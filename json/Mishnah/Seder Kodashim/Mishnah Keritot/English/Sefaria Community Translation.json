            "There are 36 actions for which the Torah prescribes Karet (being cut off from the Jewish nation): one who has relations with his mother, or with his fathers wife, or with his daughter in law, or with another man, or with an animal, as well as a woman who makes an animal have relations with her, one who has relations with a woman and her daughter, or with a married woman, or with his sister, or with his aunt from his mothers or fathers side, or with his wife's sister, or with his brother's wife, or with the wife of his brother's brother, or with a woman who is in her time of menstrual impurity. [Non-sexual reasons for Karet include]: One who curses God, one who worships idols, one who donates his children to the king, one who is a Baal Ov (a form of magic/idol worship), one who breaks the Sabbath, one who eats pure food while he is in a state of impurity, one who brings impure objects into the temple, one who eats the fat of an offering, one who eats blood, one who eats an offering that has been left over or rejected, one who slaughters an animal and sacrifices it outside of the temple, one who eats leavened bread on Passover, one who eats or does creative activity on Yom Kippur, one who adds extra fat to sacrificial oil or spices, and  who anoints himself with the holy anointing oil. Positive commandments for which one receive Karet include not eating the Paschal sacrifice, and not getting circumcised.", 
            "If these sins [the ones detailed in the previous mishnah] are done on purpose, the doer is liable for Karet. If they were done by accident, one is liable to bring a sin offering. If one was unaware of doing them, one is liable to bring an offering for uncertain guilt; unless one had impurified holy objects, then one is liable to bring an offering of adjustable value: these are the words of Rabbi Meir. The sages say: The blasphemer is also exempt from this, as it says (Numbers 15:29): \"You shall have one set of laws for those that did an action by accident.\" A blasphemer is excluded, for he didn't perform a concrete action.", 
            "Some women bring a sacrifice which is eaten; some women bring a sacrifice which is not eaten, and some do not bring [a sacrifice] at all. The following bring a sacrifice which is eaten: one who miscarries a foetus resembling a kind of animal or fowl, according to Rabbi Meir. Whereas the sages say, [not] until the foetus has human form. A woman who miscarries a fish-shaped foetus or a placenta, or a clearly-shaped foetus, or one which emerges in pieces; likewise a female slave who has miscarried, brings a sacrifice which is eaten.", 
            "The following bring offerings which are not eaten.  One who miscarries, but doesn't know what form she miscarried, similarly two women who miscarried, one which is liable to bring [a sacrifice] and one which is exempt from bringing [a sacrifice], (but the got mixed up).  Rabbi Yosi says, When is this true, when one goes to the east and the other to the west, however if they were both in the same place, they both bring a sacrifice and it is eaten (since one of them is definitely liable).", 
            "The following [women] do not bring [sacrifices]:  One who miscarries an amnion filled with water, blood, or small bones.  One who miscarries the forms of fish, grasshoppers, insects or bugs or one who miscarries [before] 40 days [of her pregnancy] and who gives birth through Caesarean Section. Rabbi Shimon makes liable [a woman] who gives birth through Caesarean section. ", 
            "A woman one who miscarries on the 81st night [after giving birth], Beit Shammai says she is exempt from a sacrifice but Beit Hillel say that she is liable.  Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel, why should the 81st night be different than the 81st day, if they are the same with regard to the woman's purity status, should they not be the same with regard to the requirement of the woman's sacrifice?  Beit Shammai answer, No! When she miscarries on the 81st day which is a time when she could bring her sacrifice [she is liable to bring a sacrifice], would you also say that when she miscarries on the 81st night when she could not bring her sacrifice [that she would be liable to bring a sacrifice]?  Beit Hillel answer, the case of a woman who miscarries on the 81st day which falls on Shabbat will prove [our case] since the miscarriage did not happen at a time when she could bring a sacrifice and yet she is still liable.  Beit Shammai say, No! In the case when the woman miscarries on the 81st day that falls on Shabbat [is different] because even though a private offering cannot be brought, a public offering can still be brought, would we say by the case of a miscarriage on the 81st night, [a time] when neither a private nor public offering could be brought [that she should be liable for a sacrifice].  The blood can also not prove either side because one who miscarries during her time of pure blood [after giving birth] her blood is impure, but she is exempt from a sacrifice. ", 
            "A woman who had five doubtful genital discharges or five doubtful births, she brings only one sacrifice, and she may eat offerings [immediately], and the rest are not mandatory for her. Five certain births, or five certain genital discharges, she brings one offering and may then eat sacrifices [immediately], and the rest are mandatory for her. It once happened in Jerusalem that the price of a pair of doves rose to a golden denar.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said: By this sanctuary, I shall not go to sleep tonight before they cost but a [silver] denar! He entered the court and taught: if a woman had five certain births or five certain genital discharges she needs to bring only one offering, and she may then eat sacrifices, and the rest are not mandatory for her.  And the price of a pair of birds stood at a quarter of a [silver] denar. "

            "There are four persons who are lacking atonement, and there are four who bring a sacrifice for intentional transgression as for unwitting transgression.  \nThe following are those who lack atonement: the male with genital discharge, the female with genital discharge, the woman who gave birth and the one with scale disease.  \nRabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: also a convert lacks atonement until the blood has been sprinkled for him; the same for the nazirite with reference to his wine, haircutting and impurity.\n", 
            "The following bring a sacrifice for intentional transgressions as for unwitting transgressions: \nOne who has intercourse with a female slave,   \nA nazirite who has been defiled,   \nFor a false oath concerning testimony;   \nAnd for a false oath concerning a deposit.\n", 
            "There are five who bring one sacrifice for multiple transgressions, and five who bring a sliding scale sacrifice.   \nThe following bring one sacrifice for multiple transgressions: \nOne who has intercourse with a female slave several times, \nA nazirite who was defiled several times.  \nOne who warns his wife in regard to several men,   \nAnd one with scaled disease who has contracted scale disease several times.   \nIf he has offered the birds and then contracted the disease again, they do not count for him until he has offered his sin offering.   \nRabbi Judah says: until he has offered his guilt offering.\n",

For they are not equivalent in regard to the punishment nor the sacrifice. \nIn the case of other forbidden sexual relations a sin offering, in the case of a female slave a guilt offering; \nIn the case of the other forbidden sexual relations a female animal is brought, in that of the female slave a male; \nIn the case of the other forbidden sexual relations man and woman are alike with respect to lashes and the sacrifice; in the case of the female slave the man is unlike the woman regarding the lashes, and the woman is unlike the man regarding the sacrifice.\nIn the case of all other forbidden sexual relations sexual contact is punishable as well as consummation, and one is liable for each act of intercourse separately.\nThe is a stringency that was more stringent for the female slave in that intentional transgression is of the same status as unwitting transgression.\n", 
            "What the female slave [referred to above]? \nOne who is half a slave and half a free person, as it is written: “And she has been redeemed and not redeemed” (Leviticus 19:20), the words of Rabbi Akiva. \nRabbi Ishmael says: This is a full female slave. \nRabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: all other forbidden sexual relations are stated explicitly, and what is left over? We have nothing but one whois half a slave and half a free person. \n", 
            "In the case of all forbidden relations, if one was an adult and the other a minor, the minor is exempt; \nIf one is awake and the other asleep, the one asleep is exempt; \nIf one is an unwitting and the other intentional, the unwitting one is liable for a sin offering, the intentional one is liable for extirpation.\n"

If one witness says: he ate, and another says: he did not eat, or if one woman says, he ate, and another says, he did not eat, he is liable to a dependent guilt offering. If one witness says, he ate, and he himself says, I did not eat, he is exempt.  Two say, he ate, and he himself says, I did not eat: Rabbi Meir makes him is liable.  Rabbi Meir said: if two witnesses are capable of bringing upon him the severe penalty of death, can they not bring upon him the less severe punishment of a sacrifice?  They replied: suppose he said, I did it intentionally.  ",

If he ate forbidden fat, blood, <i>piggul</i> and remnant in one spell of unawareness, he is liable for each kind.  This is an instance where different kinds [of food] are more stringent than one kind. And there is a stringency with one kind [of food] greater than several kinds: that if one ate half an olive-size (<i>kezayit</i>) and then again half an olive-size, both in one spell of unawareness: if of one kind he is liable, if of two kinds, he is exempt.

But the rabbis say: until he waits from the beginning to the end [of his eating] no more time than is required for the eating of a a half a loaf of bread.  If one eats unclean food or drinks unclean drinks, or if he drinks a quarter [of a log] of wine and then enters the Temple—[he is liable unless it takes less time] than it takes to eat a half a loaf of bread.  Rabbi Eliezer says: if he stopped [the drinking] or if he put any amount of water in it, he is exempt.  ", 
            "There is one that does on act of eating and become liable to four sin offerings and one guilt offering: An unclean person that ate forbidden fat, which was at the same time remnant of an offering, and it was on Yom Kippur.    Rabbi Meir says: if it was on Shabbat and he carried it out in his mouth, he is liable [to yet another sin offering].    But they said to him: that is not from the same name.  ", 
            "There is one act of intercourse for which one may become liable for six sin offerings: One who had intercourse with his daughter, he can be liable because she is his daughter, his sister, his brother's wife, the wife of his father's brother, and a married woman and a menstruant. One who had intercourse with his daughter’s daughter he can be liable because she is his daughter's daughter, his daughter-in-law, his brother's wife, the wife of his father's brother, his wife's sister, a married woman, and a menstruant.   Rabbi Yose said: if the grandfather transgressed and married her first, he is liable because she is his father's wife.  So too, if one had intercourse with his wife's daughter or her daughter's daughter. ", 
            "One who had relations with his mother-in-law he can be liable for [having relations] with his mother-in-law, his daughter-in-law, his brother's wife, the wife of his father's brother, his wife's sister, a married woman, and a menstruant.    And so too, if one had intercourse with the mother of his mother-in-law or of his father-in-law.  Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: one who had intercourse with his mother-in-law he can be liable for [having relations] with his mother-in-law, the mother of his mother-in-law, and the mother of his father-in-law.    They said to him: all three are the same name. ",

Is he liable once for all of them, or for each of them?  And they replied: we have heard nothing [about this], but we have heard that if one had intercourse with five menstruants in one spell of unawareness, he is liable for each [act], and it seems to us that the case [you asked about] may be derived by an <i>a-fortiori</i> conclusion (<i>kal vechomer</i>).

            "Rabbi Akiva further asked them: If a limb hangs loose from the body of a living beast, what is the law?    They replied: We have heard nothing about this, but we have heard about a limb hanging loose from the body of a man, that it is pure. And thus those that were afflicted with boils used to do in Jerusalem. He would go on the eve of <i>Pesach</i> to the doctor, and he would cut the limb until only contact of a hairbreadth was left; he then stuck it on a thorn and then tore himself away from it.  Both that man and the physician could make their <i>Pesach</i> offering.  And it seems to us that your case may be derived from this by an <i>a-fortiori</i> argument.  ", 
            "Rabbi Akiba asked them again: One slaughtered five sacrifices outside [the Temple] in one spell of unawareness, what is the law? Is he liable one for all of them, or one for each and every one?  They replied: we have heard nothing about this.  Rabbi Joshua: I have heard that if one eats from one offering from five different dishes in one spell of unawareness, he is guilty for each and every one of them; and it seems to me that the case in question may be inferred through an a fortiori argument.  Rabbi Shimon said: Rabbi Akiba did not ask about this, but rather concerning one who ate of remnant from five sacrifices in one spell of unawareness — what is the law? Is he liable once for all of them, or is he liable for each and every one of them. They replied: we have heard nothing about this.  Rabbi Joshua: I have heard that if one eats from one offering from five different dishes in one spell of unawareness, he is guilty for each and every one of them; and it seems to me that the case in question may be inferred through an <i>a-fortiori</i> argument.    Rabbi Akiva said: if this is a received tradition we accept it; but if it is only a logical deduction, there is a response.  He [Rabbi Joshua] said: respond.  He replied: It is not so. For if you said this with regard to sacrilege, for in this case one who gives food to another is as guilty as the one who eats it himself, and the person who causes others to derive a benefit from them is as guilty as the person who himself made use of them; furthermore, [small quantities are] reckoned together in the case of sacrilege even after the lapse of a long period, can you say it in connection with remnant where not one of these laws applies. ", 
            "Rabbi Akiva said: I asked Rabbi Eliezer: one who performs many acts of forbidden work of the same category on different Shabbats but in one spell of unawareness, what is the law? Is he liable once for all of them, or for each and every one of them?  He replied to me: he is liable for each and every one of them, from an <i>a-fortiori</i> argument. If with regard to a menstruant, for which there are neither many categories nor many ways of sinning, one is still liable for each act, in the case of Shabbat, for which there are many categories [of labor] and many ways of sinning, how much more must one be liable for each and every one. I said to him: No, if you said this in the case of the menstruant, since in that case there are two warnings: the man is warned with regard to the menstruant woman, and the menstruant woman is warned with a man; but can you say this with regard to Shabbat where there is only one warning?  He said to me: One who has relations with [menstruant] minors can prove the point, where there is but one warning.  I responded to him: No, you may say this in the case of minors because there is no prohibition for them now, there is later; but can you say the same with regard to Shabbat where there is neither now nor later  [more than one warning]?  He said to me: Let the law concerning intercourse with an animal prove my point.    I replied to him: the law concerning intercourse with an animal is indeed comparable to [that concerning] Shabbat.   "

Rather, let him set aside the principal of the trespass restitution with an added fifth, and bring a guilt offering the value of two sela's and say: “If I certainly committed sacrilege, here is my restitution and this my guilt offering; and if it is doubtful, let the money be a freewill gift and the [offering a] hanging asham;” since the same type he brings for a case where he does know, he brings for one where he doesn't know. \n",

If one set apart [money] for a lamb or a goat [for a sin offering] and he became poor, he may bring a bird; if he became still poorer he may bring the tenth of an ephah. \nIf one set apart [money] for the tenth of an ephah and he became richer, he must bring a bird-offering;   \nIf he became still richer he must bring a lamb or a goat. \nIf one set apart a lamb or a goat and they became blemished, if he wants he may bring with their price a bird-offering; \nBut if he set apart a bird-offering and it became blemished, he may not bring with its price the tenth of an ephah, since a bird-offering has no redemption. \n"
