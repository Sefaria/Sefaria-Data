            "Begin with the blessing \"who brought forth from the ground\" and take a vegetable and dip it in charoset and eat a kazait, he and everyone reclining with him should not eat less than a kazait. Afterwards, take away the table from in front of him and he reads the hagaddah to himself. Mix the second cup, and here the son asks. Why is this night different from all other night? On all other nights we don't dip even once, tonight twice. On all other nights we eat hametz and matzah, tonight only matzah. On all other nights we eat meat roasted, boiled, or cooked, tonight only roasted. On all other nights we eat all kinds of vegetables, tonight only maror. On all other nights we eat while sitting or reclining, tonight we all recline.", 
            "In today's times we don't say \"tonight only roasted\" because we don't have a [pascal] sacrifice. Begin with shame and read until completion of the entire section \"arami oved avi\"."
