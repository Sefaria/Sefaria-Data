            "I take upon myself gold,  he cannot bring less than a dinar of gold. Silver, he cannot bring less than a dinar of silver.  Copper, he cannot bring less than a ma'ah of silver.  I specified but I don't remember what I specified, he brings until he says I definitely did not mean to bring this much.  ",
            "“I take upon myself to bring wine,” he must bring no less than three logs.  \n“Oil,” he must bring no less than one log;  \nRabbi says: three logs.  \n“I specified [how much I would bring] but I do not know how much I specified,” he must bring the most that is brought on any one day. \n",
            " “I take upon myself a burnt offering,” he must bring a lamb.    \nRabbi Elazar ben Azaryah say: or a turtle-dove or a young pigeon. \n“I specified one of the herd but I do not know what it was I specified,” he must bring a bull and a calf. \n“I specified] of cattle but I do not know what it was I specified,” he must bring a bull, a bull calf, a ram, a goat, a kid, and a lamb. \n “I specified but I do not know what it was I specified,” he must add to these a turtle-dove and a young pigeon.\n",
            " “I take upon myself a thanksgiving offering or a wellbeing offering,” he must bring a lamb.\n“I specified of the herd but I do not know what it was I specified,” he must bring a bull and a cow, a he-calf and a she-calf. \n“Of the cattle but I do not know what it was I specified,” he must bring a bull and a cow, a he-calf and a she-calf, a ram and a ewe, a he-goat and a she-goat, a he-kid and a she-kid, a he-lamb and a she-lamb.\n",
            "“I take upon myself an ox,” he must bring one with its libations to the value of a maneh. \n“A calf,” he must bring one with its libations to the value of five selas. \n“A ram,” he must bring one with its libations to the value of two selas.  \n“A lamb,” he must bring one with its libations to the value of one sela. \n“An ox valued at one maneh,” he must bring one worth a maneh apart from its libations .\n“A calf valued at five selas,” he must bring one worth five selas apart from its libations.\n“A ram valued at two selas,” he must bring one worth two selas apart from its libations.\n“A lamb valued at one sela,” he must bring one worth one sela apart from its libations. \n\"An ox valued at a maneh,” and he brought two together worth a maneh, he has not fulfilled his obligation, even if one was worth a maneh less one denar and the other also was worth a maneh less one denar. \n“A black one” and he brought a white one, or “a white one” and he brought a black one, or “a large one” and he brought a small one, he has not fulfilled his obligation. \n\"A small one” and he brought a large one, he has fulfilled his obligation; \nRabbi says: he has not fulfilled his obligation.\n",
            "“This ox shall be an burnt offering,” and it becomes blemished, if he wants he may bring two with its price. \n“These two oxen are for a burnt offering,” and they become blemished, if he wants he may bring one ox with their price. \nRabbi forbids it.   \n“This ram shall be an burnt offering,” and it becomes blemished, if he wants he may bring a lamb with its price. \n“This lamb shall be a burnt offering,” and it becomes blemished, if he wants he may bring a ram with its price. \nRabbi forbids it.\nOne who says, “One of my lambs shall be holy,” or “one of my oxen shall be holy,” and he had only two, the larger one is holy. \nIf he had three, the middle one is holy. \n“I specified one but I do not know which it was I specified,” or [if he said,] “My father told me [that he had specified one] but I do not know which it is,” the largest one among them is holy.\n",
            "“I take upon myself a burnt offering,” he must offer it in the Temple.  \nAnd if he offered it in the Temple of Onias, he has not fulfilled his obligation. \n“I take upon myself to offer a burnt offering but I will offer it in the Temple of Onias,” he must offer it in the Temple, yet if he offered it in the Temple of Onias he has fulfilled his obligation.  \nRabbi Shimon says: this is not an burnt offering. \n“I will be a nazirite,” he must shave in the Temple.\nAnd if he shaved in the Temple of Onias he has not fulfilled his obligation. \n\"That I will shave in the Temple of Onias,” he must shave in the Temple, but if he shaved in the Temple of Onias he has fulfilled his obligation.  \nRabbi Shimon says: this one is not a nazirite.  \nThe priests who served in the Temple of Onias may not serve in the Temple in Jerusalem; and needless to say [this is so of priests who served] something else; for it is said, “The priests of the shrines, however, did not ascend the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem. But they did eat unleavened bread along with their kinsmen” (II Kings 23:9).   \nThus they are like those that had a blemish: they are entitled to share and eat [of the holy things] but they are not permitted to offer sacrifices.\n\n",
            "It is said of the burnt offering of cattle, “An offering made by fire of pleasing odor” (Leviticus 1:9);   and of the burnt offering of birds, “An offering made by fire of pleasing odor (vs. 17); and of the  grain offering, “An offering made by fire of pleasing odor” (Leviticus 2:2): to teach you that it is the same whether one offers much or little, so long as one directs one’s heart to heaven."
