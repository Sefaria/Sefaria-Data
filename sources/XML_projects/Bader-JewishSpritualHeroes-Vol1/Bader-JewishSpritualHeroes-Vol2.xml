<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>A<small>NY TREATISE ON THE</small> A<small>MORAIM</small> must begin with the Amoraim of Palestine who were the direct heirs of the Tanaim and the last link in the long chain of the development of the oral law which stretched from the days of the Men of the Great Synagogue down to their time. <xref rid="fn1">&#x002A;)</xref> The Amoraim of Babylonia, on the other hand, marked the beginning of a new historical epoch for the Jews of that country which continued for centuries after the spark of spiritual life expired in Palestine.</p>
<p>With the completion of the Mishna, whose authority was recognized both in Palestine and in Babylonia, the Jewish law assumed its final form. In both countries the Mishna was recognized as the deciding factor in all problems of life, but the subsequent development of the laws followed different lines in each country. None, however dared to question the interpretations of the Tanaim even when these concerned Biblical verses which had no direct relationship to religious problems.</p>
<p>When we consider the teachings of the Tanaim and Amoraim it becomes obvious, that they sought to establish a worthy continuation to the teachings of the prophets, who aimed to elevate the ethics of the Jews to the highest possible level. They therefore interpreted the commandments of the Torah in such a manner as to inculcate the people with feelings of justice, love of peace and love of one&#x2019;s neighbor. This aim caused some of the scholars to believe that study of the Torah and the fulfillment of its commandments was most important in life even though one did not agree with the commandments. Others said that after the coming of Messiah all commandments would be done with and there would no longer be any need for written laws. <sup><xref rid="fn2">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a Midrash extant which declares that those Jews who had left Egypt and wandered in the desert belonged to a &#x201C;generation of knowledge,&#x201D; because they possessed a measure of civilization and not, as might be assumed, they were untutored slaves who had just acquired freedom. Many critics ironically nod their heads at sight of this Midrash, but on closer observation of the commandments of the Torah it becomes obvious that those Jews possessed a high measure of culture.</p>
<p>Like other civilized peoples of that time, the Jews understood the art of cloth making while still in Egypt. Even if we assume that their garments were not made of the finest stuffs, skill was nevertheless required to weave the linen of which their garments were made. They understood the art of agriculture and the various occupations involved in it such as plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, grinding and baking. They also were acquainted with animal husbandry and its attendant occupations. While still in bondage they built houses and cities and they learned to bake bricks out of clay. Woodwork, masonry, metal work, wine making and hunting were also not strange to them. They knew how to find water in the depths of the earth and how to maintain fires. They made decorations out of precious metals and they pressed oil out of olives.</p>
<p>In their social relationships they maintained a civilized system of order which included representatives and judges, policemen and arrests. They understood how to divide time into weeks, months and years. In commerce they used money as is obvious from the stories of Abraham&#x2019;s purchase of the cave of Machpelah and of Jacob&#x2019;s purchase of a tract of land from the sons of Chamor for which he paid 100 Kesitah. In general we may say that the people of that time possessed a high level of intelligence and that the Jews were not behind the times. When other nations were governed by laws we may assume that the Jews did not live in lawlessness.</p>
<p>In the case of some commandments the Torah merely added legal sanction to customs which were already practiced. Thus Rashbam (Samuel ben Meir, the grandson of Rashi) states in his interpretation to the Torah that rules governing robbery, sexual relations, covetousness, courts and hospitality were accepted among the Jews even before the Torah was granted. In this case the Torah merely strengthened the accepted conduct and insured the observance of these laws in the future.</p>
<p>All the civilized peoples of that time, including the Jews of the period preceding the granting of the Torah, were called the &#x201C;sons of Noah.&#x201D; As such they only had to observe seven commandments, namely, to deal out justice, not to desecrate the name of God, not to worship idols, not to commit adultery, not to commit murder, not to rob and not to eat flesh that was cut from a living animal. Some maintain that the prohibitions against consuming the blood of a living animal, castration, witchcraft, mating different breeds of animals and planting mixed seeds were included in the above mentioned seven commandments. <sup><xref rid="fn3">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Talmud declares that even Adam was commanded to obey these commandments with the exception of the one concerning eating the flesh of a living animal, since the consumption of meat was altogether prohibited until the deluge. Others said that the &#x201C;sons of Noah&#x201D; had thirty commandments to observe. <sup><xref rid="fn4">3)</xref></sup> But these probably included many observances which were derived from the original seven commandments. It is quite understandable, that in order to conduct trials it was necessary to know which people to select as judges. Likewise, in the matter of adultery, regulations had to be established defining which women were forbidden. The concept of robbery also required definition since borrowing money and not repaying it and not paying the wage of a laborer were then considered to be robbery.</p>
<p>The offering of sacrifices from animals, fowl and fruit was customary since time immemorial. Cain offered a sacrifice from the fruit of his fields and Abel offered his best sheep. After the deluge Noah erected an altar and offered sacrifices. Abraham and Jacob likewise erected altars for the offering of sacrifices. When Moses asked Pharaoh to release the Jews, he said that they had to go to the desert to offer sacrifices to God. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon declared that since sacrifices and circumcision preceded the establishment of the Sabbath, both of them superseded the Sabbath. During the later development of divine service, which at that time consisted of sacrificial offerings, the belief became accepted among many peoples that ordinary men could not fulfill this task since they were not acquainted with all the regulations governing the offerings. This caused the establishment of a separate group of people who devoted themselves solely to sacrifices and who abstained from ordinary labor. For the support of these people tithes were offered by all. Thus we find Abraham giving tithes to Malchi-Zedek, who was a priest of &#x201C;the highest God&#x201D;; Jacob vowed to tithe all his possessions if God would bless his journey and would provide him with bread and garments.</p>
<p>The first born son at first performed the divine service. This procedure was also accepted among the Jews until the tabernacle was built. Later the performance of this office was taken out of the hands of the first born and was entrusted to the descendants of Aaron. Further development necessitated the establishment of a class of assistants to the descendants of Aaron and the Levites were added to the service. The priests performed the offering of sacrifices and they received the first fruit, the first born animals and similar gifts. The Levites who worked in the tabernacle were granted tithes, one-tenth of everyone&#x2019;s income. Of this the Levites had to give one-tenth to the priests. But the rights of the first born were preserved in the government of the family as a representative of the father. The first born also received a double share in the inheritance. If a man had children by two wives one of whom he loved and the other he hated and the first born was a son of the despised wife, the father nevertheless had to recognize the rights of this son to a double share in the inheritance. The custom of the priests blessing the people is very ancient. The first priest to do so was Malchi-Zedek who blessed Abraham. Thus it is also related that Aaron blessed the children of Israel even before the Torah explicitly commanded him to do so.</p>
<p>Even before the deluge Noah could differentiate between animals that were considered as clean and between those that were considered to be unclean. The Talmud questions this and the answer was given that when all the animals sought safety in the ark it admitted only one pair from some kinds of animals and seven pairs from other kinds. By this token it was known which were the clean and which the unclean animals. <sup><xref rid="fn5">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Soon after man began to develop family life he recognized his near relatives as part of himself. When rights of property were established he enacted laws to secure his possessions for his relations and he likewise made certain that after his death his possessions would remain within the family. In this manner laws of inheritance were established. Abraham complained to God and said: &#x201C;Since you gave me no offspring, the manager of my house will inherit me.&#x201D; Jews also practiced the same custom that was accepted among other peoples in denying a daughter a share in the inheritance. Every father gave his daughter her share as a dowry at the time that she was married. Since daughters could marry men of other tribes, they could not share in the inheritance of their fathers in order that the possessions of one tribe should not pass to another tribe.</p>
<p>Long before the Torah was granted, the descendants of Abraham observed the commandment of circumcision. It may even be assumed that the descendants of Ishmael and the sons of Keturah observed this commandment with greater strictness than did the Jews who did not practice circumcision for forty years while in the desert.</p>
<p>Among other civilized concepts man also learned to observe vows and oaths. He understood his duty of abiding by his word whether that concerned himself or others. All of these concepts civilized peoples possessed long before the Torah was given. The patriarch Abraham swore to Abimelech not to harm him or his descendants. Jacob vowed and later swore to Laban not to trespass his boundaries with evil intent.</p>
<p>The slaughter of animals for food was always considered to be a natural procedure and was practiced from time immemorial. It may also be assumed that such slaughter was always done by cutting the throat of the animal. This form was probably adopted as a reaction against the savage method of beasts of prey which break the necks of their victims. Since the commandments of the Torah aim to refine the people and are based on mercy, it was strictly forbidden to cause unnecessary suffering to any living creature. <sup><xref rid="fn6">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since ancient times man recognized the concepts of purity and impurity. As soon as man could esthetically comprehend the concept of cleanliness, he avoided coming in contact with things that were unclean. It was then believed that evil spirits inhabited the unclean objects and that they would gain control of the clean body which touched the impure one. Thus Jacob commanded his household when he left Shechem and said: &#x201C;Cast out the strange idols from your midst, clean yourself and don other garments.&#x201D; People likewise avoided coming in contact with a woman in the days of her separation, with unclean animals or insects.</p>
<p>Bathing in water was the accepted mode of purification. In this manner all impurity was washed away. Before giving the Torah, God commanded the people to consecrate themselves and to wash their garments. This was also the reason why a proselyte had to immerse himself in water and even though he was circumcised, he was not accepted as a proselyte until after immersion. Menstruating women were also required to bathe before being considered pure. This appears to have been an ancient custom observed by all civilized peoples.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that all of these commandments later evolved into numerous supplementary observances. With the development of society punishments were determined for infractions of these commandments. But no matter how much the scholars wanted that the commandments of the Torah should be observed, they nevertheless warned against observing a commandment at the expense of committing a sin, as in the case of obtaining an object illegally in order to do some good deed with it. <sup><xref rid="fn7">6)</xref></sup> But in some exceptional instances the ignoring of one commandment could aid in the fulfillment of another as when study of the Torah was interrupted in order to perform some philanthropic deed. <sup><xref rid="fn8">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ordinarily there was no prohibition which could not be broken in order to save a life with the exception of committing murder, worshipping idols or committing a sexual offense in order to save one&#x2019;s life. <sup><xref rid="fn9">8)</xref></sup> These three sins were considered to be so great that even if one&#x2019;s life depended on one of them it was forbidden to employ them. <sup><xref rid="fn10">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observance of the Sabbath was treated differently. Even though it was also considered to be very important and one who desecrated the Sabbath was to be punished by death, it was nevertheless accepted that the Sabbath could be desecrated in order to aid one whose life was in danger. <sup><xref rid="fn11">10)</xref></sup> The Tana Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia thus said that &#x201C;the Sabbath was given to the people and not the people to the Sabbath.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn12">11)</xref></sup> In order to save the life of a person Rabbi Nathan said that &#x201C;it is permissible to desecrate one Sabbath in order that he may observe many Sabbaths to come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn13">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Talmud declares that the basic purpose of religious regulations was to enable people to live and not to kill them. <sup><xref rid="fn14">13)</xref></sup> It likewise states that he who destroys one Jewish soul is like one who destroyed a whole world and he who maintains one Jewish person alive is like one who saved a whole world. <sup><xref rid="fn15">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>People were forbidden by the scholars to harm themselves even as they were forbidden to harm others. <sup><xref rid="fn16">15)</xref></sup> When the Torah said that fruit trees should not be cut down during the siege of a city, the scholars added that one may not cut down a fruit tree even in his own garden and he who did so was to be punished. <sup><xref rid="fn17">16)</xref></sup> On other occasions the scholars said that endangering one&#x2019;s life was worse than committing a sin. <sup><xref rid="fn18">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Talmud further declares that the Torah was concerned with the honor of the people. In its eyes the worth of man was so great that one could sometimes overlook a commandment because of it. <sup><xref rid="fn19">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thieves were usually enslaved after they were forced to pay twice the price of the stolen goods. If a living animal was stolen, the thief had to pay four or five times its value. At times thieves were also sentenced to death or to be flogged. The death sentence was imposed by the Torah for stealing a human being and selling him into slavery. Nevertheless the Torah showed consideration even for the thief and the scholars declared that the reason why a thief had to pay five times the value of a stolen ox and only four times the value of a stolen sheep was that an ox can be led easily but a sheep has to be carried and this accounted for the easier punishment for one stealing a sheep. <sup><xref rid="fn20">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other punishments, aside from death and flogging, were meted out to offenders against God or man. Prisons then existed and when one was flogged for an offense and he later committed a similar offense he was imprisoned. <sup><xref rid="fn21">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Self-inflicted torture as a religious ritual was known to man for a long time. The forms of this torture were numerous. Some renounced food and drink while others avoided pride. The drinking of wine was considered to be a luxury and he who wanted to deny himself pleasure for the greater glory of God renounced the drinking of wine. Shaving one&#x2019;s head or letting one&#x2019;s hair grow wild was at various times considered to be a means against pride. The scholars differed in their evaluation of these forms of self-torment. Some praised them while others condemned them as sinful. <sup><xref rid="fn22">21)</xref></sup> The majority of the scholars agreed with the opinion of Rabbi Jose that one should not torment himself with too many fasts. <sup><xref rid="fn23">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The custom of mourning for dead relatives, as it is accepted in the form of a Biblical commandment, was a subject often questioned by the scholars. From the story of Joseph they deducted that mourning should last seven days. Others reached the same conclusion from the verse &#x201C;I shall turn your feast days into mourning&#x201D; and they said that even as each holiday lasts seven days so also must mourning last for seven days. There were also differing opinions among the scholars whether mourning was a Biblical commandment or whether it was instituted by the Rabbis. The Jerusalem Talmud declares that &#x201C;Moses instituted for the Jews seven days of mourning and seven days of merry making.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn24">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>For seven centuries from the time of Simon the Just till the last Amora, Greek, Roman and Persian culture influenced Jewish life, which was so closely joined with it. For that reason we come across ideas which arose at different times under different circumstances and differentiated in their spirit and character. At times it is difficult to discover which event preceded and which followed and to separate fact from legend.</p>
<p>Our &#x201C;Spiritual Heroes&#x201D; ofttimes rise to great spiritual heights, while at the same time their ideas are rooted not alone in the past but look forward to the future as well. Their roots cleave a path through stem reality to the high ideals of mankind as a whole and emphasize those means which serve as a realization of those ideals.</p>
<p>It is this Talmudic forest whose trees contain the seed for the plants of future generations. It is also the source from which later law-givers derived their notions as well as being the form for the pursuit of learning in all its branches.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1">&#x002A;) For a better enlightment of the subject, we have to repeat that a teacher of the &#x201C;Mishna&#x201D; was called &#x201C;Tana&#x201D; (plural: &#x201C;Tanaim&#x201D;) and a teacher of the &#x201C;Gemara&#x201D; was called &#x201C;Amora&#x201D; (plural: &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D;).</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>LIFE IN PALESTINE DURING THE CREATION OF THE JERUSALEM TALMUD</title>
<p>S<small>OME OF OUR ENLIGHTENED PEOPLE</small> are of the opinion that while death and destruction raged in Palestine the scholars of that country secluded themselves within the walls of the synagogues and debated irrelevant religious problems. Such a view is highly superficial. In between wars and aside from the Talmudic discussions the people pursued their normal occupations. They sowed their fields, they engaged in various trades and they developed a highly complex Jewish cultural life.</p>
<p>There are but few sources of information concerning the mode of life of that time. The Talmud is the most trustworthy of these, although it was written much later when many of the previous customs were nearly forgotten. In addition to the Talmud there are less faithful descriptions in the writings of Josephus Flavius, the geographer Strabo and the naturalist Pliny.</p>
<p>During all these centuries the overwhelming majority of the Jews were agriculturists. These tillers of the soil were but little affected by the numerous incursions of the Romans. In the worst cases their cattle and produce were robbed but the farmers and their families were not molested. Even when the Romans were determined to destroy Judaism they understood that the farming population was the foundation of the productive forces in the country and should be spared. It is therefore certain that even when many Jews were exiled from the country the farmers were left to till their fields.</p>
<p>It must also be borne in mind that the Jewish farmer of that time was religious more than he was patriotic. As long as the Romans did not interfere with his offering of sacrifices he was satisfied and probably indifferent whether he paid his taxes to the Jerusalem aristocrats, who looked down upon him, or whether the taxes were collected by the Romans.</p>
<p>When the Hasmoneans ruled Palestine they acquired a number of seaports but the merchants and sailors of these cities were largely Phoenicians. Jews were then in the initial stages of learning the arts of commerce and navigation and their share in these occupations was negligible. Even the Jews of Galilee who were close neighbors of the Phoenicians excelled in agriculture and fruit growing rather than in commerce and Josephus described their land as &#x201C;covered with fields of grain and resembling a large garden.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Bible described Palestine as a land of milk and honey but this blessing was not always realized. The Biblical curse that the heavens shall be like copper over their heads and the earth shall be like iron under their feet often approached nearer the truth when periods of drought affected the land. Nevertheless the tillers of the soil always managed to secure their bread despite the fact that the country was rocky and sandy to a large degree. The Jews loved their land and each one was convinced that it was the most beautiful in the world. They learned to improve the soil and to fertilize it artificially, to clear it of stones and to destroy obnoxious weeds. The fields were surrounded with cactus fences to prevent the cattle from trampling them and those that were located on steep hills were terraced. Every handbreadth of land was utilized and there were no more diligent workers than the farmers of Palestine. Agriculture was highly regarded by all and was especially revered by the Romans. Whereas in other lands the Romans encountered difficulties in persuading the people to till the soil, Palestine farmers were happy if they were left to pursue that labor.</p>
<p>The fertility of the soil of Palestine varied in different regions of the country. Jericho and its environs was praised by the writers of all times as &#x201C;the city of dates.&#x201D; Other districts excelled in wheat growing. It was said that the grain growing about the city of Ophroim attained such height that it provided sufficient straw for the needs of the whole country. The wheat of Galilee was also famous for its quality and some said that it excelled even the wheat of Judea. Rye, oats, barley, sorghum and other grains grew in abundance. Bread made out of barley meal was considered to be the staple article of food of the poorer elements. There was a great abundance of this meal and considerable quantities of it were exported to other countries from which rice was introduced and sowed in Palestine.</p>
<p>In ordinary years the grain crop was between five and ten fold that which was sown, but in years when the rains descended in time and the sun did not scorch the germinating seed the crop reached as much as a hundred fold. In years of bumper crops Palestine exported grain, but during lean years grain had to be imported from Egypt. Palestine abounded in all kinds of greens and vegetables such as cabbage, cucumbers, onions, garlic, radishes and various beans. In time new vegetables which had not grown there previously were introduced into the country. These different kinds of vegetables were avidly consumed. Due to the stringent regulations governing the offering of sacrifices people often abstained from eating meat and indulged in it only on Sabbaths and holidays or other festive occasions. After the destruction of the temple, when the offering of sacrifices was done away with, many people gave up meat altogether as an item in their diet.</p>
<p>Many varieties of fruit trees thrived in Palestine including figs, grapes, olives, carobs, oranges, ethrogim, plums, cherries, walnuts, almonds, dates, mulberries, pomegranates, apples and pears. In addition to these, new improved varieties were introduced and cultivated. Palestine was especially renowned for its wine, dates and wheat. The coins that were minted by the Hasmoneans bear ears of wheat, bunches of grapes and date palms as symbols of the fertility of the land. The vineyards of Judea were considered the most beautiful in that part of the world. Between the rows of trees and vines flowers were planted which filled the air with their fragrance. Raisins and date honey were commonly used as food. Oil, which was plentiful, was exported in great quantities, and just as Judea was renowned for its wine Galilee was famous for the quality of its oil. The oil was used as food and also for medicinal purposes and it was widely sold in Sidon, Syria and Egypt.</p>
<p>Pliny, the Roman &#x201C;Natural-philosopher,&#x201D; declared that Judea was famous for its dates just as Egypt was known for its incense. In the Talmud we find a story told by Rabbi Jacob ben Dostai that on his way from Lud to Ono, a distance of three miles, he waded ankle deep in fig honey. <sup><xref rid="fn25">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The shores of the Dead Sea were covered with balsam and the districts of Gilead and Jericho were especially noted for it. Balsam was used as a medicine and also as incense. It was a very expensive commodity and the Romans declared that the Jews did not plant it elsewhere in order to maintain its rarity and to be able to sell it for a high price. After the destruction of the temple the Romans said that the Jews uprooted all the balsam trees in revenge on the Romans.</p>
<p>Sheep and cattle abounded in the land as a result of the need for sacrifices. There were many Jewish shepherds at that time and some of these also traded in cattle or in wool. This was especially true in the regions east of the Jordan. The women of Judea spun the wool and the women of Galilee spun flax and the garments were sold in the nearby cities. Many of the known varieties of fowl were introduced into the country at a later date. This is obvious from their Hebrew names which were never mentioned in the Bible. Geese, ducks and chickens were among the imported species and although they were not used for sacrificial purposes they were used as food. Many people also raised cattle and goats and considerable quantities of dairy products were consumed and exported.</p>
<p>Although some Jews engaged in hunting animals and birds the number of these was not great due to the numerous laws regarding unclean animals and the restrictions affecting slaughter. But many people engaged in fishing especially in Galilee. The sea of Gennesaret (sea of Galilee) abounded in many of the varieties of the best edible fish and scores of fishing villages dotted its shores. A great part of the catch was also exported.</p>
<p>The Dead Sea occupied a prominent place among the natural resources of the country. Various salts were extracted from its waters (salt of Sodom) as well as asphalt. These were sold far and wide and were used for medical purposes and also in the manufacture of cosmetics. Historical descriptions of Palestine also mentioned metal mines. Iron was mined in the Lebanon mountains and in the region north of Idumea. Josephus Flavius mentioned an iron mountain which extended to the boundary of Moab and in later years this metal was also mined in Trans-Jordania.</p>
<p>The trades and occupations of the Jews of that time are a subject of endless interest. The Talmud is the best historical source on this subject and it lists the following occupations as being most widely engaged in: tailoring, shoemaking, building, quarrying, carpentry, hairdressing, metal working, weaving, dyeing, tapestry-weaving, bee raising, pottery, glass blowing, engraving, tanning, ink and arms manufacturing.</p>
<p>But although all these trades were commonly practiced and Jewish artisans were accorded social recognition, they did not constitute a majority of the population. Farming engaged the efforts of the majority of the nation. This is evident from the fact that the Talmud devoted itself more to the interests of the farmers than it did to the interests of the artisans.</p>
<p>From the available historical data we may conclude that the Jewish artisans could not compete with the artisans of the foreign countries and when vessels or garments of higher quality were desired they had to be imported. This conclusion is also substantiated by the fact that the Talmud refers to all superior vessels or garments by their Greek names. This was also true of vegetables for some time, but as the years went by the superior varieties were cultivated also in Palestine. However there was a common conviction that articles of foreign manufacture were superior in quality and people of means bought their garments and decorated their houses with foreign importations.</p>
<p>Among the farming population the poorer peasants were in a majority. These were referred to in the Talmud as &#x201C;Baal Habaith&#x201D; and they usually possessed only a small tract of land from which they barely eked out a living. Together with the members of his family such a peasant would work in his field from dawn till sunset. Most of his produce he used for his own household and the remainder, after he paid his taxes and tithes, was marketed in the nearby cities where it was bartered or sold for money. Under such circumstances, the poorer peasants suffered every time a drought occurred or some other calamity overtook the country. He was then forced to hire out as a farm hand or to pawn his land to a richer farmer. But even when no unforseen calamities occurred, the poor peasant often had to become a wage-earner by working for another farmer. The parcelation of the land when it was being divided between the heirs left each of the heirs such a small holding that many were forced to hire out even during normal years. Those who could find no employment were forced to turn to begging or to brigandage.</p>
<p>In Galilee and Judea there existed a small class of rich farmers who owned considerable stretches of land and had a comfortable income. It was these people who loaned money to the poorer peasants and in time increased their holdings by seizing the land in payment of outstanding debts. They were also the merchants in grain and the Talmud refers to them as <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E2;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D9; &#x05E0;&#x05DB;&#x05DD;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;&#x05F4;</span> (men of much property). Although their number was small, they were socially prominent and exerted an influence on the administration of the land. They were generally the officials, the elders and members of the priestly families which accumulated the land of the poor. It is told that they engaged &#x201C;Ikonomusin&#x201D; (managers) and &#x201C;Apitropsim&#x201D; (overseers) to supervise the cultivation of their fields and vineyards while the owners remained in the city or travelled about in connection with their business ventures.</p>
<p>Thus the Talmud relates that Rabban Gamliel II, also known as Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh, employed a great number of laborers <sup><xref rid="fn26">2)</xref></sup> and he also leased a part of his lands. <sup><xref rid="fn27">3)</xref></sup> Such a procedure was engaged in by people who did not live on their land. Rabban Gamliel was presiding officer of the Sanhedrin and had to reside in the city. He administered his lands through the agency on an &#x201C;Economos&#x201D; or an &#x201C;Apitropos.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hired laborers were engaged for a definite period which may have been as much as a year or as little as a day or half a day but never for more than six years. Among the laborers there were men who owned small plots of land as well as those who owned no land at all. Those unskilled in agricultural work hired out as common laborers and engaged in the most difficult work.</p>
<p>The scholars always sided with the laborers when they had complaints against their employers. They also established definite regulations concerning the food and drink to which the laborers were entitled, and although it is possible that most of these rules defining the rights of the workers remained theoretical, it is nevertheless certain that the social differentiation between poor and rich was not as sharp among the Jews as it was among the other nations of that time. The persecution at the hands of the Gentiles to which Jews poor and rich were subject partly accounted for this state of affairs.</p>
<p>Contract farming was also a known phenomenon. A contractor would undertake to cultivate a field and he was responsible for all the operations. He would buy the seed, hire the laborers and work together with them. He was responsible for the payment of the taxes to the government and the tithes to the priests as well as for all other expenditures. In compensation he received half the crop. In addition there were &#x201C;Arisim&#x201D; (tenants) who received the seed, the tools and the animals required for cultivation from the owner. Tenants supplied only their labor.</p>
<p>Artisans and peasants in Palestine were free men. They could choose their own occupation and when they hired out they were free to leave at any time and the employer was legally bound to pay whatever wage was coming to them for the work which they had accomplished. The condition of the slaves was entirely different. In some respects the slaves were in a better position than the hired laborers but socially they occupied the lowest level. The slave was assured of his food and shelter, but he was not free to choose his occupation and he was dependent on the whims of his owner who could force him to work day and night.</p>
<p>The condition of the Jewish slave was peculiar. It was only on rare occasions that a Jew bought a Jewish slave. When the Gentiles from the surrounding countries brought Jewish slaves to sell, they were ransomed and immediately freed. But there were occasions when a Jew was in debt and he voluntarily sold himself into slavery to be able to repay his debt. Similarly, when a man was caught stealing and he had to pay twice the value of the article stolen, the court would sell him into slavery if he could not pay the required sum. Like the artisan and farm laborer, the Jewish slave sold only his labor power, but he did not have definite working hours and he could be called upon to perform some task at any hour of the day or night. However, he enjoyed the privilege of resting on the Sabbath and the holidays together with his owner.</p>
<p>Because of the preferred treatment which the owner had to accord a Jewish slave there were not many that were anxious to own them, and a statement current at the time declared that &#x201C;He who buys a Jewish slave buys an overlord.&#x201D; But there undoubtedly existed slave owners who did not grant their Jewish slaves any privileges and on the year of the Jubilee the courts had to force them to liberate their Jewish slaves. Human nature did not change much during the centuries and it is apparent that the generations of the time of the Talmud had to contend with the same problem that was recorded by Jeremiah (Ch. 34) that king Zedekiah commanded that all Jewish slaves be liberated and their owners soon enslaved them again.</p>
<p>Jewish slave owners were enjoined to treat their non-Jewish slaves with humaneness. Although the owner could beat his slave at will he was strictly warned not to starve him, and in case the slave was crippled through the loss of an eye or a limb, he was immediately liberated. If a slave died as a result of a beating, the Torah commanded that the owner be put to death; but when the slave survived his punishment by a day or more, the owner was not to be put to death.</p>
<p>Judging from numerous circumstances we may conclude that Jewish slaves felt a greater kinship to their owners than the non-Jewish slaves. They participated actively in the various rebellions against Rome and Josephus relates that during the war which ended with the destruction of the temple Bar Giora proclaimed the liberation of all Jewish slaves as the first step in his mobilization of an army. At the same time the Romans announced that all non-Jewish slaves who would betray their owners would be granted their freedom.</p>
<p>Non-Jewish slaves were brought from the markets of Tyre and Sidon. Their treatment in Palestine could compare favorably with their treatment in other countries. Every slave was branded on the forehead or he was given a cap with a bell on it to wear that he might be recognized. Compared with the treatment of slaves in other lands, these measures were relatively humane.</p>
<p>Slaves were the unrestricted property of their owners. If the owner so desired he could marry a slave to his mother or sister. But the marriage of a slave was of no significance and the owner retained his rights of possession. Children of slaves also belonged to the owner and could be sold at will. All possessions of a slave automatically belonged to his master who also claimed any object found by the slave. In addition the owner could rent the labor power of his slaves to others without consulting the slaves.</p>
<p>The Midrash relates the case of a man who persuaded his neighbor to divorce his wife because of her immoral conduct. When the husband complained that he could not divorce her because he did not have enough money to pay her dowry, the man offered to loan him the necessary sum. After the woman was divorced the creditor married her and enslaved her previous husband for inability to repay his debt. The man thus became the slave of his ex-wife and he was forced to witness her relations with his creditor.</p>
<p>But if the position of the male slave was unenviable, the condition of the women slaves was even worse. In addition to their labor they were held at the disposal of the owner and his sons. It is therefore remarkable that some women were sold by their own parents into such life.</p>
<p>There undoubtedly were many Jews who treated their slaves in a more humane manner. In many homes the slaves were employed in skilled work and were trusted with all confidence. Some of them were tailors or barbers; others were bakers and cooks. In some cases the owners even entrusted the education of their children to the slaves. Among the women slaves there were singers and dancers who entertained their owners and their guests.</p>
<p>The Mishna tells that Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh owned a slave named Tabbai whom he respected greatly and for whom he mourned a long time after his death. Another slave of Rabban Gamliel was called &#x201C;father&#x201D; and his wife was referred to as &#x201C;mother.&#x201D; It is quite probable that these were not isolated instances and that the lot of the slave of a Jew was better than that of a non-Jewish owner.</p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that the whole Jewish people was not mourning constantly for the destruction of the temple and the cessation of the sacrifices. It is even related that when Jerusalem was destroyed the people of Betar celebrated the occasion. It is also quite certain that the institution of sacrifices had lost much of its significance in the minds of many leaders and some of them were satisfied that Jabneh had been saved as a cultural center. Others, however, were convinced that the destruction of the temple was temporary and that it would soon be restored even as the first temple was rebuilt a short time after its destruction. This belief found a deep echo in the hearts of large sections of the population who looked upon themselves as people whose house had been burned and who were waiting for the construction of a new house. There is also no definite proof that the institution of sacrifices ceased with the temple and that small groups did not gather secretly to offer sacrifices. It is even possible that they brought their offerings on the site of the demolished altar. The fact that the regulations pertaining to the priests and the tithes were observed for a long time after the destruction is ample proof of the expectations of the people of a rapid restoration.</p>
<p>This was not an impossibility under the political conditions then prevailing. It was quite likely that some emperor would grant permission to rebuild the temple out of respect for the Jews or through the intercession of some influential person who could also pay for the right. But these hopes vanished with the rebellion of Bar Kochba against Hadrian. Over half a million Jews were killed in the uprising and hundreds of thousands of others were sold into slavery. The country was devastated and a temple to Zeus was erected in Jerusalem. Jews were not even allowed to approach the gates of the city.</p>
<p>But this was not the final expulsion from Palestine. Jews continued to reside in other cities and subsequent Roman emperors allowed them to visit Jerusalem on the ninth day of Ab to mourn for the destroyed temple.</p>
<p>Various historical events of that time are described in the Jerusalem as well as in the Babylonian Talmud and also in the Midrash. Most of these descriptions were not clearly understood until a recent date when certain Jewish historians made a careful study of these sources. Whenever the Talmudic descriptions are not in agreement with the facts as they are related by Roman historians it is safer to rely on the Talmudic sources.</p>
<p>That the destruction which followed the conquest of Jerusalem by Titus was not complete was also a result of other factors. Many people did not actively participate in the rebellion and after the war they rearranged their lives to conform with the situation that had been created and they maintained peace with the Romans. But the zealots who participated in the war were branded as bandits after the conflict. Their desparation in the struggle also harmed the interests of the people and hastened the ultimate destruction.</p>
<p>Titus and the rulers that immediately followed him did not intend to interfere with the religious practices of the Jews. According to Josephus, Titus even commanded that the temple be spared and it was the princess Berenice who set fire to it out of conviction that the Jews would never surrender as long as it remained in existence. After the revolt was quelled Titus did not wish to do any further harm. In all religious matters the Jews remained free and they retained the right of judgment in religious and also in secular cases. Even non-Jews often appeared before a Jewish court when in dispute with a Jew and the Roman authorities allowed Jewish courts to handle all cases when both parties consented to be tried by it. The Church-father Origines even declared that Jewish courts tried cases involving life although they were not authorized to do so.</p>
<p>The teachings of the Pharisees then developed to an extent which would have been impossible had the temple been in existence. The Sadducees disappeared altogether and the oral law became the dominant influence in Jewish life. All national life concentrated about the religious regulations which were strictly observed. In their devotion to the Torah and in the observance of its commandments the people found consolation for the destruction of the temple; Jabneh took the place of Jerusalem and the offering of gifts to the scholars in Jabneh took the place of the offering of sacrifices on an altar.</p>
<p>Sixty years after the destruction of Jerusalem, during the reign of Hadrian, another uprising took place which affected the whole people. The cause of this uprising is sought in the events which occurred during the reign of the preceding emperor Trajan. During his reign Babylonia rebelled against Rome and the Jews extended aid to the insurgents. (The Talmud refers to this revolt as &#x201C;Polemos Quietus.&#x201D;) A number of Jews from Palestine also joined this uprising in the hope that the defeat of the Romans would lead to the liberation of Palestine.</p>
<p>Trajan entrusted the conduct of the war to general Lucius Quietus and he commanded him to execute all Jews that would fall into his hands. After he quelled the revolt, Quietus was appointed governor of Palestine. Uprisings of the Jews occurred simultaneously in Egypt, Cyrenaica and Cyprus and the rebels vented their pent up anger on the neighboring Greek population and slaughtered many of them. Greek authors of that time speak of hundreds of thousands of slain Greeks, but these numbers were undoubtedly highly exaggerated. Marcius Turba was dispatched to quell the revolt and he triumphed over the Jews in &#x201C;Bikat Yadaim&#x201D; (Alexandria). A Talmudic legend describes the slaughter that followed and states that twice as many people as left Egypt were killed at that time.</p>
<p>Hadrian was by nature a peace loving and kindly man and he is said to have permitted the restoration of the temple, but the Samaritans objected to such a step and he withdrew his permission. One legend states that when the foundations for the new temple were being excavated flames burst out from the diggings and consumed the laborers. The Jews then asked that the work be stopped because of their belief that this was an omen of God&#x2019;s desire that the temple should not be rebuilt. However, it has been historically established that the relations between the Samaritans and the Jews during the reign of Hadrian were friendly and they also participated on the side of the Jews during the uprising.</p>
<p>Recent historical investigations ascribe the rebellion to Hadrian&#x2019;s prohibition against circumcision. Both the Jews and the Samaritans observed the law of circumcision and they therefore united against Rome. It seems inexplicable why the Romans, who did not interfere with the religious customs of the subject peoples, should have prohibited circumcision, but the Christian historian Schuerer explains this in the following manner: Emperor Domitian issued a law against castration as a barbaric custom. This law Hadrian extended to include circumcision and the death penalty was established for those who broke the law. This explanation is obviated by the fact that Antoninus Pius again allowed the Jews to practice circumcision and his edict declared the practice to be an old Jewish custom and not to be confused with castration. In issuing this edict he was also influenced by the stubborness with which the Jews clung to this practice.</p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>When Moses sent spies to Palestine they reported that the cities of Palestine were well fortified (Numbers, 13:28). Moses informed the Jews that they would find &#x201C;cities great and fenced up to heaven&#x201D; (Deut. 9:1). It is therefore remarkable that after so many invasions and wars the people believed that many of the gates and fortresses dated back to the days of Joshua ben Nun. The Bible mentions that the Jews lived in &#x201C;Ir&#x201D; (city), &#x201C;Chatzer&#x201D; (court) and &#x201C;Kefar&#x201D; (village). The Talmud makes no mention of &#x201C;Chatzer&#x201D; but contains the additional concept of &#x201C;Kerach&#x201D; (large city) and in addition to the &#x201C;Ir&#x201D; (city) it makes mention of &#x201C;Ayarah&#x201D; (town). There are differing opinions concerning the exact meaning of &#x201C;Chatzer&#x201D;. Some declared it to be a suburb; others maintained that it referred to an enclosure or a group of houses where a large number of people lived. We also find references to cities named &#x201C;Hatzar&#x201D; (Numbers, 34:4; Joshua, 19:3), and these probably developed from small groups of houses. The name &#x201C;Kefar&#x201D; appears both in the Bible and in the Talmud. The size of a &#x201C;Kefar&#x201D; (village) was not definitely determined but Josephus declares that the smallest &#x201C;Kefar&#x201D; in Palestine contained fifteen thousand inhabitants. However, his statement may be discounted as exaggerated. There were also cities in Palestine which developed from villages as is indicated by their names: &#x201C;Kefar Haamoni,&#x201D; &#x201C;Kefar Hananiah&#x201D; and &#x201C;Kefar Aziz.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the scholars tried to define the difference between a city and a village they said that a city is a place where there are always ten &#x201C;Batlonim&#x201D; (idlers) available for various religious functions which require that number. <sup><xref rid="fn28">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The name &#x201C;Kerach&#x201D; was derived from the Aramaic. The name signifies a fortified city. The Talmud sometimes refers to the same city by all three names (Kerach, Ir, Kefar), but it is obvious that &#x201C;Ir&#x201D; usually referred to an unfortified city.</p>
<p>The fortified &#x201C;Kerach&#x201D; was surrounded by a wall as protection against sudden attacks and was generally situated on the top of a mountain or on a rocky hill which was difficult of access and could be easily defended. Whenever an &#x201C;Ir&#x201D; was fortified it was expressly referred to as a walled city.</p>
<p>A &#x201C;Kerach&#x201D; was limited in area by its walls and could not grow indefinitely; the name therefore described the strength of the city and not its size. Whenever we find statements such as &#x201C;the great Kerach of Rome&#x201D; these refer to the defenses of the city rather than to its size.</p>
<p>The Talmud relates that when God wanted to determine the size of Jerusalem the angels said: &#x201C;You have created so many Kerachim of the Gentile nations without determining their size. Why should you do so for your own city?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn29">5)</xref></sup> This legend is interpreted by some to indicate that &#x201C;Kerach&#x201D; referred to Gentile cities or to those whose garrisons were largely non-Jewish. The Talmudic reference to Betar, which was a Jewish city, as &#x201C;Kerach&#x201D; they hold to be an exception.</p>
<p>The walled cities of Palestine were thus named &#x201C;Kerachim&#x201D; and were considered as Gentile places of residence. There were ten such cities which bore the collective name of Decapolis. In the course of time they developed into separate centers of activity apart from the rest of Palestine, <sup><xref rid="fn30">6)</xref></sup> although some of them were surrounded by Jewish settlements. <sup><xref rid="fn31">7)</xref></sup> The administrators of these cities discriminated against the Jews who were denied privileges enjoyed by the other inhabitants. This was also a distinction between a &#x201C;Kerach&#x201D; and an &#x201C;Ir&#x201D; which was not autonomous. The &#x201C;Kerach&#x201D; contained garrisons; this is evident from the reference of the Talmud to &#x201C;Burganin,&#x201D; that means the barracks which housed the soldiers or the government tax collector. <sup><xref rid="fn32">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>This fact explains the Talmudic saying that a man who is about to enter a &#x201C;Kerach&#x201D; should pronounce the following prayer: &#x201C;May it be Thy will to lead me into this Kerach in peace.&#x201D; Once within the city one was supposed to recite another prayer which said: &#x201C;I am thankful to You that You brought me into the city in peace.&#x201D; Upon leaving, one said: &#x201C;May it be Thy will to lead me out of this city in peace,&#x201D; and after one was out of the limits of the city he was to say: &#x201C;I thank You for leading me out of the city in peace and I pray that You shall further lead me and protect me in peace and that You shall save me from any enemy who may lurk by the roadside.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn33">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>This prayer was instituted because of the danger of entering and leaving a &#x201C;Kerach.&#x201D; It was composed during the rule of the Romans who afforded no protection to Jewish travellers when they did not molest them themselves. But despite the danger, Jews constantly had to visit these cities because of their business enterprises. Sometimes they only had to pass through these cities, as in the case af sea journeys when the ships touched at these ports. The scholars therefore at times forbade entrance into these cities or even into towns which were located in their neighborhood, but these prohibitions were usually ignored out of necessity. <sup><xref rid="fn34">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even wicked kings who ruled the land with brutal force and persecuted the Jewish religion could gain the admiration of the people by building a new city. This act was enough to justify many of his cruel deeds in the eyes of the people. Such was the case of Omri, the king of Israel, who encouraged idolatry, nevertheless the Talmud declared that he gained the kingdom for four generations of his successors because he built the city of Samaria. <sup><xref rid="fn35">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The number of cities in Palestine was usually highly exaggerated. Speaking of the conquests of Alexander Jannai, R. Jochanan thus declared that the area occupied contained 600,000 cities each of which was inhabited by 600,000 people. The total number would thus be larger than the population of the whole world today. Similar exaggerations we find in the writing of Josephus who said that there were 1200 cities in Galilee alone and in the writings of the Greek historian Dio Casius who related that during the uprising of Bar Kochba the Romans conquered 950 fortified cities.</p>
<p>We may conclude, however, that the large cities were subdivided into quarters each of which was significant in itself. From the descriptions of ancient Jerusalem we know that the city was divided into an upper and a lower part. During the time that we are dealing with, Jerusalem was in ruins and uninhabited, and when the scholars attempted to describe the beauty of the city they relied upon their imagination of the Jerusalem of the future after Messiah would come. But the descriptions of ancient Jerusalem were not exaggerated. The image of the city lived in the memory of all the people and they sought to make the other cities resemble Jerusalem in appearance. Most of the Palestine cities were built on mountain tops and the synagogues were erected at the highest point so as to be seen from all sides. The court which dispensed justice and controlled the observance of the commandments of the Torah also held its sessions there. The academies were located nearby and the sexton of the synagogue blew the Shofar there to announce the beginning of the Sabbath. The watch tower was also located in that vicinity to observe the countryside over a great distance and to announce the coming of an enemy.</p>
<p>Nearly all Palestine cities had suburbs which were called in Hebrew &#x201C;Migrash&#x201D; or &#x201C;Parvar&#x201D; (Kings II, 23:11). Houses in these suburbs were part of the cities for purposes of taxation and maintenance of order, but in time of war they were abandoned except such houses as bordered on the city walls.</p>
<p>The scholars established a rule by which all inhabitants of a city were compelled to build a wall with gates about the city. This rule was enforced in those towns that were near the border of the country and were subject to attacks. Every city also had one or more market places and was traversed by streets.</p>
<p>Speaking of the greatness of Jerusalem, a Midrash relates that the city contained twenty-four palaces each of which had 24 entrances. Near every entrance there were 24 large market places, each of which was divided into 24 small ones. Each small market place had 24 courts in each of which there were 24 houses. <sup><xref rid="fn36">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Every market place was usually designated by a name which described the type of merchandise that was sold there. Thus there were poultry markets and fish markets. Others were named after the people that lived in the neighborhood such as &#x201C;the market of the Arameans.&#x201D; &#x201C;the market of Rabbi Yitzchak&#x201D; and &#x201C;the market of Rabbi Chanin.&#x201D; In addition every city had &#x201C;corners&#x201D; (Kranoth) where different stores were located and where idlers (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05E9;&#x05D1;&#x05D9; &#x05E7;&#x05E8;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span>) congregated awaiting strangers from whom they could earn something.</p>
<p>The <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05DE;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05D0;&#x05F4;</span> (entrance) to the city also served as a market place and frequently resembled a court which extended for some distance and led up to various houses and courts within the city. The &#x201C;Mavo&#x201D; was significant and played an important role in the development of the rules pertaining to &#x201C;Eruvin.&#x201D; <xref rid="fn37">&#x002A;)</xref> The inhabitants living in the neighborhood of the &#x201C;Mavo&#x201D; were also responsible for its upkeep.</p>
<p>The Romans were great city builders and they generally laid out new cities in squares. Jewish scholars therefore developed the theory that cities should be built in that form in order to facilitate defining the 2000 ell limit outside of the city which was the distance allowed to walk on the Sabbath. <sup><xref rid="fn38">13)</xref></sup> Jews also built the walls surrounding their cities with uneven surfaces. The unevenness of the walls increased their defense capacity and when the enemy attempted to demolish them with iron rams the upper stones would fall on the attackers. The numerous corners and turns in the walls were also strategically important and hard to conquer.</p>
<p>As a result of the limited space within the walled area, houses were built close together and some of them were built into the protecting walls. Such houses generally served as gates to the city. Thus we find that during the conquest of Jericho, Rahab&#x2019;s house was built into the city wall and it was also said of one of the &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; of Palestine that the gate of the city led into his house. <sup><xref rid="fn39">14)</xref></sup> Some cities had double walls for greater protection in face of a superior enemy. The Romans were in the habit of erecting imposing gates on each side of the city, but such gates were built only in the Gentile inhabited cities. Jewish cities, on the other hand, presented a poor appearance architecturally both in the construction of their houses and protecting walls.</p>
<p>Life in the cities differed greatly from that in the villages so far as food, clothing and general behavior was concerned. Life in the cities was more refined in all its aspects when compared to the primitive mode of life in the villages. For the convenience of the city dwellers there were markets and hostelries where food supplies were sold and travellers were accommodated. These two institutions also served as the foundation for commerce in the country. On certain days of the week the villagers would bring their produce to the cities and would buy those necessities which they could not raise themselves. These market days were called <span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05DE;&#x05D9; &#x05D4;&#x05DB;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05D7;</span> (days of entrance) and occurred on Mondays and Thursdays. In honor of the visitors a chapter from the Torah would be read in the synagogue on those days and other religious needs of the villagers would be fulfilled. The court held its sessions and the scholars lectured on religious questions. Friday was another market day when the villagers brought food supplies such as fowl, cattle, fish and wine for the Sabbath. The artisans also had their shops in the city and the villagers paid them for their labor with their farm produce. Among these were also the scribes, the doctors and the teachers.</p>
<p>This trade was defined in the Talmud as &#x201C;give and take&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E9;&#x05D0; &#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05EA;&#x05DF;</span>) because it largely consisted of barter. It was only rarely that the villagers possessed any money. Cities were generally built near a supply of water, but when there were no springs or wells in the vicinity, water would be brought in pipes or aqueducts from some distance. Many cities also had reservoirs to store water in anticipation of drought or the drying up of wells and the people knew how to utilize water pressure to raise it to higher levels. Some cities had canals for drainage purposes and these canals were also used to bring the water to the fields for irrigation purposes. Wells were provided with buckets for raising the water.</p>
<p>The abundance of water in Palestine enabled people to maintain cleanliness and its effects on the health of the population was noticeable. The need and the justification of baths was recognized by the Talmud and was expressed in the following words: &#x201C;If a city dweller does not allow his wife to bathe at least once a week or a villager does not allow his wife to bathe at least once in a fortnight the woman may demand a divorce and the full payment of her dowry, likewise if a villager forces his wife to go barefoot three months in succession, or if a city dweller commands his wife to go barefoot one day.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn40">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Every city was surrounded by fields and in some cases part of the fields were within the city walls. This was also true of wine cellars and threshing floors which sometimes were found within the confines of the city walls. Although numerous trees were grown within the cities the orchards and the gardens were outside the walls. The roads leading through the gardens were often lined with avenues of trees. Torches and oil lamps were used to illuminate the entrances to the courts. These were provided by the owners of the houses at their own expense. <sup><xref rid="fn41">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the weekly market days every city had special fairs once a month or once every half year. At these fairs various kinds of merchandise from distant places and foreign lands were sold and money changers (<span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D7;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05F4;</span>) were present to exchange the coins of the foreign merchant who came to buy Palestine products.</p>
<p>Aside from their economic significance market places were also social centers where people congregated to look at the displays of merchandise and at the artistic arrangement of fruit. The grains most commonly marketed were rye or wheat for bread. In addition there were articles of apparel and flax, wine, wool, leather and slaves. Stores provided the city dwellers with all their needs in addition to the markets. These stores contained all possible articles including arms. In the smaller towns and villages there were also peddlers who carried their wares from house to house and many villagers preferred to dispose of their goods in this manner out of fear of being cheated in the cities.</p>
<p>The more refined tastes of the city people was apparent also in the food which they consumed and the Talmud mentions the difference in the flour which they used as compared to the flour used by the villagers. <sup><xref rid="fn42">17)</xref></sup> A delicacy frequently used at that time consisted of dough baked in honey, but in the cities this was made with much honey while in the villages only a trace of it was used. <sup><xref rid="fn43">18)</xref></sup> The villagers also ate coarse bread which was not liked in the cities. <sup><xref rid="fn44">19)</xref></sup> Similar differences were apparent in the garments worn. The garments of the villagers were primitive and are referred to in the Talmud as <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D2;&#x05D3;&#x05D9; &#x05D1;&#x05E0;&#x05D9; &#x05D7;&#x05E7;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05D0;</span> (garments of the farmers); in the cities various styles were used and it was often impossible to distinguish between the garments of men and women. <sup><xref rid="fn45">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Difficult as conditions were in the cities, the farming population met with still greater hardships. Their struggle for existence was more arduous and they were also exposed to ridicule. Villagers were called &#x201C;Am Haaretz&#x201D; and even those scholars who showed respect for the city artisans often expressed disdain for the &#x201C;Am Haaretz.&#x201D; In later years the name &#x201C;Am Haaretz&#x201D; was no longer used and <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D1;&#x05DF; &#x05DB;&#x05E4;&#x05E8;&#x05F4;</span> (villager) was substituted instead, but even then it was pointed out that a great difference existed between the city dweller and the villager. The contempt in which the villager was held is apparent from many descriptions and popular sayings of that time. From these it is obvious that only city dwellers were considered as civilized and the rural population was held to be ignorant.</p>
<p>Cities were held to be the home of wisdom and only their inhabitants knew how to show proper respect to scholars and to prominent men. Whenever a villager did not accord the proper respect to one greater than himself, he was not punished and it was ascribed to his ignorance.</p>
<p>The most striking analysis of the difference between city and village inhabitants is contained in the statement of the scholars concerning the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel both of whom described their visions of God and his heavenly retinue. Isaiah described what he saw as a city dweller who had frequent opportunities to see the king, but Ezekiel described his vision like a villager who may have seen the king only once in his life. <sup><xref rid="fn46">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>All political upheavals of that time originated in the cities, for only there the people showed understanding of political events. Villagers were not much concerned with political matters and they suspected everyone of trying to rob them. This state of mind resulted partly from the fact that the country was overrun by Jewish as well as non-Jewish bands of robbers in addition to soldiers, tax collectors and others who prayed upon the villagers.</p>
<p>The entire mode of life of the villagers was thus on a low plane. Their food was poorer, their garments coarse, their furniture made of unplaned boards. The regulations of the Talmud concerning cleanliness of vessels specifically mentions a &#x201C;bowl of the villagers&#x201D; which was different from those used in the cities. <sup><xref rid="fn47">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Villagers were allowed to celebrate Purim earlier than the city celebrations. Although the Book of Esther expressly states that Purim should be observed on the 14th and 15th days of the month of Adar, the Mishna declared that villagers may read the Book of Esther on market day when they come to the city on a Monday or Thursday even when those days are only the 11th, the 12th or the 13th of the month.</p>
<p>As soon as darkness fell, all villagers were afraid to leave their houses because of the wild animals that roamed the land <sup><xref rid="fn48">23)</xref></sup> and also for fear of the soldiers and of robber bands. But whereas the soldiers would only rob the farmer and force him to provide all their needs, the robber bands, which were common in peace time as well as during years of war, frequently killed their victims if any resistance was offered. Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta therefore said that the life of a villager might be compared to that of wanderers in the desert who were never sure of their lives, and whose wives and children could be seized. <sup><xref rid="fn49">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The doors of city houses were usually locked and when they were open there was always a bell present to announce the visitors. But the houses in the villages were always open and visitors with honest intentions could always be sure of generous hospitality.</p>
<p>But despite the disabilities of the villagers, their mode of life had certain advantages. Due to the crowded conditions in the cities contagious diseases were common and frequent bathing did not counteract them. The disease germs bred in the walls of the houses, as may be seen from the Biblical laws concerning leprosy.</p>
<p>The scholars ruled that every city must possess ten things for the convenience of its inhabitants. These were: a court, a charity fund, a synagogue, a bath house, a comfort station, a doctor, a barber, a scribe, a butcher and a teacher. <sup><xref rid="fn50">25)</xref></sup> But all of these did not suffice in time of epidemics and the inhabitants sought refuge in the villages.</p>
<p>By far the greatest difference between city and village consisted in matters of administration. The cities possessed courts and a police force to maintain order; each one was also taxed a definite sum for the city government and also for charitable purposes. In the villages, on the other hand, anarchy reigned and he who was more powerful could do as he pleased.</p>
<p>Jews exhibited a dislike for dogs and only in rare cases were dogs allowed in the cities and then they had to be chained. The opinion was common that one who keeps a dog is like one who raises pigs, and stories were related of pregnant women miscarrying when frightened by the barking of dogs. <sup><xref rid="fn51">26)</xref></sup> But in the villages dogs were common, especially for herding purposes.</p>
<p>Villages were often traversed by many people when they journeyed in connection with their business enterprises or to announce the regulations of the Sanhedrin. There were also travelers who went about to acquaint themselves with different peoples and lands. All of these found shelter and hospitality in the villages where they stopped overnight for fear of robbers who hid along the highways. Tax collectors especially were subject to such robberies when it was known that they carried considerable sums.</p>

<title>Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>EHUDAH</small> H<small>A</small>N<small>ASI</small> (R<small>ABENU</small> H<small>AKADOSH</small>) was succeeded by his son Rabban Gamliel to the post of Nasi. Rabban Gamliel (referred to in the Talmud as Rabban Gamliel, the son of Rabbi Jehuda Ha-Nasi) maintained his rule for but a short time, certainly not more than ten years, and was followed by his son Jehudah, whom the Talmud calls Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah (or Rabbi Judan) to distinguish him from his grandfather. Historically he is known as Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the First because he was followed by others of the same name.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah I was the last of the descendants of Hillel who was both head of the Sanhedrin and in charge of the secular administration of the Jewish population. After his death these two offices were separated and were held by different persons. It is impossible to establish the definite dates of these events due to the confusion of the records which resulted from the repetition of names. Frequently it is impossible to determine whether it is the grandfather or the grandson that the records speak of. But despite these discrepancies it is safer to trust the Talmudic sources even when they disagree with the historical dates of the Roman history.</p>
<p>There are numerous indications that Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah was a pupil in the academy of his grandfather. At that time it was still allowed for a grandson to bear the name of his grandfather during the latter&#x2019;s life. As additional substantiation of this fact we find a statement in the Talmud that Hillel, the younger brother of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah, questioned his grandfather in some religious matters. <sup><xref rid="fn52">1)</xref></sup> This leads to the belief that the older brother certainly must have been a pupil of Rabbi Jehudar ha-Nasi. The Talmud also cites differing opinions between grandfather and grandson regarding the necessity of offering tithes from fruit that was bought from a stranger or from a pagan, and this is held to be further proof of the scholastic relationship between the two. <sup><xref rid="fn53">2)</xref></sup> But despite these deductions we can only say with certainty that Rabbi Jehudah was a pupil of his father, Rabban Gamliel, and of Rabbi Chiya. <sup><xref rid="fn54">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah permitted the use of oil bought from pagans, <sup><xref rid="fn55">4)</xref></sup> and also attempted to introduce other reforms pertaining to the laws of marriage and divorce. In these reforms, however, he was thwarted by the opposition of the Sanhedrin. When his disciple, Rabbi Simlai, wished to repeal the prohibition against the use of bread that had been bought from strangers and concerning which there was doubt whether it had been tithed, Rabbi Jehudah objected on the ground that people would say that the court was repealing all prohibitions. <sup><xref rid="fn56">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In previous years enough olives were raised in Palestine so that it was unnecessary to buy oil from pagans and such oil was considered undesirable in the same way that wine made by pagans was not used for fear that it had been used for idolatrous purposes. But during the numerous wars that were fought in the country, the Romans destroyed most of the olive groves and the inhabitants had to resort to buying oil. For this reason Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah allowed the use of such oil.</p>
<p>The origin of the prohibition against the use of oil bought from pagans, dates back to the time of Daniel, according to Rav (Aba Arecha). Others maintain that this prohibition was one of the famous eighteen decrees that were promulgated by the scholars prior to the destruction of the Temple. It is related that Rav refused to use such oil even after the prohibition against it was repealed and he was reproved by his friend Shmuel who said to him: &#x201C;You should eat this oil, otherwise I will declare you to be a &#x2018;dissenting elder&#x2019; who refuses to obey the decisions of the court.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn57">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears that the people clung to the stricter interpretations of the law and the laxity of the religious conduct of the household of the Nasi was the subject of comment throughout the country. When Rabbi Jehudah realized that his household was the talk of the country he commanded that a stricter religious discipline be applied in order to avoid criticism.</p>
<p>The following instances are related in the Talmud. Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah and his brother Hillel were once bathing in the bath house of the city of Kabul. The custom of that city did not allow two men to bathe together, and when Rabbi Jehudah heard the people murmuring against him, Hillel immediately left the bath house to avoid all cause of criticism. Another time the two brothers spent the Sabbath in Biri, a city to the north of Safed, and on that day they walked about the streets in their overshoes. They then heard the people exclaiming that such a thing was never seen before and they immediately removed their overshoes and gave them to their servants to carry. <sup><xref rid="fn58">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The people criticised the household of the Nasi for many of its customs which differed from those commonly accepted, but the scholars informed them that some things which were prohibited for the rest of the population were permissible for the Nasi and those about him because they were &#x201C;close to the government.&#x201D; They were thus allowed to decorate their wall with various paintings, to use mirrors, to grow their hair long and to study Greek. <sup><xref rid="fn59">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among other attempted reforms, Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah also sought to do away with the fast of the ninth day of Ab. Others maintain that he merely wished to do away with the fast on those years when the ninth day of Ab fell on a Saturday and that it would have been unthinkable for him to try to abolish the fast altogether since it was enjoined by the Bible. Rabbi Jehudah also declared that there was no cause for fasting in times when there were no religious persecutions and Jews lived peacefully. <sup><xref rid="fn60">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was noted above that the events of this period are highly confused. Much information is lacking and we do not know with any degree of certainty where the last of the N&#x2019;siim maintained their academies. Of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah it was said that his academy was located in Sephoris; others maintain that it was in Tiberias. The city of Tiberias was held to be unclean because of the belief that it was built on the site of a cemetery. Rabbi Jehudah thus removed the taboo from this city by holding his academy there. Even the ceremony of the &#x201C;consecration of the month,&#x201D; which was always held in a city of Judea, Rabbi Jehudah performed in Tiberias. <sup><xref rid="fn61">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like his grandfather, Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah was also called Rabbi or Rabenu. This appellation which was applied to both grandfather and grandson still further confuses the records. The historian Graetz thus maintains that the Talmudic story of the friendship of Rabbi and emperor Antoninus refers to Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah and Alexander Severus.</p>
<p>History records that Alexander Severus was a Roman of Syrian birth. He ruled from 222 until 235 (C.E.) and was friendly to the Jews. His bedroom was said to contain the statues of Orpheus, Jesus and Abraham. On all occasions he repeated the maxim of Hillel: That which you would not have done to yourself, do not unto others. He also commanded that this maxim be engraved on the gates of all courts and whenever his legions were about to march, a herald pronounced these words to the soldiers that they might remember them.</p>
<p>Being a friend of the Jews and Christians (who were then still considered to be a Jewish sect) he always set them up as an example of honesty and moral conduct. The Greeks of Antioch and Alexandria therefore ridiculed him and called him &#x201C;Imperator Archisynagogos,&#x201D; but although the emperor knew of this attitude of the Greeks he did not deviate from his path. He presented the synagogue at Tiberias with a golden Menorah and he gave the Nasi a large field for the maintenance of his pupils. The friendly attitude of the emperor brought about more cordial relations between the Romans and the Jews and Christians. The Christian Church-father Origines complained in his writings that the emperor thought more like a Jew than a Roman.</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah that he did not distinguish between scholars and ordinary people in administrative matters and he taxed everyone equally for the government of the city of Tiberias. This was against the accepted axiom that one who undertakes the burden of the Torah should be freed from the burden of the government. Many of the scholars therefore spoke against the Nasi and on one occasion, as they studied the laws pertaining to a Nasi who commits a transgression, Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish asked: &#x201C;If a Nasi has committed a transgression, should he be flogged or not?&#x201D; He was answered that a court of three judges could condemn such a Nasi to be flogged and that it was not even necessary to convoke the small Sanhedrin of 23 members to try him.</p>
<p>Later Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish further asked whether a Nasi who had been flogged could be reinstated to his office. One of the pupils, Rabbi Chagai, replied that such a Nasi could not be reinstated for fear that he would execute his judges.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah heard of this discussion he understood that it was directed against himself and he sent one of his non-Jewish soldiers to seize Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish, but Rabbi Simeon escaped.</p>
<p>The following day Rabbi Jochanan came to the academy and before the studies were begun he pretended to look in all the corners of the buildings. When he was asked by the Nasi what he was searching for, Rabbi Jochanan answered: &#x201C;I search for Ben Lakish; we cannot begin our studies without the key.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Where is Ben Lakish without whom we cannot pursue our studies,&#x201D; the Nasi asked, and Rabbi Jochanan replied that he was hiding in Magdala. They then decided to go to Magdala on the following day to bring Ben Lakish back.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan at once sent a messenger to announce the good news to Ben Lakish and when they met on the following day Ben Lakish said to the Nasi: &#x201C;You have this day done an act which is similar to that of the Creator. When God wanted to free his people from bondage he did so Himself and not through a messenger or an agent.&#x201D; The Nasi asked him why he proposed his questions in the academy in a manner that would insult the Nasi and Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish replied: &#x201C;You must not think that out of fear of you I will refrain from studying God&#x2019;s Torah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn62">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time Jose the Maonite expounded the fifth chapter of Hosea and remarked that there would come a time when God would bring the priests to trial and He would ask them why they did not observe his Torah after He had granted them 24 priestly gifts. The priests would then reply: &#x201C;Creator of the world&#x0021; You have given us nothing.&#x201D; God would then go to the Jews and ask them: &#x201C;Why did you not give to the priests the 24 gifts which I have commanded in my Torah?&#x201D; and the Jews would reply: &#x201C;Because the servants of the Nasi take everything away from us.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Nasi wanted to punish Jose the Maonite for these words, but Rabbi Jochanan and Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish pleaded with him and said: &#x201C;Jose the Maonite wished to explain a difficult passage in the Bible; would you punish him for it?&#x201D; The Nasi summoned Jose the Maonite and during their conversation he asked him the meaning of the verse &#x201C;As is the mother so is her daughter&#x201D; (Ezekiel, 17:44). Jose replied: &#x201C;As is the generation, so is its Nasi and as is the altar such are its priests. <sup><xref rid="fn63">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah I was succeeded by his son Rabban Gamliel IV; Rabban Gamliel IV was followed by his son Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the Second. <sup><xref rid="fn64">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nearly 80 years passed from the rule of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah I until the administration of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah II. Lack of documentary information makes it impossible for us to fit the events of these years into the historical frame work of the Roman empire of that period. It is also entirely possible that due to the political changes there was an interregnum in the rule of the N&#x2019;siim. It is also noteworthy that Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah II was only nominally Nasi, for although he was recognized by the government as head of the Sanhedrin, the religious authorities of the people were Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Jochanan. We may assume that even Rabban Gamliel IV did not make any religious decisions without consulting the opinion of other scholars. Rabban Gamliel was looked upon as a mediocre man and a similar attitude was shown toward Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah II who always sought the advice of Rabbi Ami. When Rabban Gamliel asked Rabbi Abahu whether it was permissible to go to a Gentile fair to buy slaves, the latter sharply responded in the negative. <sup><xref rid="fn65">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On another occasion, when the land was affected by a drought, Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah declared thirteen fast days but still no rain fell. He was ready to declare still more fast days, but Rabbi Ami sent him a message saying that it was enough and that since the first thirteen fast days did not produce the desired effect, additional ones would be of no avail. <sup><xref rid="fn66">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah was a pupil of Rabbi Jochanan. On one occasion he declared so himself and the Talmud also relates that on a certain evening Rabbi Jochanan came to the gardens of Rabbi Jehudah to teach his men how to clean the plow shares. <sup><xref rid="fn67">16)</xref></sup> It is further told that when the pupils of Rabbi Chanina explained a law contrary to the opinions of Rabbi Jochanan, Rabbi Jehudah sent soldiers to enforce the decisions of Rabbi Jochanan. <sup><xref rid="fn68">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile scholarship declined in Palestine. The political unrest in the country and the growing weakness of the Roman empire resulted in a chaotic state of affairs. Emperors changed frequently and the central government lost much of its ability to govern lands as distant as Palestine. Babylonia then developed into a center of Jewish learning and in Palestine academies existed only in Galilee. But the Jews of Babylonia continued to cherish a great love for the Land of Israel and they still believed that one who would be a scholar must go to Palestine. Various anecdotes then became current in each country about the inhabitants of the other.</p>
<p>Determining the day of the new month was then a most important religious question. This day could be determined only on the basis of the testimony of witnesses who declared that they had seen the new moon. This became a very difficult procedure due to the interference of the Romans and also because of internal enemies. The beginning of the months of Tishri and Nisan were especially significant because the date of the Passover and leap years were then established. Rabbi Ami insisted on maintaining the old procedure, but Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah reminded him of the ruling of Rabbi Jochanan that one must be so strict with the witnesses who testify about the new moon, that even if they had not seen it in time they should declare that they had. <sup><xref rid="fn69">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is told that Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah devoted much time and energy to the establishment of schools for children and academies for adults in all corners of the land. To achieve this aim he sent out three scholars (R. Ami, R. Asi, and R. Chiya bar Aba) to investigate the situation and he instructed them that wherever they would find a city without a school and an academy they should call the elders and inform them that any city where the children do not study should be destroyed. <sup><xref rid="fn70">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The administration of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah occurred during the reign of Diocletian who was born in Dacia and rose from the common people. Diocletian decided that it was too great a task for one man to conduct the numerous Roman wars and to rule the empire at the same time. He therefore selected men to assist him; these were called &#x201C;Anti-Ceasar.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Some historians claim that Diocletian was friendly to the Jews and it is true that there is no record of any unusual persecution during his reign. But the Christian Church-father Eusebius relates that Diocletian persecuted the Christians. This is hard to explain in view of the fact that the Christians were then still considered to be a Jewish sect. This hatred of Christianity is ascribed to Diocletian by some historians as due not to religious fanaticism but to the realization that the Christians aimed to destroy the ruling religion. He therefore forced them to worship idols and commanded that all Christian churches be closed. From Jewish sources we learn that Diocletian also persecuted the Samaritans in Palestine and forced them to offer sacrifices to Roman idols. It is even said that he forced all the peoples of the empire, with the exception of the Jews, to worship the idols and to pour wine before their images. The Samaritans obeyed and since that time the wine of Samaritans was prohibited to Jews as unclean. <sup><xref rid="fn71">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The favorable position of the Jews aroused the envy of their neighbors and in order to undermine the friendship of the emperor it was reported to him that the Jews ridiculed his low origin and referred to him as the &#x201C;swine-herd.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A Talmudic legend relates that when Diocletian was a swine-herd the pupils of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah mocked him and even beat him. After he was elected emperor he remembered the insults that were his share and when he visited a Palestinian city a few miles from Tiberias he sent a letter to the Nasi commanding him to appear before him on a Saturday night together with a group of his scholars. The messenger was instructed to deliver the letter on the eve of the Sabbath so that the Nasi would have no opportunity to leave at once. Heavy punishment was threatened to the Nasi and the scholars if they delayed their appearance.</p>
<p>The legend continues that a miracle occurred and the Nasi together with his companions appeared before the emperor on time. A spirit named &#x201C;Antigris&#x201D; carried them to the emperor immediately after the &#x201C;Havdalah.&#x201D; When their coming was announced, the emperor declared that he would not see them until after they bathed and he comanded that a bath be heated for them for seven days and seven nights so that they may die of the heat. But the same spirit cooled the bath before they entered it, and when they finally appeared before the emperor he asked them whether they allowed themselves to ridicule the emperor because of their assurance that miracles would occur to them. The scholars replied that the Jews only ridiculed the swine-herd Diocletian but not the emperor Diocletian. <sup><xref rid="fn72">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have noted before that the family of the Nasi was no longer outstanding in scholarship and its religious authority almost vanished entirely. But the adherence of the people to the dynasty of the Nasi remained steadfast. As long as the Nasi was descended from Hillel, who traced his descent from king David, the people felt that they had a ruler of the royal house of David whose power was temporarily limited by the Romans. The people considered it to be their duty to provide the needs of the Nasi and to maintain him in the greatest honor. As long as one of the seed of David still lived, their independence was not entirely lost.</p>
<p>The Roman government sought to press as much money as they could out of the Jews and the tax collectors were avoided as often as was possible, but for the needs of the Nasi everyone gave as much as was asked and even more than was asked. When the Nasi sent out his messengers to announce the religious decisions of the Sanhedrin, the messengers were received with great honors and were given valuable gifts to take to the Nasi that he might be able to conduct his office without worry.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah I died, Rabbi Jannai Rabah announced in the academy that all regulations affecting the priests were done away with for that day and that priests could participate in the rites for the dead. But when Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah II died no such reverence was shown and some of the scholars even allowed themselves to joke at the funeral. <sup><xref rid="fn73">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah II was followed by three N&#x2019;siim of the house of Hillel concerning whom we would have known nothing were it not for the Christian Church-father Epiphanos who wrote about them. Church-father Epiphanos thus saved the history of these N&#x2019;siim from oblivion even as Josephus saved for future generations the chronicle of many of the events which transpired during the time of the second temple. Epiphanos appeared to have been born a Jew and he described the history of the N&#x2019;siim in the belief that those were the last days of the Jewish faith. In this respect he also resembled Josephus who believed that he was writing the history of a people doomed to extinction.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah II was followed by his son Rabban Gamliel V. Rabban Gamliel was succeeded by Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah III who was thirteen generations removed from Hillel. The Talmudic records about this Rabbi Jehudah are very meager and he is mentioned together with Rabbi Jeremiah <sup><xref rid="fn74">23)</xref></sup> or Rabbi Ami <sup><xref rid="fn75">24)</xref></sup> which is our only basis for concluding that it was Rabbi Jehudah III that was being referred to. The events mentioned in connection with his name also do not coincide with the period of his predecessors.</p>
<p>Due to the political alignment in Palestine, Rabbi Jehudah III lived in Caesarea where Rabbi Abuah headed the academy. Previous N&#x2019;siim lived either in Sephoris or in Tiberias.</p>
<p>But despite the unfavorable political and economic situation of the Jews, the Nasi still occupied an exceptional position and he was immune in his person. His decisions in religious matters were binding. The Nasi had to assist in the collection of the taxes from the Jews and he had the right to collect money for the needs of his household. He also had the right to ordain his disciples and to excommunicate those who joined the Christians.</p>
<p>Until the year 325 (C.E.) the Christians were considered to be a Jewish sect and they had a large following in the country. Debates between the orthodox and Christian Jews were a common occurrence and both groups sought substantiation for their beliefs in the Bible.</p>
<p>Oppressed by heavy taxes and other political and economic persecutions, the condition of the people grew worse from day to day but their spirit was not broken as long as their religious life could continue in its traditional channels. In this respect the situation took a radical turn for the worse with the accession of Constantine to the throne of Rome (306-337). Constantine embraced Christianity and established it as the state religion. Persecution of the Jews on religious grounds was then intensified. The council of the Christian Patriarchs was then held at Nicea and this gathering severed all bonds with the Jews. The emperor lent his aid to the Christian church in its persecution of all other religions. Constantine II who ruled together with the co-emperor Gallus (337-349) revived the policies of Hadrian in not allowing the Jews to practice their religious commandments. Gallus was especially known for his brutality to the Jews. Upon his return from a war in the east he laid waste the southern half of the country, and it seemed that this region which contained many educational institutions headed by the disciples of Rabbi Jehudah, would never be rebuilt</p>
<p>Under these circumstances the secular power of the N&#x2019;siim was diminished to a minimum. The population lost much of its interest in legal matters and devoted itself primarily to Hagada with its fantastic interpretations. The scholars of Palestine lost the creative powers of the previous generations. There was also not much time to devote to such matters, for everyone was concerned with finding a way to escape from the country. The population became impoverished and Rabbi Levi said: &#x201C;Years ago, when people had money they were interested in the Mishna, Halacha and Talmud; but now that they are poor they do not want to hear of legal matters and are only interested in blessings and consolation.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn76">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study of the Bible, however, was widespread. Those who leaned toward Christianity studied it to prove their contentions and the others studied it in order to be able to refute the Christians. Thus Rabbi Abahu, who was a disciple of Rabbi Jochanan, declared: &#x201C;The people of Palestine study the Bible and are acquainted with all its books and they can explain everyone of its verses because of their constant debates with the Minim (Jewish Christians) on the basis of the Bible.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn77">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study of Halacha thus declined and only those who survived from the days of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah I understood it fundamentally. The other scholars were mediocre people and exhibited no penetrating logic. They merely gathered the statements and opinions of the previous generation without analyzing their content and without questioning their validity. They did not seek to solve the problems which arose in their day, nor did they ponder the words of their predecessors. They were satisfied to know the simple meaning of the laws which they had received.</p>
<p>The situation was entirely different in Babylonia. There &#x201C;Sophistry&#x201D; was engaged in extensively and for this reason the Palestinians often mocked the Babylonians and said that &#x201C;there is no study of the Torah that can compare with the study of the Torah in Palestine and there is no wisdom like the wisdom of Palestine.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn78">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the Jews of Palestine realized that scholarship was on the decline, they were still proud of their heritage and they were convinced that the handful of scholars in Palestine outweighed those of Babylonia. They said: &#x201C;The small group of scholars in Palestine is of greater significance than a large Sanhedrin in a foreign country.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn79">28)</xref></sup> Palestine scholars did not allow their pupils to emigrate, and when Rabbi Simeon bar Aba asked Rabbi Chanina bar Chama whether he should go to Babylonia and he requested a letter of recommendation, Rabbi Chanina refused to give him such a letter not wishing to see a promising pupil leave the country. <sup><xref rid="fn80">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increasing lack of interest in Halacha and the difficult situation of the country led to the emigration of many scholars despite the opposition of others. This attitude toward Halacha is illustrated in the following story: &#x201C;Rabbi Abahu and Rabbi Chiya bar Aba once came to a city where Rabbi Abahu lectured in Hagada and Rabbi Chiya expounded Halacha. All the inhabitants of the city came to hear Rabbi Abahu but Rabbi Chiya had no audience. Rabbi Chiya was greatly hurt and Rabbi Abahu consoled him by saying that but few people go to buy valuable diamonds and pearls but everybody readily buys cheap toys.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn81">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But Palestine still maintained a position of authority. Legal decisions were sent from Palestine to Babylonia <sup><xref rid="fn82">31)</xref></sup> touching upon various prohibitions and permissions and also on money matters. <sup><xref rid="fn83">32)</xref></sup> No one in Babylonia dared to question the validity of these decisions. <sup><xref rid="fn84">33)</xref></sup> The decisions of the Palestine scholars in the matter of the determination of the date of the new month and of leap years were especially adhered to even after the scholars of Babylonia had learned to calculate the calendar and could determine these dates without having to wait for word from Palestine that the new moon had been seen. <sup><xref rid="fn85">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thirteen generations after Hillel the Old, another Hillel, the son of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah III, was elected Nasi. Of his activities we only know that in the year 359 (C.E.) he finally solved the problem of a calendar by basing it on exact calculations. The new calendar was to be permanent and all holidays were to be determined by it. The book of genealogy lists the following as the last N&#x2019;siim: R. Hillel II, R. Gamliel V, R. Jehudah N&#x2019;siah IV, and R. Gamliel VI (or Bathraah&#x2014;the last). About sixty years passed from the time of Hillel II till R. Gamliel the VI, and this period was a very difficult one since it coincided with the rise of Christianity to power.</p>
<p>The political decline of the Jews began during the reign of Constantine the Great and continued at an eccelerating pace. During the first years of his rule Constantine was quite tolerant to the Jews and he repealed the limitations which were imposed by Diocletian. He was then convinced that every man should have the right to choose his own faith and he also freed the Jewish scholars and all &#x201C;the servants of the synagogue&#x201D; from payment of taxes to the government. He recognized the Nasi as the head of the Jewish religious community and teachers of Jewish law were commanded to obey his edicts. But this liberalism of the emperor was not of long duration and soon after he embraced Christianity, he fell under the influence of religious fanatics and he was guided by them in his policies toward the Jews. The emperor&#x2019;s religious advisers followed the leadership of Bishop Sylvester of Rome, Bishop Paul of Byzantium and Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea. It was they who called the attention of the emperor to the belief that the Jews were a cursed and forsaken people condemned to suffering. They insisted that since the emperor had seen the light and had embraced the only true faith, he had to abstain from the sin of protecting the Jews.</p>
<p>Constantine then ruled that Jews could not convert others to their faith, and if they did, both parties were to be punished. A free man who embraced Judaism was to lose all his property and a non-Jewish slave who was circumcised against his will was to be liberated. If a Jew who embraced Christianity was persecuted by other Jews, his tormentors were to be burned at the stake.</p>
<p>All these years of persecution were only broken for a brief moment by the short-lived reign of Julian the Apostate who ruled for 18 months (Nov. 361&#x2014;June 363). In his struggle against Christianity Julian befriended the Jews. He reduced the burden of their taxes, he did not allow them to be insulted and he called the Nasi &#x201C;Honored friend and brother.&#x201D; In a letter to the Nasi Rabbi Hillel, he promised to improve the condition of the Jews and to permit the rebuilding of the temple after his return from the war with the Persians.</p>
<p>After Hillel II the post of Nasi was occupied by his son Gamliel V. The Christian Church-father Hieronymus relates that Emperor Theodosius the Great, who ruled from 378 till 395, took the part of the Nasi against the Roman consul in Palestine, who infringed upon his rights, and had him executed.</p>
<p>R. Gamliel V was succeeded by Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah IV. The son of Rabbi Jehudah, Rabbi Gamliel VI, was the last Nasi. In his time the Roman empire was divided into two parts&#x2014;eastern Rome with the capital at Constantinople (395-1453) and western Rome with its old capital (395-476). Rabbi Gamliel the last is mentioned in the decrees of emperor Honorius (395-424) and of Theodosius II (408-450).</p>
<p>There is also in existence a decree of the year 426 which commands that all the payments which the Jews of Palestine made to the Nasi should henceforth be paid to the imperial treasury. This decree was probably issued at the death of Rabbi Gamliel. Rabbi Gamliel the Sixth died childless and with him the dynasty of Hillel came to an end.</p>
<p>Thus we find that although the Nasi was recognized by the government at all times his significance in the eyes of the Jews diminished toward the end. In religious matters he was no longer the highest authority and his political influence with the Roman officials was negligible. His only important religious functions were the consecration of the new month, the sending of messengers to report the appearance of the new moon, questioning the witnesses and the determination of the holidays and the leap years. Traditionally all of these had to be determined in the presence of the Great court in Palestine in order to be valid.</p>
<p>The Romans frequently seized the messengers that were sent to announce these matters to the scholars in Babylonia which was outside the boundaries of the Roman empire. Whenever caught the messengers were hanged and few people volunteered for such dangerous work. Although the Babylonian scholars could calculate the time of the holidays and the leap years, they were not allowed by tradition to determine these occasions on the basis of their calculations. Thus it once occurred that throughout the month of Adar it was impossible to send messengers to Babylonia to announce that a leap year had been declared. Only late in the summer there were found people who were willing to risk their lives in this mission and the Babylonian Jews observed the month of Ab twice in order that the New Year might coincide with that in Palestine. The messengers were given a letter written in code so that in case they were caught the Romans should not be able to understand its contents. The letter read and was interpreted as follows: &#x201C;A pair (two witnesses) came from Reketh (Tiberias) and they were caught by the eagle (the Romans) who found in their possession things that are made in Luz (Tzitzith). Through God&#x2019;s mercy and because of their own merit they escaped in peace (from the hands of the Romans). The descendants of Nachshon (the Nasi who was descended from the tribe of Judah) wanted to decide upon a crescent (declare a leap year), but the Idumean (the Roman) did not permit them. But the men of the assemblies gathered and declared a crescent for the month that Aaron died (the month of Ab). <sup><xref rid="fn86">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The function of determining new months and leap years lent some prestige to the Nasi and he had to be looked up to as the religious leader. But when Rabbi Hillel II established a permanent calendar he did away with the last important role of the Nasi. The office of Nasi thus became an empty title. The government looked upon the Nasi as upon a Jewish official, but the Jews could see no use in maintaining the office. Emperor Theodosius issued a decree that &#x201C;whoever insults the Nasi should be heavily punished.&#x201D; From other sources we may conclude that this decree was aimed primarily at the Jews.</p>
<p>We have previously recounted some of the laws promulgated by Constantine against the Jews, especially in relation to their attitude toward converts to Christianity. When he was informed that the Jews were planning a revolt against Rome he issued a decree prohibiting them from approaching the gates of Jerusalem. He also exhibited a certain sense of justice in not repealing a previous order which freed scholars and servants of the synagogue from taxes. In 336 he also ruled that Jews who embraced Christianity must not insult or do harm to their previous co-religionists.</p>
<p>This law was very timely because new converts to Christianity persecuted the Jews, and before the latter could get redress from the governor or the emperor, much harm was accomplished. Such was the case of one Joseph of Tiberias who was considered to be one of the scholars of the court of the Nasi. The Nasi trusted him and sent him to gather the offerings of the people. When Joseph came to Cilicia in Asia Minor, it became obvious from his lectures that he was no longer an adherent of Judaism and the people would pay no attention to him. Joseph then said that he had been thrown into a river and was only saved through a miracle. After he openly embraced Christianity, the priests interceded for him with the emperor and he was appointed in charge of the new converts. Utilizing the confidence of the Emperor, Joseph fabricated numerous false stories about the Nasi and he particularly tried to convince the emperor that the Jews were planning revolt.</p>
<p>The rumor of a planned revolt must have been based on some truth. We find that in 351 an attempt was made to overthrow the Romans. The records of that rebellion, both Jewish and non-Jewish, are very inadequate, but even from these meager sources we can obtain a picture of the events.</p>
<p>The uprising began in the city of Sephoris which was a natural fortress. The Jews overwhelmed the Roman garrison of that city on a dark night and with the weapons which they seized they attacked other cities and succeeded in capturing Tiberias and Lud. Constantine II (350-361) dispatched several legions which subdued the uprising and mercilessly persecuted the rebels. Sephoris was destroyed entirely. Tiberias, Lud and southern Palestine were laid waste. The pursuit of the rebels continued until they were annihilated.</p>
<p>The Roman commander Arsikanus was especially severe with the inhabitants of Sephoris who were forced to hide in the caves about Tiberias. Some of them tried to mask their faces in order not to be recognized, but numerous informers reported them to the authorities. <sup><xref rid="fn87">36)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of the great perils that attended the announcement of the new months and leap years Rabbi Hillel II decided to do away with the traditional procedure and he established a permanent calendar. It was thus no longer necessary to question witnesses concerning the appearance of the new moon nor to send messengers to announce the findings to the Jews of foreign countries. In the matter of holidays, Jews in foreign countries were freed from the decisions of the &#x201C;Great Court&#x201D; in Palestine.</p>

<chapter>
<title>The Hagadah and Its Authors</title>
<p>T<small>HE</small> H<small>AGADIC PART OF THE</small> T<small>ALMUD</small> consists of the interpretations of the texts of the Bible as well as of legendary and poetic descriptions of historical events in so far as these were not concerned with the law. It was the aim of the Hagada to inspire the people with higher moral concepts and to revive their courage during times of oppression.</p>
<p>Throughout the numerous generations of Amoraim there were many scholars who underestimated the worth of the Hagada and even opposed it. Such opposition, however, remained ineffective. The demands of the people were stronger than scholastic theories. The masses yearned for words of consolation and they eagerly listened to the teachings of the Hagada.</p>
<p>The economic and social pressure which resulted from the political developments, the constant impoverishment of the people and the burden of submission to foreign rulers weakened the interest in Halacha. A much more receptive attitude was maintained toward Hagada which caressed the fantasy and in times of sorrow it inspired hope for a brighter future. Even during the brief intermission when the situation of the Jews of Palestine improved, as during the reign of Alexander Severus, Rabbi Jehudah, then Nasi, complained of the suffering inflicted by the government which forced him to take the last earnings of the people for the payment of taxes. In an attempt to increase its taxes, the Roman government once issued an edict that Jews should cultivate their fields on the Sabbatical year and the scholars had to give their consent, otherwise the people would have been unable to pay their taxes.</p>
<p>But such respites in the long chain of oppression which did occur were short lived and were intended to allow the people to recuperate and to prepare them to bear patiently the decrees that inevitably followed. It is also remarkable that the rich as well as the poor suffered equally whenever the Romans intensified their oppression. The rich were sentenced to death for not giving all that was asked of them and the poor met a similar fate for not having anything to give.</p>
<p>All of these facts we learn from casual remarks in the Talmud and the Midrashim which are attached to various legal opinions. The scholars of that time did not appreciate the importance of recording the events, and when it was remarked that future generations would not know what had occurred, the answer was given that &#x201C;even if we should want to record everything we could not do so.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Considering the unbearable position of the Jews at that time, it is therefore quite understandable why they thirsted for consoling words and why they so eagerly turned to the Hagada. But the masses of the people were not alone in this respect; their leaders also sought momentary respite from the bitterness of their fate. The Hagada offered them all that. It promised a glorious future for the Jews, it taught them to value their faith, and it assured divine justice and retribution for all the wrongs that they were suffering. The Hagada extolled the virtues of the Jewish nation; it listed the virtues of the Torah and of those who adhered to it; it related the events of the past and inspired courage to face the future.</p>
<p>Not all the legends that were repeated by the scholars were written down and many of them were lost. Others were not concerned with problems of conduct and were considered unimportant. But all those legends that have come down to us are a rich source of ethical maxims and words of wisdom with a definite lesson for every eventuality. In addition they also explain many passages of the Bible which would otherwise remain inexplicable. Some of the legends may appear to be of minor worth today, but this is due to the fact that we do not understand them. Others are based on events of which we have no record or on events which we cannot conceive of today.</p>
<p>The authors of the Hagada are usually known as the <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D1;&#x05E0;&#x05DF; &#x05D3;&#x05D0;&#x05D2;&#x05D3;&#x05EA;&#x05D0;</span> (teachers of the Hagada). Some of these also engaged in legal discussions and looked to the Hagada as a means of refreshing the minds of their pupils when they showed signs of weariness of the &#x201C;Sophistry.&#x201D; There were some scholars who looked at the teachers of Hagada with a lack of respect; they refused to call them &#x201C;Rabbi&#x201D; and merely referred to them as &#x201C;the men of Hagada.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Aside from the above mentioned purposes the Hagada also served to protect the Jews from Christian teachings which became common at that time. It taught them how to answer and to refute the arguments of the Christians which were based on the Bible. As long as the Christians were considered to be a Jewish sect and they preached moral principles which did not threaten the fundamental tenets of the faith, they were tolerated. But when they began to claim that God had repudiated the Torah and for this reason he had destroyed the temple they became a menace to the Jewish religion. When the Christians sent apostles to win the nations to their faith and these apostles were successful because they repudiated the Sabbath, the laws of cleanliness and circumcision, the scholars feared that Jews also might be misled.</p>
<p>One must also bear in mind that the Jewish method of interpreting the Bible was also used by many Christians of that time. The difference consisted in that the Hagada never assumed the authority of law among Jews while many of the principles of Christianity were founded on such interpretations. Not only Jewish born Christians but also non-Jews who embraced Christianity employed this method of expounding the Old and the New Testaments and even in their attacks on Jews they based themselves on the texts of the Bible.</p>
<p>The Church-father Theophil of Antioch, who was born a non-Jew, thus explained that God was called &#x201C;Makom&#x201D; because He contained the whole world within himself but that the world was too small to be the &#x201C;Makom&#x201D; (place) of God. Likewise he said that when the animals were created they were powerless to do any harm and only the sin of Adam bestowed this power upon them. Another time he declared that when God said to Adam &#x201C;Where art thou?&#x201D; it might seem that He did not know where Adam was, but in reality He said so in order to begin a conversation with Adam and to give him an opportunity to repent.</p>
<p>The Church-father Origines declared that the &#x201C;Seraphim&#x201D; which the prophet Isaiah saw in heaven were the Messiah and the personification of the Holy Spirit. He also explained the functions of the angels mentioned in the Scriptures: Raphael was appointed to heal the sick, Gabriel was in charge of wars, and Michael was in charge of the prayers of man.</p>
<p>Hieronimus, the greatest of the Church-fathers, to whom Jews owed a debt of gratitude for preserving the Bible, held forth on the piety of Noah who lived in a generation of wicked men. The passage stating that God created a garden eastward (mikedem) in Eden, he explained to indicate that the garden of Eden was created before the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It would take us too far afield to cite any more interpretations of the Christian Patriarchs (who were born non-Jews) to the texts of the Bible in so far as they resemble those of the Jewish scholars. It is obvious, however, that most of these interpretations were taken from Jewish sources.</p>
<p>Nearly all Christian teachers attempted to prove their contention from the verse &#x201C;Let us make man.&#x201D; The use of the plural in this verse, they said, indicated that God consulted with His son when He decided to create man.</p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuel ben Nachmani quoted his teacher Rabbi Jonathan in this matter and said that when Moses had to write this passage in the Torah he said to God: &#x201C;Lord of the world&#x0021; Why do you give an opportunity to claims that You had a partner in the creation of man?&#x201D;, and God answered: &#x201C;You write as I tell you and those who err shall err.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn88">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Church-father Justinus the Martyr once asked a Jew with whom he was debating religious matters: &#x201C;If the commandment of circumcision is so important in the eyes of God, why did He not impose it on Adam?&#x201D; The same question was once asked by a Min (a Jew who embraced Christianity) of Rabbi Oshaiah and the latter replied: &#x201C;Why does a man shave the hair on his head but not his beard?&#x201D; The Min answered: &#x201C;Because the hair on a man&#x2019;s head was already growing when he was still a foolish child.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why then does not one gouge out his eyes or cut off his hands because they also were with him when he was still foolish?&#x201D; Rabbi Oshaiah continued, &#x201C;the truth of the matter is that whatever had been created by God during the six days has to be improved. Thus wheat has to be ground before it can be used. Likewise the human body has to be improved.&#x201D;</p>
<p>An outstanding man among the teachers of the Hagada was Rabbi Simlai, a disciple of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah I and a friend of Rabbi Jehudah II whom he accompanied on all his travels. He was a constant companion of the Nasi who always relied upon him. Rabbi Simlai loved the Hagada and although most of his statements were lost we may conclude from the few that remained that his expositions consisted of wise and witty sayings.</p>
<p>Rabbi Simlai said: 613 commandments God gave to Moses; King David reduced them to 11; the prophet Isaiah reduced the commandments to six; Micha limited them to three, and Amos condensed all 613 into one commandment. Rashi comments on this that in earlier generations people were very pious and could observe all 613 commandments, but the later generations were not so pious, and when it is impossible to observe all the commandments it is necessary to be satisfied with fewer. <sup><xref rid="fn89">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Characteristic of the condition of his times is his explantation of the passage in Hosea (2:7) as referring to scholars who shame the Torah with their deeds such as people who preach that one must not loan money for interest and yet they do so themselves, that one must not rob yet they rob others or that one must not steal and yet they steal from others. <sup><xref rid="fn90">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani, several of whose Halachic opinions are cited in the Talmud, was even greater than Rabbi Simlai in this form of exposition. He loved to compare the virtues of the Jews with those of other peoples and at the same time he praised the Torah and its followers. But the moral life he held to be &#x201C;even more important than the study of the Torah.&#x201D; He sought to explain and to justify the sins of the leaders of the nation. He always maintained that the story of these sins must not be taken literally and those who believed that such people as Reuben the son of Jacob, the sons of Eli or king David could have sinned, were in error. <sup><xref rid="fn91">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even in legal matters he based his arguments on the Hagadic method of interpretation. Thus he said: &#x201C;How do we know that a court need not listen to the defense of one who incites to idol worshipping? We may learn this from the case of the snake which God cursed for persuading Eve to sin without even giving it an opportunity to defend its act.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn92">5)</xref></sup> When the Mishna ruled that during a public fast ashes had to be placed on the Ark, Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani said that it was necessary to do so in memory of Isaac who allowed himself to be sacrificed and that God might consider the ashes on the Ark as if they were those of the ram which Abraham sacrificed instead of his son. <sup><xref rid="fn93">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another bright star in the firmament of the Hagada was Rabbi Levi. He lived during the time of the second and third generations of Amoraim in Palestine. The name of his father is unknown to us, for he is always referred to only by his own name. Like Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani he also found substantiation for legal decisions in the interpretations of Biblical texts. For a long time Rabbi Levi was not appreciated among the scholars. His work then consisted in calling the people to attend the lectures of Rabbi Jochanan. But one time Rabbi Jochanan was late and Rabbi Levi addressed the audience to pass the time until the arrival of Rabbi Jochanan. His words were greatly liked and since then he was allowed to lecture every Saturday in the academy of Rabbi Jochanan. <sup><xref rid="fn94">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even Rabbi Zera, who often mocked the &#x201C;men of Hagada,&#x201D; asked his friends and colleagues to attend the lectures of Rabbi Levi. <sup><xref rid="fn95">8)</xref></sup> Rabbi Levi&#x2019;s interpretations followed an original method and he explained the significance of Biblical words according to their meaning in other languages, particularly Arabic and Greek. He also employed fables which were based on the behavior of men and animals. Thus he related that the lion, the king of the animals, was once angered by his subjects. The animals gathered to decide who should conciliate him and the fox undertook the task. At other times he uttered maxims to guide men in their conduct as when he said that man should eat according to his income, he should dress poorer than his income allows him and he should furnish his house better than his income permits him. <sup><xref rid="fn96">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of the verse &#x201C;if the anointed priest shall sin&#x201D; he said: &#x201C;Woe to the city whose doctor is sick and he who has to cure others is himself blind in one eye.&#x201D; He also said: &#x201C;The heart and the eye are agents of sin. The eye sees and the heart desires.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn97">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Six limbs serve man,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;three of these he can control but the other three are outside of his control. Man cannot control his eye, for it sees even against his will. The same is true of the ear which hears even when one does not want to. Likewise the nose smells odors which one does not like. The mouth, on the other hand, can be controlled. It may be used for the study of the Torah or it may be employed in gossip. Man also controls his hand to fulfill commandments with it or to steal. The same is true of the foot which leads man wherever he chooses, either into the synagogue and the academy or to see forbidden games.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn98">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In many of his speeches Rabbi Levi sought to inspire the people with courage to bear all vicissitudes in the belief that God would avenge them. At times he also hinted that the Jews were themselves to blame for much of their suffering. Thus he said that when Messiah would come God would throw the Pagans into Gehenna and He would say to them: &#x201C;Why have you inflicted pain upon my children?&#x201D; They would then answer: &#x201C;We would not have inflicted pain upon them if they had not slandered each other.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn99">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The passage &#x201C;A good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one&#x2019;s birth&#x201D; (Ecclesiastes, 7:1), Rabbi Levi explained with a parable. Two ships were once on the great sea. One of them was leaving the shore and the other was approaching it. It was then seen that the people on the ship leaving the shore were happy while some of those on the ship nearing the shore were sad. A wise man remarked: &#x201C;We see here a strange sight. People who leave the shore should not be happy, for they know not how long they will be at sea and what winds they will encounter, but people who near the shore should be happy in the realization that they have safely reached dry land. It is likewise with the life of man. One should not reckon the years he had lived but rather should he reckon the time which still separates him from death.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn100">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Levi said: &#x201C;When God commanded Noah to include two of each kind in the ark, falsehood came and wanted to enter, but Noah said to it: &#x2018;You cannot enter, for you have no pair.&#x2019; Falsehood then went to search for a mate and it met with sin and asked it whether it would enter the ark with it. Sin asked what it would receive for doing so and falsehood promised that everything which it would earn it would give to sin. When they left the ark, sin seized everything which falsehood had gained, and when falsehood objected, sin reminded it of their compact. Falsehood thereupon said: &#x2018;How could you believe me that I meant to do as I promised?&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn101">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another prominent teacher of Hagada was Rabbi Jehudah bar Simon or Rabbi Jehuda ben Pazi, as he is called in the Jerusalem Talmud. (Sometimes also called Rabbi Jehudah ben Rabbi Simeon ben Pazi.) Like some other teachers of Hagada, we also find some of his legal statements in the Talmud, but these are of minor importance. Many of his expositions were not original but were repetitions of those of former scholars which he improved and amplified for the better understanding of his audiences.</p>
<p>Speaking of Adam Rabbi Jehudah said: &#x201C;God almost decided to give the Torah through Adam and He thought: &#x2018;This man whom I created and who is not of woman born, should I not give the Torah through him?&#x2019; But He immediately decided otherwise and said: &#x2018;I gave one commandment to this man that he should not eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge and he failed to obey me. How then can I give him the Torah with its 613 commandments?&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn102">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time Rabbi Jehudah said: &#x201C;Adam was destined to live forever. Why then was he condemned to die? To inspire people with the fear of God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn103">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah bar Simon sought to introduce such novel interpretations into the texts of the Bible as would surprise the hearer by their originality and their wondrous nature. Of the passage in Genesis, &#x201C;And the earth was without form and void,&#x201D; he said that &#x201C;without form&#x201D; referred to Adam who was as nothing after he sinned and &#x201C;void&#x201D; referred to Cain who voided the act of creation by killing Abel. &#x201C;Darkness&#x201D; referred to the generation of Enosh. &#x201C;The face of the deep&#x201D; referred to the generation of the deluge. God&#x2019;s words &#x201C;Let there be light&#x201D; referred to Abraham; &#x201C;and God called the light day&#x201D; referred to Jacob; the evening referred to Esau and the morning to Jacob. &#x201C;One day&#x201D; referred to the Day of Atonement which God gave to Israel. <sup><xref rid="fn104">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Telling of Sara and the miracles that occurred to her, Rabbi Jehudah declared that many other childless women bore children at the time that Sara gave birth to Isaac; the blind regained their sight and the deaf their hearing and many foolish men gained wisdom. <sup><xref rid="fn105">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah referred to the political situation of the Jews on numerous occasions but he could not speak openly on this subject and he limited himself to vague references to the oppressors. &#x201C;The devouring fire&#x201D; spoken of by Isaiah (33:4) he explained to mean the enemies of the Jews who would burn the world and all of humanity if they could. <sup><xref rid="fn106">19)</xref></sup> On the same subject he also said: &#x201C;The Jews say to God: &#x2018;How many decrees have been enacted against us to make us turn away from your holy name but they were to no avail, for we still come to Your synagogues and academies to announce to the whole world twice each day that You are our only God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn107">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once Rabbi Jehudah was asked concerning the Trinity and the verse of Zechariah (13:8) was quoted that &#x201C;it shall come to pass that in all the land two parts therein shall be cut off and die but the third shall be left therein.&#x201D; Some Christians explained this verse to indicate that those people who believed in two kinds of gods, such as the Persians who believed in a god of light and a god of darkness, shall perish and only those who believed in the Trinity would be saved. Rabbi Jehudah agreed with them concerning the Persians but the &#x201C;third&#x201D; he explained to refer to the Jews who are made up of three groups (Priests, Levites and Israelites) and who praise God by thrice saying Kadosh. <sup><xref rid="fn108">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>With exaggerated love Rabbi Jehudah bar Simon spoke of the Jews and said: &#x201C;A king once had an orchard in which there grew figs, vines, pomegranates and apples. The king leased the orchard and went away. Sometime later the king returned to see how his orchard was thriving and he found it full of thorns and weeds. In great anger he called men and commanded them to cut down the trees, but when he looked closely between the thorns he noticed a beautiful rose. He bent down over it and inhaled its fragrance and said: &#x2018;Because of this rose I will save the whole orchard.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>Such was also the case with the world. Twenty-six generations after the creation of the world God saw that its conduct was bad and He decided to annihilate it. But among the thorns He saw a rose, the Jews, who accepted the ten commandments and for their sake He spared the whole world. <sup><xref rid="fn109">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The passage &#x201C;after God you shall follow&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah questioned and said: &#x201C;How can one imagine people following God who makes a way in the sea and a path in mighty waters? How can one cling to the Shechina which is made of fire and which is surrounded by a river of fire? This can only mean that one should imitate the deeds of God. When He created man He immediately planted a garden in Eden, where Adam was. For this reason the Jews were also commanded to plant trees when they came to Palestine.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn110">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah further said: &#x201C;Of three places in Palestine the Pagans cannot say that the Jews have taken them without paying: the cave of Machpelah, the Temple and the grave of Joseph. The Bible expressly states that Abraham bought the cave of Machpelah for four hundred silver shekels. The site of the temple was bought by David from the Jebusite for six hundred golden shekels and of the grave of Joseph it is said that Jacob bought a plot of land from the sons of Chamor for one hundred Kesitah. <sup><xref rid="fn111">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another prominent Hagadist was Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta. Rabbi Jose was known also as an authority in Halacha and he strove to eliminate the differences between the school of Shammai and the school of Hillel. He expressed a wish that his share in the life to come should be among those who eat three meals on the Sabbath, who praise God daily, who pray at sunrise, who die of intestinal trouble or on their way to fulfill a commandment, who greet the Sabbath in Tiberias and end it in Sephoris, who seat their pupils in the academy and do not let them stand, who are in charge of charities but not participate in their distribution so that no suspicion is directed against them. <sup><xref rid="fn112">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In their persecution of the Jews the Romans sought to prevent them from resting on the Sabbath. Rabbi Jose therefore said that &#x201C;he who observes the Sabbath joyfully, him will God give boundless rewards.&#x201D; Fasting was prohibited on Sabbath but the persecutions were such that people often had no opportunity to eat on that day and Rabbi Jose said: &#x201C;He who fasts on the Sabbath will be forgiven all the sins of his seventy years. Nevertheless he will also be punished for disobeying the commandment that one must enjoy himself on that day.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn113">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jose&#x2019;s opinions of prophecy was unusual. &#x201C;All the prophets,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;spoke they knew not what, for the spirit of prophecy spoke out of them and the prophets did not say that which they themselves wanted to say. The only ones who did know what they said were Moses and Isaiah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn114">27)</xref></sup> His appreciation of the greatness of God also expressed itself in his statement that were all the scholars of the world to attempt to create the smallest creature, they would not be able to inspire it with the breath of life. <sup><xref rid="fn115">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears that some Gentile scholars asked why God did not choose animals that would symbolize His greatness to be offered to Him as sacrifices. Rabbi Jose replied that God purposely chose the hunted and not the preying animals as sacrifices. The ox runs away from the lion; the goat flees the tiger; the sheep flees the wolf. God chose to honor the hunted animals in order to show his love for the weak. <sup><xref rid="fn116">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prayers had already supplanted sacrifices at that time and many people apparently ignored these in the belief that if prayers had been desired by God He would not have allowed the temple to be destroyed. Rabbi Jose then declared that God also prayed. He arrived at this conclusion from the verse of Isaiah &#x201C;I will make them joyful in my house of prayer&#x201D; (56:7). The use of the words &#x201C;my house of prayer&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;their house of prayer,&#x201D; Rabbi Jose held to be proof that God also prayed. <sup><xref rid="fn117">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;It sometimes occurs,&#x201D; Rabbi Jose said, &#x201C;that a man prays to God to help him because of his merit and God heeds his prayer because of the merit of others; or a man prays to be aided because of the merit of others and God aids him because of his own merit. Thus we find that Moses prayed to God to remember the merit of the fathers, but his wish was fulfilled because of his own merit. King Hezekiah prayed to God to aid him in his own merit, but God aided him because of the merit of king David.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn118">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another prominent Hagadist was Rabbi Simeon ben Jehozadak. Some are of the opinion that there were two persons of this name because the references of the Talmud to this man concern events which occurred over a period of several generations. We may be justified in assuming, however, that there was only one man of this name because the name Jehozadak is rare and appears only once in the Bible and in the Talmud. Any discrepancies that have arisen may be ascribed to errors of the copyists.</p>
<p>Two of his statements deal with the honor due to scholars and with the Torah which confers eternal life upon its followers. One of these states that &#x201C;any scholar who is not vengeful as a snake is not a scholar.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn119">32)</xref></sup> The other statement says: &#x201C;Every word which is quoted in the name of a scholar causes the lips of its author to move in the grave.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn120">33)</xref></sup> He also said: &#x201C;A letter may be omitted from the Torah if in this manner the name of God will be honored publicly. <sup><xref rid="fn121">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aside from the teachers of Hagada that were enumerated above there were other Amoraim who devoted themselves to it. Of these we will mention only one, Rabbi Berachiah, a disciple of Rabbi Simeon ben Gamliel. We can do no more than quote some of his interpretations which illustrate his mode of thought.</p>
<p>Of the creation of the world Rabbi Berachiah said: &#x201C;When God wanted to create man he foresaw that both good and wicked men would be descended from him. He then thought: &#x2018;If I will create man, he will have wicked descendants, but if I am not to create him how will there be just men?&#x2019; God then removed the ways of the wicked from his view and donning the &#x2018;measure of pity&#x2019; He created man.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn122">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>More interesting is Rabbi Berachiah&#x2019;s interpretation of the verse &#x201C;Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven&#x201D; (Psalms, 32:1). He said: &#x201C;Happy is he who can rise above sin and not that sin should rise above him.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn123">36)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud</title>
<p>T<small>HE LIFE OF THIS PROMINENT</small> &#x201C;A<small>MORA</small>&#x201D; consisted of an unbroken chain of misfortunes. His parents he did not know, for he became an orphan at his birth. His father died before Jochanan was born and his mother died in childbirth. <sup><xref rid="fn124">1)</xref></sup> When he came of age and married, Rabbi Jochanan became the father of ten sons all of whom died before him. Rabbi Jochanan then carried about the tooth of his tenth son who had died and he pointed out on all occasions that &#x201C;this is a bone of my dead tenth son.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn125">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The occupation of Rabbi Jochanan&#x2019;s father was hinted at when Rabbi Jochanan was called &#x201C;the son of the blacksmith.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn126">3)</xref></sup> Since his father died before his birth, Rabbi Jochanan lived with his grandfather who made him the pupil of Rabbi Simeon bar Elazar. <sup><xref rid="fn127">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan was gifted by nature with the highest physical and spiritual qualities. He possessed deep understanding exceeding that of others and he was renowned for his beauty. <sup><xref rid="fn128">5)</xref></sup> His diligence was also uncommon and love of the Torah filled his whole being. Only once did he forsake study of the Torah when a friend of his named Ilfa, who was older and probably also better educated than Rabbi Jochanan, suggested that they engage in business in partnership. However, this venture did not last long and Rabbi Jochanan soon realized that it was undesirable to leave the permanent values of the Torah for the transitory gains of commerce. He then parted with his friend Ilfa and returned to the academy. <sup><xref rid="fn129">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The years of Rabbi Jochanan&#x2019;s youth coincided with the period of the last Tanaim and he often told of how in his early youth he attended the academy of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah where he sat 17 rows behind Rav (Aba Arecha) and he listened to the debates between the two whose words flew like coals of fire, but which he could not understand because of his unripe age. <sup><xref rid="fn130">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Later Rabbi Jochanan was a pupil of Rabbi Jannai Raba, <sup><xref rid="fn131">8)</xref></sup> but he also attended the lectures of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama, <sup><xref rid="fn132">9)</xref></sup> and when he began to lecture in the academy of Rabbi Banaa, Rabbi Chanina pronounced a benediction and praised God that he had been allowed to see the fruit of his labor. <sup><xref rid="fn133">10)</xref></sup> But even after he already ranked among the scholars, Rabbi Jochanan still heeded the words of older scholars and for a period of thirteen years he often attended the lectures of Rabbi Oshaiah in Caesarea. <sup><xref rid="fn134">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the above we may conclude that Rabbi Jochanan was ready to learn from every one, but the foundation of his learning was the Mishna of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah. The Mishna he considered as his highest authority and he often repeated that &#x201C;I have nothing but the Mishna.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn135">12)</xref></sup> He considered every word of the Mishna to be holy and he believed that nothing could be added nor detracted from it. <sup><xref rid="fn136">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan weighed and analyzed every word in the Mishna just as other scholars did to the text of the Torah. Statements of earlier scholars were sacred in his eyes and he said: &#x201C;The hearts of earlier scholars were as wide as the gate of a palace&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn137">14)</xref></sup> and &#x201C;The least finger nail of an earlier scholar was of greater worth than the whole body of the later ones.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn138">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>His belief in the words of earlier scholars was unshakable and every one of their statements was sacred in his eyes. He delved in antiquities and no other Amora strived as hard as he did to retain for later generations all the old traditions and what they signified. He therefore said: &#x201C;Whatever is written in the Mishna has been commanded to Moses from Mount Sinai.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn139">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many customs of that time were considered by the other scholars to have been originated by the &#x201C;Soferim&#x201D; for various purposes and any man who broke one of these customs was merely said to have transgressed a Rabbinical commandment. But Rabbi Jochanan declared, that even such customs as those regulating the quantity of matter in questions pertaining to the prohibition of the use of certain articles <sup><xref rid="fn140">17)</xref></sup> or the customs of beating willow branches and pouring water during the feast of Succoth were laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai. <sup><xref rid="fn141">18)</xref></sup> Likewise he declared that the Biblical prohibition against eating the fruit of trees which only began to bear, was mandatory also outside of Palestine as a Mosaic law. <sup><xref rid="fn142">19)</xref></sup> It is also characteristic that he always spoke highly of the rabbinical commandments because of the fact that he considered all of these to partake of the same sacredness as the biblical commandments, <sup><xref rid="fn143">20)</xref></sup> and in this connection he said: &#x201C;The words of the scholars are very near to the words of the Torah and often they are even more loved by the people than the words of the Torah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn144">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aside from his great learning Rabbi Jochanan was also renowned for his moral qualities which were equalled only by few others. Because of his love for learning he despised wordly advantage and he preferred a life of suffering if only he would not be disturbed in the sacred work. From his father, or from his grandfather, he inherited a small field between Sephoris and Tiberias, and even this he sold in order to be free from mundane cares.</p>
<p>The death of his sons he suffered patiently and he found consolation in his studies. He was kind to all, even to his slave whom he gave meat to eat and wine to drink. When he was asked for the cause of such treatment of his slave he replied: &#x201C;The slave was born in the same manner that I was born.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn145">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But although he led a pious life he believed that for the welfare of the community, or even for that of an individual, it was permissible to depart from the strict letter of the law. It was thus related that weak from hunger he once ate food without ascertaining whether it was clean. Another time he ruled that it was permissible to desecrate the Sabbath to save the life of a sick man who would later live to observe many Sabbaths. <sup><xref rid="fn146">23)</xref></sup> He also appeared indifferent to the habit of the people of painting various images on the walls of their houses under the influence of their Greek neighbors, although this was against the injunction of the Bible not to make any graven images. <sup><xref rid="fn147">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He was likewise tolerant in his interpretation of Biblical passages. Thus he explained that the injunction not to let &#x201C;thy brother&#x2019;s ox or his sheep go astray&#x201D; (Deut. 22) applied even to the possessions of one who had renounced his Judaism. <sup><xref rid="fn148">25)</xref></sup> He also sought to modify the rule which forbade Jews to eat the flesh of an animal that was slaughtered by a Samaritan, if the slaughter was carried out in the presence of a Jew, who could testify that it had been performed according to law. It was then said that Rabbi Jochanan once ate of such flesh. <sup><xref rid="fn149">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Due to the difficult political and economic circumstances of the country, many sought to emigrate and to settle in the neighboring lands. In an attempt to stem the tide of emigration, the Talmudic teachers declared that any scholar who left the country to settle in a foreign land was to be excluded from their society. Rabbi Jochanan, on the other hand, was opposed to this measure. <sup><xref rid="fn150">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to his tolerance Rabbi Jochanan also preached patience toward sinners. This was especially true in the case of the relations with the Romans. The Romans showed contempt for the Jews and the latter repaid them with the same measure. Since the Romans ridiculed Jewish wisdom and learning, the Jews underestimated the value of the Gentile sciences. It was then that Rabbi Jochanan declared that God had granted a share of wisdom to the Gentile nations and it was therefore possible for them to say wise things. <sup><xref rid="fn151">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He shared the reverence of the other Amoraim for the scholars and he often said that they were the &#x201C;master builders&#x201D; of the world. <sup><xref rid="fn152">29-30)</xref></sup> He expressed a similar sentiment when he said that &#x201C;the Torah was like a fortress about the Jewish people and the scholars were its bastions. <sup><xref rid="fn153">31)</xref></sup> This was only true, he added, when a scholar served the Torah with all his might and renounced all worldly interests for the sake of spiritual interests, <sup><xref rid="fn154">32)</xref></sup> when he ignored all earthly gain, <sup><xref rid="fn155">33)</xref></sup> and when he did not desecrate the honor of the Torah by vain pride. <sup><xref rid="fn156">34)</xref></sup> Only one who possessed the above mentioned qualities could, in Rabbi Jochanan&#x2019;s opinion, be considered a &#x201C;master builder&#x201D; of the world and a worthy guardian of the Torah. Such a man could be compared to a myrtle which grows in the desert. <sup><xref rid="fn157">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>And when Rabbi Jochanan thought that he had not sufficiently stressed the worth of the Torah, he added that even a bastard, who according to law could not be admitted into a Jewish family till the tenth generation, even he, if he is a scholar, is a more important one than an ignorant High Priest. <sup><xref rid="fn158">36)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The contemporaries of Rabbi Jochanan also gave preference to the rich, and of this attitude he said: &#x201C;Not wealth nor noble descent are the measure of a man&#x2019;s worth, but only his knowledge of the Torah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn159">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patiently he suffered misfortune and without complaint he bore his poverty, but he could not brook opposition to his opinions and he could easily become an enemy to one who opposed him in these. While he was still in Sephoris, he could not tolerate the Amora Rabbi Chanina bar Chama who disagreed with him. When he realized that he would never convince Rabbi Chanina of his own correctness, he left Sephoris and settled in Tiberias. <sup><xref rid="fn160">38)</xref></sup> Rabbi Jochanan also clashed with his pupil Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath who refrained from quoting his name when he repeated his opinions. <sup><xref rid="fn161">39)</xref></sup> Rabbi Jochanan then said: &#x201C;Whatever Rabbi Elazar says he probably heard from me.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn162">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once Rabbi Elazar repeated a law which he had heard from Rabbi Chanina concerning the share of a first born son in the inheritance of his father. Rabbi Jochanan then remarked: &#x201C;It is strange that during all the years that I have sat at the feet of Rabbi Oshaia, I have not heard this law.&#x201D; In saying this he meant to hint that Rabbi Elazar quoted Rabbi Oshaia in order to lend weight to an opinion which was his own. To this Rabbi Elazar replied: &#x201C;Why is it strange? It is a common matter that one should hear something from his master which another has not heard.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn163">41)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But most characteristic of Rabbi Jochanan were his relations with his brother-in-law, Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish. Rabbi Simeon was a devoted friend of Rabbi Jochanan who often boasted that he introduced him into the mysteries of the Torah. Nevertheless he would tolerate no disagreement on his part and whenever Rabbi Simeon opposed him, Rabbi Jochanan complained that &#x201C;even the members of my own family are against me.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn164">42)</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, these shortcomings of Rabbi Jochanan were overlooked by the people who only saw his great achievements toward increasing the worth and the influence of the Torah and his own importance grew in their eyes as a result of his efforts. Rabbi Oshaia, who was probably the head of the academy of Tiberias, meanwhile died and Rabbi Jochanan succeeded to this office. Hosts of disciples then flocked to him and his name became known throughout the land, even to Babylonia.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan showed great reverence for the scholars of Babylonia and he was angered when he heard them slighted. His words were also held in great respect in that country and it was sufficient for him to inform them what the law was and his opinion was accepted. <sup><xref rid="fn165">43)</xref></sup> Rabbi Chisda was the only one in Babylonia who dared to disagree with Rabbi Jochanan and he declared that even if he were to receive instructions from Rabbi Jochanan he would disobey them. <sup><xref rid="fn166">44)</xref></sup> On another occasion, while disputing with a disciple of Rabbi Jochanan, he similarly remarked: &#x201C;Who heeds you or your master Rabbi Jochanan.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn167">45)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav (Aba Arecha) and Shmuel (Yarchinai) were at that time the heads of the academies in Babylonia. When Rabbi Jochanan addressed messages to that country, he always wrote to Rav whom he called &#x201C;our teacher in Babylonia,&#x201D; but after the death of Rav he refused to recognize Shmuel as an authority in legal matters, and in his letters to him, he addressed him as &#x201C;our friend in Babylonia.&#x201D; Shmuel was offended by this attitude and as proof of his authority in Halacha he sent to Rabbi Jochanan a calculation of the seasons and a calendar of leap years for sixty years. But Rabbi Jochanan said that one may be an expert in reckoning the seasons and yet not be an authority in Halacha. Shmuel then sent him &#x201C;thirteen camels&#x201D; (?) laden with questions pertaining to the laws of cleanliness and only then did Rabbi Jochanan exclaim: &#x201C;There is a teacher in Babylonia.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn168">46)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan found a staunch adherent in Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;sia I, the grandson of Rabbi Jehudah. He realized that the needs of his office as well as his personal benefit required such an attitude, and knowing of Rabbi Jochanan&#x2019;s sensitive nature in everything that touched his personal honor, the Nasi refrained from offending him in any manner. The Nasi also supported Rabbi Jochanan with the authority of his office and he provided for all his needs. <sup><xref rid="fn169">47)</xref></sup> The power of the Nasi was then still great enough to enable him to enforce his regulations with the aid of the government. This power greatly aided Rabbi Jochanan to put his religious regulations into effect.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan particularly strived to impress upon the people the significance of prayers which had been introduced some time before, but which apparently were neglected. Everybody realized that since the destruction of the temple prayers came to take the place of sacrifices. It therefore became necessary that a man of the authority of Rabbi Jochanan should establish the proper significance of prayers.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan then declared that &#x201C;he who wears phylacteries, pronounces the Shema and recites his prayers, is like one who has built an altar and has offered a sacrifice.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn170">48)</xref></sup> He also ruled that every man should pray in a place specially appointed for this purpose, <sup><xref rid="fn171">49)</xref></sup> for &#x201C;whoever establishes a special place where he recites his prayers, his enemies shall fall before his feet, and when a congregation prays together then it is a time when God is ready to fulfill the wishes of the supplicants.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn172">50)</xref></sup> When a man is told to be the messenger of the congregation, he is not told: &#x201C;Go and pray for us&#x0021;&#x201D;, but rather should he be told: &#x201C;Go and offer a sacrifice for us, pray for our needs and fight our battles&#x0021;&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn173">51)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have mentioned above that Rabbi Jochanan was a pupil of Rabbi Jehudah in his early youth. In his later years he paid tribute to his master by saying that he would never have reached his position as a scholar if he &#x201C;had not seen Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s finger portruding from under his mantle.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn174">52)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding Rabbi Johanan&#x2019;s birth there exists a legend that on a Day of Atonement a pregnant woman was seized with a great craving for food. Rabbi Jehudah was consulted and he suggested that the woman be reminded that it was the Day of Atonement. When this was done, her craving for food vanished and she completed her fast. This woman was said to be the mother of Rabbi Jochanan. <sup><xref rid="fn175">53)</xref> <xref rid="fn176">&#x002A;)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan was raised in the house of his grandfather and partly in the home of the Nasi who prophesied that he would some day be a teacher among Jews. <sup><xref rid="fn177">54)</xref></sup> He survived all his comrades and even the grandson of Rabbi Jehudah. Since he lived till the fourth generation of Amoraim, he witnessed the decline of the Nasi and the loss of his prestige.</p>
<p>It is told that whenever Rabbi Jochanan was immersed in his studies, he was not aware of what transpired about him. Thus he once sat before the synagogue in Sephoris engaged in his studies. A high Roman official happened to pass by, but Rabbi Jochanan did not notice him and did not accord him his due honors. The servants of the official were ready to attack Rabbi Jochanan, but the Roman prevented them from doing so, for he understood that it was not out of lack of respect that the honor was denied to him. <sup><xref rid="fn178">55)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan was a strong and stout man. <sup><xref rid="fn179">56)</xref></sup> As he was once ascending some stairs, supported by Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, the stairs caved in under his weight and his two disciples carried him up in their arms. The scholars then asked him: &#x201C;If you are so strong, why do you lean on others?&#x201D;, but Rabbi Jochanan replied: &#x201C;I must spare my strength for my old age.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn180">57)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But above all Rabbi Jochanan was gifted with great beauty. <sup><xref rid="fn181">58)</xref></sup> It was also remarkable that he was beardless and as he was once bathing in the river a passerby mistook him for a woman and waded after him into the water. <sup><xref rid="fn182">59)</xref></sup> The Talmud further relates that Rabbi Jochanan himself declared: &#x201C;I am the only one remaining of the beautiful men of Jerusalem,&#x201D; and when people spoke of his beauty, they said: &#x201C;If one would have some conception of the beauty of Rabbi Jochanan, he must take a silver beaker just out from the hands of the silversmith and fill it with red flowers, then he should surround it with a wreath of red roses and place it between the sun and the shade; the reflection of the beaker on the ground will then resemble the beauty of Rabbi Jochanan.&#x201D;</p>
<p>His diligence in his studies so weakened Rabbi Jochanan that he could not wear the phylacteries all day. During the winter he wore the phylacteries on arm and head, but during the summer, when his head felt weak, he merely wore the phylacteries of the arm. But in order that others should not copy his example, he explained to his disciples that it was only due to his weakness that he took these liberties. <sup><xref rid="fn183">59a)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of all the books of the Bible R. Jochanan preferred the book of Job and after each reading he exclaimed: &#x201C;Death is the end of man; slaughter is the end of animals; all that exists is doomed to die. Happy is he who was raised in the Torah and who devoted his efforts to it. Such a person brings joy to his Creator when his good name grows and when he leaves the world with a fair name.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn184">60)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have already noted Rabbi Jochanan&#x2019;s attitude toward prayer and his insistence that people should pray in congregations. To this he added that when God comes into a synagogue and does not find there a quorum of Jews (a &#x201C;minyan&#x201D; of ten) He is angered thereby. <sup><xref rid="fn185">61)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Every time that Rabbi Jochanan finished his prayers, he concluded with the following words: &#x201C;May it be Thy will, oh Lord our God, that You should see our shame and observe our plight and that You should don Your great mercy and cover Yourself with Your strength and wrap Yourself with Your righteousness and gird Yourself with Your forgiveness and may the measure of Your goodness and Your modesty come before You.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn186">62)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan is also said to have shown respect to every person and whenever he saw an old man he rose before him even if the man was of another faith, he would then say: &#x201C;So much suffering the man withstood and if in spite of all he lived to old age he deserves that honor be accorded to him.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn187">63)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But his attitude toward the scholars of Babylonia was contradictory. The political and economic situation of Palestine then resulted in the establishment of a Jewish center in Babylonia. The might of the Romans broke at the gates of Babylonia and the Jews enjoyed numerous liberties in that country. When young men came from Babylonia to study in the academy of Rabbi Jochanan, he befriended them, but nevertheless he sometimes allowed himself to make fun of them. When asked why he did so, Rabbi Jochanan replied: &#x201C;The prophet Hosea allowed himself to mock the Jews of the foreign lands when he said that they are despised in the eyes of God who exiled them to foreign lands for their disobedience. Then why should I not allow myself the same?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn188">64)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But Rabbi Jochanan&#x2019;s mockery was good natured in character. This, for instance, was the case when he was explaining some passages to one of his pupils, but he realized that the latter did not understand what he was told. He then asked him: &#x201C;What is the cause of your lack of understanding of that which I tell you?&#x201D; The pupil replied: &#x201C;It is because I am exiled from my home.&#x201D; &#x201C;And where is your home?&#x201D; Rabbi Jochanan further asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In Bursif,&#x201D; the pupil replied.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, in Bulsif&#x0021;&#x201D; Rabbi Jochanan mocked his pronounciation, for the Babylonians pronounced the letter r with difficulty.</p>
<p>Another time he remarked to his pupil Rabbi Chiya bar Aba: &#x201C;How could you become interested in learning in Babylonia, where you were always busy eating dates?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn189">65)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the same subject he also said: &#x201C;Even if all the Jews had returned from Babylonia together with Ezra, the Shechinah would still not have rested on the second temple, for the Babylonian Jews suffered from the Biblical curse that God would give them a heart full of unrest which would not calm even with their coming to Palestine.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn190">66)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But Rabbi Jochanan also had kind words to say of Babylonia. Thus he explained the name Babylonia to mean &#x201C;varied&#x201D; or &#x201C;confused&#x201D; and he pointed out that the Jews of Babylonia engaged in the study of all branches of the Torah such as Scriptures, Mishna and Gemara. <sup><xref rid="fn191">67)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ofttimes he would also say: &#x201C;Why did God choose to exile the Jews to Babylonia? This may be compared to a man who is angered with his wife and sends her away from his house; he then sends her to her mother&#x2019;s house. God did likewise with the Jews; He exiled them to the land whence their mothers came.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn192">68)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The political situation of that time is mirrored in the sayings of Rabbi Jochanan. Whenever the scholars wanted to discuss this problem they generally did so by speaking of the times of the coming of Messiah. When we analyze their discources we can obtain a clear picture of the events of that time. These discourses also served to revive the courage of the people in the face of their misfortunes which were explained to be the &#x201C;pains of Messiah&#x201D; preceding the redemption. We thus possess hundreds of statements by Rabbi Jochanan from which we may learn of the conditions of his time and also his philosophy of life which is of worth for all times.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the generation that will mark the coming of Messiah,&#x201D; Rabbi Jochanan said, &#x201C;scholars will diminish and all men will sigh with sorrow. There will be many misfortunes and numerous evil decrees will be promulgated daily; before one decree will be enforced, another one will be enacted.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn193">69)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Jochanan was telling the story of Jacob who was waiting for Esau and who meanwhile prayed to God: &#x201C;Spare me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau,&#x201D; he remarked: &#x201C;Such is the way of an evil kingdom when it desires to seize the property of men; it appoints one to be an overseer and another to be tax collector. All this is done in order to take away from the people that which they possess.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn194">70)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also related that Rabbi Jochanan never smiled and that he was always sorrowing. He declared: &#x201C;One must never laugh as long as the Jews are in exile and the promise that the Gentile nations will see the miracles that have been performed for the Jews has not yet been fulfilled.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn195">71)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have already written concerning his reverence for the Torah. In this category belong his statements that &#x201C;the Torah clings to that person who in his modesty acts as if he did not exist at all,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn196">72)</xref></sup> and &#x201C;if one has learned much but does not observe the commandments, it would have been better had he not been born.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn197">73)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Out of reverence for the Torah,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;it is a shame for a scholar to go about in patched shoes and it is a sin punishable by death for a scholar to go about in a spotted garment.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn198">74)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The praise which he expressed for prayer in congregations, he somewhat modified in his old age when due to weakness he often wore only the phylacteries of the arm and he said: &#x201C;Whoever prays at home is like one who has surrounded his prayer with an iron wall.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn199">75)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan had ten sons and all of them died during his lifetime. In order to console him one of the scholars said that he who buries his sons during his lifetime, God will forgive his sins. But Rabbi Jochanan denied this and said that &#x201C;sickness and the death of children are not a punishment which God visits upon a person out of love, <sup><xref rid="fn200">76)</xref></sup> but rather is it true that &#x201C;he who leaves no sons to inherit him, has incurred God&#x2019;s anger.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn201">77)</xref></sup> He believed instead that exile, rightlessness, the hardships of wandering and restlessness are conditions that forgive man&#x2019;s sins. <sup><xref rid="fn202">78)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Various authorities of his time forbade the writing down of the Talmudic legends, but Rabbi Jochanan declared that one who studies the legends out of a book will not forget it so readily. <sup><xref rid="fn203">79)</xref></sup> Another time he came out against writing down the &#x201C;Halacha&#x201D; (the law) and said that &#x201C;whoever writes down the laws is like one who has burned the Torah and he who studies law from a book will receive no reward.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn204">80)</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the numerous clashes between the Romans and the Parthians who ruled in Babylonia, Rabbi Jochanan always hoped for the victory of the Parthians and he often repeated the statement that was credited to Rabbi Jehudah that the Romans would in the end be vanquished by the Parthians. <xref rid="fn205">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>This statement he further amplified by reasoning as follows: &#x201C;If the first temple that was built by Jews and was destroyed by the Chaldeans, caused the Chaldeans to be conquered by the Persians; the second temple that was built by Persians and destroyed by Romans, would certainly cause the Romans to be conquered by the Persians.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rav (Aba Arecha), on the other hand, looked forward to a victory of the Romans. But the hopes of neither came to pass, for the Persian &#x201C;Chabarim&#x201D; (Zoroastrians) meanwhile took over the government of Babylonia. When Rabbi Jochanan heard of this he felt disappointed in all his hopes. <sup><xref rid="fn206">81)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A period of turbulence and upheaval at that time affected all the countries wherein Jews lived. After the death of Alexander Severus, Rome underwent a period of unrest and emperors changed rapidly. In Babylonia a prince of the house of Sassan, named Ardeshir (or Artachshaster) revolted against Artaban, the last of the Parthian dynasty. The struggle in Babylonia was more of a religious nature. Artaban was favorably inclined to the Greek form of worship which penetrated the country and the population revolted against the innovation. The rebel Artachshaster therefore easily overcame the ruling king and established a new dynasty in place of the old one which had ruled the country for 466 years.</p>
<p>The new rulers of Babylonia, historically known as the Sassanides, are referred to in Jewish writings as &#x201C;Chabarim.&#x201D; These were worshippers of fire and they believed in a dual deity of light and darkness. Zealously they persecuted all those who refused their teachings and they were especially vengeful toward the Greeks and Christians. The Jews also met with suffering but they were not persecuted with such fury as were the Greeks and Christians. The latter were offered a choice between acceptance of the law of Zoroaster or emigration. Those who stubbornly clung to their beliefs were executed.</p>
<p>Jews were deprived of the right to judge in cases affecting life and as long as they remained neutral to the dominant religion they were tolerated in a measure. This attitude was not a result of kindness but was rather due to the fact that the Jews offered a great resistance to the &#x201C;Chabarim.&#x201D; Since they lived in Babylonia in compact masses it was difficult to subdue them.</p>
<p>The affliction of the Jews under the rule of the &#x201C;Chabarim&#x201D; could nevertheless easily compare with their plight under the Romans. They remained undisturbed in their religious life only so long as they did not use fire for any purpose. When they lit candles on the eve of Sabbath or on Chanukah these had to be hidden and any person that was caught keeping fire in his house was condemned to death.</p>
<p>The Jews of Palestine then felt that their plight was incomparable and the Jews of Babylonia were convinced that the conditions in Palestine were more favorable. When the news of these developments reached Palestine, the Jews of that country began to say that the Romans were honorable men even in their oppression while the &#x201C;Chabarim&#x201D; were no more than barbarians.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Jochanan became convinced that no help could come from Babylonia he began to look forward to aid from Tiberias which was the last home of the Sanhedrin. <sup><xref rid="fn207">82)</xref></sup> In order to encourage the people and to persuade them to remain in the country he declared that God said: &#x201C;I cannot enter the heavenly Jerusalem until I have come to Jerusalem on earth,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn208">83)</xref></sup> or &#x201C;he who walks four ells in Palestine is certain of his share in life to come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn209">84)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time he said: &#x201C;What good deeds had Omri, king of Israel, done that he merited the crown? It was because he added a city, Samaria, to the kingdom of Israel.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn210">85)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of the old age of Rabbi Jochanan it is told that for a period of three and a half years he did not come to the academy out of grief for his brother-in-law who had died. <sup><xref rid="fn211">86)</xref></sup> When he realized that his death was approaching he instructed those that were to bury him that he be interred in a shroud which was neither black nor white. For if he be buried in a black shroud he may, at the resurrection, come to life among just men and he would be put to shame. Likewise if he be buried in a white shroud, he may come to life among wicked men and he would be shamed by his garment of a just man. <sup><xref rid="fn212">87)</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to tradition Rabbi Jochanan lived to a ripe old age. The &#x201C;Chronicle&#x201D; of Rav Sherira Gaon declares that he survived Rabbi Jehudah HaNasi by 68 years and that he died in the year 279. (C.E.)</p>
<p>Aside from the statements of Rabbi Jochanan that we have quoted so far in connection with various moments of his life there also exist many expressions of his that are concerned with the interpretation of passages of the Bible. Although most of these are of value only in exposition, some of them contain important philosophic observations concerning the conduct of men and the ways of the world.</p>
<p>At a certain period of Rabbi Jochanan&#x2019;s life it was forbidden to the Jews to determine the month through lunar observation and the Romans were especially strict in preventing them from celebrating their holidays. At the same time the observance of the Sabbath was not interfered with. Under the influence of Rabbi Jochanan the court in Tiberias therefore decided to observe the Day of Atonement on a Sabbath, although it really occurred on a week day, in order to deceive the Romans. The exact date of this occurrence is unknown as is also the duration of this decree. We can only guess under what administration this took place, for we only find hints about this event. <sup><xref rid="fn213">88)</xref></sup> Historians are therefore confused as to the exact date and also as to the motive which prompted Rabbi Jochanan to instruct even the Jews of Babylonia to observe the Day of Atonement on a Sabbath, although the latter were not under the rule of the Romans and could have celebrated the Day of Atonement in its proper time. We find an explanation of this hinted in the statement of Rabbi Jochanan who said that the angels gather about God and ask him: &#x201C;When is the New Year and when is the Day of Atonement?&#x201D; and God answers them: &#x201C;Why do you ask me? Let us go to the Court on earth and we will find out.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn214">89)</xref></sup> By this statement he meant to imply that the court in Tiberias had the complete right to determine holidays as it saw fit under the circumstances.</p>
<p>The following is a similar statement concerning the determination of holidays: If the court had said that today is New Year then God says to the angels: &#x201C;Erect a platform and let the prosecutor and the defense appear before me, for my children have said that today is New Year and so it shall be.&#x201D; If the Court decided to postpone the New Year till the following day, then God says to the angels: &#x201C;Take this platform away and remove the prosecutor and the defense for my children have postponed the New Year till the following day and so it shall be.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan was always poor even when he headed the academy and when he received assistance from the Nasi. He then said: &#x201C;When one depends on the charity of men, the color of his face changes to pale and blue.&#x201D; In general we may assume that it was very difficult to earn a livelihood at that time from his statement that &#x201C;It is difficult to earn a livelihood, twice as difficult as the pains of a woman in childbirth, more difficult than the arrival of the redemption.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn215">90)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears that it was customary at that time for the people of a city to do the work of the scholars that resided there. When Rabbi Jochanan was asked how great a scholar one must be, to deserve such a service from his townsmen, he replied: &#x201C;Only a scholar who renounces all worldly occupations and devotes himself solely to heavenly matters deserves this service; but the obligation rests on the people only to provide him with his daily bread but not with luxuries.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn216">91)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan therefore added: &#x201C;One should eat an onion and sit in the shade and not eat geese and hens that his heart should not lust after such food.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn217">92)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are grounds to assume that he also believed in hypnotism and in the ability of a person to convince himself that he was in a healthy or a sickly state. Thus it is told that when Rabbi Chama bar Aba fell sick Rabbi Jochanan came to visit him and asked him: &#x201C;Do you accept your suffering with love?&#x201D;, by which he meant that suffering atones for the sins of man who enters the world to come purified of wrong doing. But the sick man replied: &#x201C;I do not want the suffering nor its reward.&#x201D; &#x201C;Then give me your hand,&#x201D; Rabbi Jochanan said. Rabbi Chama gave him his hand and he was healed.</p>
<p>Another version of this story relates that Rabbi Jochanan came to visit Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath who fell sick and he found him lying in a dark room. Rabbi Jochanan then bared his arm which illuminated the room and he saw that Rabbi Elazar was weeping. &#x201C;What is the cause of your weeping?&#x201D; he asked. &#x201C;Is it because you have not studied as much as you had wanted to? We have a rule that it is all the same whether one studies much or little and that only the good intention counts. Do you weep because you cannot earn your livelihood? One cannot deserve two tables, the table of the Torah and the table of worldly goods. Do you weep that you leave no son? Then look at me that I carry a bone of my tenth son.&#x201D;</p>
<p>To this Rabbi Elazar replied: &#x201C;I weep because I am reminded that beauty such as yours will rot in the ground.&#x201D; &#x201C;For this one should weep,&#x201D; Rabbi Jochanan responded, and they both wept. <sup><xref rid="fn218">93)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Still another form of this story is told concerning Rabbi Jochanan and Rabbi Chanina. <sup><xref rid="fn219">94)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan was punished by becoming afflicted with a disease for three and a half years. Rabbi Chanina came to visit him and said: &#x201C;What do you ail from?&#x201D;, to which the other replied: &#x201C;It is more than I can bear.&#x201D; &#x201C;You must not say so,&#x201D; Rabbi Chanina answered, &#x201C;you should rather say that God is just.&#x201D; It is further related that when Rabbi Jochanan&#x2019;s pains increased, Rabbi Chanina pronounced an incantation and the pain ceased. We may conclude from this Midrash that Rabbi Jochanan believed in incantations.</p>
<p>It must be remarked, however, that this matter is not entirely clear, for Rabbi Akiba had already declared that &#x201C;one who attempts to heal a wound with incantations loses his share in the life to come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn220">95)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When people wondered that a man like Rabbi Jochanan, who lived in poverty and who devoted all his energies to study, nevertheless retained good health, he said: &#x201C;My father comes from a healthy family and I can do without meat, but under present conditions it is best that any man who has money should immediately spend it and buy meat.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn221">96)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We may add the following statements of Rabbi Jochanan to illustrate his great love for the Torah:</p>
<p>One who has many pupils but does not allow them to serve him is as if he had denied them his kindness, <sup><xref rid="fn222">97)</xref></sup> for serving the Torah is often more important than study itself. <sup><xref rid="fn223">98)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Jews devote themselves to the Torah and to charity, their evil natures are under their control and not they under control of their evil natures. <sup><xref rid="fn224">99)</xref></sup> Study is of such importance that one who engages in it in this world is conducted into the academies of Shem and Eber, of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, of Moses and of Aaron, in the world to come. <sup><xref rid="fn225">100)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Three types of people are so rare that when they occur God speaks of them and He also wishes that people should note their qualities. The first is an unmarried man who lives in a great city and does not sin; the second is a poor man who returns what he finds to its owner; the third is a rich man who offers the tithes of his fruit so that no one should know of it. <sup><xref rid="fn226">101)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are three types of attractions: One is the attraction of a place in the eyes of its inhabitants; another is the attraction of a woman in the eyes of her husband; the third is the attraction of something bought in the eyes of its buyer. <sup><xref rid="fn227">102)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan attached great importance to repentance and he said that &#x201C;whoever believes that king Menasseh, the son of Hezekiah, has no share in the world to come, weakens the hands of penitents by making them believe that repentance is of no avail.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn228">103)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following are among the other interesting statements of Rabbi Jochanan:</p>
<p>Great is the day when God will gather the exiled Jews&#x2014;as great as the day on which He created heaven and earth. <sup><xref rid="fn229">104)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Deception with words is even worse than deception in money matters. <sup><xref rid="fn230">105)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prophets spoke only for those who give their daughter in marriage to a scholar, or who conduct the business of a scholar or who share their wealth with scholars. <sup><xref rid="fn231">106)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The observance of six types of commandments rewards men in this world while the principal of the good deed is rewarded in the world to come. These commandments are: hospitality to strangers, visiting the sick, careful prayer, rising early to go to the academy, raising children to the knowledge of the Torah and judging everyone according to his good deeds. <sup><xref rid="fn232">107)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Jochanan died, Rabbi Yitzchak ben Elazar eulogized him in the following words: &#x201C;This day is as difficult for the Jews as if the sun had suddenly set at midday.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn233">108)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan was called the &#x201C;Editor of the Jerusalem Talmud.&#x201D; This does not imply that he gathered and edited all the statements and opinions which we find in it, but rather that he conceived the idea that since Jewish life expanded to such a great extent, the Mishna was no longer sufficient and that it was necessary to gather everything which the scholars said in comment on the Mishna. This became the foundation for the Jerusalem Talmud.</p>

<title>RABBI SIMEON ben LAKISH</title>
<p>T<small>HE ACADEMY OF</small> R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>OCHANAN</small> was open for all those who sought learning. Men of two generations prided themselves on being disciples of Rabbi Jochanan. Among these there were some who saw and heard Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi, but themselves remained disciples while he grew in stature to become one of the most outstanding Amoraim. Among his disciples there were also some who themselves headed academies, but who came to the academy of Rabbi Jochanan in Tiberias as often as they could in order to be able to call themselves his disciples although their circumstances did not compel them to do so.</p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish was one of the most prominent of these colleagues and disciples of Rabbi Jochanan. In the Talmud he is more commonly referred to as Resh Lakish. <xref rid="fn234">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Very little is known definitely of the youth of Resh Lakish and numerous terrifying legends surround his early years. It was said that he befriended robbers and that he was a robber himself. While going about the banks of the Jordan armed from head to foot, he saw a woman bathing and he entered the water. But the figure which he saw bathing was not a woman. Instead it was Rabbi Jochanan who remarked to him that such unusual strength as he seemed to possess should rightfully be devoted to the Torah. Resh Lakish replied: &#x201C;Such beauty as you possess, should belong to a woman.&#x201D; Rabbi Jochanan is said to have told him: &#x201C;If you will turn to learning, I will give you my sister, who is more beautiful than I am, for a wife.&#x201D; Resh Lakish then promised to give up his occupation and to turn to learning and he married the sister of Rabbi Jochanan. <sup><xref rid="fn235">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The legend is highly questionable and does not agree with other accounts of the youth of Resh Lakish. Thus it was accepted as a fact that in his youth he was a companion of Rabbi Jochanan in the academy of Rabbi Jehudah which would make any such error as the legend ascribes to him out of the question. Nor is there any mention anywhere as to who the teacher of Resh Lakish had been, for although he attended the academy of Rabbi Jehudah together with Rabbi Jochanan, they were both very young at that time and could not have been direct pupils of Rabbi Jehudah, although in later life they both declared that were it not for their contact with Rabbi Jehudah, they would not have attained their status as scholars. <sup><xref rid="fn236">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears that both, Resh Lakish and Rabbi Jochanan, attained prominence rapidly, but Resh Lakish continued to be considered a disciple of the latter despite the fact that his importance was great enough, so that problems were brought to him for decision in the absence of Rabbi Ephes who was a disciple and a member of the household of the Nasi. <sup><xref rid="fn237">3)</xref></sup> In scholarship, however, the two were considered to be of the same rank by the Nasi and by Rabbi Hoshaia Raba. <sup><xref rid="fn238">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the academy of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama it was customary for Rabbi Chanina to begin a lecture and for Resh Lakish and Rabbi Jochanan to finish it. <sup><xref rid="fn239">5)</xref></sup> Resh Lakish was also held in great esteem at the court of Rabbi Hoshaia Raba, <sup><xref rid="fn240">6)</xref></sup> and he called Rabbi Hoshaia &#x201C;the father of the Mishna.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn241">7)</xref></sup> Resh Lakish was also a friend of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, whom he quoted on numerous occasions. All this would indicate that Resh Lakish and Rabbi Jochanan were friends since youth. They were both considered as equals and were referred to as &#x201C;the two great men of the world.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn242">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some scholars considered Resh Lakish to be superior to Rabbi Jochanan in the use of clear logic. Ula, one of his pupils, declared: &#x201C;He who sees Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish expounding in the academy, will imagine that he sees a man uprooting mountains and crushing them one against another.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn243">9)</xref></sup> Rabbi Jochanan likewise said: &#x201C;Whenever Resh Lakish is absent from the academy I feel as if I lacked my right hand.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn244">10)</xref></sup> Resh Lakish was not an ordinary disciple who assents to all that is said. On the contrary, he frequently raised doubts concerning opinions that were expressed and Rabbi Jochanan complained that Resh Lakish would ask 24 (&#x0021;) questions in every matter and that he had to search for replies to all these questions. <sup><xref rid="fn245">11)</xref></sup> It is also remarkable that the questions of Resh Lakish were often of such penetrating keenness that Rabbi Jochanan was compelled to change his previous opinion, <sup><xref rid="fn246">12)</xref></sup> and in at least one instance, when the question of &#x201C;Eruvin&#x201D; was being discussed, the opinion of Resh Lakish prevailed. <sup><xref rid="fn247">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Resh Lakish based all of his opinions on the Mishna and he rarely employed arguments which were not substantiated by the Mishna. <sup><xref rid="fn248">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish was known for his honesty in worldly matters, and any person with whom he had dealings was considered to be as honest as himself and to be trusted unquestioningly. <sup><xref rid="fn249">15)</xref></sup> In his loyalty to his friends he was ready for self-sacrifice and it was told that when Rabbi Isi was captured by bandits, Resh Lakish hastened to save him, saying that he must do so even if his own life were endangered. <sup><xref rid="fn250">16)</xref></sup> His diligence was incomparable and he was said to study every subject forty times. <sup><xref rid="fn251">17)</xref></sup> He boasted himself that even Rabbi Chiya bar Aba was not more diligent than he was. <sup><xref rid="fn252">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But despite all these qualities he never attained the headship of an academy and he always remained a disciple of Rabbi Jochanan. When differences of opinion occurred the matter was always decided according to Rabbi Jochanan with the exception of three cases concerning &#x201C;Halitza&#x201D; which the Babylonian scholars decided according to Resh Lakish, but this was due to the fact that there was no dissenting opinion from Rabbi Jochanan. <sup><xref rid="fn253">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Resh Lakish was not a reserved man, and when it seemed to him that not enough attention was paid to his words, he would shout in a loud voice. <sup><xref rid="fn254">20)</xref></sup> He also did not restrain himself from passing judgment when he saw wrong and he did not spare his colleagues, nor even the Nasi, in this respect. <sup><xref rid="fn255">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sometimes it happened that Rabbi Jochanan expressed an opinion in a matter of law and Rabbi Janai Raba praised him for it; Resh Lakish then ironically remarked that Rabbi Jochanan&#x2019;s words were incorrect. <sup><xref rid="fn256">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Much time and energy was devoted by the scholars in gathering the &#x201C;Baraithoth&#x201D; (the tannait traditions not incorporated in the Mishna), and it was even attempted to lend to these the authority of law. Resh Lakish opposed this tendency and refused to recognize the authorship of those &#x201C;Baraithoth.&#x201D; He therefore ruled that every Mishna which had not been studied by a group of scholars should not be depended upon. <sup><xref rid="fn257">23)</xref></sup> In this respect he would not even listen to Rabbi Jochanan and he refused to accept any new &#x201C;Baraitha,&#x201D; saying that it was not needed and that Rabbi Jehudah had left a complete Mishna. <sup><xref rid="fn258">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of these habits, Resh Lakish was disliked by his contemporaries who looked upon him as a trouble maker. <sup><xref rid="fn259">25)</xref></sup> Thus he was the first to declare that the events related in the book of Job were imaginary, that there never was a man named Job nor ever will be, and that the whole book was but intended to teach people moral principles. <sup><xref rid="fn260">26)</xref></sup> <xref rid="fn261">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Another time he declared that the Jews borrowed the names of the angels from the Babylonians because until the time of the Prophets who lived in Babylonia the Bible spoke of angels without mentioning names. <sup><xref rid="fn262">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reason why Resh Lakish never came to head an academy either in Tiberias or in any other city despite the fact that he was considered worthy for such a post is explained by the fact of his past, when he interrupted his scholarly career and followed ways not befitting a scholar. Like Rabbi Jochanan who left the academy for a short time to engage in commerce Resh Lakish also abandoned his studies for a time but not to engage in commerce. Instead he became a gladiator. <sup><xref rid="fn263">28)</xref></sup> <xref rid="fn264">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Another time Resh Lakish hired out as a garden watchman. Because of his unusual strength and his ability to deal with animals, he was trusted to be able to drive away any marauders. But it is further told that thieves once came to that garden and took as much fruit as they could carry and Resh Lakish did not seize them and bring them to court; instead he argued with them and threatened them with excommunication. <sup><xref rid="fn265">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once Rabbi Jochanan was robbed of all his possessions and when Resh Lakish came to the academy and asked him something, he did not reply. Resh Lakish inquired for the cause of his silence and the latter replied: &#x201C;My heart is with the wealth that the robbers have taken away from me.&#x201D; Resh Lakish then pursued the robbers and retrieved the stolen wealth.</p>
<p>Because of these stories there were rumors that Resh Lakish associated with robbers. The truth of the matter was that because of his poverty, for he had no income from his scholastic endeavors, he sometimes hired out as a gladiator and at other times as a watchman, but he is not known to have done any harm and even the robbers against whom he was supposed to protect he merely threatened with excommunication and not with that punishment which they deserved. Rabbi Jochanan brought Resh Lakish back to the Torah, as we have previously related, but even after he abandoned his earlier calling, the people continued to remember it. When Rabbi Jochanan was called upon to answer a question pertaining to knives and how they are contaminated, Resh Lakish found the correct answer and Rabbi Jochanan remarked: &#x201C;A robber understands in matters of his trade.&#x201D; He said this although Resh Lakish was then already his brother-in-law and was held to be his equal in learning.</p>
<p>Like Rabbi Jochanan Resh Lakish also disliked the Babylonians who prided themselves on the fact that, when the Jews returned from Babylonia to Palestine, only the poorer families left while the more aristocratic remained behind. To this Resh Lakish remarked: &#x201C;If someone told me that there are genealogies of the families in Babylonia I would go and bring them, but even if all the scholars gathered for this purpose they could not bring them thence.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn266">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On another occasion he chided the Babylonian Jews for remaining in an unclean land and not returning to Palestine with Ezra. Speaking with Raba bar Bar Chana he said: &#x201C;God is displeased with you, people of Babylonia, that you did not come to Palestine in great masses at the time of Ezra.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn267">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless he sometimes also praised the Babylonians and said: &#x201C;When the Torah was forgotten among Jews, Ezra came out of Babylonia and re-established it anew; later Hillel the Babylonian came and revived it and when it was forgotten for the third time there came Rabbi Chiya and his sons and they re-established it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn268">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>More than all other Amoraim Resh Lakish revered Rabbi Chiya. He is said to have fasted three hundred fasts in order to see Rabbi Chiya in his dream but to no avail. <sup><xref rid="fn269">33)</xref></sup> When he complained about this and said: &#x201C;Have I not studied as much Torah as he did?&#x201D;, a Bath-Kol replied: &#x201C;You have studied as much Torah as he did, but you did not aid in the spread of the Torah as much as he did.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn270">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The grandson of Rabbi Jehudah, who was then Nasi, disapproved of the privileges of the scholars and he demanded that they should also bear the burden of taxation and that they should share in the expenses of strengthening the gates of the city and of paying the city watchmen. Resh Lakish protested against this demand which would place the scholars on the same level as the rest of the population especially since it was an old custom to liberate scholars from the burden of taxes.</p>
<p>To the other differences of opinion that existed between Rabbi Jochanan and Resh Lakish, we may add the following: When Rabbi Jochanan declared that &#x201C;the least finger nail of the scholars of old was worth more than the whole bodies of those of today,&#x201D; Resh Lakish replied: &#x201C;On the contrary, the worth of the scholars of today is greater, for they devote themselves to the Torah and they ignore the persecution of the government.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn271">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have already mentioned that the final altercation between the two occurred in the question of the contamination of knives, when Rabbi Jochanan exclaimed to Resh Lakish that &#x201C;your business involved knives and therefore you understand their nature.&#x201D; It is remarkable that Resh Lakish was never offended by references to his old occupation. Frequently he even spoke of it himself and he often introduced his remarks by comparing the situation in question to &#x201C;two athletes.&#x201D; It is also told that on one occasion he witnessed a public performance where the people ate and drank and danced and, aroused by past memories of his career, he participated in the gaiety. <sup><xref rid="fn272">36)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time he was asked whether it was permissible to drink water that had remained uncovered, for fear that a snake might have drunk of it and thus have poisoned it. He did not reply directly to this question, but instead he said: &#x201C;When one sells himself to the gladiators he does so for a high price because he will have to risk his life. Will you sell your life so cheaply?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn273">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the final remark of Rabbi Jochanan offended Resh Lakish to such an extent that he fell sick from worrying and he died soon after. Of this last clash between the two it was further related that Rabbi Jochanan said to Resh Lakish: &#x201C;Are you not glad that I have brought you under the wings of the Torah?&#x201D; and Resh Lakish replied: &#x201C;What good has it done me? There I was called Rabbi (master) and here I am called Rabbi.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Resh Lakish was sick, his wife ran to Rabbi Jochanan and implored him to save his life, but Rabbi Jochanan remained stubborn until the death of Resh Lakish. Afterward he was greatly troubled by his conscience; the &#x201C;right hand&#x201D; of his learning was lacking. The scholars then gathered and said: &#x201C;Who will go to console Rabbi Jochanan?&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath volunteered and as he sat before Rabbi Jochanan, he remarked to every one of his statements: &#x201C;There is a Rabbinical saying which can substantiate your words.&#x201D; But Rabbi Jochanan was annoyed at this and said: &#x201C;Do you think to take the place of Resh Lakish? Ben Lakish asked 24 questions to every statement that I made and I had to find 24 answers to them. The law was thereby clarified. But you merely say that there is a Rabbinical saying which substantiates my words, as if I did not know that myself.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn274">38)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many of the expressions of Resh Lakish contain truths which are of permanent validity. Thus he said: &#x201C;He who mocks others will be doomed to Gehenna&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn275">39)</xref></sup> or &#x201C;If one is angry, even though he be a scholar, his learning will depart from him, and if he be a prophet, the spirit of prophesy will abandon him.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn276">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Nasi once appealed to Resh Lakish saying: &#x201C;Pray to God for me, for the government mistreats me&#x201D; and Resh Lakish replied: &#x201C;If you will take nothing from others, you will have to give away nothing that is yours.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn277">41)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;He who slanders his neighbors,&#x201D; Resh Lakish continued, &#x201C;his sin reaches to heaven and the verse &#x2018;Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment and a babbler is no better&#x2019; implies that just as no enchantment can cure the bite of a serpent even such is the harm done by a slanderer. When Messiah will come all the animals will gather and will say to the serpent: &#x2018;If a lion kills his prey, he devours it; a wolf eats that which he has killed, but what pleasure does a snake derive from its bite?&#x2019; The snake will then answer: &#x2018;What pleasure has man out of a gossiping tongue?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn278">42)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Resh Lakish said: &#x201C;He who raises his hand against his neighbor, even though he did not strike him, he deserves to be called a wicked man, <sup><xref rid="fn279">43)</xref></sup> and he who suspects his neighbor in vain will be punished in that he will do that which he suspected the other of doing.&#x201D; A similar event occurred to Moses, when God commanded him to go to announce to the Jews that He would redeem them from the bondage of Egypt. Moses then said: &#x2018;How can I say this and they will not believe me?&#x2019; God thereupon said to Moses: &#x2018;Jews are a trusting people.&#x2019; And when Moses came and spoke to the Jews they believed him. Jews are also descended from believers, for when God said to Abraham, who was then childless, that his children would be like the stars in the sky, he believed Him. Only Moses doubted the word of God when He commanded him to speak to the stone and instead he smote it with his cane. <sup><xref rid="fn280">44)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Repentance&#x2014;Resh Lakish believed&#x2014;ranked above all, for one who repents is forgiven even such sins which he committed purposely and they come to be considered as errors. For a penitent they are sometimes even reckoned as good deeds. <sup><xref rid="fn281">45)</xref></sup> Since everybody knew of his trust in repentance it was related that on the day of his death, two robbers, onetime friends of his, died and their share in the life to come was granted to Resh Lakish. <sup><xref rid="fn282">46)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Resh Lakish continued, sinners are so hardened in their wrong doing that even at the gates of death they do not think of repentance. <sup><xref rid="fn283">47)</xref></sup> And when one wants to point out the shortcomings of another, he should be told: &#x201C;Adorn yourself first and then you will adorn others.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn284">48)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concerning judges and courts, Resh Lakish declared that &#x201C;one should only heed the judges of his own generation,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn285">49)</xref></sup> and &#x201C;he who appoints an unworthy judge is like a man who plants a tree that Jews might worship idols under it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn286">50)</xref></sup> &#x201C;When a court has to pass sentence it must consider small matters of the same importance as great ones.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn287">51)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On another occasion Resh Lakish said: &#x201C;He who is merciful when he should be harsh, will in the end be harsh when he should be merciful.&#x201D; Thus we find that king Saul was merciful to the Amalekites and later he ordered the annihilation of the city of Nob together with its priests. <sup><xref rid="fn288">52)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When a man lends his neighbor a sum of money to help him rehabilitate himself, he does a kinder deed than if he had given the money in charity. It is better still if one invests the money in partnership, for this makes the other man feel glad that he neither has to borrow nor to take charity. <sup><xref rid="fn289">53)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;One who wishes to sin is aided in doing so and one who wishes to turn to better ways is assisted from heaven.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn290">54)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The biblical verse &#x201C;the eye of an adulterer guards the night,&#x201D; he interpreted to indicate that one is an adulterer even if he lusts only with his eyes.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn291">55)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Torah says that &#x201C;if you abandon me one day I shall abandon you two days.&#x201D; This he compared to two men one of whom is coming from Sephoris and the other from Tiberias. On the road they meet and continue on their way. But after each has walked one mile, they are already two miles apart. <sup><xref rid="fn292">56)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of the worth of scholars Resh Lakish said the following:</p>
<p>&#x201C;A scholar may not spend his time in fasting, for he thereby loses time and energy that should be devoted to study.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn293">57)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;A scholar should be shameful and modest as a bride and like her he must also guard his conduct that no shadow of immorality should fall upon them.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn294">58)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;When two scholars heed each other in matters of Halacha, God also hears their voices and grants their desires, but when they do not so, they cause the Shechinah to depart from among the Jews. Two scholars who encourage each other are beloved of God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn295">59)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;It is customary that when two merchants exchange their products, one offers silk and the other pepper; in the end they each have but one article. It is otherwise in learning. One studies the order Zeraim and the other studies the order Nezikin. One scholar then says to the other: Teach me Zeraim and I will teach you Nezikin. In the end they both know double that which they knew at the beginning. Can one possibly imagine a better trade in the world?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn296">60)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Poor as the political situation of the Jews was at that time, the people nevertheless did not give up their hope that redemption was bound to come and that the first step of the liberated Jews would be to restore the temple. But &#x201C;even if the moment of the restoration of the temple were at hand, children should not be disturbed in their studies.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn297">61)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Resh Lakish was very particular where the dignity of a scholar was concerned and when a certain wealthy man offended the Amora Rabbi Jehudah bar Chanina, whom Resh Lakish often quoted in matters of law, and he later wished to reconcile him, Resh Lakish told him to donate a pound of gold. On another occasion Resh Lakish said: &#x201C;He who expectorates in the presence of his Rabbi deserves to be punished by death.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn298">62)</xref></sup> &#x201C;But if a scholar commits an error he should not be reproved in public.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn299">63)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sometimes&#x2014;Resh Lakish said&#x2014;new interpretations lead to hindrance in the study of the Torah. Thus God commanded Moses to make new tablets in place of those that he had broken and indicated that He approved the breaking of the first tablets. <sup><xref rid="fn300">64)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;When afflictions are visited upon the world,&#x201D; Resh Lakish said, &#x201C;the Jews are the first ones to suffer from them and when joy is visited upon the world the Jews are also the first to feel it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn301">65)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;In the eyes of God a proselyte is preferred to a Jew, even to those Jews who stood at the foot of Mount Sinai and of whom God is so proud. Why is this so? Because if it were not for the lightning and the thunder and the blowing of the heavenly Shofar at the time of the giving of the Torah the Jews would not have accepted it. But a proselyte who has not seen nor heard all this embraced the Torah of his own free will. Could God love anyone more than him?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn302">66)</xref></sup> To this Resh Lakish added that &#x201C;he who denies the rights of a proselyte, is like one who denies the rights of God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn303">67)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;All his life,&#x201D; Resh Lakish believed, &#x201C;man should devote to study and even nights were created by God for that purpose.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn304">68)</xref></sup> While strolling once during a Sabbath, Resh Lakish was so immersed in pondering some problem that he unconsciously walked beyond the limit allowed on that day. <sup><xref rid="fn305">69)</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn234">&#x002A;) Resh Lakish is an abbreviation of Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05F4;&#x05E9;</span>). The mark indicating the abbreviation was in time transformed into a Yud. We may also remark that his appelation Ben Lakish does not prove that Lakish was the name of his father, but might indicate that he was a native of a city called Lakish, possibly the biblical &#x201C;Lachish.&#x201D; One of the last Tanaim was also called Rabbi Jehudah ben Lakish, and in this case also the appelation may indicate the city of origin rather than the name of the father.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn261">&#x002A;) The above mentioned passage from the Talmud Jerushalmi attempts to explain a contradiction for Resh Lakish is first quoted as saying that Job lived during the days of Abraham and later he declared that there was no Job. The Talmud explains this contradiction by saying that Resh Lakish did believe in the existence of Job, but he did not believe that Job, who was a just man, would have sinned because of his suffering.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HIYA</small> R<small>ABA BAR</small> A<small>BA</small> had two sons, Jehudah and Ezekiah. These at one time incurred the displeasure of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah. As they sat at the table of the Nasi without uttering a word, he commanded his servants that they be served wine to loosen their tongues. His command was obeyed and as the two young men became merry with wine they exclaimed: &#x201C;Messiah will not come as long as the two ruling houses in Israel, the house of the Exilarch in Babylonia and the house of the Nasi in Palestine, is not destroyed.&#x201D; As proof of their statement they quoted a passage from the Bible. In great anger the Nasi replied: &#x201C;Will you throw thorns in my eyes?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn306">1)</xref></sup> As a result of this altercation the two young men never received ordination although they were both called &#x201C;Amoraim of the West.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn307">2)</xref></sup> The older brother, Jehudah, is sometimes referred to as Rabbi in the Talmud, but this appears to be an error.</p>
<p>The two brothers died in their youth. It was also said that their birth was unusual, and although they were twins, one of them was three months older than the other (&#x0021;). The older brother was born at the beginning of the seventh month of pregnancy, while the younger one was born at the end of the ninth month. <sup><xref rid="fn308">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Together with their father Rabbi Chiya, the two young men came to Palestine from Babylonia when they were already of age and well versed in learning. It was then said that the learning in Palestine was in a decline and that Rabbi Chiya and his sons re-established it in the minds of the people. <sup><xref rid="fn309">4)</xref></sup> It was also related that as long as they lived it was not necessary to thresh the flax in the country and because of their merit the wine never turned sour. <sup><xref rid="fn310">5)</xref></sup> When the land was affected by a drought, the Nasi declared a fast day and he commanded Rabbi Chiya and his sons to pray for rain out of conviction that God would not refuse their prayer. <sup><xref rid="fn311">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the death of their father the two sons engaged in tilling the soil, <sup><xref rid="fn312">7)</xref></sup> and being so far removed from the academy, they once expressed concern lest their father be troubled in his grave at their neglect of their studies. <sup><xref rid="fn313">8)</xref></sup> This conversation is not entirely clear for, although they were not ordained, they were both known as prominent scholars. Jehudah&#x2019;s name is often mentioned in the Talmud in connection with various legal matters. Ezekiah was mentioned even more frequently and it appears that he compiled a collection of &#x201C;Boraithoth.&#x201D; His opinions are quoted in the Babylonian Talmud with the introducing words &#x201C;we have learned in the house of Ezekiah&#x201D; and in the Jerusalem Talmud they are prefaced by the words &#x201C;Ezekiah taught.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jehudah, the older brother, was a son-in-law of Rabbi Jannai Raba and he died during the lifetime of his father-in-law. Jehudah was in the habit of spending his days in the academy and of returning home only at nightfall. When he once failed to appear at the usual time, Rabbi Jannai ordered his bed to be covered believing him to have died. <sup><xref rid="fn314">9)</xref></sup> The reverence with which Rabbi Jannai regarded his son-in-law may be gauged from the following story which is told of their relations. Jehudah always visited his father-in-law each Friday and Rabbi Jannai would seat himself on the top of a high mountain to observe the approach of his son-in-law. As soon as he would see him coming in the distance he would rise out of respect. His disciples asked him for the meaning of his action and explained that his son-in-law equalled Mount Sinai in sanctity and that none was allowed to sit down in front of Sinai. <sup><xref rid="fn315">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jehudah&#x2019;s statements on various problems can best be understood when one considers the events of that time and the persecution at the hands of the Romans to which the Jews were subjected when their rights were denied, the academies were destroyed and unbearable taxes were imposed upon them. These persecutions were believed to be a punishment for the sins of man. When many people repented their sins, but the persecutions continued, Jehudah said: &#x201C;Repentance avails against half of the punishment while prayer may undo all of it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn316">11)</xref></sup> To this he often added that &#x201C;the suffering of exile brings forgiveness for the second half of the sins, so that one should not suffer in the world to come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn317">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of the numerous afflictions it was at that time customary for a congregation to request one of its members to pray to God for deliverance, but when no aid was in sight many lost their faith. It was then that Jehudah declared that a &#x201C;scholar who devotes himself to learning despite his needs, his prayers will surely avail.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn318">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like most of his contemporaries Jehudah highly praised the worth of the Torah and compared it to a healing balm which cures all diseases unlike ordinary cures each of which is effective only for one limb. <sup><xref rid="fn319">14)</xref></sup> Ezekiah expressed a similar sentiment when he said of the Torah that &#x201C;its words are a crown for one&#x2019;s head, an adornment for one&#x2019;s neck, a joy for one&#x2019;s heart, salve for one&#x2019;s eyes and balsam for one&#x2019;s wounds.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn320">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following are the most characteristic statements of Ezekiah:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Most important of all is peace. All the commandments a man must observe if they are at hand. When one meets with a situation, he must act in a certain manner, but if he does not meet with it, he is absolved. But where peace is concerned one must go out of his way to seek for it. The value of peace is so great that the Bible refers to all the wanderings of the children of Israel in the desert in the plural (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05E2;&#x05D5; &#x05D5;&#x05D9;&#x05D7;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;</span>) because they travelled in discord and they rested in discord, but when they reached Mount Sinai the singular is used (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D9;&#x05D7;&#x05DF; &#x05D9;&#x05E9;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05DC;</span>) for then they were at peace and united in one wish; it was then that God said: &#x2018;Now the time has come that I should give the Torah to my children.&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn321">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Well did the prophets do when they described the power of God by comparing the creation to the Creator. Thus they compared the voice of God to the roar of a lion or to the sound of mighty waters, for the human ear can conceive only that which it can hear. Man should likewise be shown only that which he can see.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn322">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;He who would add to what he had heard in order to strengthen its impression only succeeds in detracting from it. Thus God commanded not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, but when Eve spoke to the serpent she added that He had also commanded not to touch the tree. The serpent then pushed Eve until she touched the tree and seeing that she had not died the serpent said: &#x2018;Touching the tree has caused you no harm, neither will you suffer any harm by eating of its fruit.&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn323">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the Jews had made the golden calf, Moses prayed to God to forgive their sin and he reminded Him of His promise to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to increase their offspring like the stars in the sky. Ezekiah formulated the prayer of Moses in the following words: &#x201C;Had You sworn by heaven and earth, You could break your oath for heaven and earth may be done away with and You would be free of your oath. But since You swore by Your own name and You are eternal, Your oath is therefore eternal and You must forgive them.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn324">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We do not know where Jehudah lived, but mention is made that Ezekiah resided in Tiberias. <sup><xref rid="fn325">20)</xref></sup> Although Ezekiah was not ordained, he had prominent disciples among whom was Rabbi Jochanan. As long as Ezekiah lived, Rabbi Jochanan did not head an academy. <sup><xref rid="fn326">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both brothers died about the same time and they were buried near their father Rabbi Chiya. Jehudah, the older brother, was buried on the right side of Rabbi Chiya and Ezekiah, the younger brother, on his left side. <sup><xref rid="fn327">22)</xref></sup></p>

<title>RABBI JANNAI RABA</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>ANNAI</small> R<small>ABA LIVED IN THE CITY OF</small> A<small>CHBARA</small> (Achbaria) which was located in upper Galilee, one hour&#x2019;s walk to the south of Safed, and there he was the head of an academy. <sup><xref rid="fn328">1)</xref></sup> He was never called by his patronymic and he was often referred to as &#x201C;Raba&#x201D; (the Great), to distinguish him from other &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; of the same name.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jannai Raba was a descendant of the priest Eli. <sup><xref rid="fn329">2)</xref></sup> He was a wealthy man and he owned many fields and gardens. <sup><xref rid="fn330">3)</xref></sup> Some talmudic teachers claimed, that he owned as many as 400 vineyards. <sup><xref rid="fn331">4)</xref></sup> His daughters were very proud and the man who would marry one of them had to pay him a pot of gold. <sup><xref rid="fn332">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The disciples of Rabbi Jannai cultivated his fields and vineyards and thus they earned their livelihood. It appears that this condition continued long after Rabbi Jannai died. The laws that were studied in his academy are known in the Talmud as &#x201C;the Halachoth of the house of Rabbi Jannai.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Some historians claim that Rabbi Jannai had been a pupil of Rabbi Jehudah HaNasi, but there is no proof of this fact. It is certain however that he was a disciple of Rabbi Chiya, who foretold that he would become a leader among Jews. <sup><xref rid="fn333">6)</xref></sup> In later life he was a colleague of Rabbi Chiya, and R. Jehudah, the son of Rabbi Chiya, was his son-in-law. <sup><xref rid="fn334">7)</xref></sup> When the Nasi died, Rabbi Jannai announced that all regulations pertaining to Priests were done away with for that day and that every Priest could participate in the burial. <sup><xref rid="fn335">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time it was told that in his old age Rabbi Jannai once met Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah II and, fingering the mantle of the Nasi, he remarked: &#x201C;Your mantle looks like a sack upon you,&#x201D; thereby hinting that the robe of office did not befit the man. Later he asked the Nasi a question concerning the laws of inheritance and, dissatisfied with the reply, he said to Rabbi Simlai, upon whom he was leaning: &#x201C;Lead me hence. This man has studied nothing.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn336">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears that no decrees of unusual severity were issued at that time although the emperors of the period&#x2014;Caracalla, Makrinus and Heliogabalus&#x2014;were known for their cruelty. Graetz suggests that the statement of Rabbi Jannai that &#x201C;we have neither the security of the wicked nor the chastisements of the righteous&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn337">10)</xref></sup> refers to the political situation of that day, but according to the &#x201C;Seder Hadoroth&#x201D; this statement was uttered by a previous Rabbi Jannai.</p>
<p>Only once did Rabbi Jannai depart from the strict interpretation of the commandments when he advised the Jews to cultivate their fields on a Sabbatical year. The emperor Caracalla then led his armies through Palestine to wage war on the Parthians and he ordered the Jews to till their fields on the Sabbatical year in order to provide food for his armies. Rabbi Jannai&#x2019;s advice did not imply an attempt to do away with the observance of the Sabbatical year, but was conditioned by the exigencies of the moment. <sup><xref rid="fn338">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>With nostalgic longing Rabbi Jannai spoke of the days of his youth, when young men went out in groups to teach the people. In contradiction to the opinion of Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi who advised against teaching in the streets, Rabbi Jannai declared that when scholars teach in the streets they are like fields of balsam which waft their odors far and wide. <sup><xref rid="fn339">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jannai compared the Torah to a loaf of bread which is suspended on a rope in a house. The foolish man says: &#x201C;Who can reach this bread?&#x201D;, but the wise man says: &#x201C;Has not someone hung up this bread? I will build me a ladder until I reach the bread.&#x201D; The foolish man similarly says: &#x201C;Who can learn all the Torah which my master has in his heart?&#x201D;, but the wise man says: &#x201C;Has not my master learned his Torah from others? Therefore I will learn two sentences today and two the next day, until I will learn all the Torah of my master.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn340">13)</xref></sup> Nevertheless Rabbi Jannai also said that one who studies all his Torah from one master will see no blessing in it, <sup><xref rid="fn341">14)</xref></sup> and he who has studied but has not served scholars may be compared to a pagan. <sup><xref rid="fn342">15)</xref></sup> A priest may eat his &#x201C;Trumah&#x201D; on the grave of another priest who was not a scholar, for he does not contaminate, <sup><xref rid="fn343">16)</xref></sup> and when Rabbi Jannai met a man who was versed in learning but had no fear of God, he said: &#x201C;Woe to the people who before they build a house, erect the door.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn344">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jannai was once in his house engaged in study when he suddenly heard a voice in the street calling: &#x201C;Who would buy a remedy to assure him of life?&#x201D; Rabbi Jannai sent his daughter to call the merchant, but the merchant said: &#x201C;Neither you nor those like you need this remedy,&#x201D; When Rabbi Jannai insisted that he should sell him this remedy, the merchant opened a book of Psalms and showed him the verse: &#x201C;Who is the man who wants life, who loves to see good days? Guard your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking falsehood.&#x201D; Rabbi Jannai remarked that king Solomon said the same in Proverbs: &#x201C;He who guards his mouth and tongue spares himself from trouble.&#x201D; Finally he gave the merchant six denars for his trouble and he said to his pupils: &#x201C;All my life I read this verse, but I never understood it in the same sense that I understand it now.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn345">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jannai was one of those in charge of the distribution of charity in his city, but his own charity he distributed secretly. <sup><xref rid="fn346">19)</xref></sup> When he saw a man giving charity to another in the presence of other people he said: &#x201C;It were better that you had given nothing, for you shamed the poor man.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn347">20)</xref></sup> In this capacity he probably had many opportunities to see people break their promises to contribute to charity. He was always worried at sight of this and he said: &#x201C;When one makes a vow it is written down in a book in heaven; when the vow is not fulfilled it is also noted down in that book.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn348">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;One should never tempt providence,&#x201D; Rabbi Jannai said, &#x201C;by standing in a place of danger and expecting a miracle to occur, for no miracle may take place. If a miracle does occur, it will certainly be deducted from the reward of the man in the world to come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn349">22)</xref></sup> He avoided depending on miracles to such an extent that he always tested every bridge before he crossed it, <sup><xref rid="fn350">23)</xref></sup> and when he had to go on a journey, he wrote his will so that his family should know what to do in case he did not return. <sup><xref rid="fn351">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;One must always show respect for royalty,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Thus we see that when Moses came to announce to Pharaoh that all first born sons would die, he knew that Pharaoh himself would come to ask him to take the Jews out of Egypt. Nevertheless he did not say so to Pharaoh; instead he said that Pharaoh would send his messengers.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn352">25)</xref></sup> The passage stating that all the days of a poor man are evil he explained as referring to a man who is merciful. <sup><xref rid="fn353">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the days of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah II the Boraitha and the Tosephta were compiled and Rabbi Jannai considered the Boraithoth of Rabbi Chiya to be of the same importance as the Mishna. <sup><xref rid="fn354">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jannai urged each man upon his morning awakening to add a special prayer, thanking God for returning him to life. In addition he composed the following prayer: &#x201C;Lord of the world, I have sinned before you&#x0021; May it be Thy will to grant me a good heart, a good share, good desires, a good name, a good eye, a modest soul and a humble spirit. May Thy name not be profaned through us and preserve us from being the talk of the people. Doom us not to destruction, nor our hopes to frustration, and spare us from depending on the gifts of men whose gifts are small but whose shame is great. Grant that our share be in Your Torah and among those who do Your will and build Your house and Your palace and Your city and Your temple soon in our days.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn355">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jannai survived the rule of four N&#x2019;siim from Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi until the rule of his great grandson Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah II. As his death approached he instructed his children that they should not bury him in a white shroud lest he go to Gehenna where he will appear like a groom among mourners, nor in a black shroud lest he go to Paradise where he will appear like a mourner among grooms. <sup><xref rid="fn356">29)</xref></sup></p>

<title>RABBI JONATHAN ben ELAZAR</title>
<p>A<small>MONG THE DISCIPLES OF</small> R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HIYA</small>, Rabbi Jonathan ben Elazar, sometimes called <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E9;&#x05E8; &#x05D4;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D4;&#x05F4;</span> or <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05E9; &#x05D4;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D4;&#x05F4;</span> (the Man of the Capitol), was very prominent. He excelled in Hagada and after he reinterpreted some biblical text it seemed that it had never really been understood before. His deductions were primarily religious and ethical.</p>
<p>The times were such that the masses of the people lost much of their interest in legal disputations and preferred the legendary explanations of the Scriptures and the wondrous stories concerning the heroes of the Bible. These stimulated their imagination and momentarily removed them from their sad realities into a beautiful world of dreams. We therefore find Rabbi Jonathan mentioned hundreds of times in Hagada, but only once in Halacha. <sup><xref rid="fn357">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears that Rabbi Jonathan ben Elazar was a grain merchant and that he lived in Sephoris. He was a close friend of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama with whom he frequently discussed various matters. The following story is characteristic of the lifetime of Rabbi Jonathan. As he once came to a merchant to buy lentils, the merchant offered him wheat at a low price but demanded a high price for lentils. Rabbi Jonathan&#x2019;s relative then instructed him to inquire for the price of wheat whenever he wanted to buy lentils, so that he might obtain it at a low price. <sup><xref rid="fn358">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jonathan also conducted an academy and one of his most prominent disciples was Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani, who often repeated the Hagadic sayings of Rabbi Jonathan. Rabbi Shmuel came from Babylonia to Palestine to ascertain the meaning of three biblical verses of which he was in doubt. He met Rabbi Jonathan who gave him a satisfactory explanation. Another version declares that he met Rabbi Jonathan in the street, but the latter refused to answer his questions there and instructed him to visit the academy where he would teach him the meaning of these verses. Rabbi Shmuel attempted to prove that it was permissible to teach the Torah in the street and he quoted Proverbs (1:20) to prove his contention. But Rabbi Jonathan declared that the reference was not to an ordinary street, but to a highway of learning. He added further that one does not sell precious stones in a vegetable market. <sup><xref rid="fn359">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuel related that whenever Rabbi Jonathan came to the passage, &#x201C;For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it&#x201D; (Isaiah 28:20), he explained it to mean that the whole world is too small for God to share its rule with any other power. <sup><xref rid="fn360">4)</xref></sup> This statement of Rabbi Jonathan is no doubt part of his argument against people who believed in dual rule out of conviction that God could not alone govern the world and required the assistance of another.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jonathan was always kind to those he came in contact with and there is no mention of any outburst of anger on his part. But he was strict with Rabbi Simlai, who later became one of the outstanding exponents of Hagada; he said to Rabbi Simlai: &#x201C;It is a tradition of my forefathers not to teach Hagada to a Babylonian nor to an inhabitant of the south, for these possess vain pride and little Torah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn361">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The problem of fair judgment in Jewish courts was then of paramount importance and of this Rabbi Jonathan said: &#x201C;One who sits in judgment should consider that a sword hangs over his head and the pit of damnation opens at his feet, <sup><xref rid="fn362">6)</xref></sup> for every judge who passes just sentence causes the Shechinah to dwell among Jews, but one who is unjust drives the Shechinah away and a judge who illegally deprives one man of his possessions and gives them to another will lose his life.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn363">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jonathan&#x2019;s custom when passing sentence in a dispute was illustrated by the following story: Rabbi Jonathan lived in the neighborhood of a Roman and the branches of a tree in his garden overhung the property of the Roman, who did not complain about this for a long time. One day two men came to Rabbi Jonathan to decide a dispute between them which involved such a case of an overhanging tree. Rabbi Jonathan heard the arguments of the contending parties and told them to return on the following day when he would pass sentence. The Roman was anxious to hear his decision and if he was to command that the tree be cut down, he would ask him, why he did not do so to his own tree. That evening Rabbi Jonathan had his tree trimmed of all branches overhanging the property of the Roman and when the litigants appeared on the following day, he commanded them to do likewise. To the query of the Roman, he replied: &#x201C;My tree has been trimmed since the previous night.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Another story concerns a woman who brought a basket of figs as a gift to Rabbi Jonathan. He refused the gift and he asked the woman to take the basket back with her; if the basket of figs had been covered when she brought it then she should take it away covered, but if it had been uncovered then she should carry it out uncovered lest people should suspect that she had brought a basket of gold but was taking back a basket of figs. <sup><xref rid="fn364">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;He who commits a good deed,&#x201D; Rabbi Jonathan said, &#x201C;will be rewarded for it in the world to come and he who commits an evil deed will be followed by it until judgment day.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn365">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Seven different sins bring punishment upon the whole world and the innocent suffer for them together with guilty; these sins are: slander, bloodshed, false oath, immorality, pride, robbery and envy. <sup><xref rid="fn366">10)</xref></sup> Punishment for these sins is visited during a time when there are wicked men and the punishment first affects the just men. <sup><xref rid="fn367">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He who teaches Torah to the son of another man deserves to sit among the angels and one who teaches Torah to the son of an Am Haaretz, God will undo all decrees against Him. <sup><xref rid="fn368">12)</xref></sup> It is a worthy deed for a man to point out to his neighbor the evil of his ways and one who does so with pious intention merits the grace of God, <sup><xref rid="fn369">13)</xref></sup> but it is a sin to slander another person. However, should one do so to quarrelsome people then he has committed no sin, for against such people anything may be said. <sup><xref rid="fn370">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We may assume that Rabbi Jonathan disapproved of the kindness of the Romans, for he declared: &#x201C;The curse of Achijah of Shilo was preferable to the blessing of Balaam. Achijah cursed the Jews that they should shake like the reed which grows in the water, but water reeds are deeply rooted and no wind can uproot them; after the wind calms down the reed remains upright in its place. But Balaam blessed the Jews that they should be like cedar trees growing near water and even though all other winds will not budge a cedar tree, a south wind will uproot it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn371">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Jonathan heard the words of the pagans who could not understand how the Jews clung to their faith despite all suffering and persecutions he said: &#x201C;Other nations wish to know what is our consolation in time of need and how we withstand the anger of our God; we must tell them that even though He punishes us, He immediately heals us of our suffering and creates us anew.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn372">16)</xref></sup> In line with this point of view was also Rabbi Jonathan&#x2019;s explanation of the origins of storms and he said: &#x201C;When God remembers that His children suffer among the Gentiles a sigh escapes Him and such sighs cause storms.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn373">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani quoted Rabbi Jonathan as follows: &#x201C;When Moses was writing the Torah and he reached the verse &#x2018;Let us make man&#x2019;, Moses said to God, &#x2018;Why do You give unbelievers an opportunity to say that You did not create man alone?&#x2019; but God replied: &#x2018;Write as you are told and he who would err may err.&#x2019; Later God added: &#x2018;Moses, these people whom I created consist of large ones and small ones and I give them an example that the great ones should consult the small ones before doing anything even as I consulted the angels before creating man.&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn374">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When God completed the creation of the world, He looked upon it and found it good in His eyes. Rabbi Jonathan compared this to a king who was giving his daughter in marriage and who prepared a beautiful canopy for the bride. As the king looked upon the canopy he said to his daughter: &#x201C;Daughter, may I always be as pleased with this canopy as I am pleased now.&#x201D; God likewise looked at that which He had created and said to the world: &#x201C;May I always be as pleased with you as I am pleased with you now.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn375">19)</xref></sup></p>

<p>R<small>ABBI</small> O<small>SHAIA WAS A DISCIPLE</small> of Bar Kapara and Rabbi Chiya Raba. The title &#x201C;Raba&#x201D; was added to his name, to distinguish him from a later &#x201C;Amora&#x201D; of the same name.</p>
<p>Collaborating with his master Rabbi Chiya, Rabbi Oshaia compiled over seventy Boraithoth and it became an accepted rule to doubt the authencity of any Boraitha which was not examined and explained by these two, <sup><xref rid="fn376">1)</xref></sup> for&#x2014;as Rashi explains&#x2014;they were careful to repeat every word as it was originally said unlike the other scholars who often added to the texts which they received.</p>
<p>Some scholars even referred to Rabbi Oshaia as &#x201C;the father of the Mishna.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn377">2)</xref></sup> But primarily he was the first commentator on the Mishna because of his position as disciple of Rabbi Chiya who passed on to him the opinions which he had heard from Rabbi Jehudah. The Boraithoth of Rabbi Oshaia are therefore referred to as &#x201C;the great Mishnayoth.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn378">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Oshaia was descended from a family of scholars and his father, R. Chama bar Bisa, was highly respected by Rabbi Jehudah who called him &#x201C;a great man.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn379">4)</xref></sup> Rabbi Oshaia was at first a pupil of Bar-Kapara and later of Rabbi Chiya. <sup><xref rid="fn380">5)</xref></sup> It appears that he also studied with Rabbi Ephes for some time and he accompanied him on a journey to Antioch in the interests of the people. In addition he maintained close relations with Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the first. <sup><xref rid="fn381">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Throughout the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the first Oshaia attended his academy at Sephoris and it was his duty to go to Ein Tov every month to question the witnesses concerning the appearance of the new moon in order to determine the beginning of the new month. As long as it was possible it was customary to hear such testimony in a city of Judea and the Nasi who lived in Galilee maintained a court in Ein Tov. <sup><xref rid="fn382">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of Rabbi Chama, the father of Rabbi Oshaia, it was said that he engaged in study away from home for twelve years. When he returned and entered the academy he did not recognize his son. In the discussion that followed Rabbi Chama was amazed at the learning of the young man and he felt grieved that he had been away for so long and had neglected the education of his son. As he came home he was met by his son, but he thought that the young man followed him to continue the discussion and he rose out of reverence. His wife then remarked to him: &#x201C;Who has ever seen a father rise to greet his son?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn383">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chama was a judge together with Bar-Kapara during the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah <sup><xref rid="fn384">9)</xref></sup> and he is frequently mentioned in the Talmud as the father of Rabbi Oshaia. <sup><xref rid="fn385">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Bisa, the grandfather of Rabbi Oshaia, was also a scholar and at least on one occasion he sided with his grandson against his father in some legal question. <sup><xref rid="fn386">11)</xref></sup> Various legal opinions of Rabbi Bisa were also quoted by the scholars at Caesarea. <sup><xref rid="fn387">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following the death of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;sia the first, the Nasi was no longer the head of the Sanhedrin and Rabbi Oshaia established an academy in Caesarea which was attended by many scholars. <sup><xref rid="fn388">13)</xref></sup> The Christian Church-father Origines appears to have had religious discussions with Rabbi Oshaia and during one of these (the Midrash there mentions the name as &#x201C;Philosophos&#x201D; instead of Origines) he was asked why God had not commanded Adam to practice circumcision if this commandment was of such great significance. Rabbi Oshaia replied with a counter question: &#x201C;Why do men shave the hair on their heads but not their beards?&#x201D; <xref rid="fn389">&#x002A;)</xref> Origines replied: &#x201C;Because the hair on one&#x2019;s head grows since childhood when man was still foolish, but the beard begins to grow when man attains wisdom.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;According to your answer,&#x201D; Rabbi Oshaia said, &#x201C;I could say that man should gouge his eyes or cut off his arms or break his legs, since these have grown with him since childhood. But the matter is entirely different for everything that was created requires improvement. Thus there are various bitter herbs which man eats after they are sweetened; wheat cannot be eaten as it grows, but must first be ground and only then can it be kneaded and baked. It is likewise true of man that he needs to be improved.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn390">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among the prominent followers of Rabbi Oshaia there was Rabbi Jochanan who declared that Rabbi Oshaia was as great in his generation as Rabbi Meir had been in his and even as Rabbi Meir was often misunderstood by his contemporaries, likewise were Rabbi Oshaia&#x2019;s ways often misunderstood. <sup><xref rid="fn391">15)</xref></sup> Another disciple was Rabbi Pinchas, who gathered all the lectures of Rabbi Oshaia and these were later included in &#x201C;Midrash Raba&#x201D; on the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>Rabbi Oshaia was a poor man and the Nasi often aided him. On a certain Purim he sent him meat and wine and Rabbi Oshaia told him that he had fulfilled both commandments of sending gifts to one&#x2019;s friends and donations to the poor. <sup><xref rid="fn392">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following are some of the statements of Rabbi Oshaia:</p>
<p>He who strives for perfection in his conduct will certainly succeed, but one who is vainly proud will go to Gehenna. <sup><xref rid="fn393">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Why are the words of the Torah compared to water, wine and milk? These three liquids may be kept in cheap vessels and the words of the Torah are retained only by those who are humble. <sup><xref rid="fn394">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>God was gracious to the Jews in that he scattered them among the nations and thus saved them from annihilation. When they suffer in one country, they are treated kindly in another land. <sup><xref rid="fn395">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking of the same subject on another occasion, he explained it with a passage from the Bible. When Esau came to meet Jacob, Jacob had said: &#x201C;If Esau come to the company and smite it (referring to the Jews in Palestine), then the other company which is left shall escape&#x201D; (referring to the Jews in the lands of the Diaspora). But although the Jews in the Diaspora do not suffer as much as we do, they nevertheless fast every Monday and Thursday to intercede with God in our behalf. <sup><xref rid="fn396">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Jews obey their leaders but the leaders do not that which is necessary than the blame is with the leaders. It is as if one blackens his hands and then wipes them on the wall; the wall is blackened thereby but his hands do not become clean. <sup><xref rid="fn397">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prophet Zechariah said: Behold I take two canes, one of them I call &#x201C;Noam&#x201D; (pleasant) and the other I call &#x201C;Chovlim&#x201D; (pain). We may say that &#x201C;Noam&#x201D; refers to the scholars of Palestine and &#x201C;Chovlim&#x201D; refers to the scholars of Babylonia who cause each other pain with their constant doubts and questions while the scholars of Palestine are dear and pleasant to each other; they sit together and in study each improves the words of the other until the law becomes clarified. <sup><xref rid="fn398">22)</xref></sup></p>

<title>RABBI CHANINA bar CHAMA</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HANINA BAR</small> C<small>HAMA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST</small> &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; in Palestine, called also Rabbi Chanina the Great. <sup><xref rid="fn399">1)</xref></sup> He was a priest and it was said that he always returned to parents the money which he received at the ceremony of &#x201C;redeeming a first-born son.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn400">2)</xref></sup> He was said to devote himself to healing and he was acquainted with the nature of serpents. <sup><xref rid="fn401">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina was born in Babylonia and he came to Palestine to study with Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi after he was already the father of a son whom he brought with himself. He then settled in Sephoris where the academy of Rabbi Jehudah was situated, but for some unknown reason he was not liked by the inhabitants of the city. Thus it was related that an epidemic once broke out in Sephoris, but it did not affect the street where Rabbi Chanina resided. The people were angered and said that he refused to pray for them, but Rabbi Chanina denied that his prayer could be of any avail as long as they conducted themselves immorally. Another time a drought occurred and although a fast day was declared no rain fell. Rabbi Chanina was then blamed and it was said that because he spoke evil of the people, God refused to heed their prayers. <sup><xref rid="fn402">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Chanina arrived in Palestine, he was already well versed in the Scriptures, but this knowledge hindered his career, for it incurred the displeasure of Rabbi Jehudah, whom he once corrected. Rabbi Jehudah at that time remarked: &#x201C;Where and from whom have you learned until now?&#x201D; &#x201C;From Rav Hamnuna the Scribe,&#x201D; Rabbi Chanina replied. &#x201C;Then go to Rav Hamnuna and have him ordain you,&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah exclaimed.</p>
<p>Only when the Nasi was nearing his death, did he command his son Rabban Gamliel to ordain Rabbi Chanina and to seat him in the first row in the academy. But Rabbi Chanina refused the last honor saying that Rabbi Ephes was older and therefore deserved the foremost seat. <sup><xref rid="fn403">5)</xref></sup> Rabbi Chanina believed that this act accounted for his long life and health, for even after he was eighty years of age, he could balance himself on one foot while removing his shoes. He added by saying: &#x201C;The fact that my mother bathed me in warm water and anointed me with oil during my childhood contributed to my long life.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn404">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But although Rabbi Chanina was not ordained during the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah, he was nevertheless highly respected by him, and whenever Rabbi Jehudah visited the representative of the emperor or was visited by him, Rabbi Chanina was always at his side.</p>
<p>One time, as Rabbi Chanina went on some mission to the Roman governor at Caesarea accompanied by Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, the governor arose to greet the messengers. His friends then asked him: &#x201C;Why do you rise to greet Jews?&#x201D;, and the governor replied: &#x201C;These Jews resemble angels.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn405">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From various expressions of Rabbi Chanina we gather that he was acquainted with the science of medicine and people often turned to him for medical advice. <sup><xref rid="fn406">8)</xref></sup> But although he believed that all actions are determined from above and that one does not even stir a finger unless it has been so determined in heaven, <sup><xref rid="fn407">9)</xref></sup> he nevertheless declared that fevers and chills were exceptions, <sup><xref rid="fn408">10)</xref></sup> and that 99 out of 100 people died through their own fault in not avoiding colds. <sup><xref rid="fn409">11)</xref></sup> He likewise said: &#x201C;Why do the people of Babylonia escape the skin ailment known as <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05EA;&#x05DF;</span>? It is because they eat a herb called <span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E8;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span> which grows among the thorns. This herb they mix with a special kind of wine fermented from dates.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn410">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina was modest toward his master, but he consciously maintained his dignity among his colleagues. When he met Rabbi Chiya at the death of Rabbi Jehudah there arose a dispute between them as to who did more for the advancement of the Torah and Rabbi Chanina declared that if the Torah were to be forgotten entirely, he could reconstitute it with his &#x201C;pilpul.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn411">13)</xref></sup> It is also related that Rav (Aba Arecha) once read a chapter of the Torah before Rabbi Jehudah; as Rabbi Chiya entered in the middle of the reading, Rav began to read from the beginning again; then Bar-Kapara entered and again he reread the chapter. He repeated this also when Rabban Simeon, the son of the Nasi, entered in the middle of the reading, but when Rabbi Chanina entered, he refused to begin the chapter anew. This offended Rabbi Chanina and on thirteen successive eves of the Day of Atonement Rav visited Rabbi Chanina to ask his forgiveness, but the latter would not become reconciled. <sup><xref rid="fn412">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina maintained a close friendship with nearly all the contemporary Amoraim. One of these was Rabbi Jochanan, later the editor of the Jerusalem Talmud, who was first his pupil and later his close friend. Due to differences of opinion with Rabbi Chanina, Rabbi Jochanan left Sephoris and settled in Tiberias, <sup><xref rid="fn413">15)</xref></sup> but these differences did not weaken their friendship and Rabbi Jochanan often visited his master in Sephoris. <sup><xref rid="fn414">16)</xref></sup> When Rabbi Chanina fell sick before his death, Rabbi Jochanan went to visit him, but on the road he met a man of Sephoris and he asked him: &#x201C;What new things have happened in your city?&#x201D; and the man replied: &#x201C;A great rabbi died and everybody is hurrying to the funeral.&#x201D; Rabbi Jochanan then understood that Rabbi Chanina had died and he rent his garments as a sign of mourning. <sup><xref rid="fn415">17)</xref></sup> Others told that Rabbi Jochanan carried thirteen garments to wear and that he tore all of them exclaiming: &#x201C;The man who nourished me with Torah has gone.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn416">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Every word which Rabbi Chanina had heard directly from Rabbi Jehudah, or which he heard repeated in the name of Rabbi Jehudah, he considered to be sacred and he would not deviate from it. In all questions that arose, Rabbi Chanina relied on the conduct of Rabbi Jehudah in similar cases and whenever a question arose to which Rabbi Chanina could find no answer in the Mishna, he consulted his colleagues and even his disciples. Rabbi Jochanan and Resh Lakish were thus greatly surprised when he asked their opinion in a matter which could easily be explained; but Rabbi Chanina said to them: &#x201C;May evil come upon me if I ever made any statement which I have not previously heard from Rabbi Jehudah as many times as I have hair on my head. In all matters of law I would observe the conduct of Rabbi on three occasions in similar cases, but this matter concerning which I asked you I only witnessed Rabbi Jehudah observe twice. I therefore asked your opinion in order that it should be as if I had seen it observed a third time.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn417">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>This strict adherence to tradition and the constant repetition of opinions of previous authorities was disapproved of by the other scholars of the time who did not want to allow the interpretation of the Torah to lose its vitality. Many of them therefore left Rabbi Chanina and opened academies of their own. But these differences were only theoretical and did not diminish the personal regard which they felt for each other. On the contrary, Rabbi Chanina was always glad of the honor which was bestowed upon his pupils of the past.</p>
<p>Thus it is told that as he was once strolling in the street he saw all people abandon their work and don festive garments. He asked what the occasion for rejoicing was and he was told: &#x201C;Your pupil Rabbi Jochanan has arrived and he will lecture at the academy; everybody therefore hastens to hear him.&#x201D; Rabbi Chanina then pronounced the blessing of &#x201C;Schehechayanu&#x201D; that he had lived to see the honor accorded to his disciple. <sup><xref rid="fn418">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina gained his livelihood from trade in honey. On one occasion he sold a large quantity of fig honey and from the considerable profit which he realized by this transaction he built the academy at Sephoris. <sup><xref rid="fn419">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>His love for Palestine was indescribable. It was said that wherever he went he removed the stones and other hindrances from the way in order to smooth the road and to improve it. He was said to be able to distinguish between the soil of Palestine and soil of other lands by merely taking a lump of it in his hand. When one of his young pupils, Rabbi Simeon bar Aba, asked him whether he should go to a foreign land and requested a letter of recommendation to the scholars in Babylonia, Rabbi Chanina said to him: &#x201C;I cannot give it to you, for tomorrow I may see your parents (I may die) and they may complain to me that they had owned a beautiful flower in Palestine and that I had allowed it to be transplanted to a foreign land.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn420">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From Rabbi Chanina&#x2019;s statements it is obvious that he believed that God rewards man according to his deeds and even though judgment may be delayed it was certain that God would not overlook anyone&#x2019;s sins, for whatever He does is done in a spirit of justice. <sup><xref rid="fn421">23)</xref></sup> It is therefore better that man should sin secretly, if he does so, and should not profane the name of God in public. <sup><xref rid="fn422">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But although Rabbi Chanina believed that all man&#x2019;s actions were controlled from above even to the extent of stirring a finger, he nevertheless added that &#x201C;fear of God&#x201D; was dependent on the individual. <sup><xref rid="fn423">25)</xref></sup> Regarding relations between people Rabbi Chanina said: &#x201C;He who raises his hand against his neighbor, even though he does not strike him, has already sinned. He who strikes a Jew, is like one who struck the Shechinah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn424">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;There are people,&#x201D; Rabbi Chanina said, &#x201C;who sin on earth, but do not sin against heaven; then there are others who sin against heaven but do not sin on earth, but he who engages in slander sins both against heaven and against earth.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn425">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;There are various kinds of wicked men. Some are sly and these are worse than the ordinary sinner, for they always prove their innocence. During a trial, for instance, such a man comes before the judge before the other party has arrived and he presents his arguments thereby influencing the judge in his favor. A judge must therefore be careful not to heed the words of one of the sides until the opposing side is also present.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn426">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like other scholars Rabbi Chanina also praised charity and he said: &#x201C;Charity may be compared to a garment. The stuff of a garment is woven out of single threads. Charity likewise is gathered in single coins until it accumulates into a considerable sum.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn427">29)</xref></sup> &#x201C;In the distribution of charity scholars should be considered first, for he who shames a scholar should be considered a heretic who does not deserve a share in the world to come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn428">30)</xref></sup> &#x201C;He who shows ill will toward scholars in this world will have his ears filled with smoke in the world to come,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn429">31)</xref></sup> &#x201C;but one who gains the approval of his teachers is certain of a share in the world to come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn430">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time scholars are obliged to teach all those who wish to learn and a scholar who refuses to read a chapter of the Scriptures or to teach a chapter of the Mishna to one who requests it by saying &#x201C;Leave me&#x0021; I have not the strength for it,&#x201D; to him God says: &#x201C;The time will come when you will in truth not have the strength to teach.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn431">33)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina believed in the influence of stars (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D6;&#x05DC;</span>) on human life. &#x201C;The stars make one wise and also rich,&#x201D; he said. In contradistinction to those who said, &#x201C;Jews have no stars,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn432">34)</xref></sup> Rabbi Chanina declared that &#x201C;Jews have stars.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn433">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Sabbath he considered to be the most important day of the week which should be honored by wearing special garments. Every man, he said, should have two sets of garments, one for week days and the other for the Sabbath. <sup><xref rid="fn434">36)</xref></sup> Each Sabbath eve Rabbi Chanina donned his Sabbath garments and said to his friends and disciples: &#x201C;Let us go to greet the queen Sabbath.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn435">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like his contemporaries Rabbi Chanina met with suffering but he did not allow these to influence his attitude toward life and he always controlled his reactions. Only once did he omit his daily prayer due to anger. <sup><xref rid="fn436">38)</xref></sup> When his daughter died, he did not weep. His wife thereupon chided him and said: &#x201C;Even when a hen is lost from the house one regrets it.&#x201D; But Rabbi Chanina replied: &#x201C;One cannot bear two griefs. I suffer enough that I am now childless, must I also weep until I become blind?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn437">39)</xref></sup> Rabbi Chanina also did not mourn when his son, Shivchath, died. He accepted it as a just act of God and merely said that his son died because he &#x201C;cut down the fig before it was time.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn438">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina scolded the inhabitants of his city for their immorality and he said: &#x201C;During the time of Moses there was one Zimri and 24 thousand Jews lost their lives on his account. In this generation we have many Zimri&#x2019;s. Why then should we complain if God punishes us?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn439">41)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When asked to what he ascribed his long life, Rabbi Chanina sometimes explained it by natural reasons as due to the warm baths and the anointment with oil which he received as a child. At other times he ascribed it to the fact that he gave up the foremost seat in the academy, which was offered to him by the Nasi to Rabbi Ephes, or to the special effort which he made by going out of his way on the road from Sephoris to Tiberias in order to greet Rabbi Simeon ben Chalafta. <sup><xref rid="fn440">42)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Joshua ben Levi</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>OSHUA BEN</small> L<small>EVI BELONGED</small> to the first and second generations of &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; who were influential after the death of Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi. Among these he occupied an important position and his life history was surrounded with wondrous legends. It was said that he spoke to the prophet Elijah as one speaks to an equal and that he obtained from him whatever he requested. When in doubt concerning the meaning of some passage he would send Elijah to inquire its meaning from the deceased Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai. <sup><xref rid="fn441">1)</xref></sup> Often he prayed for rain and his prayer was never denied. It was even told that he spoke to Messiah who revealed to him the time of his coming, and when the angel of death finally came to take his soul, he succeeded in outwitting him and in entering paradise alive. <sup><xref rid="fn442">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some people claimed that Rabbi Joshua was a son of Levi ben Sisi who had been a disciple of Rabbi Jehudah. But this appears to be unlikely since Levi ben Sisi came from Babylonia whereas Rabbi Joshua was a Palestinian, also, had he been the son of the renowned Tana, he would have quoted his father in legal matters. <sup><xref rid="fn443">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua was a pupil of many of the scholars of his time. For a time he even attended the academy of Rabbi Jehudah whose legal observances he later quoted. The high esteem in which Rabbi Joshua was held here is apparent from the fact that one of his statements was included in the &#x201C;Boraithoth&#x201D; to the tractate of Aboth. This statement declares that every day a &#x201C;Bath Kol&#x201D; is heard from Mount Horeb announcing: &#x201C;Woe to those who allow the Torah to be put to shame.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua lived in Judea, in the city of Lud where he was born and where he also headed an academy. We may assume that he was already prominent during the days of Rabbi Chiya, for it was told that Rabbi Chiya once visited him in Lud and in honor of the guest 24 different courses were served. Rabbi Chiya was surprised and asked what they did on the Sabbath if so many courses were offered during a week day. Rabbi Joshua then told him that the number of courses was doubled on Saturday. Some time later Rabbi Joshua visited Rabbi Chiya and the latter gave his pupils several golden ducats with which to buy food for a repast such as Rabbi Joshua was accustomed. <sup><xref rid="fn444">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua often visited Sephoris where the Sanhedrin convened and he was a close friend of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama, the head of the academy at Sephoris. He also accompanied him once on a trip to the proconsul at Caesarea on a mission of the people. <sup><xref rid="fn445">5)</xref></sup> It was related that Rabbi Joshua ordained all his pupils irrespective of whether the Nasi approved. <sup><xref rid="fn446">6)</xref></sup> Nevertheless he recognized the authority of the Nasi and considered his opinions to be law. <sup><xref rid="fn447">7)</xref></sup> When his son, Rav Joseph, married the daughter of the Nasi he considered it to be a great honor and even accorded honor to his son, always remarking that he did so out of respect for the Nasi. <sup><xref rid="fn448">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua was an authority in both Halacha and Hagada, but from some of his declarations we gather that he did not approve of Hagada. Thus he opposed comitting Hagada to writing and he said that &#x201C;he who writes down an Hagada will have no share in the world to come; he who studies it will suffer humiliation and he who listens to it will receive no reward.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn449">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>His love for the Torah and his veneration of scholars exceeded all bounds and he said: &#x201C;Beware of an old man who has forgotten his learning, for the broken tablets were kept in the Ark together with the whole ones.&#x201D; Likewise he declared that &#x201C;one who speaks evil of a scholar is doomed to &#x201C;Gehenna&#x201D; and that there were 24 instances when a court could excommunicate a person for showing disrespect to a scholar. <sup><xref rid="fn450">10)</xref></sup> &#x201C;He who teaches Torah to his son is like one who received the Torah from mount Horeb.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn451">11)</xref></sup> He also considered it to be a means of curing bodily ailments and he said: &#x201C;One who suffers from a headache should turn to study.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn452">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But although he wished every one to study he nevertheless said that slaves must not be taught, <sup><xref rid="fn453">13)</xref></sup> and he also believed that no scholar could discover anything new, for &#x201C;everything which a bright pupil will reveal before his master has already been said to Moses on Mount Sinai.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn454">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prayer he held to be of equal significance and he instructed his children to &#x201C;rise early and hasten in the evening to the synagogue and you will gain long life.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn455">15)</xref></sup> Every one should strive to be among the first ten to arrive at the synagogue, <sup><xref rid="fn456">16)</xref></sup> and at prayer one should stand by the wall. Likewise one should never pass by a synagogue when prayers are said without desiring to enter. <sup><xref rid="fn457">17)</xref></sup> He who answers Amen during Kadish is certain to have all decrees against him annulled, <sup><xref rid="fn458">18)</xref></sup> and when prayers come smoothly from one&#x2019;s lips, one may feel sure that they have been accepted. <sup><xref rid="fn459">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Repentance was then held to be of great merit and Rabbi Joshua said that &#x201C;the Jews have made the golden calf only in order to have an opportunity to repent and to demonstrate the power of repentance.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn460">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like many of his contemporaries Rabbi Joshua often disputed with the &#x201C;Minim&#x201D; (early Christians), but he based his arguments on sentiment rather than on logic. This gave rise to the opinion that his opposition to Hagada was a result of the fact that the &#x201C;Minim&#x201D; often used biblical passages to uphold their views. One of the &#x201C;Minim&#x201D; especially caused much trouble to Rabbi Joshua and he was ready to curse him, but he remembered that God had mercy on all his creatures and he refrained. <sup><xref rid="fn461">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following are characteristic statements of Rabbi Joshua:</p>
<p>He who slanders his neighbor is like one who has broken all the commandments of the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn462">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>For two great sins there is no forgiveness: for bloodshed and slander. <sup><xref rid="fn463">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>An honest man never utters an improper word. <sup><xref rid="fn464">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Money is of great value and even bastards are made acceptable with it. If one sees two families quarrelling and insulting each other, one of them is no doubt affected by some irregularity. <sup><xref rid="fn465">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Rabbi Joshua was of a delicate constitution and he had to wear shoes on the Day of Atonement, <sup><xref rid="fn466">26)</xref></sup> he nevertheless fasted two days in succession during the month of Ab&#x2014;the ninth and the tenth&#x2014;for the temple was burned on the tenth of Ab but it caught fire on the ninth. <sup><xref rid="fn467">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have previously mentioned the &#x201C;intimacy&#x201D; between Rabbi Joshua and Elijah which legends described. One of these legends relates that Rabbi Joshua once met Elijah at the mouth of the cave where Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai hid for thirteen years and he asked him when Messiah would come. Elijah replied that he would have to ask Messiah and Rabbi Joshua said: &#x201C;Did I but know where he is I would ask him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then Elijah said: &#x201C;He sits at the gate of the great city&#x201D; (referring to Antioch or Caesarea where the Romans had their camp). He also gave him a token whereby he could recognize him saying that Messiah sat among the sick beggars.</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua then approached Messiah and said to him: &#x201C;Peace be with you my lord and my teacher,&#x201D; and Messiah replied: &#x201C;Peace to you, son of Levi.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;When will the lord come?&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua asked, and Messiah answered: &#x201C;Today.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua returned to Elijah and related to him what Messiah had said. Elijah explained that the greeting of Messiah was an indication that both Rabbi Joshua and his father were assured of a share in the world to come. When Rabbi Joshua complained that Messiah had deceived him in saying that he would arrive on that day, Elijah informed him that he would have come that day, had every one obeyed the will of God as is indicated by the Biblical verse: &#x201C;This day, if you will heed his voice.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn468">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another legend related that a man had been devoured by a lion three miles from where Rabbi Joshua lived. This caused Elijah not to appear to R. Joshua for three days, because Elijah felt that R. Joshua should have prayed to God that such an occurrence should not have happened so near his home. <sup><xref rid="fn469">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Legend coupled the name of Rabbi Joshua with the prophet Elijah on still another occasion. A certain man, Ula ben Kushab, had incurred the anger of the Roman authorities and soldiers were sent to capture and to execute him. But this man hid in the house of Rabbi Joshua and the soldiers surrounded the city and threatened to destroy it, if the man was not handed over to them. Rabbi Joshua then persuaded the man to surrender to the Romans and thus save the city. He even pointed out that a law in the Mishna permitted surrendering a man to the government when a whole city was threatened as was the case at Abel when Joab besieged the city and the inhabitants gave him the head of Sheva ben Bichri who had revolted against king David.<xref rid="fn470">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>After Ula bar Kushab surrendered to the Romans, Elijah failed to appear to Rabbi Joshua for a long time. Rabbi Joshua then fasted a number of times and Elijah finally appeared to him. When he was asked why he did not appear for such a long time, Elijah replied: &#x201C;How could I appear before an informer?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Have I not acted according to the Mishna?&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua asked. But Elijah retorted: &#x201C;Is this a Mishna to be observed by pious people? A man like you should not have been involved in this matter.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn471">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua also maintained friendly relations with the angel of death whom he deceived when the latter came to take his soul. He asked the angel of death to show him his place in Paradise and the angel gave him his sword to carry on the way as a token that he would not harm him. When they reached the gate of Paradise, Rabbi Joshua jumped in alive. The angel of death seized his garment in an attempt to hold him back, but Rabbi Joshua escaped. The angel then begged for his sword, but Rabbi Joshua refused to return it until a Bath Kol commanded: &#x201C;Return the sword for the world needs it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Glad to have regained his sword, the angel of death departed and the prophet Elijah proceeded before Rabbi Joshua announcing: &#x201C;Make way for the son of Levi.&#x201D; As Rabbi Joshua looked about himself, he saw Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai seated on thirteen rugs of gold. Rabbi Simeon asked him: &#x201C;Are you the son of Levi?&#x201D; and Rabbi Joshua replied that he was. &#x201C;Has a rainbow been seen during your lifetime?&#x201D; Rabbi Simeon asked, and Rabbi Joshua answered that a rainbow was seen. &#x201C;Then you are not the son of Levi,&#x201D; Rabbi Simeon said, &#x201C;for your merit should have protected your generation so that no rainbow should be needed.&#x201D; As a matter of fact no rainbow was seen during the lifetime of Rabbi Joshua, which was the best proof of his piety, but he refused to boast of it. <sup><xref rid="fn472">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time Rabbi Joshua engaged in conversation with the angel of death and the latter instructed him to avoid three things in order to escape death. One of these was not to stop in front of women who return from a funeral, for the angel of death is then among them with his sword and he has permission to do harm. <sup><xref rid="fn473">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As was previously mentioned, Rabbi Joshua issued ordination without the consent of the Nasi. This was not a sign of opposition to the Nasi. He merely did not want to see Babylonia become a center of ordination, for it frequently happened that those who encountered difficulties in obtaining ordination in Palestine went to Babylonia to have themselves ordained. Rabbi Joshua therefore ruled that ordination obtained in foreign countries was not valid. <sup><xref rid="fn474">33)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua taught his own children and he was accustomed to hear his grandson repeat the portion of the week every Friday. This custom he strictly adhered to and said: &#x201C;He who hears his grandson read a chapter of the Torah is like one who heard the Torah from Mount Sinai.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn475">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Rabbi Joshua insisted that the Hagada should remain oral and declared that: &#x201C;Only once have I read a book of Hagada and since then I am afraid of evil dreams,&#x201D; Hagada nevertheless occupied a prominent place in his lectures and a great number of them were repeated in his name. He entrusted one of his disciples with the arrangement of the Hagadoth. <sup><xref rid="fn476">35)</xref></sup> Tanchum ben Chanilai, another one of his disciples, was considered to be an authority in Hagada and was always consulted by Rabbi Chiya. <sup><xref rid="fn477">36)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Biblical passage stating that all the days of a poor man are evil, Rabbi Joshua interpreted to indicate that any person who lacked wisdom, who was angry or who was covetous could be considered poor. Covetousness Rabbi Joshua considered to be the worst human trait and he said that &#x201C;whoever derives any benefit from a covetous person commits a sin, for king Solomon had commanded not to eat the bread of such a person.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn478">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the body of a slain person was found and it was not known who the slayer was, the Bible enjoined that the elders of the nearest city must slaughter a heifer and declare that their hands had not shed the blood of the slain man. This passage was questioned by Rabbi Joshua who said: &#x201C;Could anyone suspect the elders of shedding the blood? What then did they have to declare? They had to declare that they had not seen the man or they would not have let him depart without food and without an escort.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn479">38)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;When the enemy came to destroy the temple,&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua said, &#x201C;it was surrounded by six hundred thousand angels who were prepared to defend it. But when they saw that the Shechinah was indifferent to what the enemy was doing they also departed.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn480">39)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the temple was destroyed God called his angels and said to them: &#x201C;What does a mortal king do when his son dies?&#x201D; and the angels replied: &#x201C;He hangs a sack over his door.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thus will I also do,&#x201D; God answered, &#x201C;I will cover the skies with darkness and a sack shall be its garment.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Again God said to his angels: &#x201C;What does a mortal king do when he mourns for his family?&#x201D; and they replied: &#x201C;He puts out all the lamps in his house.&#x201D; &#x201C;Thus will I also do,&#x201D; God said, &#x201C;the sun and the moon shall become dark and the stars shall lose their brightness.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn481">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>God also says to the Jews: &#x201C;You have caused me to destroy my house and to exile my children, you should therefore at least pray for the peace of Jerusalem and I will forgive your sins.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn482">41)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;If the nations of the world knew,&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua said, &#x201C;that whenever Jews sin they are punished together with the Jews, they would assign two soldiers to every Jew to prevent him from sinning. Instead they even prevent Jews from observing the commandments. When Jews sin, the whole world is punished and when they refrain from sin the whole world is blessed for their sake.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn483">42)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time Rabbi Joshua said: &#x201C;Every prophet which the Jews had depended on the prophecy of others, with the exception of Moses. All prophecy which followed that of Moses was part of his. All the commandments which God gave on Mount Sinai were spoken to the Jews through the mouth of Moses with the exception of the first two which God pronounced himself.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn484">43)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua, who was on such &#x201C;intimate&#x201D; terms with the prophet Elijah and with the angel of death, once decided to visit Paradise and Gehenna. He spoke of this to the angel of death who was not at all pleased with this request. The angel of death complained to the then Nasi, Rabban Gamliel the Third, but Rabban Gamliel declared that Rabbi Joshua was right in his request and he commanded the angel of death to escort Rabbi Joshua. Rabban Gamliel also instructed the angel of death to request Rabbi Joshua to send a complete description of what he saw to the Nasi. The Nasi was particularly curious to know whether there were any Jews in Gehenna or any pagans in Paradise.</p>
<p>In his description what he saw, called &#x201C;Massecheth Gan Eden,&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua relates that he went throughout the length and breadth of Paradise which was divided into seven different parts. In one part of Paradise he found Elijah and the Messiah of the House of David, who asked him what the Jews were doing. Rabbi Joshua replied: &#x201C;They are waiting for your coming,&#x201D; whereupon Messiah wept bitterly and all the saints wept with him.</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua further relates that he was not admitted into Gehenna, but was merely allowed to stand at the gate and to observe that which went on within.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have measured the area of Gehenna,&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua wrote, &#x201C;and I found it to be one hundred miles long and fifty miles wide. Fiery lions are stationed everywhere and whoever falls into Gehenna is devoured by these lions and is afterward recreated in his previous form. Later I measured a second part of Gehenna and I found it to be of the same dimensions as the first. I then asked: &#x2018;For whom is the first part set aside?&#x2019; and I was informed that it was set apart for ten nations, and that among them was also Absalom, the son of king David, who rebelled against his father. One nation says to another: &#x2018;We have sinned in not accepting the Torah; what have you done?&#x2019; and the other nation replies: &#x2018;We have committed the same sin that you have committed.&#x2019; Then they all turn to Absalom and ask: &#x2018;What was your sin?&#x2019; and Absalom replies: &#x2018;I have sinned against my father.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;An angel then beats them all with fiery rods and the name of the angel is Kushiel. He throws them into fire until they are burned and then they come out in their previous form. Finally the angel is ready to chastise Absalom, but a Bath Kol announces: &#x2018;Do not beat him, for he is descended from a people which promised at Mount Sinai to obey God&#x2019;s commandments before they even knew what these commandments would be.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;After all the sinners are chastised and burned, they emerge from the fire as if nothing had happened. This occurs seven times during each day and three times during each night. Only Absalom is neither chastised nor burned and his punishment consists in observing the others&#x2019; chastisement.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Of the second chamber of Gehenna Rabbi Joshua related the same as of the first. It also contained ten nations which were punished in the same manner as those in the first. Together with them was Doeg the Edomite who had been a guard of king Saul. The avenging angel was named Lahatiel and he did not chastise Doeg because of his Jewish descent. In the third chamber there were another ten nations and the name of the angel was Shaftiel. Korach and his congregation was found among these, but he also escaped chastisement and merely had to observe the punishment of the others.</p>
<p>The fourth chamber contained ten nations and Jerobeam ben Nebat. The punishing angel was Machtiel. Jerobeam escaped punishment because of his knowledge of the Torah and because of his descent. The fifth chamber was similar to the preceding ones and it contained Ahab, king of Israel. The name of the angel was Chutriel. The sixth chamber contained Micah who built the famous idol of Micah. He was punished together with the others by an angel named Pusiel. The seventh chamber also contained ten nations and Elisha ben Avuyah. The name of the angel was Dalkiel.</p>
<p>Of his visit in Paradise Rabbi Joshua also related the following:</p>
<p>&#x201C;There are two gates of clear crystal and on top of each there stand six hundred thousand angels each of whose faces shines like the sky. When a saint enters they remove the garments in which he was buried and they dress him with eight new garments made out of clouds. Two crowns are then placed upon his head, one made out of precious stones and the other of pure gold; in addition they place eight strands of myrtle in his hands and they say to him: &#x2018;Go eat your bread in gladness.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He is then led to a place of rivers surrounded with flowers. A canopy of gold is erected and from the canopy there flow four rivers: one of oil, one of milk, one of wine and one of honey. Every canopy has a golden vine on top of it from which hang thirty pearls which shine like the morning star. To every canopy is attached a table laden with precious stones and pearls and sixty angels stand ready to serve every saint and they say to him: &#x2018;Eat your honey and drink your wine, for it has been prepared for you since the six days of the creation.&#x2019; Even the least of the saints equals Rabbi Jochanan in beauty and is endowed with grace like that of Joseph.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There is no night in Paradise, and each day is divided into four parts. During the first part God comes to the children and plays with them as one would with children; during the second part God comes to the young men and plays with them as one would with young men; during the third part God comes to the middle aged men and plays with them as one would with middle aged people; during the fourth part of the day God comes to the aged and converses with them as one would with aged people.&#x201D;</p>
<p> &#x201C;There are eighty thousand trees in every corner of Paradise and the least of them is more beautiful than incense trees. There are also six hundred thousand angels in every corner and they all sing the praise of the Creator.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the very center of Paradise there stands the Tree of Life whose branches cover all of Paradise. Its fruits have five hundred thousand tastes and each taste differs from all the others and each odor differs from all the others. Above the Tree of Life there float seven sacred clouds; breezes blow from all four sides through the leaves of the Tree of Life and its odors are wafted from one end of the world to the other.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The saints in Paradise are subdivided into seven groups. One group consists of martyrs such as Rabbi Akiba and his colleagues and disciples; the second group consists of those who were drowned for the sanctification of the name of God such as the four hundred young men and the four hundred maidens who jumped into the sea when the enemy wished to sell them to a life of shame; the third group consists of people like Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai and his colleagues; the fourth group consists of people whom the enemy wanted to defame after their death and a cloud descended and covered them; the fifth group is made up of penitents; the sixth group consists of young men who never sinned, and the seventh group includes modest people who suffered humiliation without replying in kind.&#x201D;</p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani</title>
<p>A<small>FTER THE PERIOD OF THE BLOSSOMING OF LEARNING</small> in Palestine during the lifetime of Rabbi Jochanan and Resh Lakish a decline set in. This decline had been apparent for some time and was becoming more noticeable daily. A descendant of Hillel still occupied the office of Nasi and was thus the legal representative of the people. But the later N&#x2019;siim were not noted for scholarly achievements and the veneration of the people toward them diminished. In time they lost all spiritual authority.</p>
<p><xref rid="fn485">&#x002A;</xref>Rabbi Shmuel Bar-Nachmani was one of the spiritual leaders of the people during this period. He left few legal decisions, but he was one of the most prominent exponents of the Hagada. He repeated hundreds of Hagadic statements of previous &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; and his disciples quoted hundreds of his own interpretations. All questions pertaining to Hagada during his lifetime were always referred to him for clarification. <sup><xref rid="fn486">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuel Bar-Nachmani was born in Palestine and while still a child his grandfather often carried him on his shoulders through Beth Shean on his way to Kefar Chanan that he should see the scholars at study and that he should absorb the sound of their voices. This took place during the last days of Rabbi Jehudah haNasi and it was then an accepted belief that a child which looked at Rabbi Jehudah or was in his presence for a few minutes was certain to become a scholar.</p>
<p>Another legend related that Rabbi Shmuel was born in Babylonia and only came to Palestine to ask of Rabbi Jonathan the meaning of three verses in the Bible concerning which he was in doubt. But this apparent contradiction may be explained by the fact that Rabbi Shmuel spent his youth in Babylonia, where favorable circumstances prevailed, and that he later returned to Palestine. Rabbi Shmuel visited Babylonia a number of times at the request of the High Court of Palestine in order to determine &#x201C;leap years&#x201D; when that could not be done in Palestine. On one of these trips he spent a night in the house of Rabbi Jacob the Miller. That night Rabbi Zeira hid among the barrels in the house in order to hear Rabbi Shmuel recite the &#x201C;Shema&#x201D; and he later told that Rabbi Shmuel repeated the Shema many times until he was overcome by sleep. <sup><xref rid="fn487">2)</xref></sup> Rabbi Shmuel is also known to have been sent, together with his mother, to intercede with queen Zenobia for the life of a political offender.</p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuel Bar-Nachmani lived for more than one hundred years and the time of his influence extended from the days of Rabbi Jonathan, whose pupil he had been, until the rule of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the Second. It appears that the Nasi did not approve of Rabbi Shmuel and when he once asked him the interpretation of the expression &#x201C;by his name Jah&#x201D; (Psalms, 68:4), he was dissatisfied with the reply and remarked: &#x201C;It is regrettable that those scholars who could interpret this passage better are already dead.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn488">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At that time there broke out a famine and an epidemic and the people were at a loss for the deliverance of which of the calamities they were to pray. Rabbi Shmuel advised them to pray for the cessation of the famine, for &#x201C;when God will give us food, He will also grant us life during which to enjoy the food.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn489">4)</xref></sup>. He also instructed that teachers should dismiss their pupil from eleven o&#x2019;clock in the morning until three in the afternoon during the time between the seventeenth day of Tamuz and the ninth day of Ab, for this was a difficult period for the pupils who might lose their health from too great effort. <sup><xref rid="fn490">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Shmuel grew old and realized that the Nasi did not regard him favorably he but rarely attended the academy. During one of his infrequent visits he found the scholars debating the request of a man to annul an excommunication which was imposed upon him by Rabbi Jehudah ben Ezekiel. Since R. Jehudah was dead at that time the scholars were inclined to consider favorably the petition of the man. But Rabbi Shmuel said: &#x201C;The maidservant of Rabbi Jehudah haNasi once banned a man who had beaten his grown up son and the scholars honored her decision; would you revoke the excommunication of our comrade Rabbi Jehudah?&#x201D; His opinion was then accepted and the ban was not lifted. <sup><xref rid="fn491">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following are characteristic expressions of Rabbi Shmuel:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Everything in the world was created by God, except falsehood which is an outgrowth of human imagination.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn492">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After completing the creation of the world God saw everything that He had made and &#x201C;it was very good.&#x201D; Rabbi Shmuel declared that &#x201C;very good&#x201D; referred to man&#x2019;s evil desires, for if it were not for these no man would build a house, nor marry a wife, nor beget children, nor engage in commerce. <sup><xref rid="fn493">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuel devoted himself to classifying the prayers. One must pray thrice daily, he said, to conform with the three changes which occur every day. In the morning one should say: &#x201C;I thank Thee my God and God of my fathers for bringing me out of darkness into light.&#x201D; In the afternoon one should say: &#x201C;May it be Thy will to permit me to see the sun in the West even as You allowed me to see it in the East.&#x201D; At night one should pray: &#x201C;May it be Thy will to lead me out of darkness into the light even as You had led me out of darkness into light before.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn494">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuel lived during the last years of the third century C.E., when the Christians began the attempt to postpone the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday. Rabbi Shmuel opposed this effort with all his might and he warned the Jews against assuming that the Sabbath could be postponed to another day. &#x201C;Why did God bless the Sabbath?&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;because it may never be postponed to another day. Holidays and even the Day of Atonement may be postponed, when a leap year is declared, but not the Sabbath.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn495">10</xref></sup> <xref rid="fn496">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Some of the Amoraim believed that Sabbaths and holidays were to be devoted to the study of the Torah solely, while others allowed half of these days to be utilized for personal enjoyment. <sup><xref rid="fn497">11)</xref></sup> But Rabbi Shmuel declared that the Sabbath should be devoted to food and drink and that only in order to avoid idle talk was it allowed also to engage in study on that day. <sup><xref rid="fn498">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The verse &#x201C;Many waters cannot quench love&#x201D; (Song of Songs, 8:7) Rabbi Shmuel interpreted in the following manner: Two kinds of love are referred to, the love of God for Israel which is so great that were all the nations of the world to try to thwart it, they could not do so, and the love of Israel for the Torah. Were all the nations to say: &#x201C;We will sell all our possessions in order to observe the Torah and its commandments,&#x201D; God would reply to them: &#x201C;Even if you were to sell all your possessions to obtain the Torah, you would only be ridiculed.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn499">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The destruction of the Temple played an important role in the mode of thought of Rabbi Shmuel. Nearly two centuries had already elapsed since the destruction and none thought about sacrifices any longer. Many of the scholars of the time disapproved of sacrifices or had ignored the matter. The express commandments of the Torah to offer sacrifices, they easily refuted with passages from the Prophets such as the statement of Jeremiah that &#x201C;I spoke not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices&#x201D; (7:22). But the Temple remained a symbol of the liberation of the people and it was always mentioned with the hope of its speedy restoration and the renewal of the service as in days of old. It is also interesting to note that the people feared to speak of the second temple and they therefore always referred to the first temple. They spoke of Babylonians, but meant the Romans, they referred to Nebusaradon or Nebuchadnezzar, but really meant Titus or the reigning emperor.</p>
<p>Like other scholars Rabbi Shmuel also spoke of the destruction of the Temple in his lectures. Many such lectures are included in the introduction to &#x201C;Midrash Eicha Rabathi&#x201D; and these describe how Jeremiah went to the graves of the Patriarchs and begged them to intercede with God. It was characteristic of the times that the belief was commonly held that Rachel rose from her grave and wept at the fate of her children. Her weeping aroused pity in heaven and she was assured that they would soon be redeemed from the land of the enemy. (Jeremiah, 31:14.) Such descriptions delivered by good orators profoundly impressed the people.</p>
<p>&#x201C;After the Temple was destroyed,&#x201D; Rabbi Shmuel said, &#x201C;Abraham came to the throne of glory; he was weeping and tearing his hair; his garments were torn and he was covered with ashes. Thus he went about and called upon God: &#x2018;Am I worse than other fathers that I should suffer such shame?&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;When the Angels saw Abraham they also wept and when God asked them why they wept, they said: &#x2018;The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth, he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.&#x2019; &#x201D; (Isaiah, 33:8.)</p>
<p>&#x201C;God thereupon answered and said: &#x2018;Since my friend Abraham has left the world, he has not come to see the welfare of my house, Why then does he come now?&#x2019; and Abraham replied: &#x2018;Why have you exiled my children and handed them over to barbaric peoples who slay them with numerous kinds of deaths? Why have you allowed the Temple, the place where I offered my son for the sake of Thy great name, to be destroyed?&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C; &#x2018;Your children have sinned,&#x2019; God replied to Abraham, &#x2018;they have not observed the commandments of my Torah and they transgressed against the 22 sacred letters of the Torah.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C; &#x2018;Who will bear witness against my children that they have not observed the commandments, or that they transgressed against its 22 sacred letters?&#x2019; Abraham asked.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C; &#x2018;The Torah is the best witness,&#x2019; God replied.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Torah then came out and was ready to testify against the Jews, but Abraham said: &#x2018;Daughter, you wish to testify against the Jews that they did not observe your commandments? Are you not ashamed of such testimony? Do you not remember the day, when God carried you among all the nations and they refused to accept you until my children came to Mount Sinai and they accepted you with honor? Will you now testify against them in the hour of their affliction?&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;When the Torah heard this, it stepped aside and God called upon the 22 letters to come and testify. The first of these was &#x2018;Aleph&#x2019; and Abraham said to it: &#x201C;You, who are the first letter of the Alphabet, come to testify against my children? When God appeared on Mount Sinai and offered the ten commandments which begin with an Aleph, no people would accept you until my children did; would you now testify against them?&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;In shame the Aleph stepped aside and the Beth came up to testify. To it Abraham said: &#x2018;You would testify against my children, who accepted the Pentateuch which begins with a Beth?&#x2019; In shame the Beth stepped aside and the Gimel came forward, and Abraham addressed it: &#x2018;God&#x2019;s commandment <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D2;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;&#x05F4;</span> (Deutr. 22, 12), which begins with a Gimel, was rejected by all nations until my children accepted it; would you testify against them?&#x2019; After the Gimel appeared the Daled and again Abraham said: &#x2018;Will you testify against my children? When God told Moses, Speak to the children of Israel, which begins with a Daled&#x2014;did they not heed him?&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;In shame the Daled also stepped aside and when the other letters saw that Abraham shamed them, they refused to testify against the Jews. Then Abraham said: &#x2018;Lord of the world&#x0021; When I was 100 years old, you gave me a son and when he reached the age of 37 you commanded me to offer him to you as a sacrifice. I then hardened my heart and I showed no mercy to him in order to fulfill your wish. Now you have forgotten all that and you showed no mercy toward my children.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;After these words Moses came and he said to God: &#x2018;Lord of the world&#x0021; Have I not been like a good shepherd to your people? Like a horse I ran before them in the desert, but when the time came to enter the Land of Israel you decreed that I should die in the desert. Now I am called to mourn over their affliction.&#x2019; Then Moses said to Jeremiah: &#x2018;Proceed, and I will go with you, for I wish to see who will dare do harm to the Jews.&#x2019; But Jeremiah replied: &#x2018;I cannot go, for the road is covered with corpses and I am a Priest.&#x2019; Moses then said to him: &#x2018;Come, for I have commanded you.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Moses and Jeremiah came to the rivers of Babylon and when the Jews saw Moses, they exclaimed: &#x2018;The son of Amram has risen from his grave to redeem us from our enemies.&#x2019; But a Bath-Kol was heard to declare: &#x2018;It is a decree which cannot be changed.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then Moses said to the people: &#x2018;My dear children, I cannot redeem you; I can only pray to God that he should soon return you to your land.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;When the Jews heard these words, they wept bitterly and the sound of their weeping shook the seven heavens The angels, the sun, the moon and the stars wept with them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Moses returned to the Patriarchs to tell them of what the enemy had done to their children and he said: &#x2018;Some of them are killed and some had their arms broken and bound behind their backs, some were burdened with heavy chains and were driven naked over mountains and valleys, while others died on the way and their bodies were left to be devoured by birds and beasts of prey. Still others were left on the sands of the desert with their eyes gouged out to await their death.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;When they heard this, the Patriarchs wept and mourned: &#x2018;Woe, what has befallen our orphans that hungry and naked they must wander in the lands of their enemies, woe that they must climb high mountains and must wound their feet on rocks and boulders, woe that they must carry heavy sacks of sand on their delicate backs, woe that their arms have been broken and their eyes gouged, woe that their throats are parched with thirst, woe that God could witness the slaughter of children before the eyes of their mothers and the death of mothers before the eyes of their children.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Moses then turned to the Sun and said: &#x2018;Be cursed, Sun, that you were not darkened when the enemies entered the Temple&#x0021;&#x2019; and the Sun replied: &#x2018;I swear to you, Moses, by the name of the Eternal One, that I wanted to hide among the clouds in order not to light the way of the enemy, but I was beaten with fiery rods and I was commanded to do my duty.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then Rachel came weeping bitterly and when the sound of her weeping was heard a voice from heaven announced: &#x2018;Cease weeping, for your children will soon return from the land of their enemies to their own home.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Simlai bar Aba</title>
<p>L<small>IKE</small> R<small>ABBI</small> S<small>HMUEL BAR</small> N<small>ACHMANI</small>, Rabbi Simlai was also a master of Hagadic interpretation. Hundreds of these are quoted in the Babylonian Talmud in his name, but the Jerusalem Talmud contains only one Hagadic quotation from Rabbi Simlai. <sup><xref rid="fn500">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simlai was born in Babylonia in the city of Nehardea. The exact location of this city is unknown aside from the fact that it was situated on the river Malka, somewhere between the Tigris and the Euphrates. It is also known that Jews began to settle in that city several decades after the destruction of the Temple. Various horrifying stories were at first told about Nehardea, but later it became known as the seat of prominent academies which rivalled those in Jabneh and Tiberias.</p>
<p>Rabbi Simlai&#x2019;s father was always referred to as &#x201C;Aba, the father of Rabbi Simlai.&#x201D; However, he was a significant man in his own right and it was related that he once asked Shmuel Yarchinai, the mathematician of the Talmud, a question pertaining to the determination of &#x201C;leap years&#x201D; which the latter could not answer despite the fact that he had boasted that he could calculate the beginning of each month without recourse to the testimony of witnesses who had seen the new moon. On this occasion the father of Rabbi Simlai is said to have remarked: &#x201C;If you cannot answer this question, then it is entirely possible that there are other matters which you do not know.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn501">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Simlai arrived in Palestine he settled in Lud, but later he moved to Galilee where he spent most of the time in the city of the residence of the Nasi. Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the First was Nasi at the time of his arrival. The following conversation is said to have taken place between the two, as the Nasi once leaned on the shoulder of Rabbi Simlai during a stroll: &#x201C;Yesterday you were absent from the academy when we permitted the use of oil bought from Gentiles,&#x201D; the Nasi said and Rabbi Simlai replied: &#x201C;I will yet live to see the day when you will permit the use of Gentile bread.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn502">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>This new regulation was announced in Babylonia by a pupil of Rabbi Simlai, although it is also possible that Rabbi Simlai himself was delegated by the Nasi to announce the new regulation. <sup><xref rid="fn503">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In later life Rabbi Simlai served Rabbi Jannai the Old <sup><xref rid="fn504">5)</xref></sup> and he was also a close friend of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the Second. <sup><xref rid="fn505">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>His debates with the &#x201C;Minim&#x201D; (Christian Jews), who annoyed him with various questions, are interesting. Since the Hebrew word &#x201C;Elohim&#x201D; (God) is in the plural form, the Minim asked him, how many gods shared in the creation of the world. Rabbi Simlai replied that the further text amply answered their question; thus the Bible says: &#x201C;Let us make man in our image&#x201D; (in the plural) and this is followed by &#x201C;God created man in his own image&#x201D; (in the singular). When his pupils said that it was easy to give such an answer to the &#x201C;Minim,&#x201D; but that they were not satisfied with it, he replied that the plural was used, because Adam was created out of earth and Eve out of Adam&#x2019;s rib, but in the future no increase could be had by man without woman or by woman without man, and both need the assistance of God.</p>
<p>Another time the &#x201C;Minim&#x201D; asked him why the phrase &#x201C;Elohim Kedoshim&#x201D; (holy gods, in the plural) was employed in the Bible, and Rabbi Simlai replied that the subsequent phrase &#x201C;Elohim Hu&#x201D; (He is God) was a sufficient answer. To his pupils he explained that the plural was used to indicate that God was holy with all kinds of holiness.</p>
<p>The number of commandments in the Torah is 613 and whoever transgresses even against one commandment is considered to have broken all of them. The Prophets sought to diminish the number of commandments and Hillel tried to express the essence of the Torah in one phrase: &#x201C;Do not unto others what you would not have done unto you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Simlai said: &#x201C;The 613 commandments consist of 365 negative ones, equal to the number of days in the year, and of 248 positive commandments, equal to the number of limbs in the human body.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn506">7)</xref></sup> One of Rabbi Simlai&#x2019;s pupils amplified this statement and said: &#x201C;The number of positive commandments is equal to the number of limbs in a human body, because every limb implores man to commit a good deed. The number of negative commandments is equal to the number of days in the year, according to the reckoning of the sun, because each day implores man not to commit a sin during its time.</p>
<p>Another general statement of Rabbi Simlai declared: &#x201C;The Torah begins with an act of kindness and ends with an act of kindness. When Adam and Eve realized their nakedness and were ashamed, God made them coats of skins. When Moses died on Mount Nebo and no one was with him to bury him, God buried Moses.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn507">8)</xref></sup> Later Rabbi Simlai somewhat changed his interpretation and said: &#x201C;One who would realize the kindness of God should consult the Torah and he will see that the first act of God was to adorn Eve as one adorns a bride when he led her before Adam. God adorns all brides as he adorned Eve; He visits the sick as He visited Abraham; He buries the dead as He buried Moses.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn508">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;The Bible says: &#x201C;Remember the day of Sabbath to consecrate it&#x201D; and also &#x201C;Observe the day of Sabbath.&#x201D; Rabbi Simlai explained that one should remember the Sabbath before it comes and he should observe it after it had come. How can this be done? Every time one sees a good object or a new vessel, he should reserve it for the Sabbath. <sup><xref rid="fn509">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Economic conditions in Palestine were very poor at that time and the population was so impoverished that no one possessed good garments. As Rabbi Simlai once explained the commandment to prepare special garments for Sabbath, the people wept, for they could not afford such a luxury. Rabbi Simlai then said: &#x201C;If one does not have a good garment to wear on Saturday, he should at least wear a different garment; even though it be torn it should be different from the one worn on week days.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn510">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;When Messiah will come,&#x201D; Rabbi Simlai said, &#x201C;God will take a book of the Torah in his arms and He will say: &#x2018;Whoever devoted himself to the study of the Torah, let him come and receive his reward.&#x2019; All the nations will then come together, but God will say to them, &#x2018;Let each nation come separately.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The first to come before God will be Edom (Rome) and He will ask them: &#x2018;What have you done in the world?&#x2019; and they will reply: &#x2018;We paved highways; we built many bath houses; we gathered much silver and gold. All this we did for the sake of Your Jews that they might devote themselves to the Torah.&#x2019; God will then answer them: &#x2018;Fools that you are. All that you did, you did for yourself. You paved streets that you might settle your harlots there; you built bath houses that you might anoint your bodies; you gathered gold and silver which belongs to me. But you did not study the Torah and you will receive no reward.&#x2019; The sons of Edom will then leave with bowed heads.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;After them will come the Persians and God will ask them: &#x2018;What have you done?&#x2019; and they will reply: &#x201C;We have built many bridges; we have conquered many cities; we have waged many wars. All this we did for the sake of the Jews, that they might have time to devote themselves to the Torah.&#x2019; To them God will say: &#x2018;All that you did, you did for yourself. You built bridges to collect tolls; you conquered cities to collect taxes; your wars I waged for you, but you did not study the Torah, then why do you seek reward?&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But the Persians will refuse to leave empty handed and they will say: &#x2018;Have you offered the Torah to us and we have rejected it?&#x2019; and God will reply: &#x2018;Seven commandments I gave to the sons of Noah and you have not observed them.&#x2019; The Persians will ask further: &#x2018;Have the Jews observed the seven commandments?&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C; &#x2018;I will call your own witnesses,&#x2019; God will answer, &#x2018;and you shall see that they have observed my commandments. Let Nimrod testify concerning Abraham that he did not worship idols; let Laban testify that he did not suspect Jacob of robbery; let Potiphar&#x2019;s wife testify that Joseph was not persuaded to sin; let Nebuchadnezzar testify concerning Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, that they refused to bow before an idol; let Darius testify concerning Daniel that he refused to interrupt his prayer.&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn511">12)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> E<small>LAZAR BEN</small> P<small>EDATH</small> occupied a prominent place among those who came to Palestine from Babylonia during the second and third generations of the &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D;. He is very seldom referred to by his patronymic and nothing is known of the position of his father in Jewish life.</p>
<p>Although he was not ordained, when he arrived in Palestine, he was then well versed in learning. <sup><xref rid="fn512">1)</xref></sup> While still in Babylonia he was a pupil of Rav (Aba Arecha), whose legal opinions he later quoted. <sup><xref rid="fn513">2)</xref></sup> Later he was a disciple of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama and scores of statements in the Talmud begin with the words: &#x201C;Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Chanina.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar always named the authors of the opinions which he quoted even when these were commonly known as in the case of the statement which declared that: &#x201C;He who repeats a word in the name of its authors brings redemption to the world.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn514">3)</xref></sup> It is therefore incomprehensible that Rabbi Jochanan complained about Rabbi Elazar that he appropriated statements of others. <sup><xref rid="fn515">4)</xref></sup> This attitude of reverence toward authorship also caused a dispute between Rabbi Elazar and Resh Lakish, when he heard the latter state a law which he had previously heard from Rabbi Jochanan. <sup><xref rid="fn516">5)</xref></sup> In the popular mind Rabbi Elazar was considered to be a disciple of Rabbi Jochanan, although he denied it, and when a colleague of his referred to &#x201C;your master R. Jochanan&#x201D; he remarked: &#x201C;not my master nor our master.&#x201D; We also find an instance in the Talmud that Rabbi Jochanan complained against Rabbi Elazar for not greeting him. <sup><xref rid="fn517">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We may assume that a personal misunderstanding existed between Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Jochanan, although no specific mention of it is made anywhere in the Talmud. But we do find reference to an attempt by Rabbi Jochanan to discuss the &#x201C;mysteries of the chariot&#x201D; with Rabbi Elazar which the latter turned down on the grounds of being &#x201C;too young to discuss this matter.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn518">7)</xref></sup> Another time Rabbi Jochanan exclaimed: &#x201C;It is a pleasure to observe Ben Pedath while lecturing. It seems as if Moses is expounding that which he heard from the mouth of God.&#x201D; But to this Resh Lakish remarked: &#x201C;He does not speak his own words. He merely repeats what he read in a Boraitha.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn519">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar earned his livelihood from testing coins. <sup><xref rid="fn520">9)</xref></sup> This occupation provided him with an insufficient income and he lived in great want. Once, after he bled himself and there was not a crust of bread in his house, he ate a piece of garlic for want of something better and fainted. While swooning he asked God how much longer he would have to suffer want, but God replied: &#x201C;Would you have me upset the world in order that you might be born in a more lucky hour?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn521">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the original statements of Rabbi Elazar in the Talmud we gather that he was gifted with noble qualities. Thus he declared that &#x201C;humility adds to one&#x2019;s life.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn522">11)</xref></sup> In his personal life he was always humble and he never prided himself on his learning before others. <sup><xref rid="fn523">12)</xref></sup> His love for the Torah was indescribable <sup><xref rid="fn524">13)</xref></sup> and he often said: &#x201C;Just as a child must be nursed by its mother every hour during the day even so should every man devote each hour of the day to the Torah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn525">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The great poverty of Rabbi Elazar was well known to the Nasi who sometimes sent him gifts to alleviate his need, but Rabbi Elazar always refused to accept these. When he was invited to attend a feast at the house of the Nasi he also refused to attend. <sup><xref rid="fn526">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Charity,&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar said, &#x201C;atones for all sins and is more important than sacrifices.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn527">15a)</xref></sup> &#x201C;It may be compared to armor; just as armor is made up of small pieces, in charity one adds penny to penny until there is formed a considerable sum.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn528">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Great trust was therefore placed in Rabbi Elazar and he was entrusted with the feeding of the poor. <sup><xref rid="fn529">17)</xref></sup> It was then observed that in distributing charity, he sought to make the recipients feel as if they were not receiving charity. When Rabbi Elazar was made head of the distribution of charity he also had to collect taxes from the Jews. He then asked Rabbi Jochanan whether taxes should be levied according to wealth or according to the number of persons in a family. Rabbi Jochanan replied that taxes should be levied according to one&#x2019;s wealth. <sup><xref rid="fn530">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>His hatred of charity was so great that Rabbi Elazar said: &#x201C;When Noah sent out a dove to see whether the waters of the flood had receded, it returned with an olive leaf in its beak. By this it implied that food bitter as an olive leaf obtained from the hand of God, is to be preferred to food sweet as honey which is obtained at the hand of man.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn531">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar was not the only needy scholar at that time. Due to the difficult economic circumstances there were many such. Among these was also Rabbi Simeon bar Aba. It was related that Rabbi Elazar once lost a ducat which was found by Rabbi Simeon, but he refused to take it back declaring that he had already given up the search for it. <sup><xref rid="fn532">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following the death of Rabbi Jochanan, Rabbi Elazar was elected representative of the academy and since that time the Babylonians began to call him &#x201C;The lord of the Land of Israel.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn533">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have previously mentioned that the Babylonians were not held in high repute in Palestine and they therefore prided themselves on their countryman Rabbi Elazar. Since he was everywhere recognized as an authority, they appealed to him in all matters and he instructed them in all problems of things which are prohibited or permissible and also in money matters. <sup><xref rid="fn534">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his teachings Rabbi Elazar followed logical reason in his attempts to find the correct interpretations and to explain apparent contradictions. He did not fear to differ from the interpretations of others and his opinions were at times even contrary to the obvious meaning of the Mishna. <sup><xref rid="fn535">23)</xref></sup> When he sought to establish the original intentions of various laws, he set up rules which were later accepted by other scholars. These rules included the following: &#x201C;One must not add to a biblical decree or to its structure.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn536">24)</xref></sup> &#x201C;One may not declare an unclean thing to be clean nor a clean object to be unclean.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn537">25)</xref></sup> &#x201C;Everything which derives its importance from certain circumstances loses its importance when these circumstances cease to exist.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn538">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As soon as Rabbi Elazar came to Palestine, he established close relations with the scholars of that time. He particularly respected Rabbi Chiya whose opinions served as his guide, <sup><xref rid="fn539">27)</xref></sup> and it was accepted that the opinions of the two would always coincide. <sup><xref rid="fn540">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar expressed his love for Palestine in the following statements: &#x201C;He who lives in Palestine, is without sin,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn541">29)</xref></sup> and &#x201C;Happy are they who live in Palestine, for they have no sins either in life or in death.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn542">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath instructed the Babylonian Jews to observe strictly all holidays for the duration of two days, as it was the law at the Diaspora. <sup><xref rid="fn543">31)</xref></sup> The problem of the second day of a holiday was then an important matter for the Jews of Babylonia. This custom of celebrating an extra day was introduced during the time when messengers of the Palestine High Court could not be sent to inform the Babylonians of the beginning of a new month. Although the Babylonian Jews could have determined the new months themselves, because they also followed the lunar calendar, the Exilarch nevertheless added an extra day to all holidays for fear that his calculations might differ from those of the High Court in Palestine. But at times the Romans relaxed their vigilance and the messengers were free to announce the findings of the High Court, at such times the Babylonian Jews would ignore the extra added day. It was for this reason that Rabbi Elazar instructed all Jews who lived outside of Palestine to observe the second day of the holidays.</p>
<p>On another occasion he sent the following message to Babylonia: &#x201C;Attend to the cleanliness of your bodies; strive to study in company and be careful in your treatment of poor children, for only from them the Torah will issue.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn544">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Little is known of the achievements of Rabbi Elazar as head of the academy at Tiberias. We do know that, aside from the few Halachoth in the formulation of which he participated, he was one of the outstanding exponents of Hagada. His Hagadic statements were of such deep significance that their value remained permanent and it was also unimportant what biblical text he based them on, for he used the texts merely to bring out his ideas.</p>
<p>Thus he declared that one who returns from a journey must rest for three days before he can keep his mind on his prayers. He proved this by the fact that when Ezra came to the river Ahavah, on the way to Palestine, he rested for three days before he declared a fast and prayed to God to guide his steps. When he arrived in Jerusalem he also waited for three days before he commenced his work. <sup><xref rid="fn545">33)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The statement of Hannah to Eli (Sam. I., 1:16), &#x201C;Esteem not thy handmaid as a daughter of Belial,&#x201D; he compared to the &#x201C;Bnei Belial&#x201D; mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and he concluded that &#x201C;the prayer of a drunken man may be compared to idol worshipping&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn546">34)</xref></sup> Another example of his method of interpretation is found in his declaration that there can be no other punishment for a man who lifts his hand against neighbor except being buried. This he based on the verse that the earth belonged to men of strong arms. <sup><xref rid="fn547">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of charity Rabbi Elazar said: &#x201C;As long as the Temple existed, a man could give a shekel for a sacrifice and his sins were forgiven; but now that the Temple is destroyed, it is best that one should give for charity, for if he will not give charity to Jews, pagans will take his possessions by force.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn548">36)</xref></sup> On another occasion he similarly declared that &#x201C;if a poor man requires aid, it should be given to him even on the Sabbath.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn549">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of those who sought to obtain charity when they did not need it, Rabbi Elazar said: &#x201C;We should be thankful to these, for were it not for these swindlers, any man who refused to give charity when asked, would be punished at once. As it is, such a person can claim that he suspected the applicant for charity of being a swindler.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn550">38)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Why did God create human fingers in their present shape?&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar asked. &#x201C;It was done in order that a man might plug his ears when he hears improper words,&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar himself explained. <sup><xref rid="fn551">39)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking of God&#x2019;s consideration for human weaknesses, Rabbi Elazar said: &#x201C;If a man insults his neighbor and later wishes to conciliate him, the insulted man may demand a retraction in the presence of those people who witnessed the insult. But when a man sins against God in public, he may repent in private.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn552">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At times Rabbi Elazar discussed the evil nature of man and he said: &#x201C;He who ridicules others will be punished with suffering,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn553">41)</xref></sup> and &#x201C;he who is arrogant toward others, deserves to be cut down like a tree, for he causes the Shechinah to sorrow and in the end he will be as low as dust.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn554">42)</xref></sup></p>
<p>More than arrogance Rabbi Elazar despised flattery and he said: &#x201C;A flatterer brings down the anger of God upon the world. Even children in their mother&#x2019;s womb curse him and he is doomed to Gehenna. He who flatters a wicked man, will be delivered into his hand, if he escapes his hand, he is sure to be delivered into the hands of the children or the grandchildren of the wicked man.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn555">43)</xref></sup> &#x201C;If a whole congregation is afflicted with flattery,&#x201D; he added, &#x201C;it may be compared to an unclean woman and in the end it will be exiled.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn556">44)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;He who departs from his word is like an idol worshipper,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn557">45)</xref></sup> and &#x201C;one who deceives with words, is worse than one who deceives with money.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn558">46)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;A man who owns no land may not be considered a man, for the Bible said, &#x2018;The earth He gave to the people.&#x2019; &#x201D; All artisans will in the end return to the soil despite the fact that there is no ruder work than tilling the soil. But although tilling the soil is of great importance, the position of the merchants is much more favorable. <sup><xref rid="fn559">47)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Working for one&#x2019;s livelihood,&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar said, &#x201C;may be compared to working for the redemption. Just as redemption will be achieved through miracles, even so does one gain his livelihood miraculously, and just as one has to earn his livelihood daily, even so may he expect redemption daily.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn560">48)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar had a high opinion of married life and he said: &#x201C;One who is not married may not be considered a man. Thus we find that God named man after He had created both male and female.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn561">49)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking of human intelligence he said: &#x201C;A man without intelligence deserves no pity, and he who gives his bread to a fool will suffer in the end and will be driven out of his home.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn562">50)</xref></sup></p>

<title>Rabbi Avahu of Caesaria</title>
<p>A<small>T THAT TIME</small> C<small>HRISTIANITY BEGAN</small> to spread throughout Palestine as a result of the encouragement which it received from the Roman officials who were inclined to favor it more than they favored the Jewish teachings under the direct protection of the government. Those who steadfastly clung to the Jewish faith found themselves persecuted by their own brothers as well as by the government.</p>
<p>Rabbi Avahu of Caesarea lived during this period. He was known for his great beauty which was said to have resembled the beauty of the patriarch Jacob. (According to Jewish tradition Jacob was the handsomest man of his generation and his image was engraved on God&#x2019;s &#x201C;throne of honor.&#x201D;) In addition he was reputed to possess great physical strength, equal to the strength of Jacob who, upon his arrival in Haran, alone removed the stone from the mouth of the well; a feat which ordinarily required the combined efforts of all the shepherds. Thus it was related of Rabbi Avahu that when the roof of the bath house, where he found himself at the moment, caved in, he supported it with his hands until assistance came and thus saved the lives of 101 people that were within the building from certain death. <sup><xref rid="fn563">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Avahu was born in Caesarea and in that city he lived all his life and conducted an academy. He traded in women&#x2019;s adornments and was very wealthy. <sup><xref rid="fn564">2)</xref></sup> Because of this he was respected by the Roman officials whom he often presented with gifts. He led the life of an aristocrat: his house was furnished with ivory chairs, and it was said that each Saturday night he had a fatted calf slaughtered and of this he ate only the kidneys. <sup><xref rid="fn565">3)</xref></sup> Rabbi Avahu was versed in the secular sciences and foreign languages and this contributed to his popularity in government circles. It was thus related that whenever he visited the governor, he was met with a special greeting which praised him in the following words: &#x201D;Behold the greatest among his people, the leader of his nation, the shining light. Blessed be his coming in peace.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn566">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But despite Rabbi Avahu&#x2019;s wealth and honor he was not proud and he shared his honors with other people. <sup><xref rid="fn567">5)</xref></sup> He was often compelled to debate with Gentiles and he invariably emerged victorious. <sup><xref rid="fn568">6)</xref></sup> During one of these debates he nearly lost his life when one, Jacob Minaa, gave him a poisonous liquid to drink; he was then saved by his colleagues, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi. These debates forced Rabbi Avahu to study the Scriptures minutely until he became a great authority on the Bible. <sup><xref rid="fn569">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Avahu began his studies with Rabbi Jochanan and from him he learned most of the Torah. In later life he remarked: &#x201C;Rabbi Jochanan opened a door for me and he allowed the light to shine upon me.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn570">8)</xref></sup> Rabbi Jochanan also used to mention the name of Rabbi Avahu with affection and he called him &#x201C;my child.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn571">9)</xref></sup> Rabbi Avahu also studied with Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath. He quoted his master in the Babylonian Talmud twenty times and in the Jerusalem Talmud there are about fifty such quotations in addition to those in the Midrashim. It appears that he also studied with Resh Lakish, but his relations with the latter were more those of friendship than the relations of a pupil with his teacher. Both often went to spread knowledge of the Torah in cities where that was needed. As they were once approaching such a city, Rabbi Avahu remarked: &#x201C;Why should we go into a city of wicked men where we shall certainly be humiliated?&#x201D; Resh Lakish then descended from the ass upon which he was riding and taking a handful of earth, he stuffed it into the mouth of Rabbi Avahu and said: &#x201C;God does not want that evil should be spoken of Jews.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn572">10)</xref></sup> Other statements quoted by Rabbi Avahu in the Talmud indicate that he also learned from other scholars.</p>
<p>After the death of Rabbi Jochanan, his followers wanted to choose Rabbi Avahu as head of the academy, but he refused this honor saying that Rabbi Aba of Acco was better fitted for the post. Rabbi Avahu therefore remained in Caesarea where he continued to head his own academy and he interceded for his people with the authorities whenever necessary. When other scholars were forbidden to visit the cities for educational purposes, Rabbi Avahu was exempted from this restriction. In these travels he even reached Alexandria.</p>
<p>The wife of Rabbi Aba of Acco once remarked to the wife of Rabbi Avahu that her husband was the equal of Rabbi Avahu in learning and that he showed respect to him merely because the latter was rich. The woman repeated this remark to her husband, but Rabbi Avahu said: &#x201C;It does not matter whether Rabbi Aba needs my learning or not, both he and I praise God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn573">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following incident was also characteristic of the modesty of Rabbi Avahu: When the land was once affected by a drought, the people sought for someone whose prayer for rain should be acceptable in the eyes of God. Rabbi Avahu was then informed in a dream that a certain man named Pentakake was the right man to offer the prayer. The man was thereupon summoned and when he was asked what his trade was, he said that he was a white slave dealer. Rabbi Avahu was curious to know what good deeds such a man could have done that he should be worthy to have his prayers acceptable before God. The man told him that a woman once came to him and offered her body for a sum of money with which to redeem her husband from prison where he was incarcerated through no fault of his. The man pitied the woman and gave her all the money that he possessed and when that sum was not enough he sold his belongings to aid the woman free her husband. When Rabbi Avahu heard this story he said: &#x201C;If this is so then you are the worthiest man to pray for rain.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn574">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the Second was Nasi at that time. The Nasi resided at Sephoris and even though the government at times did not allow an academy to be maintained in that city, he was too old to move elsewhere. His son Rabban Gamliel IV, on the other hand, settled in Caesarea where an academy could be maintained, due to the influence of Rabbi Avahu with the authorities.</p>
<p>Rabbi Avahu was devoted to the Torah. When he once came to Tiberias he was met by the disciples of Rabbi Jochanan who noticed that his face was suffused with joy. When Rabbi Jochanan later asked what was the cause of his joy, he replied that he had found an old Tosephta which shed new light on the subject that he was then studying. <sup><xref rid="fn575">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time it was related that Rabbi Avahu fasted on the day that a scholar died. <sup><xref rid="fn576">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following of Rabbi Avahu&#x2019;s ethical teachings deserve to be mentioned:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Repentance is the greatest thing in the world; even saints cannot attain the position of penitents.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn577">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;One should strive to be among the persecuted rather than among the oppressors.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn578">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;One should not rule his household by fear.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn579">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>During a discussion on the manner in which the world had been created, Rabbi Avahu said: &#x201C;God had created previous worlds which He destroyed, because He had not been pleased with them until He created the present world which is permanent.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn580">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The verse &#x201C;They who sit at the gates shall speak against me&#x201D; (Psalms, 69:13), he interpreted to refer to those who ridicule the Jews in their theatres and circuses. Rabbi Avahu then described the manner in which the theatre of his time ridiculed the Jews. They would bring out on the stage a camel whose head was bowed and one actor would then ask another: &#x201C;Can you tell me why this camel is so sad?&#x201D; and the other would reply: &#x201C;This is the Sabbatical year of the Jews and since they do not have enough food they eat the camel&#x2019;s food and that makes the camel sad.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And why is the price of oil so high?&#x201D; the first actor would ask again. The other actor would then reply: &#x201C;Since the Jews strictly observe their Sabbath, on which day they eat the food which they accumulated during a whole week, they never have enough wood to cook all that food, thus they use their beds as fuel; when their beds are burned, they are forced to sleep on the floor, and since that makes them dirty and dusty, they rub oil all over their bodies and that&#x2019;s why oil is so expensive.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn581">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Anyone who is familiar with the Bible is acquainted with the story of Saul who sought a young man who could play well in order to soothe his melancholy. On that occasion one of Saul&#x2019;s servants answered that the son of Jesse was &#x201C;skilful as a player and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and intelligent in speech, and a person of a good form, and the Lord is with him.&#x201D; (Sam. I, 17:18.) Rabbi Avahu interpreted this verse to mean that &#x201C;skilful as a player&#x201D; indicated that David was versed in the Scriptures; &#x201C;a mighty valiant man,&#x201D; that he was strong in Mishna; &#x201C;a man of war,&#x201D; that he was skilled in the battles of the Torah; &#x201C;intelligent in speech,&#x201D; that he understood the value of good deeds; &#x201C;a person of good form,&#x201D; that he understood the Talmud. Another interpretation of Rabbi Avahu to the same verse declared that &#x201C;intelligent in speech&#x201D; indicated that David could deduce conclusions; &#x201C;a man of good form,&#x201D; that his face shone in Halacha; and &#x201C;the Lord is with him,&#x201D; that the law was established according to his opinion.</p>
<p>The following is another sample of Rabbi Avahu&#x2019;s method of interpretation: Of the creation of the world the Bible says that the earth &#x201C;was without form, and void.&#x201D; This expression was then interpreted to mean that the earth was wondering at the void which pervaded it. Rabbi Avahu compared this to a king who had bought two slaves on one contract and for the same price. The king then commanded that one of the slaves should be fed from the royal kitchen and that the other one should obtain his own food. The second slave therefore wondered: &#x201C;We were both bought on one contract and for the same price and yet I must obtain my own food or starve.&#x201D; The earth likewise wondered and said: &#x201C;The creatures of Heaven and those of the earth were created at the same time and yet creatures of Heaven are nourished by the divine Shechinah while the creatures on earth must labor for their food else they would starve.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn582">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On one occasion Rabbi Avahu lectured on Hagada in the same city where Rabbi Chiya bar Aba lectured on Halacha. The inhabitants of the city then flocked to hear Rabbi Avahu and Rabbi Chiya felt grieved at this. But Rabbi Avahu consoled him with the following parable: &#x201C;Two merchants once came to a city; one of them brought precious stones to sell while the other brought trinkets. Did not most of the people run to the merchant who sold trinkets?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn583">21)</xref></sup> The Talmud further relates that on that day Rabbi Avahu showed special honor to Rabbi Chiya. On all other occasions it was customary for Rabbi Chiya to escort Rabbi Avahu to his hostelry whenever they chanced to be in the same city. This honor was accorded to Rabbi Avahu because he was considered to be the representative of the Jewish people to the Roman government. But on that day the procedure was reversed and Rabbi Avahu escorted Rabbi Chiya to his hostelry in order to console him in his grief at being slighted by the inhabitants of the city.</p>
<p>As a result of Rabbi Avahu&#x2019;s residence in Caesarea, the city came to be known as a seat of learning even as it was during the days of Rabbi Oshiya Raba. The academy where Rabbi Avahu taught was known as &#x201C;Mardutha&#x201D;, which some explained, indicated that the academy was a nest of rebellion against Rome, because &#x201C;Mardutha&#x201D; signifies revolt. <sup><xref rid="fn584">22)</xref></sup> It was further related that when Rabbi Avahu studied during the night, he did not remove his phylacteries, <sup><xref rid="fn585">23)</xref></sup> and that when he lectured his hearers could see a halo about him. <sup><xref rid="fn586">24)</xref></sup> When Rabbi Avahu died, the mourning was so great that even the pillars in the city were believed to shed tears. <sup><xref rid="fn587">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Three types of sin&#x201D;, Rabbi Avahu said, &#x201C;are never forgiven by God. These are deception, robbery, and idol worshiping.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn588">26)</xref></sup> When he heard scholars debating the cause of the destruction of Jerusalem, he declared that it was due to the neglect of reciting the Shema morning and evening. <sup><xref rid="fn589">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of Rabbi Avahu&#x2019;s sons, Rabbi Chanina, was sent to Tiberias to engage in study. But the young man devoted himself primarily to charitable deeds, especially to burying the dead. Rabbi Avahu then wrote to him: &#x201C;Have I sent you to Tiberias because there were not enough graves in Caesarea? Furthermore it is an accepted rule that learning is more important than charitable deeds.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn590">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Poverty was then the share of many scholars and Rabbi Avahu, who was himself wealthy, consoled the needy scholars with the following words: &#x201C;A scholar who devotes himself to learning despite his poverty is certain to partake of the nobility of the Shechinah in the world to come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn591">29)</xref></sup> Of those who forgot their learning he said: &#x201C;One who forgets anything of his learning should be demoted from his position.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn592">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like other scholars Rabbi Avahu also believed that God recognized the holidays as they were determined by the high court and he said: &#x201C;When five elders gather to determine a leap year, God leaves His heavenly retinue and he descends to earth in His Majesty. The angels then wonder since they know that were the people to err God would correct them.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn593">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Avahu was once asked whether &#x201C;Hallel&#x201D; should be recited on New Year and the Day of Atonement. He then declared that on these days the angels come before God and say: &#x201C;Your Jews are celebrating holidays and they do not recite &#x2018;Hallel&#x2019; (praise)&#x201D;. God then answers them: &#x201C;When a mortal king sits in judgment and the books of life and death are open before him, do his subjects sing his praise at that moment?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn594">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;When Jews are aided in time of need&#x201D;, Rabbi Avahu said, &#x201C;it is as if God were also aided for the Scriptures declare &#x2018;I am with him in affliction&#x2019;. When Jews are in need it is as if God were also in need; by aiding them He also aids Himself.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn595">33)</xref></sup> &#x201C;It is an accepted rule that God forgets nothing&#x201D;, he continued, &#x201C;but when the punishment of Jews for their sins is concerned, He overlooks many things.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn596">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of the passage &#x201C;I hear of your evil dealings from all this people&#x201D; (Sam. I, 2:23), Rabbi Avahu said: &#x201C;The Scriptures intend to teach the people ethical behavior. When one hears good things of his neighbor, he should repeat it in the name of the person that he had heard it from; but when one hears evil of his neighbor and he wishes to admonish him, he should not name the person by whom he was informed. <sup><xref rid="fn597">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Biblical statement &#x201C;I am the Lord your God&#x201D; Rabbi Avahu explained as an indication that God was not like mortal rulers. Therefore God said &#x201C;I am first&#x201D;, and I have no father; &#x201C;I am last&#x201D;, and I have no brother; &#x201C;Beside me there is no God,&#x201D; and I have no sons. <sup><xref rid="fn598">36)</xref></sup></p>
<p>During a discussion concerning wise men Rabbi Avahu said: &#x201C;God gives wisdom to the wise as the Scriptures say &#x201C;In the heart of every wise man I put wisdom.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn599">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When a child of Rabbi Avahu died, two scholars came to console him but they remained silent fearing to grieve him by mentioning the dead child. Rabbi Avahu then explained to them that God&#x2019;s judgment could not be otherwise than just and he said: &#x201C;When an earthly court condemns one to death, the relatives of the condemned man come to greet the judges and the witnesses to show that they bear no ill will against them and that they are convinced of the justice of the sentence despite the fact that earthly courts are full of deception and robbery and error and they are also transitory. How much greater is the duty to recognize the justice of the judgment of God before whom there is no deception nor robbery nor error?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn600">38)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Chiya bar Aba Hacohen</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HIYA BAR</small> A<small>BA</small> H<small>ACOHEN</small> is not to be confused with the Tana Rabbi Chiya Raba who lived four generations earlier during the time of Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi. He came to Palestine from Babylonia together with his brother Simeon. Since no mention is made of his teachers in Babylonia it is to be assumed that he left that country while still very young. Upon his arrival in Palestine he still found the first of the Amoraim Rabbi Chanina bar Chama and Rabbi Joshua ben Levi who were then already old men. When Rabbi Chiya came to Sephoris he was befriended by Rabbi Chanina bar Chama who often leaned on him when he walked through the streets; he was also respected by Resh Lakish who engaged him to tutor his children. Rabbi Jochanan likewise loved his pupil Rabbi Chiya and called him &#x201C;my child&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn601">1)</xref></sup> When Rabbi Chiya fell ill, Rabbi Jochanan came to visit him and asked him: &#x201C;Do you love your suffering?&#x201D;, implying thereby that suffering atones for one&#x2019;s sins, but Rabbi Chiya replied: &#x201C;I want neither suffering nor its reward&#x201D;. Rabbi Jochanan then asked him to give his hand and he cured him. <sup><xref rid="fn602">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chiya bar Aba was also respected by the Patriarch Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the Second who empowered him to visit various cities together with Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi for the purpose of clarifying matters of religious conduct and also in order to appoint tax collectors in these cities for the government and for the Nasi. <sup><xref rid="fn603">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chiya suffered greatly in Palestine. Although he did not suffer want to the same extent as his brother did, he nevertheless was subject to other limitations and hindrances. Friends then advised him to leave Palestine, but for some time he refused to leave the country. Finally he was compelled by circumstances to leave when he no longer wanted to gain his sustenance from tithes which in his eyes amounted to charity and made him feel dependent. He was at that time the &#x201C;Cohen&#x201D; of the family Silone which gave him its tithes. When a dispute arose concerning the interpretation of a law which Rabbi Chiya wanted to interpret more leniently than the other scholars, he feared that his action would be explained as an attempt to favor the family from whom he derived his livelihood. <sup><xref rid="fn604">4)</xref></sup> He then went to Babylonia and he was detained by no one. Rabbi Chiya asked Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath to obtain for him a letter of recommendation from the Nasi and the latter immediately granted his request. In his letter to the Jews of Babylonia the Nasi wrote: &#x201C;We are sending you a great man who is our messenger and who is like ourselves.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn605">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chiya later returned to Palestine where he remained permanently. He lived in several cities, namely in Gabala, which was situated between Beth Shean and Tiberias, <sup><xref rid="fn606">6)</xref></sup> in Roma which was located in Galilee, <sup><xref rid="fn607">7)</xref></sup> in Sephoris, <sup><xref rid="fn608">8)</xref></sup> and in Lodacea. <sup><xref rid="fn609">9)</xref></sup> His permanent residence was later in Tyre which had once been a Phoenician city, but at that time it contained a Jewish community and was considered to be a part of Palestine.</p>
<p>It was told that at the death of Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the Second priests were permitted to participate in the burial of the Nasi. Rabbi Zeira, who was also a priest, disapproved of this ruling and Rabbi Chiya forced him to touch the body of this Nasi. It appears that Rabbi Chiya was not very strict in the observance of the priestly restrictions on other occasion as well. Thus it was told that when emperor Diocletian visited Tyre, Rabbi Chiya passed through a cemetery to see him. <sup><xref rid="fn610">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chiya bar Aba was very pious and many wondrous tales were related of the effects of his prayers. Some he cured through prayer and for others he obtained long life. Once there appeared a wild animal which destroyed all the trees which it chanced upon. The people came to Rabbi Chiya to ask him to pray that the animal should depart. He prayed and the animal suddenly heard the voice of its mother<xref rid="fn611">&#x002A;)</xref> and fled to the desert whence it came. <sup><xref rid="fn612">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chiya bar Aba was not an adherent of Hagada and when he lectured on Halacha in the same city with Rabbi Avahu of Caesarea, the people flocked to hear Rabbi Avahu whose discourse dealt with Hagada. The opinion of Rabbi Chiya concerning Hagada is illustrated by the incident when he saw a book of Hagadoth and remarked: &#x201C;Even though it may contain some good things, the hands of him who wrote the book should be cut off.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn613">12)</xref></sup> We may also assume that his knowledge of the Bible was limited. <sup><xref rid="fn614">13)</xref></sup> One of his pupils once asked him the reason why the word <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05F4;</span> (good) was mentioned in the version of the ten commandments given in Deuteronomy but not in the first version. To this Rabbi Chiya replied: &#x201C;Rather than to ask me why the word <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05F4;</span> is or is not used, you should ask me whether it is used at all for I do not know of it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn615">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like his contemporaries Rabbi Chiya also revered the Sabbath above all and he maintained that because of its merit the Jews will be redeemed. <sup><xref rid="fn616">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;When Jews pray&#x201D;, Rabbi Chiya said, &#x201C;they do not all end their prayers at the same time for each group prays separately. But when all the prayers are finished, the angel who is in charge of prayer gathers them and weaves out of them crowns for the head of God who adorns Himself with the prayers of Israel.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn617">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;One who observes the Shema is like one who observes all the Ten Commandments for the latter were given at the time of the morning Shema and all of them are also included in the Shema.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn618">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other statements of Rabbi Chiya give a clear picture of the time during which he lived. Thus he said:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Even a father and a son or a teacher and his pupil waged hot discussions on their differences of opinion while interpreting their studies, but they do not part until they grow to love each other.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn619">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;If one were to tell you that you should give your life for the santification of the name of God, you may say to him: &#x2018;I will do so if I am to be killed at once, but not if I have to undergo the ordeal of previous generations when heated balls of iron were placed under the arms of Jews or when their nails were pierced with wire.&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn620">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;The hatred of the Gentile nations toward the Jews may be compared to a man who is an enemy of the king and wishes to harm him, but cannot do so. Such a man at least wants to destroy the statue of the king, but fearing that he would be executed for such a deed, he undermines the wall of the monument thus causing it to fall. Gentile nations likewise fear to come out against God and they therefore persecute the Jews.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn621">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chiya lived to a ripe old age and all of his sons grew up to be scholars. A special prayer of Rabbi Chiya is of great interest. It said: &#x201C;May it be Thy will, oh Lord our God and God of our fathers, that You should turn our hearts to complete repentance, that we should not be shamed before our fathers in the world to come, that You should inspire our hearts with fear of Thy name and that You should remove us from that which You hate and that You should bring us near to that which You love and that You should be merciful to us for the sake of Your name.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn622">21)</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn611">&#x002A;) The above mentioned Midrash does not name the animal and merely refers to it as <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D2;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05F4;</span> a young beast. This was assumed to be a <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05DD;&#x05F4;</span> concerning the nature of which commentators differed. According to a Midrash the <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05DD;&#x05F4;</span> was a gigantic animal which Noah could not take into the Ark, because of its size and he therefore tied it to the Ark that it might swim along with it. The &#x201C;Septuaginta&#x201D; (Greek translation of the Bible) identified the <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05DD;&#x05F4;</span> with a unicorn. Others gave differing descriptions. It nevertheless appears that the animal referred to in the Midrash was a young elephant which uprooted trees and which <italic>fled when it heard</italic> the call of his mother.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</title>
<p>T<small>HE TWO</small> A<small>MORAIM</small>, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, were always mentioned together due to the great bond of friendship which united them. But before we proceed to describe the lives of these two Amoraim we must mention an event which transpired in Palmyra (in the Bible &#x201C;Tadmor,&#x201D; in the Talmud &#x201C;Tarmud&#x201D;), a city located in an oasis in the Syrian desert between the Euphrates and Damascus.</p>
<p>In the city of Palmyra there lived a robber chieftain who became a legitimate ruler when he aided the Romans in their war against the Persians of Babylonia. The name of this chieftain was Barnezer Odenate. When the Romans were defeated by the Persians and their leaders were taken captive, Odenate librated them and preserved Roman rule in Syria. Emperor Galianus (264 C. E.) then recognized him as co-ruler in Syria. However, this situation did not last long for the wife of the chieftain, later queen Zenobia, hired assassins to murder her husband in order that she might rule in his stead. With her wisdom and her organizational talents she succeeded in transforming Palmyra into a metropolis. In this she was aided by the fact that the city was situated at the crossroads of important caravan routes. The city was then enlarged by the construction of beautiful palaces in the Roman style.</p>
<p>Some historians maintain that Zenobia embraced Judaism or that she was sympathetic to the Jewish faith. Jewish historians, however, deny this and make no mention of any kind acts toward the Jews on her part. But all Roman historians concurred in their praise of her beauty, education and good taste. She was a gifted diplomat and she succeeded in persuading all the rulers of western Asia to unite against emperor Aurelius. Aurelius advanced against Zenobia with a large army when he realized that she planned to liberate her country from Roman domination. In this venture he was also successful and he devastated her land.</p>
<p>It appears that the Jews of Palestine were not satisfied with the proximity of Zenobia&#x2019;s kingdom and they aided the Romans. An expression current among the Jews of that time stated: &#x201C;Happy is he who will live to see the destruction of Tadmor&#x201D;. The problem also arose whether converts from Palmyra were to be accepted since the population of this city was of mixed origin.</p>
<p>According to the Scriptures (Kings I, 9:18) Palmyra was founded by king Solomon who colonized it with people from various nations. It is also known that Zenobia was herself an offspring of a mixed marriage. For this reason it was an accepted opinion that &#x201C;Jews would celebrate the day of the destruction of Tadmor.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn623">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>That the Jews participated in this war on the side of Rome is evident from numerous statements in the Talmud. Thus it is told that Rabbi Ami interceded for a man named Zeira bar Chanina who was captured in the city of Saphsipha as a warrior against Palmyra. Rabbi Ami then implored Zenobia to spare the man&#x2019;s life, but she said to him: &#x201C;Do you permit yourself to do anything you choose because God always performs miracles for you?&#x201D; At about the same time Rabbi Asi was also captured by the soldiers of Palmyra and was condemned to death. Resh Lakish then hastened to save him saying that he would sacrifice his own life if necessary to achieve his aim. <sup><xref rid="fn624">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Palestinian Patriarch of that time was R. Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the Third. He was nearly always ignored by the scholars, and when the latter consulted him in some matter out of deference for his office, he always sought the advice of Rabbi Ami. The Nasi once sent Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi to the various cities of Palestine, to appoint teachers of the Bible and the Mishna. They then arrived in a certain city where there were no teachers and they asked the leaders of the community whether they had engaged watchmen. The city watchmen were pointed out to them, but they remarked: &#x201C;These are not watchmen&#x0021; The real watchmen of a city are the teachers who instruct the children.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn625">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The animosity between Jews and Samaritans grew acute at that time due to the friendship of the latter toward the Romans and the Christians. Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi then instructed the Jews to avoid the Samaritans and to consider them as pagans in all matters and particularly in the matter of the use of their wine. <sup><xref rid="fn626">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi came from Babylonia where they previously studied together. <sup><xref rid="fn627">5)</xref></sup> Both immediately became pupils of Rabbi Jochanan, <sup><xref rid="fn628">6)</xref></sup> and later they were ordained at the same time. The day of their ordination was a feast day for the other pupils who sang their praise in the following words: &#x201C;Only pupils like you should be ordained.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn629">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Travel between Palestine and Babylonia was free and undisturbed at that time and scholars constantly went from one country to the other. In Babylonia the academies of Sura and Pumbeditha were renowned. Whether Rabbi Ami quoted a law which he heard in Babylonia he would say: &#x201C;Our teachers in Babylonia said.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn630">8)</xref></sup> Rabbi Asi&#x2019;s coming to Palestine was said to have been caused by his desire to escape his capricious, aged mother. <sup><xref rid="fn631">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have mentioned above that Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi lived in great friendship. They attended the same academy and after their ordination they enjoyed the same measure of honor. They were referred to as &#x201C;the Judges of Palestine&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn632">10)</xref></sup> or &#x201C;the honorable Priests of Palestine&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn633">11)</xref></sup> Rabbi Ami was also called &#x201C;a great man,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn634">12)</xref></sup> and Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath referred to Rabbi Asi as &#x201C;the example of the generation.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn635">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the death of Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath both headed the academy in Tiberias. It was related that when prayer time came each one of them would pray alone between the columns of the academy. <sup><xref rid="fn636">14)</xref></sup> Often they interrupted their studies and called out: &#x201C;He who wants to know the law or seeks judgment, let him enter.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn637">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Together with Rabbi Chiya bar Aba they once judged a licentious woman named Tamar and they sentenced her to be beaten with rods. The woman complained to the Roman authorities that they had exceeded their rights in passing judgment affecting the life of a person. Rabbi Avahu successfully interceded for them since he was influential with the Romans, but the woman could not be persuaded to withdraw her complaint. Rabbi Avahu then sent an allegoric message to the defendants. Because of the original form of the message we offer here a literal translation of it: &#x201C;We have conciliated the three accusers, the Good Child, the Educated one and the Man of the Sea, but the Date (Tamar) persists in its bitterness and we sought to sweeten it, but vain were the efforts of the Goldsmith.&#x201D; The explanation of this message is as follows: Rabbi Avahu conciliated the three judges, one of whom was named Eudokos (good child), the other Eumathes (educated), and the third Thelaseus (sea man). But the woman Tamar persists in her bitterness and would not be placated with money. <sup><xref rid="fn638">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Upon their arrival in Palestine, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi were pupils of Rabbi Jochanan to whom they were so attached that after his death they mourned him as one mourns a relative. They were also close friends of Rabbi Yitzchak the Blacksmith, although there exist Halachoth in the name of Rabbi Yitzchak and Rabbi Ami alone. <sup><xref rid="fn639">17)</xref></sup> As they once visited Rabbi Yitzchak in his home one of them asked him that he should expound some matter in Halacha while the other asked that he should discuss some Hagadic subject. Rabbi Yitzchak replied: &#x201C;What you demand of me, may be compared to a man who has two wives, one young and the other old. The young wife plucks the grey hair out of his head and the old wife plucks the black hair until he remains bald. You likewise may cause me to say nothing by your requests; but I will tell you something that will please both of you and that will contain Halacha and Hagada.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn640">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>During a feast in the house of Rabbi Ami one of the guests wished to drink boiled wine that had remained uncovered overnight. Rabbi Ami said to him: &#x201C;One who wishes to die should go to his own house to die.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn641">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Ami became head of the academy in Tiberias he came into close contact with the Nasi. The latter once asked him the meaning of the verse, &#x201C;Have faith in the Lord forever, for the Lord is the rock of the ages.&#x201D; Rabbi Ami replied that one who had faith in God would be protected by Him in both worlds. <sup><xref rid="fn642">20)</xref></sup>. It was said that the Nasi bestowed honors and ordination upon people for a price and without consideration for their merit. Rabbi Ami then said that the Nasi broke the commandment not to make gold and silver gods. During a calamity which afflicted the whole people the Nasi decreed thirteen fast days. When these were of no avail he wanted to decree another fast day, but Rabbi Ami objected on the ground that the people should not be taxed beyond their endurance and the Nasi had to comply with his decision. <sup><xref rid="fn643">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the day of the coronation of Diocletian, Rabbi Ami dreamed that it was announced in heaven that &#x201C;Magdiel was crowned today.&#x201D; This dream he interpreted as an omen that the emperor following Diocletian would be the last ruler of Rome. (&#x201C;Magdiel&#x201D; in the Bible preceded the last of the rulers of Edom.) This prophecy partly came true for the successor of Diocletian was followed by Constantine the Great under whose rule Rome became a Christian kingdom.</p>
<p>It is told that when Rabbi Ami headed the academy a bag of gold was once brought to him and he distributed it among the students. <sup><xref rid="fn644">22)</xref></sup> Another version relates that he found a jar full of gold and the Romans informed him that he could use it as he saw fit, for according to the Roman law a man could claim lawful ownership to any article that he found. <sup><xref rid="fn645">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Statements of Rabbi Ami occur in nearly every part of both the Babylonian and the Jerusalem Talmud. Although he was probably the first one in his generation who ascribed sanctity to the opinions of previous Amoraim, he nevertheless was not modest in-so-far as his own achievements were concerned and he once said: &#x201C;From Ami, the son of Nathan, learning will issue for all Israel.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn646">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On numerous occasions he sought to lighten the burden of the laws. Thus he opposed the strictures of the scholars of Tiberias who would prohibit the spreading of fishing nets during the intermediate days of the holidays (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05DC; &#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05D3;</span>) for fear that it would interfere with the festive mood of the occasion. <sup><xref rid="fn647">25)</xref></sup> When he was asked whether Jews were permitted to participate in festivities of pagans, he wished to permit it for the sake of maintaining peace with the neighboring people, but Rabbi Aba reminded him that Rabbi Chiya had forbidden it and Rabbi Ami remarked: &#x201C;Let us praise God that Rabbi Aba called our attention to the opinion of Rabbi Chiya, else we would have fallen into idolatry.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn648">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time a slave brought a bill of divorce for a Jewish woman and Rabbi Ami wished to declare the divorce to be valid although it was an accepted rule that a slave may not testify. Again Rabbi Aba called his attention to a decision of Rabbi Chiya which prohibited such a procedure and Rabbi Ami said: &#x201C;Let us praise God that Rabbi Aba reminded us of the opinion of Rabbi Chiya, else we would have allowed a married woman to remarry.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn649">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, were equally respected. Rabbi Ami is always mentioned first in the Babylonian Talmud, but in the Jerusalem Talmud Rabbi Asi is sometimes mentioned first. On one occasion we also find Rabbi Asi address Ami as Rabbi. This, however, is explained by the fact that Rabbi Ami was the older of the two. <sup><xref rid="fn650">28)</xref></sup> Both of them were known as saintly men and even when they went in dangerous places where others suffered harm, they emerged unharmed. <sup><xref rid="fn651">29)</xref></sup> Rabbi Asi died first, as is evident from the fact that he died in Tiberias, while Rabbi Ami spent the last days of his life in Caesarea. <sup><xref rid="fn652">30)</xref></sup> After his death the political situation of the Jews deteriorated to such an extent that no one could be elected to head the academy.</p>
<p>Rabbi Ami was also the author of the well known statement which inspired the phantasy of many poets to the elaboration of a dramatic story. When the power of faith was being discussed, Rabbi Ami said: &#x201C;We can see the greatness of people who possess faith from the story of the weasel and the well.&#x201D; He concluded with the following words: &#x201C;Even a person who believes this story is certain to be rewarded, how much greater will be the reward of one who believes in God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn653">31)</xref></sup> It appears that the story of the weasel and the well was then very popular. It is also possible that it was written down in some Midrash and that Rashi, Tosephoth and the author of &#x201C;Aruch&#x201D; obtained it from that Midrash.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A maiden,&#x201D; thus the story runs, &#x201C;once lost her way and being very thirsty she bent over a well to draw some water and fell into it. A young man who chanced to pass by heard her cries. At first he was fearful lest it was some evil spirit which wished to draw him into the well and he asked the maiden to swear by the name of God that she was human and not an evil spirit. When he drew her out of the well, his passions were aroused by her beauty, but she implored him not to sin, promising to marry him according to the laws of Israel. They then swore fidelity to each other and, as a weasel ran by, they called upon it and upon the well to witness their troth.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The two young people then parted and the young man forgot his oath. He did not come to the maiden&#x2019;s father to claim her and he married another woman. His wife bore him two children one of which was killed by a weasel and the other was drowned in a well. His wife complained that the children must have lost their lives as a result of the sins of their father and he then remembered the oath which he swore to the maiden at the well. He thereupon divorced his wife and he found the maiden, to whom he swore fidelity, nearly out of her mind with expectation. He then fulfilled his vow and married her.&#x201D; <xref rid="fn654">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Regarding everyday conduct Rabbi Ami commanded that one should not take money into his mouth, nor place food beneath one&#x2019;s bed, nor hold bread under one&#x2019;s arm, nor allow a knife to stick in radishes or lemons. <sup><xref rid="fn655">32)</xref></sup> He also named omens by which one was to know on the new year whether he would survive the coming year and whether a trip, or some occupation that is undertaken, would be accomplished successfully. <sup><xref rid="fn656">33)</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the scholars once declared that there were three types of arrogant creatures in the world: the dog among the animals, the cock among the fowl and the Jews among the nations. Rabbi Ami then declared that the arrogance of these creatures was a virtue rather than a fault. This he held to be particularly true of the Jews who readily offer their lives for their faith. <sup><xref rid="fn657">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other expressions of Rabbi Ami indicate that he did not maintain friendly relations with pagans&#x2014;thus he said that one should not teach Torah to a pagan. <sup><xref rid="fn658">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Biblical verse &#x201C;Let us make man&#x201D; which other scholars found difficult to explain because of the implication that God was assisted in the creation of man, Rabbi Ami ingeniously explained by saying that God had consulted his own heart. <sup><xref rid="fn659">36)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Asi was once sent by the Nasi to appoint tax collectors in various cities. Many people at that time refused to accept this office because of the heavy responsibility which it involved. Rabbi Asi persuaded some of them to accept the office of tax collector by the promise of fame. He also established the rule that &#x201C;two brothers may not represent the same community.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn660">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The opinions of Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi are often introduced in the Talmud by the words &#x201C;both said.&#x201D; On other occasions, however, their opinions are quoted separately and at times they even differed. <sup><xref rid="fn661">38)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Why are children taught the chapters on priesthood before Genesis,&#x201D; Rabbi Asi asked and he gave the following answer: &#x201C;God says that sacrifices are pure and children are pure; it is therefore fitting that children should begin their studies with a sacred subject.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn662">39)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also related that a weaver once came before Rabbi Jochanan and told that in his dream he had seen the sky fall and a disciple of Rabbi Jochanan supported it with his hand. Rabbi Jochanan asked the man whether he would recognize him and the weaver asked him to pass his students before him. This was done and the weaver pointed to Rabbi Asi as the man who had supported the sky. <sup><xref rid="fn663">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Asi died, it was said that the gate of Tiberias collapsed. <sup><xref rid="fn664">41)</xref></sup> Another version told of cedar trees being uprooted on the day of his death. <sup><xref rid="fn665">42)</xref></sup></p>

<title>Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> Y<small>ITZCHAK</small> N<small>APCHA</small> (<small>THE</small> B<small>LACKSMITH</small>) was one of the most prominent disciples of Rabbi Jochanan and a master of Hagada who lived during the second, third and fourth generations of &#x201C;Amoraim.&#x201D; His surname &#x201C;Napcha&#x201D; is variously interpreted. Some claim that it referred to his occupation as a blacksmith, although the Talmud never mentioned it explicitly, while others maintained that he was a native of a city of that name. Such a city is mentioned in the travels of Benjamin of Tudela. Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha, of whom this chapter treats, should not be confused with another man of the same name who lived during the days of Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai. <sup><xref rid="fn666">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha is never mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud by this name. Some Talmud critics therefore believe that Rabbi Yitzchak bar Tavlai, who is mentioned there, is identical with Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha. References in the Jerusalem Talmud to Rabbi Yitzchak, without any further designation, are also believed to refer to Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha.</p>
<p>The poverty which characterized the time of Rabbi Yitzchak is best illustrated by his remark that &#x201C;the curse of God that people shall be forced to eat the grass of the fields applies only to the present generations. People suffer such hunger these days that they cannot wait for the grain to ripen in the field and they pluck it and eat it while it is still green.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn667">2)</xref></sup> &#x201C;In such times,&#x201D; Rabbi Yitzchak added, &#x201C;people are not interested in learning and they merely wish to hear words of consolation.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn668">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha lived in Tiberias together with his master Rabbi Jochanan and his friends R. Elazar ben Pedath and R. Ami. He also maintained close bonds of friendship with other scholars who frequently visited him at his house to discuss various laws and he also visited their homes for the same purpose. <sup><xref rid="fn669">4)</xref></sup> Differences of opinion at times marked his relations with Rabbi Ami. Thus one declared that if a needle was found in the lung of an animal its flesh was kosher, while the other held it to be unfit to eat. <sup><xref rid="fn670">5)</xref></sup> Similarly Rabbi Yitzchak passed sentence whether it was permissible to eat onions harvested during the Sabbatical year while Rabbi Ami didn&#x2019;t know how to decide this law. <sup><xref rid="fn671">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>That the opinions of Rabbi Yitzchak were held above those of other scholars is also evident from the fact that when the Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah the Second, entertained priests at his table and he did not know whether it was permissible to serve them with the flesh of a first born animal, he first inquired the opinion of Rabbi Ami and later he asked the same question of Rabbi Yitzchak for a final decision. <sup><xref rid="fn672">7)</xref></sup> It may be assumed that Rabbi Yitzchak was at that time a judge in Tiberias and since his teachings were popular, his decisions were accepted in all matters of Halacha. <sup><xref rid="fn673">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At a later date Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha went to Babylonia. This journey apparently took place after the destruction of Tiberias during the Roman wars, when Rabbi Ami transferred his academy to Caesarea, where he could continue his teaching under the protection of Rabbi Avahu. Rabbi Yitzchak&#x2019;s stay in Babylonia coincided with the period of the influence of R. Shesheth. <sup><xref rid="fn674">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Yitzchak returned to Palestine, he settled in Caesarea where he appears to have been a member of Rabbi Avahu&#x2019;s court. There he was once confronted with the problem whether it was permissible to read the weekly portion of the Bible in the Synagogue from a Torah which contained only one of the books of the Pentateuch. Rabbi Yitzchak could not answer this question, but Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani reminded him of the rule that a scroll of the Torah from which even one parchment was missing, could not be used for reading in the Synagogue; it thus became apparent that a scroll which contained only one of the books of the Pentateuch could not be used. <sup><xref rid="fn675">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Yitzchak yearned for the restoration of Jerusalem. His heart was filled with anguish when he saw Caesarea in all its glamor while Jerusalem lay desolate. He then came to the conclusion that these two cities&#x2014;Cesarea and Jerusalem&#x2014;could not both thrive at the same time and that the prosperity of one of them was inevitably bound up with the destruction of the other. <sup><xref rid="fn676">11)</xref></sup> While speaking of these cities Rabbi Yitzchak mentioned a people, &#x201C;Germamia of Edom&#x201D;&#x2014;which could destroy the whole world, if God would only allow it. This people, he said, restrains the Romans. Rabbi Yitzchak was no doubt referring to the Germans, who then conducted a struggle against Rome and of whom vague rumors reached the Jews of Palestine.</p>
<p>On another occasion Rabbi Yitzchak interpreted the verse &#x201C;A generation comes and a generation goes, but the earth endures for ever,&#x201D; as referring to the various kingdoms of the world which rise and fall while the Jewish people remains eternal. <sup><xref rid="fn677">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most of the expositions of Rabbi Yitzchak remained in the form of introductions to the books of the Scriptures. The following are some of the most interesting excerpts from his lectures:</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is impossible to measure the strength of one&#x2019;s evil desires which become renewed daily. <sup><xref rid="fn678">13)</xref></sup> Even when one mourns for the dead, his evil desires are with him. <sup><xref rid="fn679">14)</xref></sup> Man is so controlled by his desires that even though these enter as visitors, they immediately possess his entire being. <sup><xref rid="fn680">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;He who angers his neighbor, even though he does so with words only, must conciliate him. If he possesses money, he must seek conciliation through money; he should also ask his friends to intercede for him and to gain forgiveness for him. <sup><xref rid="fn681">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Yitzchak highly valued charity, but he considered kind words spoken to the poor to be of even greater merit than money. He therefore said: &#x201C;One who gives a penny to a poor man, will be blessed with six blessings, but one who speaks kind words to the poor, will be blessed with all seven blessings.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn682">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like his contemporaries he also valued prayer and he said: &#x201C;Prayer is more important than sacrifices. Thus we see that when Samuel&#x2019;s father came to Shiloh, he first bowed and then he offered sacrifices.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn683">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Why were Abraham and Isaac childless?&#x201D; Rabbi Yitzchak asked. He provided the answer himself by saying that &#x201C;God yearns for the prayers of saints and He caused Abraham and Isaac to be childless in order that they might pray to him.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn684">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of those who indulged in many vows in the hope of finding favor in the eyes of God, Rabbi Yitzchak said: &#x201C;He who makes a vow is like a person who pierces his heart with a sword. Are not the prohibitions of the Torah sufficient that people assume additional limitations?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn685">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Yitzchak highly valued the study of the Torah and he said: &#x201C;The fact that people forget what they have learned, is for their own benefit, for if they would not forget that which they had learned then a person would devote himself to the Torah for two or three years and he would then turn to other occupations. But since it is in the nature of man to forget, he must always continue to study.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn686">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The two olives which the prophet Zechariah saw in one of his visions Rabbi Yitzchak explained as referring to the scholars of Palestine, who are as gentle and as dear to each other as oil, while the scholars of Babylonia embitter each other&#x2019;s lives like an olive tree. <sup><xref rid="fn687">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Remarkably interesting are Rabbi Yitzchak&#x2019;s descriptions of the emotions of Moses as his death approached. The soul of Moses refused to leave him and Moses said to it: &#x201C;It seems that the Angel of death desires to take you,&#x201D; but the soul replied: &#x201C;God will save me from death.&#x201D; Moses then said: &#x201C;When you see the Jews weep for me, will you weep with them?&#x201D; and his soul replied: &#x201C;My eye will avoid tears.&#x201D; &#x201C;Possibly you will be forced into Gehenna,&#x201D; Moses said, but his soul answered, &#x201C;God will save my foot from misstep.&#x201D; &#x201C;And where do you expect to go?&#x201D; Moses further asked, and his soul answered, &#x201C;I will go before God in the land of the living.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Moses heard this, Rabbi Yitzchak concluded, he liberated his soul and said to it: &#x201C;Go, my soul, to your rest.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn688">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even more interesting is Rabbi Yitzchak&#x2019;s explanation of Haman&#x2019;s accusations against the Jews:</p>
<p>&#x201C;After Ahasweros decided to give a feast in celebration of the completion of the third year of his reign, Haman appeared before him and said: &#x2018;The Jewish God abhors adultery. You must therefore hire harlots and command all Jews to come to the feast and to gratify their desires.&#x2019; When Mordechai heard this, he warned the Jews not to come to the feast since they were invited with the aim of causing them to sin.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But the Jews disobeyed Mordechai and came to the feast and Satan immediately appeared before God saying: &#x2018;It is time that You destroy this people which always sins against you, but never repents.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C; &#x2018;I would do so,&#x2019; God replied, &#x2018;but what will become of the Torah?&#x2019; and Satan said, &#x2018;You can give it to the Creatures of Heaven.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;God was almost persuaded by this argument and He commanded that a parchment be brought that the decree of annihilation might be recorded. The Torah then appeared dressed in black and weeping bitterly. When the angels saw the Torah mourning, they also wept and said: &#x2018;If the Jews will be destroyed, of what use will we be in the world?&#x2019; The sun and the moon, the sky and the earth likewise wrapped themselves in black and mourned. Thereupon Elijah ran and aroused the saints from their graves and said: &#x2018;The sun and the moon are darkened; the sky and the earth are wrapped in mourning; the Torah and the Angels weep and you lie peacefully.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C; &#x2018;What happened?&#x2019; the saints asked and Elijah said: &#x2018;It is decreed to annihilate the Jews.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C; &#x2018;Is not there even one pious man in this generation?&#x2019; Moses asked and Elijah replied: &#x2018;There is one saintly Jew named Mordechai.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C; &#x2018;Then go to him,&#x2019; Moses said, &#x2018;and tell him to pray to God. We will also pray until God will have mercy and He will annul His decree.&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn689">24)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina bar Papa</title>
<p>A<small>S WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY POINTED OUT</small>, the political and economic situation of the Jews of Palestine was indescribably tragic at that time. But there seems to have been a constant migration from and into Babylonia. The Roman authorities did not object to the fact that many Jews of Palestine went to Babylonia to seek a livelihood while Babylonian Jews came to Palestine to study. This was the case despite the fact that the Babylonian Jews had by that time attained a higher degree of development of learning. They then enjoyed full liberty in the observance of the religious regulations; they had their own courts and they passed sentences as they saw fit. It was only rarely that they had to consult the High Court in Palestine. The determination of the beginning of the months and of the holidays was the only thing that the Jews of Babylonia could not do. Nevertheless they considered the teachings emanating from Palestine as the only correct ones and they believed that despite the destruction of the Temple the rule that out of Zion would come learning was still sound.</p>
<p>Rabbi Aba bar Kahana was one of the &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; who came to Palestine from Babylonia at this time. He brought with himself numerous Hagadic interpretations which he repeated in the name of Rav (Aba Arecha). <sup><xref rid="fn690">1)</xref></sup> Some people therefore claim that he was a disciple of Rav but the dates of the lives of the two men do not coincide and at the time that Rabbi Aba began to study, Rav had undoubtedly died already. It is more probable that Rabbi Aba had been a pupil of a disciple of Rav. This view is also substantiated by the fact that he sometimes quoted Rabbi Chiya bar Ashi who had been a pupil of Rav. <sup><xref rid="fn691">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Aba bar Kahana arrived in Palestine, Rabbi Chanina bar Chama was probably still alive, for we find him quoting statements in the name of Rabbi Chanina. <sup><xref rid="fn692">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another reference concerns a question which he asked of Rabbi Ami. <sup><xref rid="fn693">4)</xref></sup> But we possess little information concerning the personality and the life of Rabbi Aba bar Kahana. On one occasion he mentioned the name of Kfar Chitaa and we may assume that he lived there, but it is unknown whether he conducted a seminary there. <sup><xref rid="fn694">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like his contemporaries Rabbi Aba was also a master of exposition. The people were then tired of legal disputations, but they responded eagerly to Hagada. We thus find hundreds of expositions of Rabbi Aba. Many of these are not clear for his interpretations of the Biblical verses often seem incomprehensible. We will therefore cite only a few to illustrate his method of interpretation.</p>
<p>Speaking of the verse &#x201C;the sun rises and the sun sets,&#x201D; Rabbi Aba said: &#x201C;What is the intention of this verse? Does not everyone know that the sun rises and sets every day? But this verse intends to show how God conducts the world. Before the sun of Moses set, the sun of Joshua ben Nun rose; the sun of Samuel rose before the sun of Eli set and on the day that Rabbi Akiba died Rabbi Jehuda ha-Nasi was born.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn695">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The verse &#x201C;if a snake bite without venom&#x201D;, Rabbi Aba explained in a different manner than the other scholars did. The word <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05DC;&#x05D7;&#x05E9;&#x05F4;</span> means both, &#x201C;venom&#x201D; and &#x201C;whisper&#x201D;. Rabbi Aba interpreted this verse to mean that a snake would not bite unless it had been commanded from above, nor would a lion stalk its prey without heavenly sanction, nor would a government oppress its people unless it was so commanded from above. <sup><xref rid="fn696">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of the effect of a false oath Rabbi Aba said: &#x201C;Some things which are not consumed by fire are consumed by a false oath. Wood is burned by fire but stones are not, but a false oath will consume both.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn697">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;The slightest command of the Torah&#x201D;, Rabbi Aba said, &#x201C;is rewarded as well as the greatest. God thus determined the reward of commandments in order to encourage the people to lead honest lives. The easiest commandment is to send the mother bird away from the nest when the fledglings are taken, in order that it may not suffer the anguish of seeing them killed. The hardest commandment to observe is honoring one&#x2019;s father and mother. These two commandments are nevertheless rewarded by long life.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn698">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following interpretation of a Biblical verse by Rabbi Aba gives a picture of the mood of that time: &#x201C;The anguish of death has surrounded me&#x201D; (in Babylonia); &#x201C;rivers of wickedness have horrified me&#x201D; (in Media); &#x201C;the suffering of the grave surrounded me&#x201D; (among the Greeks); &#x201C;the traps of death were set for me&#x201D; (in Rome). The fact that the term &#x201C;death&#x201D; was employed in the first and the fourth of these Rabbi Aba explained by saying that both, Babylonia and Rome, undertook to annihilate the Jews; the Babylonians destroyed the first temple and the Romans destroyed the second temple. <sup><xref rid="fn699">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like many other scholars of that time Rabbi Aba also believed that a war between Babylonia and Rome would result in the liberation of the Jews. He therefore said: &#x201C;Whenever one will see many Babylonians in Palestine it will be a sign of the approaching redemption.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn700">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a discourse concerning the peoples that lived in the neighborhood of Palestine, Rabbi Aba bar Kahana explained the Biblical verse to indicate that the &#x201C;Pathrothim&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Kasluchim&#x201D; intermarried freely and from these mixed marriages were descended giants like the Philistines and dwarfs like the &#x201C;Kaphtorim.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn701">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina bar Papa was also of great prominence at that time and his name is constantly linked with R. Avahu, R. Yitzchak Napcha and R. Ami. In the Jerusalem Talmud as well as in the Midrashim his first name at times appears as Hinna or Chananiah. The name Papa is an Aramaic form of the Greek name Papos.</p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina bar Papa was a pupil of Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani who praised him for his knowledge of the Scriptures. <sup><xref rid="fn702">13)</xref></sup> Rabbi Chanina was also a close friend of the outstanding disciples of Rabbi Jochanan and he frequently debated with R. Chama bar Chanina and with R. Acha bar Chanina. The Talmud contains some statements of this time whose authorship is in doubt and these are generally introduced by &#x201C;R. Zeira said, but others claim that R. Chanina bar Papa said&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn703">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina par Papa also differed with Rabbi Zeira in the matter of explaining the good deeds of the Israelitic King Abiyah the son of Jeroboam. <sup><xref rid="fn704">15)</xref></sup> The Talmud also cites some of his public lectures but one of these is sometimes ascribed to R. Simlai.</p>
<p>The personality of Rabbi Chanina is surrounded with numerous legendary adventures. One of these relates of an attempt made by a Roman matron to seduce him. When she failed in her attempt, she commanded that Rabbi Chanina be found and he was forced to hide all night in a bath house which was reported to be haunted by evil spirits, but since he did not succumb to sin, he escaped unharmed. <sup><xref rid="fn705">16)</xref></sup> Another time Rabbi Chanina encountered an evil spirit while he was on a mission of charity. The spirit said to him: &#x201C;Have you not learned that one must not tresspass the boundary of another?&#x201D;, intending to say that evil spirits are in control at night and that no man should appear outside at that time. But Rabbi Chanina replied: &#x201C;The Bible says that he who gives charity secretly appeases wrath.&#x201D; As he said this he turned around and fled. <sup><xref rid="fn706">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the hour of his death approached, Rabbi Chanina implored the Angel of death to grant him thirty days in which he could review his learning. The Angel of death granted him this request and Rabbi Chanina asked him to show him his place in Paradise and also to let him hold his sword on the way. But the Angel of death refused this last request remembering what had happened when he granted such a request to R. Joshua ben Levi. When Rabbi Chanina died, his body was surrounded by a pillar of fire and none could approach it. Rabbi Alexandri then asked the body to cause the pillar of fire to depart. &#x201C;Do it for the sake of the scholars who have come to your funeral&#x201D;, Rabbi Alexandri said, but the pillar of fire did not depart; &#x201C;do it for the honor of your father&#x201D;, he continued to implore and still the pillar of fire remained; &#x201C;do it for your own honor that we may be able to approach to mourn for you and to attend to your burial&#x201D;. The pillar of fire thereupon vanished. <sup><xref rid="fn707">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following of Rabbi Chanina&#x2019;s maxims are among the most interesting:</p>
<p>&#x201C;One who is favored with grace is also a God fearing man.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn708">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;One who enjoys something in this world without pronouncing a benediction is like one who robs God and all of Israel. <sup><xref rid="fn709">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;He who criticizes his master is like one who criticizes the Shechina.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn710">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The verse &#x201C;the lions roar for prey&#x201D;, Rabbi Chanina interpreted that lions refer to the unbelieving peoples (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;&#x05BE; &#x05DB;&#x05D5;&#x05E4;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) who deny God and who seek to devour the Jews who depend upon God. God also feeds the poor and the rich alike. <sup><xref rid="fn711">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Balaam ben Beor was considered by Jews to have been the greatest prophet among Heathen. Rabbi Chanina asked: &#x201C;What is the distinction between Jewish and Heathen prophets?&#x201D; He replied that God spoke to Jewish prophets directly as a king who removes the curtains of his palace to speak to his friends. To the Heathen prophets he spoke indirectly as a king who speaks to strangers through a partition. <sup><xref rid="fn712">23)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Zeira</title>
<p>N<small>EXT TO</small> R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>OCHANAN</small> there was none among the &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; concerning whom so many legends were related as were told of Rabbi Zeira. These referred less to his greatness in learning than they did to his unusual personality and to the great friendship which united him with the other scholars who lived in Palestine during the fourth century of the Christian era. Rabbi Zeira came to Palestine from Babylonia when he was already well versed in learning. At the time of his arrival his opinions were already quoted in the academies of Babylonia and various occurrences of his life were being told. Rabbi Zeira was orphaned when he was very young. He was grieved at this and said: &#x201C;I wish that I had a father and a mother; I would then honor them as much as possible in order to earn a share in the world to come.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Once he heard it told that when a shoe fell off the foot of Rabbi Tarphon&#x2019;s mother as she was walking outside, Rabbi Tarphon could not pick up the shoe because this happened during the Sabbath and he therefore placed his hand under his mother&#x2019;s foot to prevent her from trodding the bare ground, and she thus walked until she reached her bed. The scholars then added that had Rabbi Tarphon done a thousand fold for his mother, he still would not have done even half of what one is supposed to do in order to honor his parents. Later Rabbi Zeira heard it said that the mother of Rabbi Ishmael once came before the scholars to complain that her son was not according her due honor. Greatly shocked they asked the woman what Rabbi Ishmael had done that she had found it necessary to come before them to complain and the woman answered: &#x201C;Every time that my son comes home from the academy I want to wash his feet and to drink the water, but he would not allow me to do so.&#x201D; The scholars then said to Rabbi Ishmael: &#x201C;If this is her desire, you must honor it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Rabbi Zeira heard these stories he exclaimed: &#x201C;Blessed be the Lord that I have no father and mother for I could not do that which Rabbi Tarphon did and I would not want to do that which Rabbi Ishmael was advised to do.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn713">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Babylonia Rabbi Zeira acquired most of his learning from Rabbi Jehudah bar Ezekiel, head of the academy in Pumbeditha. <sup><xref rid="fn714">2)</xref></sup> He was also a pupil of Rav Huna <sup><xref rid="fn715">3)</xref></sup> and it is possible that he also attended the academy of Rav and Shmuel, although it is likely that the opinions which he quoted in their names he heard from their pupils. It is also known that he studied for a time with Rav Hisda. <sup><xref rid="fn716">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is told that when Rabbi Zeira served his master Rav Huna, he once brought two glasses, one filled with wine and the other with oil, and he carried both glasses in the same hand. Rav Huna&#x2019;s son then remarked: &#x201C;Is your other hand cut off that you carry both glasses on one hand?&#x201D;, and Rav Huna rebuked his son and said: &#x201C;Is it not enough that a man like Rabbi Zeira is serving you that you also insult him?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn717">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zeira&#x2019;s yearning for Palestine led him to leave his native land where he enjoyed great honor as a scholar. Before he left Babylonia he fasted one hundred times in order to eradicate from his mind that which he had learned there that it might not confuse his learning in Palestine. <sup><xref rid="fn718">6)</xref></sup> Before leaving, Rabbi Zeira also minutely examined his own conduct to determine whether he was worthy to trod the Holy land. He then had a dream in which he saw barley and this he considered to be an omen that his sins had been forgiven. <sup><xref rid="fn719">7)</xref></sup> Until the day of his departure Rabbi Zeira avoided his teacher Rabbi Jehudah for fear that the latter might forbid his settling in Palestine. Rabbi Jehudah was of the opinion that one who leaves Babylonia of his own will transgresses against Biblical verse which declares that the Jews would be brought to Babylonia and would remain there. <sup><xref rid="fn720">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As he approached Palestine, Rabbi Zeira reached a river and in his impatience he did not wait until he would find a boat but he discarded his garments and swam across. A Gentile who heard of this then said to him: &#x201C;The Jews were always hasty and they remained so to this day. In your haste you could easily have been drowned.&#x201D; But Rabbi Zeira answered him: &#x201C;As I was standing at the border of Palestine, I wondered whether I was worthy to enter the land which Moses and Aaron could not enter.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn721">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zeira&#x2019;s arrival made a great impression in the country and he immediately went to greet Rabbi Jochanan. <sup><xref rid="fn722">10)</xref></sup> But his short stature and ungainly appearance earned for him nicknames such as &#x201C;the black pot&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn723">11)</xref></sup> and &#x201C;the small dark hunchback&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn724">12)</xref></sup> It was later related that once every month Rabbi Zeira would fire an oven and enter the fire, and that the flames were powerless to harm him. But once he was affected by an &#x201C;evil eye&#x201D; and he was scorched by the flames which disfigured him. <sup><xref rid="fn725">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Upon his arrival in Palestine, Rabbi Zeira became a close friend of Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath <sup><xref rid="fn726">14)</xref></sup> from whom he learned much concerning the regulations pertaining to tithes. <sup><xref rid="fn727">15)</xref></sup> He thus achieved an old ambition for it was said that while still in Babylonia Rabbi Zeira fasted one hundred times that he might find Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath alive when he would come to Palestine. <sup><xref rid="fn728">16)</xref></sup> His closest friends, however were Rabbi Ami, Rabbi Asi and Rabbi Chiya bar Aba. <sup><xref rid="fn729">17)</xref></sup> It appears that he knew these men from Babylonia and he merely renewed an old friendship when he met them in Palestine. He was especially anxious to derive as much information as possible from Rabbi Asi, who was by nature an angry man and resented too much questioning. <sup><xref rid="fn730">18)</xref></sup> Nevertheless it is recorded that Rabbi Zeira questioned him whenever he found his explanations unsatisfactory. <sup><xref rid="fn731">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of Rabbi Chiya bar Aba Rabbi Zeira said: &#x201C;You may consider it a rule that Rabbi Chiya always repeated the exact opinions of Rabbi Jochanan.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn732">20)</xref></sup> Rabbi Zeira himself also scrupulously quoted the names of the scholars whose opinions he repeated. <sup><xref rid="fn733">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zeira was also highly regarded by Rabbi Avahu who considered him as his disciple, <sup><xref rid="fn734">22)</xref></sup> and when he fell sick, Rabbi Avahu promised to give a feast upon his recovery. <sup><xref rid="fn735">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Zeira settled in Palestine he hoped to obtain ordination in that country. No ordinations were then being conferred in Babylonia. But in many of his statements he expressed his abhorrence of people who bought their ordination as frequently happened in Tiberias at that time. He would then purposely sit in places where scholars went by and whenever he saw one who, he thought, did not deserve the title of Rabbi, he would ostentatiously remain seated. To all other scholars he accorded due honor. <sup><xref rid="fn736">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally Rabbi Zeira obtained his ordination. In Babylonia it was said that he hid for a long time in order to avoid ordination. <sup><xref rid="fn737">25)</xref></sup> On the day that he was ordained, his colleagues sang his praise and the Nasi sent him gifts which he refused to accept. But when he was invited to the Nasi&#x2019;s table, he accepted the invitation out of respect for the Nasi. <sup><xref rid="fn738">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>By trade Rabbi Zeira was a weaver and he once asked Rabbi Avahu how much effort he might devote to beautifying his cloth without deceiving the buyers with its beauty at the expense of its quality. <sup><xref rid="fn739">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his time the Roman government prohibited the Jews from engaging in fasts. Rabbi Zeira was greatly worried when he heard of this regulation for he was devoted to fasting as may be seen from the previous description of his prolonged fasts. <sup><xref rid="fn740">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of his conduct Rabbi Zeira was called the &#x201C;Pious from Babylonia&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn741">29)</xref></sup> He loved peace and he sought every opportunity to effect a reconciliation whenever someone offended him. <sup><xref rid="fn742">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The name Zeira was popular in Babylonia at that time. It appears to have been a diminutive endearing form used for children who were born late in the lives of their parents.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zeira&#x2019;s parents died when he was still young. Of his father it is known that he was a tax collector for the Babylonian government for a period of thirteen years. It was told that he always protected the scholars from too heavy tax burdens. <sup><xref rid="fn743">31)</xref></sup> He is also mentioned in connection with scholarly matters when he questioned a regulation of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. <sup><xref rid="fn744">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the day that Rabbi Zeira arrived in Palestine, he met a butcher who allowed himself to ridicule him, partly because of his appearance and partly because all Babylonian Jews were exposed to ridicule. Rabbi Zeira seemed to be a subject for mirth in the eyes of the butcher into whose shop he came to buy meat. When he asked the price of the meat the butcher named a sum and said that in addition to this sum the customer must be struck a blow with the hammer. Rabbi Zeira offered a higher price for the meat if he would be spared the blow, but the butcher insisted on his original statement and Rabbi Zeira finally consented.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Zeira came to the academy that evening, he asked the meaning of this custom that every buyer of meat must receive a blow. All those present were surprised when they heard his question and they asked Rabbi Zeira where he had seen such a custom practiced. He then named the butcher and the scholars wished to send for him in order to have him punished for shaming a scholar, but they were informed that the butcher died on that same day. When they heard this, they believed that Rabbi Zeira must have cursed the butcher, but he assured them that he did not curse him and that he believed this to be the custom of the city. The scholars then concluded that Rabbi Zeira must be a very important man if God administered summary punishment to one who had insulted him. <sup><xref rid="fn745">33)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The modesty of Rabbi Zeira is further illustrated by the following statement: &#x201C;If the generations which preceded us were like angels then we are like men; if they were like men then we are like asses.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn746">34)</xref></sup> He further said that when the Torah spoke of the cure of leprosy it referred to the cure of the flesh. From this he concluded that when one is humble and lowly as the flesh, he would be cured; but one who is proud would never be healed. <sup><xref rid="fn747">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite Rabbi Zeira&#x2019;s physical handicaps he always hastened to fulfill all commandments for he had heard it said that in order to fulfill a commandment one may run even during the Sabbath when running is ordinarily forbidden. He thus declared that &#x201C;the reward for learning is the haste with which one goes to the place of learning.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn748">36)</xref></sup> Another characteristic attribute of Rabbi Zeira was his insistence that the name of the author should always be mentioned when he was quoted. On one occasion he even forced Rabbi Asi to admit that a statement which he had repeated in the name of a certain Amora, he had really heard from a pupil of that Amora. <sup><xref rid="fn749">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zeira considered the spoken word to be sacred and he insisted that everyone should fulfill his promise. He held it to be especially important to fulfill promises made to children in order that they might not learn to tell falsehoods. <sup><xref rid="fn750">38)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But it is noteworthy that despite the modesty of Rabbi Zeira he demanded that due honor be accorded to scholars and he objected to their self debasement even when that was done during the fulfillment of a commandment. When he saw Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak at a wedding, dancing before the bride with three torches in his hands which he threw into the air and caught again, Rabbi Zeira remarked: &#x201C;The old man makes a fool of himself and he also shames us.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn751">39)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zeira did not tolerate the Hagada. At that time there were already numerous books of Hagada extant and he referred to them as &#x201C;books of witchcraft&#x201D;. He also commanded one of his pupils to refrain from studying Hagada because he would learn nothing from it. <sup><xref rid="fn752">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The observance of a commandment was of lesser importance in the eyes of Rabbi Zeira than the beautification of the act and he therefore said that one may spend one third of the cost of fulfilling a commandment in order to make its fulfillment more attractive. <sup><xref rid="fn753">41)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zeira stayed in the academy day and night and engaged in study. When he felt weak from overwork he would go to the door of the academy. There he would see scholars coming and going and he would listen to their discourses and he would feel refreshed. <sup><xref rid="fn754">42)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A remarkable story is related of Rabbi Zeira and Raba who once became drunk during Purim festivities. While he was intoxicated, Raba killed Rabbi Zeira. On the following day he saw what he had done and he prayed to God and Rabbi Zeira was resurrected. The following year they made no feast for fear that the miracle might not occur a second time if needed. <sup><xref rid="fn755">43)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zeira lived to a ripe old age and when his disciples asked him what he attributed his long life to, he said: &#x201C;I was never angry at anyone in my house and I never ran ahead of one who was greater than myself; likewise I never went a distance of four ells without Torah and phylacteries. I never pondered divine matters in unclean places and I never slept in the academy, not even an accidental nap. I was never glad at the misfortune of others nor did I ever nickname other people.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn756">44)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Zeira died he was eulogised in the following words: &#x201C;Babylonia gave him birth; the Land of Israel reared him as its darling; woe to the city of Tiberias that it had lost its most attractive vessel.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn757">45)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following story is related of Rabbi Zeira&#x2019;s influence even after his death: &#x201C;In the neighborhood of Rabbi Zeira&#x2019;s house there lived some wicked men whom he rebuked for their evil and he prayed to God that they might improve their ways. The other scholars disapproved of this because even as they believed that it was a good deed to rebuke a person who might change his ways so also they considered it a sin to rebuke people who were hardened in sin. After the death of Rabbi Zeira, his wicked neighbors said: &#x2018;Until now the short dark man prayed for us and protected us. Now that he is dead who will pray for us?&#x2019; They thereupon repented their sins.&#x201D;</p>
