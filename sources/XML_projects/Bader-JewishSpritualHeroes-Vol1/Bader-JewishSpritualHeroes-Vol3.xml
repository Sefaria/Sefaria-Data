<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>S<small>EVEN CENTURIES PASSED</small> from the days of the first Tana until the time of the last Amora. This is a long time in the history of any people. No matter how conservative one may be, it would still be impossible to assume that all these years passed without noting profound changes in Jewish life. As was the case with other peoples, these centuries also marked the birth and development of new ideas and concepts among the Jews. Some of these vanished and gave rise to others. These centuries marked far going changes in the political position of the people. Now they were free in their own land, and then they were involved in wars; exile was succeeded by periods of peace and welfare in foreign lands.</p>
<p>After the return from Babylonia, where they lived in an entirely strange environment, the Jews developed new ideas and concepts. The situation in Babylonia itself changed when that country came under the sway of the Persians who possessed an original culture. Later the Jews fell under the domination of the Syrian Greeks and of others. It was quite natural for the Jews to be influenced by these peoples even when they did not imitate them and when they sought to avoid the ways of the pagans. When the conquering nations tried to undermine their belief in one God they did not succeed. The Jews remained steadfast in their faith and were ready to sacrifice their lives for the observance of the Sabbath and of circumcision. The outside influence expressed itself in some modifications in the ceremonial rituals, but the fundamentals of religion were not affected.</p>
<p>As soon as the repatriates from Babylonia were entrenched in the country&#x2014;after the days of Ezra and Nehemiah&#x2014;there developed a new attitude toward the Torah. They were convinced that the destruction of the Temple and the exile was a direct result of their negligence in the observance of the commandments of the Torah. They therefore determined to observe scrupulously all the regulations of the Torah. The first measure in this direction was the establishment of a rule that &#x201C;many students should be maintained&#x201D;. To achieve this end, many schools were established in all the comers of the land. Whereas the majority of the people had heretofore been farmers and shepherds, it was now sought to transform them into a nation of scholars. The leaders of the schools were called &#x201C;Soferim&#x201D;, scribes, whose duty it was to explain the Scriptures and to interpret its teachings. Later the &#x201C;Soferim&#x201D; were known as &#x201C;Chachamim&#x201D;, wise men. They thus performed a dual function of interpreting and also adapting the Torah to the needs of the time.</p>
<p>The religious and secular life of the people was then governed by two institutions: the Great Court and the Academy, which worked hand in hand and supplemented each other. The entire content of Jewish life centered about these institutions which laid the foundation for the spiritual life of the people. The &#x201C;Great Court&#x201D;, later known as the &#x201C;Sanhedrin&#x201D;, issued all the decrees and, together with the academies, it became the law giving body which regulated the moral and religious conduct of the people and strengthened its ethical concepts. One of the first activities of the Sanhedrin was the establishment of a &#x201C;protective fence&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05F2;&#x05D2;</span>) about the Torah. It was the function of this &#x201C;fence&#x201D; to prevent the people from doing any thing which might lead them astray from the commandments of the Torah even when the particular deed had not been prohibited in itself.</p>
<p>Concerned with the moral conduct of the people the scholars sought to prevent any possible lapses by prohibiting men to remain alone with married women in secluded places. In addition to the forms of adultery which the Bible prohibited they also listed 26 types of relatives whom one may not marry. <sup><xref rid="fn1">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the days preceding Ezra and Nehemiah the Sabbath was not strictly observed. The Soferim therefore warned the people concerning its observance and surrounded it with protective barriers. The concept of work was defined in order that people should know what may and what may not be done on the Sabbath. 39 primary occupations were listed the performance of which on the Sabbath was punishable by death. Among these were plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, baking, cooking, lighting and putting out fire, hunting, slaughtering animals, writing and erasing, building and destroying, sewing and tearing, carrying objects out of a house and into it. <sup><xref rid="fn2">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to these occupations the Soferim prohibited many other activities which did not constitute work in themselves but which lent a weekday atmosphere such as climbing trees, riding on animals, swimming, judging, buying and selling, marriage and others. All of these were forbidden in the interests of complete rest and were also not allowed on the holidays. <sup><xref rid="fn3">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tools and vessels which were used during the performance of occupations that were forbidden on the Sabbath, could not be carried out on that day. As a further safeguard the Soferim ruled that the Sabbath was to be observed from sunset on Friday until the sunset on Saturday. Blessings to be pronounced over a glass of wine at the incoming and at the departure of the Sabbath were instituted. <sup><xref rid="fn4">4)</xref></sup> A man was likewise appointed to blow the ram&#x2019;s horn as a signal to the people to cease working. The first blast signalled the field workers to cease their labors; the second one announced to the city workers to close their shops and the third one was a sign to stop all work at home. One more blast was then blown to indicate that the Sabbath had begun. <sup><xref rid="fn5">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first evening of the Passover was consecrated in the same manner as the Sabbath. It partook of the nature of a family celebration and all members of the family gathered to eat of the Paschal lamb, to relate the miracles of the redemption from Egypt and to sing praises. Every Jew, even the poorest, was obliged to drink four glasses of wine on that evening.</p>
<p>In addition to the sacrifices in the Temple, prayers were introduced at that time. It appears that prayer among Jews originated during the Babylonian captivity, when the people had no opportunity to offer sacrifices. Although the forms of the prayers were not yet defined, the idea of praying took root, but it did not supplant the offering of sacrifices which were expressly commanded in the Torah.</p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>The number of Jews who returned to Palestine from the exile in Babylonia was much smaller than the number exiled. But those who remained in Babylonia were no less religious than the ones who returned. The great national struggles which characterized the return to Palestine have never been sufficiently described. We possess inadequate information concerning the time that elapsed from the coming of Ezra and Nehemiah until the rebellion of the Hasmoneans, a period of nearly two centuries. The fate of Zerubabel, who was appointed to govern the Jews of Jerusalem is also unknown.</p>
<p>There exists a tradition, which is not substantiated by any historical evidence, that Zerubabel returned to Babylonia after he became convinced that he could achieve nothing in Palestine. Others claim that he was killed during one of the turbulent periods.</p>
<p>It is certain, however, that a large number of Jews refused to return to Palestine even after the second temple was built and a Hasmonean ruler governed the land. These did not consider their liberation as the expected redemption. They hoped for miracles like those which accompanied the deliverance from Egypt and they awaited a wondrous Messiah from the House of David. They also disapproved of the new temple which lacked the &#x201C;Urim&#x201D; and &#x201C;Thumim&#x201D;, the Holy Ark and the Cherubim and the &#x201C;sacred fire&#x201D;. But the lack of authentic historical information makes it impossible to give a clear description of that time. The writings of Josephus are not entirely clear and the Talmud concerned itself more with describing the customs of the time and interpreting the verses of the Bible rather than with chronicling historical events.</p>
<p>It is therefore impossible to determine how learning began to develop in Babylonia. But we do know that Jewish life developed in that country at the same time that it was making rapid forward strides in Palestine. When the second temple was destroyed, large numbers of Jews sought refuge in Babylonia where the Romans had no control. As often as the political circumstances allowed, there was interchange of scholars between the two countries. Thus we find Rabbi Chiya Raba sending his son, Nathan, to continue his studies in Palestine while Palestinian scholars sent their children to Babylonia. But despite this interchange, the Jews of Palestine nevertheless did not respect the Babylonian Jews. Even Babylonian scholars were ridiculed until their worth was established.</p>
<p>Most of the Jews of Babylonia lived in Nehardea and its environs because it was closest to Palestine. Some even believed that the city was once a part of Palestine and they sought to prove that the surrounding towns were included in the conquests of Joshua. Because of this doubt, the inhabitants of Nehardea celebrated Purim for two days.</p>
<p>The exact location of Nehardea has not been ascertained to this day. All we know is that it was located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and that the lands to the East were settled by non-Jews. Later the Babylonian Jews were compelled to wander farther inland. The persecutions in Palestine forced many scholars to settle in Babylonia and the social and economic conditions in Babylonia also contributed to the establishment of academies in different cities.</p>
<p>Enjoying complete autonomy, the Babylonian Jews were governed by an &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D; who represented them before the government. Like the Nasi in Palestine, the Exilarch also traced his descent from the house of David. At times the Exilarchs were held in even greater respect than the Nasi because they were descended from king David through the male line. At the time that Rabbi Jehudah was Nasi in Palestine, Rav Huna was Exilarch in Babylonia. Rabbi Jehudah once remarked that were Rav Huna to come to Palestine, he would accord him greater honor than he received himself.</p>
<p>When the conditions in Palestine took a turn for the worse, Rabbi Nathan of Babylonia declared that the verse &#x201C;to those who love me and observe my commandments&#x201D; (Exodus, 2:6), referred to the Jews of Palestine, who were ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of the observance of the commandments and who were indifferent to death when they were caught.</p>
<p>These conditions are best illustrated in a Talmudic story which relates that when a Jew, who was condemned to death, would be asked, &#x201C;Why are you being led to execution?&#x201D; he would reply, &#x201C;Because I have circumcised my son.&#x201D; Another would say, &#x201C;Because I have studied the Torah.&#x201D; One led to crucifixion would explain that he was being punished for eating Matzoth, another one that was to be flogged would explain that he incurred his punishment for holding a &#x201C;Lulav&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn6">6)</xref></sup> Under such circumstances, the academies in Palestine were deserted. Those who wanted their sons to gain learning sent them to Babylonia. During such times the scholars of Babylonia would also determine the beginning of the months and the leap years, although this was traditionally the prerogative of the scholars of Palestine.</p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>Judging by the structure of the Babylonian Talmud one might conclude that it is obscure and that its editors compiled its contents without considering sequence. But such a conclusion would be erroneous since every word was carefully weighed and measured before it was included in the Talmud. The Talmud as we have it is a wonderful structure carefully reared from its component parts. The editors of the Talmud followed the system of Rabbi Jehudah in editing the Mishna and not merely did they gather the material but they also sought to integrate it into an organic unit. Rav Ashi and Ravina, the compilers of the Babylonian Talmud, sought to link the subjects treated in the Talmud in a logical sequence. For this purpose they employed a technical terminology which served as a binding cement.</p>
<p>After the period of the &#x201C;Tanaim&#x201D; the language of the Talmudic literature was not preserved in its original purity. The early Amoraim still used a language closely resembling that of the Mishna and even some of the latter ones sought to achieve this end. But the majority of their sayings were in Aramaic, which was the ordinary language of the Jews of Babylonia, interspersed with some Hebrew elements. The resulting language did not resemble the language of the Mishna.</p>
<p>The two Talmuds, the Babylonian and the Jerusalem, differ in the language employed and also in their styles. The cause of this is that the methods of interpretation employed in the two countries differed. This is not surprising when we consider the manner in which the interchange of ideas between the two countries occurred. The constant interchange of scholars between the two lands resulted in many errors and quotations were frequently interpreted in a manner foreign to the author. Some scholars even ascribed their opinions to their predecessors in order to lend weight to their words. At other times the authors of various statements were forgotten. Considerable confusion was thus engendered in establishing the authorship of numerous decisions. At times the statements quoted were in direct contradictions to the opinions of the authors. This was especially true of the opinions ascribed to Rav (Aba Arecha). We thus find that when Rabbi Jehuda bar Ezekiel quoted Rav, his brother Rami remarked: &#x201C;You should not listen to him when he speaks in the name of Rav.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn7">7)</xref></sup> Another Amora likewise said: &#x201C;Whatever Rabbi Jehudah bar Ezekiel says in the name of Rav is incorrect, for Rav had never said it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn8">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even the compilers of the Talmud at times erred in this respect and they would describe a dispute between two Amoraim in contradicting versions on different occasions. There are several instances of such contradictions. <sup><xref rid="fn9">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some subjects occur both in the Jerusalem and in the Babylonian Talmud with this difference that the Jerusalem Talmud quotes conflicting opinions while the Babylonian Talmud quotes only one opinion. <sup><xref rid="fn10">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>One should not assume that the Talmud is a unified work. The teachings of seven centuries do not readily fuse into a unit. This is particularly true since so many different men of differing tastes shared in its creation. But the Talmud does possess a homogeneous character and it constitutes an integrated work.</p>
<p>In the prefaces to our first two volumes we sought to acquaint the reader with the ideas of the scholars concerning the various problems of life. We shall now supplement those remarks in order to provide a complete picture of their mode of thought. The ideas of our scholars concerning God were original and differed from those accepted among the surrounding peoples. Greek culture which was then highly developed still clung to polytheism. The same was true of the Romans, the Parthians and the Persians. One therefore marvels at the endurance of the scholars and at their success in resisting all attempts to introduce polytheism.</p>
<p>The representation of God in corporeal form such as the phrases &#x201C;the hand of God&#x201D; or &#x201C;the mouth of God&#x201D; might have indicated, the scholars interpreted as being merely a form of speech used to convey the idea of God to the common people. But they expressly warned against accepting these terms in their literal meaning. <sup><xref rid="fn11">11)</xref></sup> They then referred to God in terms which would indicate his superhuman nature. He was called &#x201C;Shechinah&#x201D;, (Glory). On other occasions he was referred to as &#x201C;Gevurah&#x201D; (Strength) and &#x201C;Makom&#x201D; (Place), because He is omnipresent. He was also called &#x201C;Shamayim&#x201D; (Heaven), because of the belief that God lived in heaven. The creation of the world they explained to be a process of creation out of nothing. Its aim was the creation of man who was made in the image of God, walking erect and facing heaven. Man is imbued by a soul and possesses a free will to do as he chooses. Of all men the Jews are the chosen ones; the outstanding men among the Jews are the just men. <sup><xref rid="fn12">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concept of God&#x2019;s unity the scholars held to be of the greatest significance. They believed it to be an honor that the Jews followed the only God and that He chose them as His people. The reason why man was created last was explained by them to indicate that man did not share with God in any work of creation. <sup><xref rid="fn13">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>God is merciful even when man does not deserve it and His very anger is an expression of his kindness. <sup><xref rid="fn14">14)</xref></sup> It is the duty of the Jew to fear God and the life of a Jew should be based on three foundations: study of the Torah; serving God with prayers and charitable deeds. <sup><xref rid="fn15">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>While studying the Torah one should bear in mind that its purpose is to observe the commandments. But the worth of the observance is conditioned by the belief in God who gave the commandments. A Jew must therefore do everything for the sake of God and not merely out of a feeling of duty. <sup><xref rid="fn16">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Faith implies the assumption of the burden of the kingdom of heavens. This implies gratitude to God for the good as well as for the evil and acceptance of his rule presupposes obedience to the rule of God and a conviction that whatever He does is for the best. God should be served with love and one should strive to make His name beloved among all. This will lead to the elevation of the conduct of man to the level of God. Even as God is merciful so also should man strive to be merciful.</p>
<p>Before the introduction of prayers, sacrifices were offered. The purpose of sacrifices was not merely slaughter of animals but elevation of human thought. After the destruction of the Temple one could only assume the vow of a &#x201C;Nazarite&#x201D;, not to drink wine and not to cut his hair, or one could undertake fasts to torment his body with lack of food and drink.</p>
<p>Charitable deeds, whether by offering money or through personal effort to aid another, was considered to be the noblest deed possible. This was based on the principle of love for one&#x2019;s neighbor which was enunciated by Hillel in his rule when he said, &#x201C;Do not unto others what you would not have done unto yourself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Moralizing others on their faults the scholars held to be of great importance and they said that it should be continued until the person corrected becomes angry and is ready to beat his moralist. Such moralizing helps people to avoid gossip, hatred and envy and encourages peace.</p>
<p>One must also believe that God sees all deeds of man, that he knows the needs of the world and that he aids all Jews because of their justice and their faith in Him.</p>
<p>God&#x2019;s messengers are angels, prophets and saints. The piety of the saint may lead him to become inspired by the holy spirit and he would thus be capable of interceding for the Jews with his prayers. Repentance has a similar effect and protects the penitent from evil. <sup><xref rid="fn17">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the most fascinating element of the faith was the belief in reward and punishment after death. God also credits offspring with the good deeds of their parents. Like the individual, the group also awaits a collective compensation which takes the form of the coming of the Messiah and the resurrection. These matters the scholars discussed tersely when they spoke of the wars of Gog and Magog, the return of the House of David and &#x201C;the future that is to come&#x201D; which would compensate the whole nation for their sufferings of the present.</p>
<p>Throughout the years there were numerous sects among the Jews who questioned the authority of the oral law. But none of these doubted the value of the moral teachings of the scholars.</p>
<p>The scholars also believed that God had previously created worlds which he destroyed and when He created the present world He said: &#x201C;This one finds favor in my eyes while the others did not.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn18">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When God decided to create Adam, the scholars said, He realized that both just and wicked men would be descended from him. Because of the just descendants he wished to create man at once but the prospect of the wicked descendants urged him to annihilate man before he was even created. God thereupon overlooked the future and proceeded to create man.</p>
<p>At first God considered creating man out of heavenly stuff. But realizing that such a creature would incur the envy of the angels who might attempt to harm him, He created man out of a mixture of heavenly and earthly materials. <sup><xref rid="fn19">19)</xref></sup> He then endowed man with a free will to do as he chose. He implanted in him good and evil desires and He gave him the power to control his desires. The scholars were convinced that there was much heroism in subduing one&#x2019;s evil desires since these are with man since his birth while his good desires manifest themselves only after he reaches the age of thirteen. <sup><xref rid="fn20">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But they did not consider the Torah as the only means against human passions. Piety was held to be a necessary supplement and one who possessed learning without piety was compared to an overseer of a palace who was given the inside but not the outer keys. <sup><xref rid="fn21">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The scholars strongly stressed the significance of justice. One who passes just sentence they compared to a partner to God and they interpreted the Biblical verse (Deut. 12:28) to show that good fortune would attend him who practices deeds that are good in the eyes of man and that also find favor in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>If a poor man and a rich man will come to trial, the poor man should not be given preference. He must not be declared just, if he had been unjust, on the ground that the rich man would have to support him anyway. Such judgment would be tantamount to accepting a bribe which blinds even the wisest man. It was also held that bribes could be offered in words as well as in money. <sup><xref rid="fn22">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Truth is the signature of God. <sup><xref rid="fn23">23)</xref></sup> Man must therefore make sure that all his utterances should be true. He who is honest is considered to have observed the whole Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn24">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Just as God punished the generation of the flood He would also punish anyone who does not abide by his word. One who departs from his word may be compared to one worshipping idols. <sup><xref rid="fn25">25)</xref></sup> For deceit with words is worse than deceit with money <sup><xref rid="fn26">26)</xref></sup> and God abhors the man who speaks otherwise than he thinks. <sup><xref rid="fn27">27)</xref></sup> But gossip was held to be even worse than deceit and those guilty of it were considered to be fit to be fed to the dogs. <sup><xref rid="fn28">28)</xref></sup> Slander, they said, is capable of annihilating all three parties concerned; the one who utters the slander, the one who heeds it and the one who was slandered. Its power extends over long distances and the only reason that the Jews who left Egypt were condemned to perish in the desert was that they heeded slander. <sup><xref rid="fn29">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Four types of people never merit seeing the &#x201C;Shechinah&#x201D;: the scornful, those who ridicule others, liars and slanderers. <sup><xref rid="fn30">30)</xref></sup> There are also numerous types of thieves and the worst of these is the one who deceives people with words; another is the type that invites one to come to his house without really wishing him to do so; the third offers gifts when he is certain that they will not be accepted; the fourth shows merchandise to a customer after that merchandise had already been sold. All of these are compared to swindlers who give false weights and measurements. <sup><xref rid="fn31">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The blessings of the Torah, the scholars said, can only be fulfilled when people follow in the ways of God. What are the ways of God? God is gracious to all and he feeds all creatures without exception. People should likewise be kind to each other. God grants health and life to those who believe in him as well as to those who reject Him. People should also forgive acquaintances and strangers. <sup><xref rid="fn32">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>All of these moral teachings which originated with the explanations of the essence of God ended by scrutinizing social relations. It grew out of the recognition that man is the flower of creation and that God wished man to act justly and kindly. As time went on these teachings expanded in depth and profundity.</p>
<p>Charity was also viewed by the scholars as of great importance. The entire world is provided with food because of charity. <sup><xref rid="fn33">33)</xref></sup> One who contributes to charity is worthier than one who offers sacrifices. <sup><xref rid="fn34">34)</xref></sup> Charity is the greatest of all commandments <sup><xref rid="fn35">35)</xref></sup> and even the poor man who receives charity should offer some of it. <sup><xref rid="fn36">36)</xref></sup> But the scholars also stressed that offering a loan was at times more important than giving charity and aid which one extends with his body may be better than financial aid. <sup><xref rid="fn37">37)</xref></sup> Scholars were also warned against living in cities which did not have a fund for the poor to which at least two people attended. <sup><xref rid="fn38">38)</xref></sup></p>
<p>One must also love to be preached to for so long as there will be moralizing there will be joy and blessings in the world and evil will depart. The scholars nevertheless warned that one must improve his own ways before he begins to preach to others <sup><xref rid="fn39">39)</xref></sup> and just as it is a good deed to suggest something which will be obeyed even so is it a good deed not to make a suggestion which is sure to be disobeyed. <sup><xref rid="fn40">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sin of hatred equals in magnitude the commandment to love one&#x2019;s neighbor. One must not say: &#x201C;I will love scholars but I will hate their disciples&#x201D; or &#x201C;I will love disciples but I will hate rude people&#x201D;. One may show hatred only to those who deny God and who incite to sin. Thus king David said: &#x201C;Your enemies I will hate and I will contend with those who rise up against you.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn41">41)</xref></sup> One must also bear in mind what the consequences of hatred will be. Why was the first temple destroyed? Because there existed idol worshiping, immorality and violence. But during the time of the second temple the people observed the Torah and its commandments, why then was it destroyed? It was destroyed because hatred prevailed. We may therefore conclude that hatred is the equivalent of idol worshipping, immorality and bloodshed. <sup><xref rid="fn42">42)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking of the significance of peace the scholars declared that blessings are of no avail if they are not accompanied by peace. <sup><xref rid="fn43">43)</xref></sup> Even in time of war one should think of peace. It is therefore permissible to alter the words of another, when quoting him, in the interests of peace. <sup><xref rid="fn44">44)</xref></sup> The stones of which the altar was built and whose function it was to cause peace between Jews and their father in heaven, could not be hewn by any iron implement. It was therefore concluded that one who brings about peace between man and wife, between one city and another, between one nation and another or between one family and another, would not meet with any harm. One must therefore heed the command to preserve peace and not to engage in quarrels. Such great significance was attached to peace that it was believed that even when people worship idols they could not be harmed by enemies if they lived in peace among themselves. <sup><xref rid="fn45">45)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Marriage was held to be the most important event in the life of any man. It was considered to be the duty of every Jewish man to participate in the increase of the people. This conviction, together with the natural fertility of the Jewish women, contributed to the survival of the people throughout the period of persecution. No man even thought of avoiding this responsibility toward his people. Thus Rabbi Akiba once asked, &#x201C;Who may be considered a rich man?&#x201D; and he replied that a rich man is one &#x201C;who has a wife noted for her good deeds.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn46">46)</xref></sup> Ben Sira was also quoted as saying that &#x201C;a good woman is the best gift. Happy is the husband of such a woman; the days of his life are doubled.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn47">47)</xref></sup> The verse which declared that the days of the poor were evil, the scholars interpreted as referring to a man who has a wicked wife. <sup><xref rid="fn48">48)</xref></sup> Man was also commanded to honor his wife for the blessing of one&#x2019;s house was entirely dependent upon the wife, <sup><xref rid="fn49">49)</xref></sup> and he who honored his wife more than himself and loved her even as he loved himself would be blessed with peace and plenty.</p>
<p>Amicable relations between man and wife caused the &#x201C;Shechinah&#x201D; to dwell in the house and when discord prevails, they are both consumed as by a fire. <sup><xref rid="fn50">50)</xref></sup> Another scholar explained the significance of peace in a still different manner. He said: The Hebrew words <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05E9;&#x05F4;</span> and <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D0;&#x05E9;&#x05D4;&#x05F4;</span> (man and woman) contain two of the letters of the name of God and God would preserve them from all evil. But this is true only so long as they live in peace. As soon as they leave the ways of peace, these two letters are withdrawn and only the letters <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D0;&#x05E9;&#x05F4;</span> remain. These signify fire which would consume them. <sup><xref rid="fn51">51)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The education of the children naturally occupied a prominent place under the circumstances. Study of the Torah was the central theme of this training. One of the scholars declared that as soon as a child learns to talk his father should teach him the Hebrew language and the Torah and any father who does not do so may be compared to a father who kills his child. <sup><xref rid="fn52">52)</xref></sup> But one who obeys this commandment is credited with teaching his descendants to the end of all generations. <sup><xref rid="fn53">53)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking in the same vein the Tana Rabbi Jochanan declared that of the three types of people who deserve a share in the world to come one is the father who raises his children in the ways of the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn54">54)</xref></sup> The entire world exists because of the breath of children at study and they must therefore not be disturbed from their studies even when the temple is to be rebuilt. Any city in which the voices of children at study is not heard will certainly be destroyed in the end. <sup><xref rid="fn55">55)</xref></sup> It was thus related that every child which had a father would be taught by him, but fatherless children remained uneducated. It was therefore ordered that schools be established in every city and every province where children were brought at the age of six or seven years. No children began their studies before they reached the age of six. <sup><xref rid="fn56">56)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jose declared that every man is obligated to study and none should assume that he will inherit his learning. Another scholar therefore said that one should beware of the children of the poor for they might grow to be great students. <sup><xref rid="fn57">57)</xref></sup> The same attitude should be maintained toward the children of the Ame Aratzim for they too might become scholars. <sup><xref rid="fn58">58)</xref></sup> Parents were also enjoined to teach their children trades and any parent who did not do so was considered on par with one who taught his son to be a robber. <sup><xref rid="fn59">59)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Learning a trade was held to be of great importance. Not only did a trade provide one with a livelihood but it also brought him honor. The importance of a man who lived off the practice of a trade was held to be equal to that of a pious man. <sup><xref rid="fn60">60)</xref></sup> In the opinion of Rabbi Gamliel, the son of Rabbi Jehudah, that knowledge of the Torah which was not accompanied by the practice of a trade was of no value and was sure to lead to sin. <sup><xref rid="fn61">61)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both parents as well as God share in the creation of a human being. As long as one honors his father and mother God therefore considers it as He had been honored. <sup><xref rid="fn62">62)</xref></sup> Another time the scholars declared that it is more important to honor one&#x2019;s father and mother than it is to honor God. Man is thus obligated to fulfill the commandments concerning a Succa, a Shofar, feeding the poor and others only if he can afford to do so; but the commandment to honor one&#x2019;s parents must be fulfilled under all circumstances. <sup><xref rid="fn63">63)</xref></sup> When the question arose how one should honor his parents and whether one could do so by word of mouth only the scholars invoked the verse &#x201C;Honor God from your wealth&#x201D; and they declared that one must honor his parents with all his possessions, with food and with garments. The honor due to one&#x2019;s father they further explained by saying that one might not stand in the place of his father nor sit in his seat nor contradict his words nor side with his opponents. <sup><xref rid="fn64">64)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The scholars also interpreted the Biblical commandment to prove that one is obligated to honor his step-mother in the same measure as he would honor his own mother; his step-father in the same measure as he would honor his own father and also his older brothers and his father in law. <sup><xref rid="fn65">65)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But not only parents were to be accorded honor. Scholars were to be granted the same respect <sup><xref rid="fn66">66)</xref></sup> and greeting a scholar was equivalent to greeting the Shechinah. <sup><xref rid="fn67">67)</xref></sup> The honor due to the Torah was so great that a bastard who was a scholar was ranked higher than a High Priest who was an Am Haaretz. <sup><xref rid="fn68">68)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Modesty was also a virtue which the sages praised highly and Rabbi Levitas of Jabneh said: &#x201C;One should be very humble for there is no real reason for pride considering that in the end all men will be consumed by worms.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn69">69)</xref></sup> One who is humble, other scholars declared, will be raised by God and one who is proud will be put to shame. It is likewise with one who seeks greatness that greatness eludes him but one who avoids it will certainly achieve greatness. <sup><xref rid="fn70">70)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Modesty is a quality of God. When He appeared to Moses the first time He did not appear in the form of a proud cedar tree but in the form of a lowly bush. When He gave the Torah to the Jews He did so from Sinai which is small compared to the great mountains. <sup><xref rid="fn71">71)</xref></sup> God therefore declares that He will avoid those who are proud and one who walks erect with pride crowds the feet of the Shechinah. <sup><xref rid="fn72">72)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Satisfaction with one&#x2019;s lot was equal in importance to modesty. &#x201C;Who is a wealthy man?&#x201D; asked the Tana Ben Zoma, &#x201C;he who is satisfied with his share.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn73">73)</xref></sup> For one should be content with that which he has. Rabbi Akiba further clarified this idea when he said that &#x201C;one should arrange his Sabbaths like week days in order to avoid being dependent on charity.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn74">74)</xref></sup> One way of attaining such a state of contentedness is by avoiding gluttony. <sup><xref rid="fn75">75)</xref></sup> At the same time the scholars ruled that one should not deny himself the pleasures of life and Rav (Aba Arecha) declared that any man who denies himself joys which he can attain will have to account for it in the world to come. <sup><xref rid="fn76">76)</xref></sup></p>
<p>One must avoid mutilating his body. <sup><xref rid="fn77">77)</xref></sup> There is also no action which may not be performed nor is there any food which may not be eaten in order to preserve an endangered life with the exception of idolatry, bloodshed and immorality for the avoidance of which one must be ready to sacrifice his life. <sup><xref rid="fn78">78)</xref></sup> Regarding the observance of the Sabbath Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said that it may be desecrated for the sake of a living day old child, but not for the sake of a dead king David. <sup><xref rid="fn79">79)</xref></sup> Rabbi Menasia liekwise said that the Sabbath was given to people to observe but the people were not given to the Sabbath. <sup><xref rid="fn80">80)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bashfulness and chastity were likewise held in great esteem, and these qualities were considered to be the outstanding merit of the Jews. <sup><xref rid="fn81">81)</xref></sup> It was believed that shame leads to avoidance of sin while arrogance leads to transgression. Scholars were warned to heed their behavior. <sup><xref rid="fn82">82)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding faith and dependence on God it was said that Jews deserve to have miracles performed for their sake because of their unbounded faith. <sup><xref rid="fn83">83)</xref></sup> He who trusts in God would be protected by Him both in this and in the coming world. <sup><xref rid="fn84">84)</xref></sup> On another occasion it was declared that a penitent is credited with making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and offering sacrifices there. When Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus enjoined his disciples to repent one day before their death, they questioned how one may know when he would die and Rabbi Eliezer explained that one must repent daily for fear that he would die on the morrow. <sup><xref rid="fn85">85)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prayer ranked close upon repentance and was held to be of greater value than sacrifices. Its significance was so great that at least half of one&#x2019;s prayers were certain to be granted. <sup><xref rid="fn86">86)</xref></sup> Another sage said that even were a sword to be at one&#x2019;s throat he should still feel confident in prayer. <sup><xref rid="fn87">87)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some Gentile pedagogues of that time declared that it is better for children to study at home, each one separately. Our scholars, on the other hand, believed that group study tended to develop the minds of children. We find no mention, however, that even the Gentile pedagogues should question the efficiency of schools for their usefulness was recognized by all. We may therefore assume that only a few held to this point of view. It was only a small number of wealthy Gentiles that could afford to maintain a private tutor for their children. Children of the poor largely remained without any education which was looked upon as a privilege of the rich.</p>
<p>The educational situation among the Jews was entirely different. Education was democratic and so organized that the whole people benefited from it. Classes were not always held indoors and frequently study would take place in the street. Thus we find that Rabbi Jehudah prohibited teaching in the street and when Rabbi Chiya taught his two sons outside the house he incurred the displeasure of Rabbi Jehudah. <sup><xref rid="fn88">88)</xref></sup> Such study as took place outside involved adult pupils mostly and was practiced during unusual circumstances. Otherwise all learning took place in the synagogues where prayers were also said. There were no convenient structures for schools at that time. Since the people were impoverished it was said that not much money should be spent even for synagogues.</p>
<p>At first all learning was engaged in while standing. Later it became customary to sit. The teacher would then be seated on a rock or on a bench while his pupils sat on the ground around him. The Talmud declared that since the days of Moses until the time of Rabban Gamliel the old people studied while standing but that after the death of Rabban Gamliel maladies afflicted the world and people were forced to sit while studying. <sup><xref rid="fn89">89)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Special furniture for the adornment of the schools was not needed at that time. If the teacher sat on a couch his pupils also reclined on couches. Teachers were also prohibited from benefiting from the services of their pupils. Thus we find that Rabbi Jehudah was in the habit of carrying his own bench to the academy.</p>
<p>The seating of the pupils was ordered in such manner that the teacher should be able to see the faces of all; they were then seated in a semi-circle. Of the influence of facing one&#x2019;s teacher while at study we learn from the remark of Rabbi Jehudah who complained that he could not always see the face of his master Rabbi Meir and that this fact hindered his proficiency in learning. <sup><xref rid="fn90">90)</xref></sup> Another sage instructed his pupils to seat themselves in such a manner as to be able to see the mouth of their teacher when he was teaching them. <sup><xref rid="fn91">91)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was the accepted rule that children should start their schooling at the age of six. One Amora warned that study at an earlier age may affect the health of the child adversely. Others said that it would also affect his intellectual development. But the most common suggestion offered was that the physical development of each individual child should be considered. <sup><xref rid="fn92">92)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We find no record of the required qualifications for teachers but we may assume that they were required to be well acquainted with the subject of instruction. The qualities that were enumerated for scholars were probably also required of teachers.</p>
<p>A popular maxim of that time declared: &#x201C;In my native city I am known by my name but in a strange city I am known by my clothes.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn93">93)</xref></sup> It was likewise said that a scholar who wears spotted clothes deserves to forfeit his life and that it is a shame for a scholar to wear patched shoes. <sup><xref rid="fn94">94)</xref></sup> Scholars were also warned to heed their habits of eating and drinking and one who arranged his feasts without choosing a proper place would forget his learning, he would cause quarrels and his words would not be heeded. <sup><xref rid="fn95">95)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not all teachers were considered capable of teaching as not all pupils were capable of learning. But the blame was mostly ascribed to the teachers and Rava once declared: &#x201C;If you see a pupil having difficulties in learning, it is a proof that his teacher does not show him friendliness.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn96">96)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Every scholar must consider it to be his duty to teach others without compensation. But since teachers were required to devote their whole time to their work some form was devised to provide for their needs. Thus the Talmud declares that he who studies without teaching others may be compared to a plant in the desert <sup><xref rid="fn97">97)</xref></sup> and he who refrains from teaching a law to his pupil is like one who robs him. <sup><xref rid="fn98">98)</xref></sup></p>
<p>According honor to one&#x2019;s teacher was therefore held to be of greater importance than honoring one&#x2019;s father. <sup><xref rid="fn99">99)</xref></sup> Should one see his father and his teacher carrying loads, he was to help his teacher first. Likewise if one&#x2019;s father and teacher are imprisoned he was to ransom his teacher first. <sup><xref rid="fn100">100)</xref></sup> One who contradicts his teacher may be compared to a man contradicting the Shechinah <sup><xref rid="fn101">101)</xref></sup> and walking on the right side of one&#x2019;s teacher indicated rudeness. <sup><xref rid="fn102">102)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Respect for one&#x2019;s neighbor was likewise commanded and it was to equal the respect in which one holds himself. <sup><xref rid="fn103">103)</xref></sup> A man who was known to be superior even in one respect deserved to be honored. <sup><xref rid="fn104">104)</xref></sup> One&#x2019;s position was entirely irrelevant in this respect, for a man brings honor to his position and not vice versa. <sup><xref rid="fn105">105)</xref></sup></p>

<title>Rav; Abba Arecha</title>
<p>A<small>FTER THE PERIOD OF THE</small> &#x201C;T<small>ANNAIM</small>&#x201D; the first important figure in the period of the &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; is that Amora who is known not by his name but by his title &#x201C;Rav&#x201D;.</p>
<p>His name was Abba, and he was called by some &#x201C;Abba Arecha&#x201D; (Long Abba), because he was the tallest man of his generation. <sup><xref rid="fn106">1)</xref></sup> It is possible also that &#x201C;Arecha&#x201D; was the name of Rav&#x2019;s birthplace in Babylon.</p>
<p>His title &#x201C;Rav&#x201D; was the same as that of all his successors who were allowed by the &#x201C;Resh Galuta&#x201D; (the ruler of the Jewish Diaspora in Babylon), to preside over their own academy. Just as R. Jehudah ha-Nasi was called &#x201C;Rabbi&#x201D;, omitting his own name, so Abba Arecha was always called &#x201C;Rav&#x201D;.</p>
<p>It was Rav who founded the academy in the city of Sura. The ruler of Babylon at that time was the Persian king Artaban who was very friendly to the Jews and a great admirer of Rav. Rav&#x2019;s academy quickly attracted over a thousand students from far and near.</p>
<p>Abba Arecha was born in the year 155 C. E. When he founded his academy which existed thereafter for seven centuries he was a man of 64. His family was of aristocratic stock and highly respected among scholars. By marriage he was related to the family of the &#x201C;Resh Galuta&#x201D; of Babylon, which was an even more important lineage than that of the &#x201C;Nasi&#x201D; in Palestine, because the family of the &#x201C;Resh Galutha&#x201D; (the &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D;) derived from king David in the paternal line and the &#x201C;Nasi&#x201D; was descended from David only in the maternal line.</p>
<p>R. Jehudah Hanasi himself once admitted this when he said: &#x201C;If Rab Huna, Resh Galuta, should ever come to Palestine, I will seat him higher than myself because he is descended from the tribe of Judah and I from the tribe of Benjamin, and in addition he is related to king David in the paternal line while I am related to king David only in the maternal line.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn107">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>An uncle of Rav, R. Chiya Raba, owned a genealogical record which showed him to be descended from Shefatiah, a son of king David by his wife Abital. <sup><xref rid="fn108">3)</xref></sup> To be sure, there is a quotation to the effect that it was R. Jehudah Hanasi who was descended from Shefatiah, and that R. Chiya derived from Shimi, a brother of David. <sup><xref rid="fn109">4)</xref></sup> But we have the personal statement of R. Jehudah Hanasi, which we quoted above, against this source.</p>
<p>It should be stated, also, that Rav&#x2019;s family tree had wide connections and a great number of scholars were found in it in later generations.</p>
<p>Rav&#x2019;s father was called Ibo ben R. Acha Karsela of Kafri. He was only a half-brother of R. Chiya Raba. R. Chiya&#x2019;s mother had a daughter by a former husband named &#x201C;Imma&#x201D; and Rav&#x2019;s father married this daughter of his step-mother. Consequently R. Chiya had the same father as Rav&#x2019;s father and the same mother as his mother.</p>
<p>This relationship had a great influence upon the course of Rav&#x2019;s life, for he was always with R. Chiya. He was brought up in his home, and when R. Chiya went to Palestine, Rav accompanied him. And just as R. Chiya was Rav&#x2019;s teacher in Babylon, so he continued to teach him in Palestine. On the other hand Rav supervised all of R. Chiya&#x2019;s business and had a hand in everything he did.</p>
<p>R. Chiya took care of Rav so devotedly because he was his sister&#x2019;s son. It seems that our scholars at that time held that it was every man&#x2019;s duty to take an interest in his sister&#x2019;s son. And even though Rav was R. Chiya&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s son, which should perhaps have been more important because they were sons of the same father, R. Chiya called him always &#x201C;my sister&#x2019;s son&#x201D; and other scholars did likewise. <sup><xref rid="fn110">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav and R. Chiya showed great similarity in their way of living and their character, which demonstrates the influence of R. Chiya in Rav&#x2019;s life, and in his aims and the ideals of his academy, as well as those of his descendants and pupils.</p>
<p>Many of Rav&#x2019;s remarks and the utterances of his pupils are preserved only in the Jerusalem Talmud, because before he founded his academy in Sura, many of his greatest pupils and their pupils left Babylon and emigrated to Palestine where they spread the wisdom of their teacher.</p>
<p>Out of the great respect of the scholars of that time for Rav, many would send their children to him to be blessed. <sup><xref rid="fn111">6)</xref></sup> Since his views were often opposed to those of the Mishnah, people said about him: &#x201C;Rav is a Tanna, but a dissenter,&#x201D; that is even though he might have been counted as a Tanna of the Mishnah, he differed from them nevertheless in his opinions. <sup><xref rid="fn112">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we have said, Rav was related by marriage to the Exilarch. They were equals in status. After them the family ramified very widely and most of the scholars until the last generations of &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; were descendants of their family. When Rav once put a question concerning human conduct to R. Chiya, R. Chiya called him <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D1;&#x05E8; &#xFB44;&#x05D7;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;&#x05F4;</span> (Son of Aristocrats). <sup><xref rid="fn113">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once in speaking about the great leaders of the Jews, Rav said, that every generation must have three such leaders, sometimes two of them in Babylon and one in Palestine and sometimes two in Palestine and one in Babylon. The Talmud relates that the scholars who heard him turned their eyes toward his grandsons, his daughter&#x2019;s children, Rabana Ukba and Rabana Nehemiah, of whom we know only that they were the students of R. Chisda, signifying that these were the two great leaders whom the Jews needed in Babylon. <sup><xref rid="fn114">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav laid great stress on the matter of lineage. A student quoted him as saying that the verse about the descendants of Asher, calling them chosen warriors, chiefs of the captains, (Chronicles I, 7:40) and signifying their standing in the army and the battlefield was written so that their reputation and prestige of the ancestors might protect them in battle. <sup><xref rid="fn115">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>This was the general attitude of Rav&#x2019;s family in the question of lineage. Another of Rav&#x2019;s students quoted him as saying that &#x201C;since genealogical records have been lost, scholars have lost their ability and the light of their eyes has been extinguished.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn116">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In spite of its high place Rav&#x2019;s family used to conduct themselves very modestly and they had a marked tendency to make friends among all classes of people. Rav himself did not discriminate among his friends because of position and would try to make friends with men of lower origin. It was characteristic of Rav&#x2019;s family to respect the dignity of women more than had been customary among Jews. This tendency is best seen in his legal decisions limiting the rights of a father with regard to his daughter and of a brother with regard to his orphaned sister.</p>
<p>Women were mentioned by their own names in his family, like &#x201C;Judith&#x201D;, R. Chiya&#x2019;s wife, &#x201C;Pazi&#x201D; and &#x201C;Tabi&#x201D;, R. Chiya&#x2019;s daughters, &#x201C;Imma&#x201D;, Rav&#x2019;s mother. It is probable that this custom of calling women by their own names was the rule in the homes of the Jewish aristocracy, the &#x201C;Nasi&#x201D; in Palestine or the &#x201C;Resh Galuta&#x201D; in Babylon, because the other women who are mentioned by name in the Talmud or in the Midrashim were also of the same family, like &#x201C;Yalta&#x201D;, the wife of R. Nachman of Nehardea, or &#x201C;Chova&#x201D;, the wife of R. Huna.</p>
<p>This family also followed the custom of naming children after dead parents and near relations, as was the custom of aristocratic Gentiles of that time, as well as of the &#x201C;N&#x2019;siim&#x201D; in Palestine and the &#x201C;Resh Galuta&#x201D; in Babylon.</p>
<p>Various customs of an extraordinary sort were prevalent in this family because of common ideals or the influence of ancient traditions. Such, for instance, was their love for the education of the younger generations. All the members of Rav&#x2019;s family took a broad interest and had a fine understanding of the problems of education and devoted to it all their time and energy.</p>
<p>These people also had an accent different from that of others. In general, their accent was similar to that of the &#x201C;Galileans&#x201D;; like them they slurred the &#x201C;gutturals&#x201D; in their speech and obscured the differences between them. They would use an &#x201C;h&#x201D; where it was not written and omit it where it was needed, had difficulty in pronouncing the <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05F3;</span> and jumbled the sounds of the letters <span dir="rtl">&#x05D6;&#x05E1;&#x05E6;&#x05F4;&#x05E9;</span>.</p>
<p>When R. Chiya once told R. Shimeon bar Bari that if R. Shimeon were a &#x201C;priest&#x201D; it would be wrong to permit him to give the blessings from the pulpit, because he had a hoarse voice, R. Shimeon&#x2019;s father said to tell R. Chiya that he himself should not even be permitted to read from the Bible in the synagogue because he spoke indistinctly and he could not pronounce the <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05F3;</span> correctly. <sup><xref rid="fn117">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav was a strong and healthy man and of a healthy family. <sup><xref rid="fn118">13)</xref></sup> This is clear also, if one considers what he suffered during his life, how much wandering he did and what he did for Jews by personal intercession. In spite of all his troubles he lived a long time and reached a great age in perfect soundness of body and mind. He had a penetrating eye for people and events. He understood the central importance of every event and weighed everything accurately.</p>
<p>He was also a great student of nature and loved to observe the course of the stars and to investigate the behavior of all sorts of creatures. He made friends gladly with shepherds and hunters because he saw that their company could enrich his knowledge. He used to listen to their proverbs with great curiosity because it was his way to consult everybody&#x2019;s opinion.</p>
<p>Being interested in human needs, Rav was always aware of the limits of human capacities. Thus he was interested in the differences of character in the cities which Jews inhabited at that time and tried to discover the differences in their essential nature. For this reason he was called <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D2;&#x05D1;&#x05E8; &#x05D1;&#x05DB;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D0;&#x05F4;</span> meaning that he was great in every sort of knowledge. <sup><xref rid="fn119">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When teaching his students, Rav would keep close watch on all their expressions. He knew just how attentive each one was at any time. Whenever his eye caught any student behaving strangely, he would want to know the reason immediately, whether the student was worrying about some personal difficulties at home. <sup><xref rid="fn120">15)</xref></sup> With his deep instinct Rav could sense a student&#x2019;s secret meaning through the intonation of his words. Thus he was once incensed when he saw his pupil R. Cahana dressing his hair during class, because he felt that it was distracting his attention from study. <sup><xref rid="fn121">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Endowed with varied abilities and many-sided knowledge, he was also a great statesman and a man of practical affairs. He spent much effort in settling Jews in Sura where he founded his academy. At the same time he managed his own large weighing business and the enterprises of his uncle R. Chiya. He built toll bridges and dealt in wheat and other goods. On certain occasions he also served as Judge and in addition he composed a large number of prayers for the holidays. Since his voice was good, he was also a <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#xFB44;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;&#x05E7; &#x05E1;&#x05D3;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05F4;</span> (a reader in the synagogue), as well as a <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05DE;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D2;&#x05DE;&#x05DF;&#x05F4;</span> (a translator). <sup><xref rid="fn122">17)</xref></sup> Only a person with a melodious voice could be chosen for this position. <sup><xref rid="fn123">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In many of his ways Rav imitated his uncle R. Chiya, of whom it was told that he once hired mule-drivers to bring him some flax. They brought him damp wares which he could not use. R. Chiya said to Rav, &#x201C;Go out and give them their wage. But tell them I am paying them not because I must, but because I do not choose to insist on my rights. <sup><xref rid="fn124">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A similar occurence once happened to Rav. His widowed daughter-in-law came to him to demand that her marriage portion be given to her. He told her, &#x201C;If I were not an open-handed person I would tell you that even the small adornments you wear on your head belong to me.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn125">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Generous himself, Rav always watched other people to see which ones gave freely and which were stingy. His own lavish charity often seemed to him to be &#x201C;wasteful&#x201D;, and in order to have some control over his expenditure, he instructed his agent that whenever he was ordered to give a person some gift which he&#x2014;the agent&#x2014;did not think the recipient needed, he was to consult Rav a second time before making the payment. <sup><xref rid="fn126">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In spite of the accepted rule that a student must not express his opinion in the presence of his teacher, Rav gave his students full permission to decide legal cases and instruct pupils to the extent of their ability. He would often take many of his pupils to judge cases with him. He said, &#x201C;A man may teach a student and at the same time have him act as an associate judge in his court.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn127">22)</xref></sup> In the same vein he said, &#x201C;If a student is capable of teaching others and he does not do so, it is as bad as murder.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn128">23)</xref></sup> On another occasion, he said, &#x201C;Whoever prohibits his students from practicing any commandments is as bad as if he robbed him of his inheritance.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn129">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav wished to be kind to everybody and thought better of people than they deserved. He also loved truth and tried to speak only the truth even when it brought him personal harm. It is said that his wife used to torment him because she never would cook what he wanted to eat. When his son Chiya was grown up he used to bring his mother his father&#x2019;s orders for each meal. He used to change his father&#x2019;s orders in repeating them to his mother, so that she gave him just what he wanted while trying to give him the opposite of what he had asked for. Once Rav said to his son, &#x201C;It seems to me that your mother is getting better.&#x201D; &#x201C;I am to blame for that,&#x201D; answered Chiya. His father understood that the son had twisted his orders to his mother, so that he would get what he wanted. This disturbed him and he said, &#x201C;Nevertheless, you mustn&#x2019;t do it any longer, because you create a tangle of lies.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn130">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav&#x2019;s colleagues and students sometimes caught him contradicting what he had said on another occasion. When they would bring it to his attention he would be silent, not answering until he thought the matter out. In such cases the Talmud says, &#x201C;Rav was silent.&#x201D; Even in other instances when Rav had a difference of opinion with some other scholars, he would be silent very often, and since he considered that not allowing oneself to be drawn into a dispute to be a mark of a high-born family, he said: &#x201C;The silence of Babylon is its nobility.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn131">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless he was frequently violently angry. Sometimes a matter did not seem to bother him for a long time, and all at once the same thing would make him burst out in a fury of rage.</p>
<p>Thus he was once reading from the Bible in R. Jehudah Hanasi&#x2019;s synagogue. While he was in the midst of his reading, his uncle R. Chiya came in and he began over again for him. Later R. Jehudah Hanasi&#x2019;s son came in and he began all over again once more. Afterwards Bar Kapara came in and he had to begin all over once more. Thus he had to begin reading the same chapter of the Bible three times. To cap the climax R. Chanina entered and asked him to begin the reading again. At this he burst out in anger, &#x201C;How often do I have to begin reading from the beginning?&#x201D;</p>
<p>His anger was only momentary, however, for when he had time to consider he hastened to seek out the one whom he had &#x201C;insulted&#x201D; and apologized to him; and&#x2014;as the story goes&#x2014;R. Chanina refused to accept his apology. For thirteen years after that Rav went to R. Chanina on Yom-Kippur-eve to apologize for the insult offered and it did no good. Another story relates that Rav had an argument with a butcher who also refused to accept his apology. <sup><xref rid="fn132">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A similar incident occurred when Rav acted as an interpreter for Rav Shila. In the course of the lecture Rav translated one word differently from Rav Shila&#x2019;s wish, even though Rav Shila had told him expressly how to translate, and in spite of the rule that &#x201C;when one works for another he must even wash his wet wool.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn133">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his anger Rav would sometimes utter a curse. Once the municipal judge annoyed him with childish questions, and Rav wished that he might grow a horn out of his eyes. Another time Samuel of Nehardea took him to his house and gave him food that spoiled his digestion, and for that Rav said that he hoped he would never have any children. <sup><xref rid="fn134">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The slightest reflection on his honor would often infuriate him. But even more than of his own honor he was touchy and jealous of the honor of the Bible and of the Jewish faith. He would curse people who allowed themselves to do things which other scholars declared were forbidden. <sup><xref rid="fn135">30)</xref></sup> He once cursed a man who planted a tree during Purim. <sup><xref rid="fn136">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because Rav often withdrew what he had previously said, it was an accepted rule that &#x201C;sometimes he said yea and sometimes nay.&#x201D; Many of his opinions are related by different students in dissimilar versions not because the students introduced differences in their quotations, but because he himself changed his formulation.</p>
<p>In general Rav believed that any person might change his mind about a matter while dealing with it, and he stated a rule that &#x201C;when a person began an action conditionally and stopped it unconditionally we may assume that he had abandoned his original intention.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn137">32)</xref></sup> When a merchant once complained that he had been cheated in the price of some goods that he had sold, he told the &#x201C;cheated&#x201D; merchant that he was probably fully aware of the fact at the time and nevertheless he had accepted the lower price because he needed money, and therefore his present change of mind could do him no good. <sup><xref rid="fn138">33)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav went to Palestine from Babylonia twice. The first time was during a strong wave of migration of the Babylonian Jews. For some reason everybody there was seized with a sudden hankering to wander. Economic conditions in Babylonia were normal at the time and there was no pressing need for anyone to leave the country. But the reports from Palestine were bad, and it seemed to the Jews in Babylonia that the Torah was sinking into oblivion in Palestine, and they had to go there in masses in order to revive its study. At that time there came to Palestine people of energy, strong will, and warm hearts. Their presence brought about a revival of life. The seat of the &#x201C;Nasi&#x201D; was occupied at the time by R. Jehudah, the &#x201C;editor&#x201D; of the Mishnah. And still there must have been something wrong if the Talmud later said that &#x201C;when the Torah had been forgotten in Palestine, R. Chiya came with his children and they revived it. <sup><xref rid="fn139">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>This R. Chiya was Rav&#x2019;s uncle, as we have already said, and when he went to Palestine he took along with him his two sons, Hezekiah and Judah, his brother&#x2019;s son Rabah bar Chana, his colleagues R. Chanina bar Chama, R. Simlai, and our Rav. It seems that all these scholars were descendants of ancestors who fled from Palestine during the persecutions of Hadrian or perhaps during later persecutions. They all kept together in Babylonia and together they returned to Palestine.</p>
<p>At that time everybody felt the need to continue the systematization of the Jewish faith through the principles of the &#x201C;Mishnah&#x201D; and Rav, of course, took part actively in this work. His thoughts were concerned with the effort to understand Jewish life clearly. The wish arose in him to lend a hand to the new systematization of the Jewish faith. The frenzied turmoil of events stirred Rav&#x2019;s soul to constant anxiety about the Jewish position. His whole life circled in a long chain between desperation and hope. His only desire was to see his people secure in its national existence.</p>
<p>One may see this aim in every act of his life, even while he was still a student in the synagogue and his abilities were just beginning to reveal their splendor&#x2014;especially in his questions to the teachers under whom he studied. One may see the same thing in his later life when he began to think independently and all the older scholars under whom he had studied were dead.</p>
<p>He came to Palestine with his uncle R. Chiya and several other scholars from Babylonia. It was said then that the purpose of their coming was to aid in the people&#x2019;s development. In this common aim each one had his own method: one wished to restore the spiritual soundness of the masses, another was concerned about the political situation, still another was busy protecting Jews from pagans and another one tried to set an example by his own good deeds.</p>
<p>The arrival of those scholars in Palestine was a great blessing for the people, especially the coming of R. Chiya. Palestine profited doubly by his presence, economically and culturally, for in addition to his activity as a teacher he was also active in commerce. He bought land and had it cultivated at his own expense or rented it out to tenants. Then he exported many divers goods from Palestine and sold them in foreign lands. He employed many people, both relatives and strangers. He had connections in the most distant countries, and a lively trade developed between Palestine and the neighboring countries. This made a living for those who helped him and also stimulated others to follow in his foot-steps.</p>
<p>R. Chiya&#x2019;s chief item of trade was flax. It is related that once he did not wish to sell his flax for the prevailing price because he hoped for a better price later. The merchants offered his flax at the price of next Purim when flax was usually at its dearest. R. Chiya asked R. Jehudah Hanasi whether such a transaction was permissible. R. Jehudah Hanasi said that such a profit could be called &#x201C;usury&#x201D; and was therefore illegal. Later, therefore, R. Chiya declared that such a transaction was a transgression against the Jewish law. <sup><xref rid="fn140">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When R. Chiya and his friends came to Palestine they did not settle in Sephoris, where R. Jehudah Hanasi had the seat of his power but they went to live in Tiberias. It is supposed therefore that R. Chiya&#x2019;s arrival in Palestine and his activity there was not entirely pleasing to the Nasi. He did not wish another spiritual power to grow up in Palestine beside his school in Sephoris, headed by a person who reckoned his descent from king David.</p>
<p>Other historians, however, see no significance in the fact that R. Chiya settled in Tiberias instead of Sephoris near the &#x201C;Nasi.&#x201D; They say there were no ulterior motives for this act, but that the Babylonians who were accustomed to a warmer climate could not stand the atmosphere of Sephoris. They believed that most people die of colds in Sephoris.</p>
<p>People in Palestine used to say, also, that since the arrival of R. Chiya with his sons and students, the hurricanes and earthquakes ceased, the wine had stopped turning sour, and the flax had not spoiled. <sup><xref rid="fn141">36)</xref></sup></p>
<p>While Rav was in Tiberias with his uncle he spent a great deal of time with the students of R. Meir, R. Shimeon ben Eleazar, R. Shimeon ben Chalafta, and Symachos, from whom he acquired several of R. Meir&#x2019;s sayings, which he repeated in R. Meir&#x2019;s name as though he had heard them directly from R. Meir.</p>
<p>Thus Rav always used to say: &#x201C;A man must accustom himself to think that whatever the Almighty does is done for the best,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn142">37)</xref></sup> or that &#x201C;One should always try to teach students as briefly as possible.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn143">38)</xref></sup> On other occasions he would say that &#x201C;one should always leave the house when the streets are light.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn144">39)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sayings which Rav learned from R. Meir&#x2019;s students and which he quoted in the name of R. Meir were usually such as dealt with human conduct and the aims of life. Rav loved life and did not regard it as a passing phase of universal existence.</p>
<p>After R. Chiya had settled in Tiberias he often took Rav with him to visit R. Jehudah Hanasi in Sephoris. The trip from Tiberias to Sephoris and back took a certain amount of time, besides which they would stop frequently during the trip because someone wished to be enlightened on some subject about which the Nasi could not be consulted at that particular time. In this way a sort of travelling religious center was established, which often changed the scene of activity. When R. Jehudah Hanasi died R. Chiya considered himself a more competent religious authority than the later &#x201C;Nasi&#x201D; Rabban Gamliel (the son of R. Jehudah Hanasi) or his brother R. Shimeon. He was hurt therefore that he was not chosen for some position of national leadership.</p>
<p>The arrival of R. Chiya and his family and students in Palestine was an event of great importance, because besides the effect of their teaching they brought new life to the crushed spirits of the Palestinians, who had almost given up all hope of a free life. Since the Babylonians were in a better position at that time than the Palestinians, R. Chiya&#x2019;s group did not have bent backs, and their free manners influenced the Jews of Palestine.</p>
<p>The Palestinians saw a revival of the Torah in the coming of R. Chiya. At the same time the social life of the scholarly groups was revived, they began to visit each other and meet in conference.</p>
<p>During his trips with R. Chiya, Rav satisfied his interest in king David, and in tracing all the places where he hid from Saul and where he waged war on the Philistines, Rav acquired a precise knowledge of Palestinian geography as well as of the differences in the situation of the Jews and their customs in different places. <sup><xref rid="fn145">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>While Rav was travelling abroad with his uncle, his sharp eye studied the life and culture of different nations. He gained an understanding of the Jewish situation in various countries, <sup><xref rid="fn146">41)</xref></sup> and learned the customs of idolatry in different places in Palestine, Babylon and Media. <sup><xref rid="fn147">42</xref></sup>)</p>
<p>It is probable that Rav stayed in Palestine no more than five or six years the first time that he came there with his uncle, R. Chiya, and his students. Then he returned to Babylonia for a short time. It seems that this voyage to Babylonia had no influence upon the later course of his life or upon the history of the Jews.</p>
<p>The reason for his return to Babylonia, it seems, was his desire to be married. Although it is not expressly stated, one can infer it from his leave-taking from R. Chiya. R. Chiya said to him in farewell, when he left his uncle to return to Babylonia, &#x201C;May the Almighty protect you from a fate worse than death&#x0021;&#x201D; Later Rav wondered what could be worse than death, until he remembered the verse in Ecclesiastes (VII, 26) which states that &#x201C;Woman is more bitter than death.&#x201D; One may infer therefore that his uncle wished to warn him to be very careful in picking his wife. <sup><xref rid="fn148">43)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rav was about to leave Palestine, R. Chiya said to R. Jehudah Hanasi: &#x201C;My sister&#x2019;s son is going to Babylonia, may he teach there?&#x201D; The Nasi answered, &#x201C;He may.&#x201D; Then R. Chiya asked, &#x201C;May he give judgment?&#x201D; The Nasi answered, &#x201C;He may.&#x201D; Then R. Chiya asked whether he might give judgment concerning the first-born of clean cattle and the answer was, &#x201C;That he may not do.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn149">44)</xref></sup><xref rid="fn150">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>For almost the whole period that Rav remained in Babylonia the first time he returned, he stayed in the city of Nehardea where he continued his studies. He used to correspond with R. Jehudah Hanasi and introduced certain religious problems in his letters. <sup><xref rid="fn151">45)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A short time later, when Rav had returned from Babylonia, R. Jehudah Hanasi died. This occurred around 190 C.E. Not long afterwards R. Chiya, Rav&#x2019;s uncle, also died. After R. Jehudah Hanasi&#x2019;s death his son Rabban Gamliel took his place and occupied the position of Nasi about ten years. Rav continued to sit in the Nasi&#x2019;s school as a student. He later quoted a great deal of what he had learned from Rabban Gamliel. Only after Rabban Gamliel died and R. Jehudah N&#x2019;siah the First was chosen to take his father&#x2019;s place, did Rav feel that he no longer wished to remain in Palestine and he returned to Babylonia, where he remained until the end of his life.</p>
<p>The deteriorating political situation of the Jews in Palestine had a great influence upon Rav&#x2019;s final decision to return to Babylonia permanently. Because of the political situation, R. Chiya once said that the Almighty knew the Jews would not be able to stand the persecutions of Edom, that is of the Romans, and therefore he dispersed them into Babylonia where they could live in better political circumstances. <sup><xref rid="fn152">46)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We may infer from this statement that if R. Chiya had not felt too old and weak to go to Babylonia, he might also have left Palestine. Still the difficult political situation was not the only reason why Rav returned to Babylonia. We may assume that a great part in his decision was due to the fact that R. Jehudah N&#x2019;siah did not grant him any particular position in his school; for patiently as Rav may have suffered his low position up to now, he surely did not wish to stand it any longer and therefore went away from Palestine.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned also that when Rav returned from Babylonia, R. Jehudah again allowed him to grant releases from vows and give judgment in cases of feminine cleanliness. When R. Jehudah Hanasi died, Rav asked his successor, Rabban Gamliel, to allow him to grant permission about the use of first-born cattle. Rabban Gamliel answered, &#x201C;I cannot give you more than my father gave you. <sup><xref rid="fn153">47)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even though Rav was &#x201C;ordained&#x201D; only in a lesser degree, he was often invited to sit with the &#x201C;Sanhedrin&#x201D;, and since he was then the youngest of them all, he was always asked his opinion first when the opinions of the judges of the &#x201C;Sanhedrin&#x201D; were asked for. <sup><xref rid="fn154">48)</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Jochanan used to tell a story about Rav&#x2019;s importance at that time. He said that when he sat in R. Jehudah Hanasi&#x2019;s school, he sat seventeen rows behind Rav. During the discussion sparks used to fly from Rav&#x2019;s mouth to R. Jehudah Hanasi&#x2019;s mouth and from R. Jehudah Hanasi&#x2019;s mouth to Rav&#x2019;s mouth, and R. Jochanan would listen carefully to them and not understand a word. <sup><xref rid="fn155">49)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears also that others of R. Jehudah Hanasi&#x2019;s students were awed by the greatness of Rav. The story goes that R. Chanina bar Chama once had a dream in which Rav was placed on a palm tree. That was counted as a sign of future greatness. R. Chanina began to fear that he would be outgrown. He wished therefore to send him away from Palestine back to Babylonia. <sup><xref rid="fn156">50)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the death of Rabban Gamliel, R. Jehudah Hanasi&#x2019;s son, the first period in Rav&#x2019;s life in which he was a pupil, ended and he wished to play the role of a teacher. Not having the same respect for R. Jehudah N&#x2019;sia as he had had for his grandfather, R. Jehudah Hanasi, and his father, Rabban Gamliel he no longer wished to stay with him as a pupil.</p>
<p>The time when Rav returned to Babylonia was a period in which the mutual influence of the scholars was at its greatest height. And at the same time there was great friction and sharp differences of opinion between them. Even then there were several different spiritual centers and academies. Besides the academy of the Nasi in Sephoris, there were academies in Tiberias and Caesarea. R. Jehudah Hanasi attempted to concentrate all religious authority in his own hands, and since there were many scholars who rivalled the Nasi in learning, he was very sparing in granting &#x201C;ordinations&#x201D; and such scholars as Levi ben Sisi, Samuel of Nehardea, as well as Hezekiah and Judah the two sons of R. Chiya were not &#x201C;ordained&#x201D; and never entitled to be called &#x201C;Rabbi&#x201D;.</p>
<p>In the meantime things went from bad to worse politically. After the death of the Emperor Commodus (192 C. E.) Pescenius Niger tried to seize power in Rome. He was defeated in open warfare by Septimus Severus. It is hard to know today with whom the Jews sided in the warfare just as it is not known whether either of the rivals promised certain national concessions in the event of his victory.</p>
<p>Judging by the circumstances and the documents of that war which have remained, we may say that the Jews did not even dream of national liberation. They felt in an instinctive manner, however, that they ought to take the opposite side in this war from the side taken by the heathen inhabitants of Palestine (Romans, Greeks, and Syrians), who supported Pescenius Niger. The Samaritans of Shechem did the same&#x2014;and there is only a hint in a saying of Rav as to the side which the Jews took, when he said: &#x201C;I am for Sufianus.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn157">51)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time severe fighting broke out between the Jews and the Samaritans in which a great deal of blood was shed. When Septimus Severus won and became the Emperor of Rome, the followers of Pescenius Niger were severely punished. In the year 200 when Septimus Severus returned from the field after having laid waste the Parthian lands, he passed through Palestine and issued repressive laws against the Gentiles and Samaritans.</p>
<p>Concerning the Jews he said merely that &#x201C;if they persist in their stupid faith, they may preserve their stupidity without interference. But if a Gentile living shall allow himself to be converted to Christianity or Judaism, such an act shall be punished by death.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Still Palestine continued to be the scene of wars and slaughters. A certain Claudius of whom nothing is known except that the Romans called him &#x201C;ladro&#x201D;, which means &#x201C;bandit&#x201D;, became the leader of guerrillas who operated in Syria and Palestine. From their lairs in the hills of Judah they would swoop down upon passers-by or upon neighboring cities and rob and murder at will.</p>
<p>And since many Jews were found among these guerrillas for some reason or other, the Roman government demanded that R. Eleazar ben R. Shimeon ben Yochai and R. Ishmael the son of R. Jose ben Chalafta help them discover the Jewish bandits in their caves and turn them over to the government.</p>
<p>At this R. Joshua ben Karcha sent the following message to R. Eleazar ben R. Shimeon: &#x201C;You vinegar, son of wine, how long will you hand over the people of our God to be murdered?&#x201D; R. Eleazar answered: &#x201C;I am merely uprooting the thorns in the vineyard.&#x201D; To which R. Joshua replied, &#x201C;Let the owner of the garden come and destroy the thorns himself.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn158">52)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we said Rav supported Septimus Severus. But before he left Palestine he said, &#x201C;It is better to be a subject of Ishmael than of Edom.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn159">53)</xref></sup><xref rid="fn160">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>About the year 219 C. E., when Rav (Abba Arecha) was sixty-four years of age, he returned to Babylonia from Palestine for the second time and remained there for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>It is possible that he considered returning to Palestine at some time because it is said that he once told his son Chiya to build him a house in Palestine. It was in this connection that he discussed the boundaries of the land which may properly be called &#x201C;Eretz Israel&#x201D;. We may infer that Rav dreamed of leaving Babylonia and never succeeded in accomplishing his desire; and Chiya never carried out his father&#x2019;s wish. <sup><xref rid="fn161">54)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before Rav arrived in Babylonia, according to legend, Samuel and Kama, who were judges in Nehardea, were once standing beside the &#x201C;King&#x2019;s River&#x201D;, that is the canal which king Hammurabi (Amraphel, king of Shinear) had constructed for a connection between the Tigris and the Euphrates. The water of the &#x201C;King&#x2019;s River&#x201D; was dark and stormy. The two scholars knew by this sign that a man was coming to Babylonia who would stir up the whole Jewry.</p>
<p>No sooner had Rav arrived than there was falling-out between him and the other two scholars which ended in Rav&#x2019;s curse which we have already mentioned. Later Rav always tried to be friendly to Samuel of Nehardea and treated him with great respect, even though Samuel always seemed to try to say directly the opposite of Rav. The story goes that they were both guests at a circumcision once and Rav did not wish to precede Samuel into the house, and Samuel wished to yield to still another scholar who accompanied them. Rav then took Samuel upon his shoulders and went into the house with him. <sup><xref rid="fn162">55)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we have already stated the academy at Nehardea was called &#x201C;Sidra&#x201D; at that time, and its head was Rav Shila. When Rav came to Babylonia, Aba bar Aba, the father of Samuel of Nehardea, was still living. And since Rav was unsuited to be the &#x201C;Reciter&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#xFB44;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;&#x05E7; &#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;</span>) or the &#x201C;Interpreter&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D2;&#x05DE;&#x05DF;</span>) he tried to make a living in another field. The Exilarch appointed him as supervisor of the municipal market to check the weights and measures, to appraise the value of goods, determine their price, to protect buyers from being deceived. It was his duty also to see that the wine brought to market should not be adulterated.</p>
<p>But Rav did not fit this position either. He felt that it was his duty only to regulate weights and measures, not the price or the quality of the goods, and he felt that if a buyer let himself be deceived concerning the price or the quality of his wares, nobody had a right to interfere, for these were matters which concerned only the individual buyer and not the general welfare. For these views the Exilarch removed him from his post and since he had not obeyed the orders of the Exilarch precisely, he was arrested. <sup><xref rid="fn163">56)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After Rav Shila&#x2019;s death Rav left the academy in Nehardea to Samuel and went to Hutzel where R. Achi bar Jashiah had been &#x201C;head of the academy.&#x201D; Since R. Achi&#x2019;s pupils lacked a leader at that time, Rav was appointed as head of their academy. Hutzel was the first landmark of Rav&#x2019;s independent activity in Babylonia. From then on his words were heard and his name began to be known among the scholars. And when Rav founded his academy in Sura later, the students of Hutzel were the first who came in droves to Sura.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell why Rav chose the valley of Sura and the city Matha Machasia for the site of his work. The academy in Sura had a loftier title than the one at Nehardea, being called not &#x201C;Sidra&#x201D; but &#x201C;Mesivta&#x201D;, even though the area of Sura was sparsely inhabited and served as a home for a pack of suspicious characters, most of whom were robbers and thieves. Rav&#x2019;s academy brought culture and the security of life to the place. With the arrival of so many scholars, sources of livelihood opened for the inhabitants, who became civilized under the influence of the academy.</p>
<p>The place had a very hot climate as was natural for a valley of that sort. Palestinians used to say, &#x201C;The Babylonians are fools who live in a dark country;&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn164">57)</xref></sup> but the hot climate of the place was not stable and the rainy season was not regular. Therefore people said: &#x201C;Just as the Babylonians are liars so are their rains.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn165">58)</xref></sup> Yet the whole area was rich in water. Besides the stormy Tigris and the quiet Euphrates, the whole countryside was covered with a network of lakes and ponds whose shores were covered with reeds from which they wove mats and many workers were employed at cutting these reeds.</p>
<p>Various strange creatures were found among those reeds: worms and mosquitoes which spread all sorts of contagious diseases throughout the region. Many epidemics broke out near Sura, but it is related that none of them prevailed in Rav&#x2019;s vicinity. <sup><xref rid="fn166">59)</xref></sup> The reason probably is that the Jews knew methods of warding off the disease. They usually planted groves of date-palms which cleansed the atmosphere with their scent. Once the forests were planted they had other uses also. Various vessels were made of their wood. A beer was made of the dates, and the twigs and branches were used for weaving baskets.</p>
<p>Beer drinking was very prevalent in Babylonia. It was usually made of dates. Other beers were brewed from hops in which the country carried on a widespread commerce. <sup><xref rid="fn167">60)</xref></sup> A malt beer is also mentioned. <sup><xref rid="fn168">61)</xref></sup> Many of the Babylonian scholars made beer and grew rich. In general beer was considered a sort of wine substitute, and a problem arose whether <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05E9;&#x05F4;</span> (the sanctification of the Sabbath) might be pronounced with beer. Rav said that &#x201C;Kiddush&#x201D; might not be pronounced with beer, but <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D4;&#x05D1;&#x05D3;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05F4;</span> (the separation of the Sabbath) might. <sup><xref rid="fn169">62)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Babylon had very little olive oil, and when R. Tarphon said that Friday night candles could be made only out of olive oil, R. Jochanan ben Nuri rose and asked: &#x201C;What are the Babylonians to do, who have only sesame oil?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn170">63)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The various oils which the scholars allowed to be used for Sabbath candles were all to be found in Babylonia. There were various sorts of aromatic plants also as we may infer from the blessing which Rav composed for good scents. <sup><xref rid="fn171">64)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There was also a great deal of wheat in the vicinity of Sura. Other parts of Babylonia would import wheat from there when they lacked it. The country also had a great deal of fruit and, as we have said, enough water to enable them to transport fruit easily from one place to another. Thus the Talmud says: &#x201C;Who brought it about that the storehouses of Babylon are full of grain?&#x201D; and answers: &#x201C;The country has vast water resources.&#x201D; And Rav added, &#x201C;Babylonia is rich and fruitful even without rain.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn172">65)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav and his students as well used to work in the fields and plant gardens with their own hands. For this work they would borrow money in the month of Tishri and pay their debts in grain in the month of Tebet at the price of Tishri. <sup><xref rid="fn173">66)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It may be assumed that Rav tried to make his students self-supporting so that they would not have to depend on the charity of kind-hearted people, who made gifts to scholars in order to share in the reward of their learning. Therefore Rav set aside only two months of the year for study &#x2014; the months of Adar and Elul &#x2014; and made the people work for their living the rest of the year. He probably chose those two months because in Babylonia one could not work or study during the summer because of the great heat: only in Elul, when the air had begun to cool off a bit could one begin to think of studying. The second month, Adar, always came after harvest which took place during the months of Tebeth and Shvat. There was an additional advantage in studying during those two months in that they could review the laws of the approaching holidays.</p>
<p>Babylonia was a country of broad pastures and there was range for the breeding of large numbers of cattle. Rav&#x2019;s students did a great deal of cattle herding and Rav himself was greatly interested, in his research, in lightening the religious prescriptions about the observance of Sabbath which made it difficult to allow the men to graze cattle during the Sabbath. Thus he spoke about the problem of saving an animal which had fallen into a pond on the Sabbath <sup><xref rid="fn174">67)</xref></sup> and about tying an animal to a stake on the Sabbath. <sup><xref rid="fn175">68)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we have said, Rav could not or did not wish to remain in Nehardea and he chose Sura for the center of his future work. Since then Sura was called &#x201C;Rav&#x2019;s place&#x201D; and just as Babylonia itself was divided geographically into the upper hilly region and a lower region of valleys, the leadership of the Jews was divided between Sura and Nehardea.</p>
<p>The center in Sura quickly became the more important and most of the communities in the country accepted Rav&#x2019;s theories and regulated their lives according to them. The Nehardean scholars often tried to put their ideas over but without success.</p>
<p>Rav did not remain content with merely the work in his academy. He travelled from city to city throughout Babylonia trying to establish his policies. His students after him did the same, settling in over twenty cities, and in spite of opposition they succeeded in propagating Rav&#x2019;s religious views. By the revolutionary struggle and the wanderings of these people over the broad prairies and sandy wastes of Babylonia the region of Sura became thickly populated with Jews. Over night Jewish settlements sprang up there.</p>
<p>Together with the Jews a cosmopolitan mass of different peoples also came, and drove the earlier inhabitants, the &#x201C;Parthians&#x201D; out and settled in their place. In many parts of Babylonia Jewish tribes declared themselves politically independent and set up rulers out of their midst. Elsewhere the Heathen persecuted the Jews and the Jews bent their backs under the yoke of oppression. Frequently the Jews sowed the fields and cultivated them, only to see other peoples come and take over the fields with the aid of a new government. A new law based on the right of power developed and whoever seized a field was its lawful owner until someone stronger came and seized it for himself.</p>
<p>When Rav came to Babylonia, king Artaban, a friend of his, ruled there. After the death of this king, Babylonia was captured by a foreign tribe named the &#x201C;Sassanides&#x201D; who set up their own king, Ardjir Babegan, upon the throne. Under his rule the condition of the Jews quickly deteriorated. Power was in the hands of the old Aramites, who regarded themselves as descended from the ancient Babylonians who destroyed the first Temple and drove the Jews out of Palestine.</p>
<p>There was a strong hatred between the Jews and the Aramites, and most of the &#x201C;Anti-Gentile&#x201D; passages in the Talmud were directed against them.<xref rid="fn176">&#x002A;</xref> Jews ordinarily regarded them as murderers and highway-robbers. Jews did not even trust their doctors, as Rav said: &#x201C;Whoever wishes to become blind, may have his eyes treated by an Aramite doctor.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn177">69)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time there was a tendency among those peoples to be converted to Judaism, in order to enjoy the rights of a <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D2;&#x05E8;&#x05F4;</span> (proselyte) among Jews. Rav, as well as the other scholars of that time, protested sharply against the acceptance of proselytes for fear of mixture of races.</p>
<p>In addition to his fear of racial mixture Rav was also afraid of the confusion of cultures. He continually issued warnings against those who followed the ways of the &#x201C;Magics&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DE;&#x05D2;&#x05D5;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) who occupied themselves with star-gazing and grave-robbing for magical purposes. They believed, also, that the dead continue to live in another world, get married and eat just as though they were alive. In addition to the Magics, Rav cautioned the people against imitating the <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D7;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;&#x05F4;</span> that is the Persians who later overran the whole of Babylonia.</p>
<p>Because of the change in the political situation in Babylonia, from which the Jews suffered severely, Rav was often afflicted with a feeling of desperation. He used to say: &#x201C;A time will come yet when the Torah will be completely forgotten by the Jews.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn178">70)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At first the customs of the &#x201C;Magics&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Chaborim&#x201D; struck the Jews as being very queer. A proverb concerning the Magics said that &#x201C;They jabber they know not what.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn179">71)</xref></sup> Nevertheless Rav was afraid that the Jews might learn their ways and he waged a lively war against this. He said that when the Almighty promised a son to the Patriarch Abraham, Abraham took his horoscope and saw that he could not have any children, and the Almighty told him: &#x201C;Do not stargaze, for a Jew should not believe in destiny.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn180">72)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On another occasion Rav said: &#x201C;In the next world there is no eating and drinking, no trade or commerce, no jealousy, hatred or intrigue; the good sit with crowns on their heads and partake of the glow of the Holy Spirit.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn181">73)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rav saw that the people refused to heed his words, and insisted on believing in a new sort of life after death, with food and drink, as the &#x201C;Magics&#x201D; persuaded them to believe, he said; &#x201C;My son, be happy in what you have now, for there is no pleasure in the pit, and when death comes, one cannot tell him to wait. Men are like the grass of the field, some sprout and others wilt.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn182">74)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It should be remarked also that when Rav arrived in Babylonia, the moral condition of the people in Nehardea and its vicinity was very low. Living mainly in the cities where luxury was rife, the people were much given to sin. A legend relates that one of the &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; once met the Prophet Elijah and asked why he delayed his coming. The Prophet Elijah answered him: &#x201C;How can Messiah come when there is so much sin among you even on Yom Kippur?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn183">75)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In many places in the vicinity of Nehardea, men&#x2019;s clothing was made after women&#x2019;s styles because of their loose morals, so that mingling of the sexes should be unnoticeable. Promiscuity was so widespread and so uncontrollable that a rule was actually adopted that a witness could not be disqualified because of moral turpitude. <sup><xref rid="fn184">76)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before Rav&#x2019;s arrival in Sura the people there were rather wild, and are described as having been bold, immodest, and obscene in their speech. It was only because they were mostly shepherds and farmers that they were not as dissolute as the Nehardeans. Rav expended much effort in teaching morals, especially regarding sexual relations. When speaking on this subject Rav always clothed his remarks in real-life allegories; he threatened the sinners with God&#x2019;s severest punishment saying that it was precisely because of crimes of this sort that Jerusalem was destroyed.</p>
<p>Religion as well as morality stood at a low level in Sura. Rav instituted a number of regulations designed to strengthen religious feeling. He was very strict in demanding that the commandments be obeyed and religious duties performed. His strict regulations are known as &#x201C;Rav&#x2019;s prohibitions&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn185">77)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He would curse anybody who permitted any act which ought to be prohibited. <sup><xref rid="fn186">78)</xref></sup> He was convinced that if a person was suspected of a crime he was probably guilty, even if not entirely then in part, and if he had not even partially committed the crime, then he had contemplated doing so. <sup><xref rid="fn187">79)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After Rav came to Sura the city was rebuilt in a beautiful style. Rav made a regulation that the synagogue should be the highest structure in the city. R. Chama bar Guria says of this, quoting Rav, that &#x201C;a city which builds the roofs of its houses higher than the roof of its synagogue, is doomed to destruction.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn188">80)</xref></sup> It is known that Rav loved beauty in general, and it is said he always wore handsome silk robes. <sup><xref rid="fn189">81)</xref></sup> His clothes were embroidered with jewelry <sup><xref rid="fn190">82)</xref></sup> and his seal signature had the form of a fish. <sup><xref rid="fn191">83)</xref></sup></p>
<p>His school had a garden planted around it, just as his city and even the cemeteries were encircled by gardens. He built an anteroom all around his school which was walled up to a balcony. He had over two thousand students, all of whom ate at his table, <sup><xref rid="fn192">84)</xref></sup> and he built the wall because he didn&#x2019;t want chance passers-by to look at them and put a curse upon them. In addition he had the place where his students ate supplied with mats for them to sleep upon. <sup><xref rid="fn193">85)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It seems probable also that Rav&#x2019;s school was situated in a high place for the expression &#x201C;they went up to Rav&#x2019;s house&#x201D; is often used. <sup><xref rid="fn194">86)</xref></sup> He also ordered the synagogue to be built in the center of the town, so that all the houses should be near the synagogue. <sup><xref rid="fn195">87)</xref></sup></p>
<p>By studying Rav&#x2019;s teachings one soon learns that he had an individual system. A great difficulty in reconstructing this system is the fact that most of Rav&#x2019;s utterances are not handed down directly from himself but only in the form in which his students have quoted them. The only conclusion which can safely be drawn from all the material we possess concerning Rav, is the conclusion that when Rav issued judgment upon any legal problem, he tried first of all to understand the spirit of the legal rule which could be applied to that problem. This method is particularly clear in cases where he tried to discover the author of a certain anonymous &#x201C;Mishnah&#x201D;. He would ask &#x201C;From what Tanna does this Mishnah derive?&#x201D; and in his further analysis of the problem, Rav showed himself to be the greatest of all the previous scholars.</p>
<p>He knew that there were certain definite rules in the system of the Mishnah which defined the stand which any Tanna would take on a given problem. Knowing the rule defining a Tanna&#x2019;s bias from the Mishnah&#x2019;s in which his name was mentioned, Rav could easily discover the author of any anonymous &#x201C;Mishnah&#x201D; which bore the unmistakable stamp of the same tendency. In the discussion of the law concerning the &#x201C;vermin and reptiles&#x201D; which were forbidden food for a Jew, it is stated that if a Jew caught or wounded one on the Sabbath, providing this catching or wounding was not necessary for his own use, he was innocent of a sin. Rav then asked: &#x201C;On the basis of whose legal opinions has this law been constructed? &#x2014; for this was an anonymous Misnah. And he answered that the Mishnah agreed with the opinion of R. Shimeon (ben Yochai) who stated, &#x201C;Some work which is not necessarily for one&#x2019;s personal needs, is not considered a sin when it is done on the Sabbath.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn196">88)</xref></sup></p>
<p>This method of seeking out the author of all anonymous Mishnahs remained the system of the academy in Sura until it went out of existence. In Nehardea, on the other hand, there was never any interest in the authorship of any Mishnah. For them it was the law itself which was important without regard to its origin and authorship.</p>
<p>Rav also had a fine style both in Hebrew and in Aramaic. Everything he said seemed to be carved out of a single piece. Even today it is an aesthetic delight to study any of Rav&#x2019;s utterances, whether the contents are of interest or not.</p>
<p>Concerning the scope of the term &#x201C;sacrilege&#x201D; Rav declared that a man like himself would be guilty of that transgression &#x201C;if he bought some meat from a butcher and did not pay immediately,&#x201D; because the butcher might think that Rav had simply robbed him of the meat, and that might lead him to think lightly of the crime of robbery himself. <sup><xref rid="fn197">89)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In speaking of the precise meaning of the term &#x201C;idler&#x201D; Rav said that &#x201C;an idler means a man like R. Samuel bar Shilet<xref rid="fn198">&#x002A;</xref> who eats of his own and drinks of his own and sleeps like a prince in a palace and the tax collector never comes to his door.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn199">90)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When asked to what extent a man is obliged to preach to his fellow men, Rav answered, &#x201C;Until the hearer begins to beat the preacher.&#x201D; When they mentioned the rule that a person who travels a good deal ought to put up always at the same house and the question was raised, &#x201C;How long should he continue to do so?&#x201D; Rav answered, &#x201C;Until they beat him there.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn200">91)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Rav&#x2019;s opinion a man ought to perform his religious duties consistently and not be deterred by any hindrances which might bar his way. He was consequently very severe and would have anybody flogged who disobeyed him. He paid special attention to the morals and protection of women. It is said that he flogged anyone who married a woman simply through intercourse, or when a man met a woman in the street and married her without a prior agreement about the wedding contract. He did the same when a man revoked his divorce or declared that the divorce which he had given to his wife was invald. He also had a man flogged who lived with his wife in his father-in-law&#x2019;s house. <sup><xref rid="fn201">92)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Rav tried to make his words and his meaning clear, he ordinarily spoke so briefly that his students understood very little of what he said. Yet they were afraid to ask him to go back. The only ones who summoned up enough courage to ask him to explain his statements were Rav Cahana and Rav Asi. When he explained his meaning to them, they asked why he hadn&#x2019;t used those words previously. He said it was because he had not supposed that they needed an explanation.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn202">93)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In citing the text of the Mishnah Rav would hardly ever say what, in his opinion, the Mishnah meant, or why he supported one interpretation rather than another. He would do this only when his students asked him. He never explained anything of his own accord because he assumed that the matter was as clear to his audience as it was to himself. Occasionally in study it was discovered that a certain law would have been reversed if the action to which it had referred had taken place in a different region. Rav left such apparent contradictions unexplained, and even when questioned about them he was silent. <sup><xref rid="fn203">94)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It seems that the habit of reading things into the Mishnah which were not there often displeased him. He said therefore that the words &#x201C;all the days of the poor are evil&#x201D; refer to those who deal with the &#x201C;Gemara&#x201D; while &#x201C;the good of heart live a continual feast&#x201D; refers to those who get their knowledge from the Mishnah. <sup><xref rid="fn204">95)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Sura every word Rav spoke was heard in pious awe and hardly ever questioned. It was different in Nehardea. His sayings often seemed queer to the scholars there. Because of this he said, &#x201C;I sometimes have to declare the reason for what I say so that the future generations may not criticize me.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn205">96)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we remarked, Rav encouraged his students to teach others and sit in judgment without interference. This, too, he did in opposition to other scholars who tried to limit the rights of their students and insisted that during their lifetime no student of theirs was to pass any judgment without consulting them first. Rav would say to his students: &#x201C;You may advise on any legal matter that comes to your attention, because a judge can know only that which his eyes see.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn206">97)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before he opened class he always said the prayer of &#x201C;Sh&#x2019;ma&#x201D; and when he would refer to God, he experienced his greatest exaltation of spirit. He said that a blessing without mention of God was no blessing. <sup><xref rid="fn207">98)</xref></sup> He said also that God&#x2019;s name contained the ten attributes of God, with which, as it were, He created the Universe: wisdom, understanding, knowledge, power, fury, strength, justice, law, grace, and mercy. <sup><xref rid="fn208">99)</xref></sup> He felt that an oath taken in court was useless without mention of God&#x2019;s name, for he felt that the mention of God&#x2019;s name in an oath frightened a witness. <sup><xref rid="fn209">100)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is said that when he stood praying, his whole body would quiver and his soul would fill with a peculiar joy. He always said at such a time &#x201C;where there is rejoicing there must be trembling.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn210">101)</xref></sup> Before he rose to pray, he would always try to cleanse his thoughts and he set up a rule that &#x201C;if one knows that his thoughts are troubled, he should not pray.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn211">102)</xref></sup> Once he proclaimed a fast for rain and it did him no good. When another person rose to pray in the synagogue and his prayer was granted, Rav immediately tried to find out what were the good deeds of the petitioner whose prayer the Almighty had heard and granted rain. <sup><xref rid="fn212">103)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We can not be certain how much of his later life Rav lived in Babylonia. According to the &#x201C;Epistle of R. Shrira Gaon&#x201D; Rav headed his academy in Sura for 24 years. Other historians estimate the amount of time which Rav spent in Babylonia after his second term from Palestine at 28 years. We may assume that both opinions are correct, for it is possible that he did head the academy for not more than 24 years. There were four years between Rav&#x2019;s return to Babylonia and the time he founded the academy in Sura, during which he was an &#x201C;Interpreter&#x201D; for Rav Shila on Nehardea and a supervisor of the municipal market.</p>
<p>In any case it is certain that Rav reached a ripe old age and he had the good fortune to see many of his ambitions realized during his life. His academy developed in a brilliant fashion and his opinions were accepted everywhere. Large groups of students, old and young, many of whom later became prominent scholars, always surrounded him when he walked in the street or came into the school. Everybody paid him the greatest respect. His academy was called a &#x201C;minor holy place&#x201D; and he himself &#x201C;Our Great Rabbi.&#x201D;</p>
<p>His opponents made peace with him and wherever he himself did not abandon his opinion, as he often did, his authority was recognized in various religious decisions. Even Samuel of Nehardea, who always defended exactly the opposite point-of-view from Rav, later began to submit to Rav&#x2019;s opinion in the interpretation of many laws. <sup><xref rid="fn213">104)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is characteristic that Samuel treated Rav&#x2019;s opinions with scorn when he heard them from one of his students. At such times he would not call him by the name of Rav but Abba. Once R. Chiya bar Joseph told him some opinion of Rav&#x2019;s and Samuel replied: &#x201C;If Abba said that it proves he knows nothing about the laws of the Sabbath.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn214">105)</xref></sup> In the same manner Samuel said to the same student about a case in impure foods: &#x201C;If Abba said that it proves that he knows nothing about the laws of impure foods.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn215">106)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is related that a man once came to Rav and asked what his status was among Jews since his mother had conceived him by an &#x201C;Aramite&#x201D;. &#x201C;You are a proper Jew,&#x201D; said Rav, because he believed that &#x201C;When a Heathen or a slave has sexual relations with a Jewish woman, the child of such a union is a good Jew.&#x201D; No sooner had Rav declared his opinion that R. Chama bar Gurya, a pupil of Rav, said to the man: &#x201C;Get away from here as fast as you can before Samuel arrives, because as soon as Samuel comes and hears what Rav has said, he will decide against you.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn216">107)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav studied day and night. People said the same of him as was said of king David, that he slept no longer than sixty breaths. <sup><xref rid="fn217">108)</xref></sup> Since he was always wanted on business, he would say; &#x201C;Scholars never have any rest, neither in this world nor in the next.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn218">109)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we said, Rav had great influence with king Artaban who was his personal friend. It was through the support of this friend that Rav founded the academy in Sura. When king Artaban died, Rav said: &#x201C;The bond is loose,&#x201D; referring to their tie of friendship, just as R. Jehudah N&#x2019;siah said when Emperor Antonius died. <sup><xref rid="fn219">110)</xref></sup> It is certain that the later rulers of the country respected the academy in Sura, and in spite of the changes which took place in politics as well as in rulers, the academy was not suppressed. It is certain too however, that the Jews were greatly afflicted outside the academy, and Rav groaned in pain at the evil lot of the people. He said, for example: &#x201C;If all the seas were ink and all the reeds in the swamps were pens, they would not suffice to describe all the evil torments which a ruler can invent for his subjects.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn220">111)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we said Rav believed in a comfortable and quiet life and he used to say of certain people that &#x201C;their life was not worth living&#x201D; as, for instance, of &#x201C;tent-dwellers and those who wander in the desert.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn221">112)</xref></sup> or &#x201C;people who are merciful, emotional and sensitive.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn222">113)</xref></sup> Food and clothing were matters of the highest importance for Rav. Therefore he always prayed that &#x201C;the Almighty give him a life of peace, a secure living, so that he could straighten his bones, a life of wealth and honor, of which he need not be ashamed.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn223">114)</xref></sup></p>
<p>What he said of food and clothing is also typical: &#x201C;A man should sell even the balconies of his house so that he may wear shoes on his feet. If he has had himself bled and has nothing to eat to revive himself, let him sell his shoes and buy food.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn224">115)</xref></sup> We have it recorded, also, that Rav ate meat like bread, salted and dried meat. <sup><xref rid="fn225">116)</xref></sup> He used to fill out his repast with a few young doves stuffed with meal. <sup><xref rid="fn226">117)</xref></sup> In addition he liked to eat fish. He followed strictly the instructions given him by an old fisherman as to the best time for catching fish and when they are good to eat. <sup><xref rid="fn227">118)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Just as important as food and fine clothing for Rav was a life without humiliation. He used to say &#x201C;Shame shortens men&#x2019;s lives.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Like all other Babylonians Rav seems to have had stomach trouble. It was said that &#x201C;more people die of a full pot than an empty belly.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn228">119)</xref></sup> and Rav was certainly among those who suffered as we may see from his remark, &#x201C;A man can stand any sickness except kidney trouble; any pain can be borne except the pain of the heart, any ache but a headache.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn229">120)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his later years Rav&#x2019;s eyes were weak. He lived at the time with his grandson, Shimi bar Chiya. He was unable to see the people who spoke to him and had to recognize them by their voices. His eyes were never cured even though they were treated with a special salve. <sup><xref rid="fn230">121)</xref></sup> His memory was poor at the same time and people said, &#x201C;He has forgotten his knowledge.&#x201D; To a certain question he himself replied: &#x201C;We had a citation for that and we have forgotten it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn231">122)</xref></sup> Seeing that he sometimes forgot what he himself had said made him realize that a person might sometimes forget a commandment and could be reminded of it if something should happen to which that commandment might apply. <sup><xref rid="fn232">123)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless his reason was unclouded until his last day. He used to defend his earlier views with an especial stubbornness and he would say: &#x201C;Anybody who feels competent to answer me, may come and do so.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn233">124)</xref></sup> Once he had a debate with one of his pupils concerning a law and was defeated. He said: &#x201C;Even though he has defeated me, I feel that the law should be as I say.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn234">125)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When his health was completely undermined, Rav became desperate. He would say that an old man who walks with a bent back and his eyes fixed on the ground &#x201C;tries to find what he has not lost.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn235">126)</xref></sup> and also that &#x201C;when a man&#x2019;s end approaches anybody can be his ruler.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn236">127)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Later on Rav died. The whole of Jewry was shocked and when the news was told to Samuel of Nehardea he tore thirteen suits of clothing and said: &#x201C;The man whom I feared is dead.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn237">128)</xref></sup> Thousands of scholars from all over Babylonia came to Rav&#x2019;s funeral. All of them tore their clothes and bewailed the great misfortune which had befallen the Jews. All the Jewish communities resolved to mourn Rav&#x2019;s death twelve months, and in sign of mourning they did not carry <italic>palms</italic> and <italic>myrths</italic> to their children&#x2019;s weddings as they had been accustomed to do. <sup><xref rid="fn238">129)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After Rav&#x2019;s death his students continued to associate with each other. Each one would repeat what he had heard from Rav, and any one who could repeat something clever of Rav&#x2019;s felt proud and was honored by the other students. A long time thereafter Sura remained without a leader, even though it did not cease to exist and continued to be called &#x201C;Rav&#x2019;s house&#x201D;. Still the academy in Nehardea became authoritative in all religious decisions in the life of the Jews of Babylonia, and questions which were too difficult for Sura were referred to Samuel in Nehardea.</p>
<p>The acting head of Sura was Rab Hamnuna; as the Talmud says, wherever one sees it written, &#x201C;Rav&#x2019;s house says,&#x201D; the person meant is Rab Hamnuna, <sup><xref rid="fn239">130)</xref></sup> and Rab Hamnuna himself was known as &#x201C;the old man of Rav&#x2019;s house.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn240">131)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav&#x2019;s influence on later generations of the Jewish people was particularly strong because of his splendid prayers which he used to compose extemporaneously while praying in the synagogue as representative of the congregation, or before opening his class. His faith in the power of prayer was enormous. Nevertheless he seldom prayed for any personal benefit, but always for the general welfare or in behalf of other people. <sup><xref rid="fn241">132)</xref></sup> He would say, &#x201C;Whoever can pray for his fellow man and does not do so, must be called a sinner.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn242">133)</xref></sup> He said, also, that there are three transgressions from which a man cannot be saved and one of these is the delusion &#x201C;that if one has prayed earnestly the Almighty will surely be compelled to grant his prayer.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn243">134)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav&#x2019;s prayers usually contained thanks for the grace which the Almighty shows unto his people Israel, from the days of Abraham till the time when Messiah will come; and the greatest kindness of all these was the fact that He chose the Jews so that they may stand before Him, thank His Blessed Name, and confess Him as their only God. In his prayers Rav would ask further that the Almighty might at length open the eyes of the Heathens and make them realize they worshipped idols that were of no use. Then the whole world would realize the greatness of Israel&#x2019;s God, who did the Jews the great kindness to choose them from among all the nations, and who from the beginning of time had set aside for them so precious a heritage as the Torah, which was the very purpose for which the Universe was created. <sup><xref rid="fn244">135)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On other occasions Rav would pray that just as He had cast His fear on all the nations when the Jews were delivered from Egypt and when He led them for forty years in the wilderness, so may he again cast His fear upon all His creatures, so that all men together might make one bond to serve the Almighty; for if the Heathens feared the Jews, they would also fear God.</p>
<p>Four sorts of people, said Rav, were especially obliged to thank God for his Grace: one who completed a voyage on the ocean, or across the desert, one who is released from a prison, or arises from a sick-bed. <sup><xref rid="fn245">136)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav was a great stylist and his prayers often rival the prophets in their simplicity. It is characteristic of Rav that he mentioned the end of the Jewish dispersion in most of his prayers. Thus he ordained that every day one should say: &#x201C;Break off the yoke of the Heathens from our necks and lead us in pride into our own land.&#x201D; He added to the Sabbath prayer these words: &#x201C;Let the Almighty bring us in joy into our land and plant us in our own boundaries.&#x201D; Similarly for the prayer on holidays: &#x201C;Gather up our scattered remnants from among the Heathens and our dispersed ones from all lands of the earth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is typical of Rav&#x2019;s prayers that rather than asking for future favors, he expresses his gratitude for what the Almighty has already done. Merely the privilege of being allowed to praise God he felt, was itself a cause for thanks. He ordained, therefore, that we say, &#x201C;We thank Thee our God for having led us out of Egypt, delivered us out of bondage, and Thou hast even permitted us to render thanks unto Thy great name. <sup><xref rid="fn246">137)</xref></sup></p>
<p>If a person undertakes a fast, said Rav, he must declare in his prayers what is the purpose for which he undertook to fast. It is not sufficient that he knows the Almighty is aware of the purpose of his prayer, but he must declare it expressly. <sup><xref rid="fn247">138)</xref></sup> Rav had the same thing in mind when he ordained that whenever there is an additional prayer (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;&#x05E3;</span>) the purpose of the &#x201C;Musaf&#x201D; must be declared in praying. <sup><xref rid="fn248">139)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the controversy whether the Creation of the Universe took place in the month of Nisan, which is called the first month in the Bible, or in the month of Tishri, when the Babylonians celebrated their New Year, Rav argued for &#x201C;Tishri&#x201D;. It is an accepted tradition also that Rav arranged the verses of the <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05DC;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;, &#x05D6;&#x05DB;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;, &#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05E4;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> which we recite during &#x201C;Musaf&#x201D; on New Year, and in the Talmud they are called <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05EA;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05E2;&#x05EA;&#x05D0; &#x05D3;&#x05E8;&#x05D1;&#x05F4;</span>. <span dir="ltr"><sup><xref rid="fn249">140)</xref></sup></span></p>
<p>In the introduction to the so called <span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05D3;&#x05E8; &#x05DE;&#x05DC;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> he says: &#x201C;Rule Thou o God, over the Universe with Thy glory, rise up in Thy splendor over the earth, and shine forth in Thy sublime strength over all those who inhabit Thy earth, so that every creature may know that Thou hast created it, and every thing that has the breath of life in its nostrils may say that the God of Israel is the only King of the Universe and His Majesty rules over all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As an introduction to the so called <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E1;&#x05D3;&#x05E8; &#x05D6;&#x05DB;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;&#x05F4;</span> he ordained that the following be said: &#x201C;O God, Thou rememberest all the happenings on earth and the creatures of all time. To Thee are revealed all dark and hidden things, the secrets of Creation, for in the seat of Thy Glory there is no forgetting and nothing is hidden from Thine eyes. Thou recallest everything that has happened to every creature, everything is apparent and known to Thee, for Thou lookest and seest all unto the end of all the generations. Thou hast also set aside a time of reminding for all Thy creatures, wherein various events and infinite multitudes of creatures shall be called to mind, which Thou hast long known and already revealed. This day is the beginning of Thy work; a memorial of the first day of Creation for the Jews, wherein the God of Jacob sits in judgment over man. This day the judgment of the kingdoms is set forth, which to the sword and which shall have peace, which shall have hunger and which shall have fullness. Who is not mentioned on this day? The memory of every living thing comes before Thee today, and Thou recallest every human deed, every thought of a man, every human deception. Happy is that man who forgets Thee not and holds fast to Thee, for they who pray to Thee are never deceived and they who trust in Thee are not shamed forever.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Besides all these prayers Rav also arranged the &#x201C;Haftaroth&#x201D; to be recited from the Prophets after the reading of the Pentateuch every Sabbath and Holiday. <sup><xref rid="fn250">141)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was the general opinion of scholars concerning Rav, which nobody presumed to contradict, that &#x201C;he was worthy to have had the Holy Spirit rest upon him&#x201D;. This was not possible however because &#x201C;he lived in Babylonia.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn251">142)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is related too that Rav did a great deal of travelling. He was continually touring various cities in the interest of the Torah and its propagation, both in Palestine and later on when he was in Babylonia. He therefore spoke frequently about proper behavior on a trip or when a man puts up at an inn. Wherever he travelled Rav acquainted himself with conditions and appreciated the hospitality which he encountered everywhere. He frequently warned people against the dangers of journeying and he would say, &#x201C;No person should go out alone at night.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn252">143)</xref></sup> Another time he said that &#x201C;if one accompanies his friend who is setting out on a journey even so short a distance as four ells within a city, the traveller will meet with no harm.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn253">144)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In everything that Rav ever said about human conduct his intention to protect the weak against the strong is apparent, he tried in the first instance to make women independent and equal in their rights with men so that they should not be dependent on man&#x2019;s caprice. At that time a man had the right to divorce his wife on the slightest pretext. The concept of &#x201C;scandalous thing&#x201D; (Deuteronomy, 24:1) was so interpreted that the slightest cause could serve as grounds for a divorce. It was enough for a man to see a more beautiful woman than his wife for him to divorce her. <sup><xref rid="fn254">145)</xref></sup> But the woman could never get rid of the husband whom her father or older brother had chosen for her.</p>
<p>The scholars introduced many changes in these laws, to enable a woman to demand a divorce under certain conditions and gave the courts the right to force her husband to grant it to her: for instance if her husband was disabled or lost an eye or a hand, or broke his leg; or if his trade gave him an unpleasant odor. There was even one opinion which said that even if a woman knew of her husband&#x2019;s disabilities or unpleasant occupation and still agreed to the match, she could declare that she did not understand at the time how much she would have to suffer and that later she perceived her error. <sup><xref rid="fn255">146)</xref></sup></p>
<p>All these aids for the woman in getting a divorce were not enough for Rav. He was dreadfully hurt when he saw a woman who was bound to a bad husband without any chance of release because he did not have any of the faults mentioned above. He added, therefore, a number of causes for divorce, saying that &#x201C;when a man takes a vow that he will no longer seek any pleasure in his wife, he must divorce her immediately and pay her the sum of her contract.&#x201D; In such a case one need not wait to see whether the man cannot get a release from his vow, but he must divorce her immediately. <sup><xref rid="fn256">147)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A man&#x2019;s duty to feed his wife and provide her with everything she needed was regarded by Rav as the most important part of the marriage contract, and he declared that if a man said to his wife: &#x201C;I will no longer feed you&#x0021;&#x201D; one should not wait until he carried out his threat, but the court must order him to give his wife a divorce and pay her the sum of her contract. <sup><xref rid="fn257">148)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to prevent such mishaps between man and wife as much as possible Rav said that &#x201C;a man must not marry off his daughter when she is young and cannot tell whom she would like to marry.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn258">149)</xref></sup> In addition he forbade the marriage of one&#x2019;s daughter to an old man or the marriage of a son who had not reached authority. <sup><xref rid="fn259">150)</xref></sup> Married life was the most sacred thing he knew and he was always thinking of ways to preserve its sanctity. He considered it woman&#x2019;s duty to be devoted to her husband and to see to the bringing up of her children. He said in this connection that a woman is elevated by the lofty character of her husband, but she must not allow herself to descend to his level if he degenerates. <sup><xref rid="fn260">151)</xref></sup> He used to say also that &#x201C;one should be careful not to hurt his wife, for, being quick to weep, a woman feels herself agrieved at the smallest trifle.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn261">152)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was Rav&#x2019;s greatest care to keep people removed from all temptations and even to prevent them from putting themselves in a position where they might be tempted to sin. <sup><xref rid="fn262">153)</xref></sup> He used to keep himself from thinking about temptation. When walking with his pupil R. Judah once, they saw a woman walking before them, and Rav said to R. Judah: &#x201C;Let us hurry and pass this woman so that we need not continue to walk behind Gehenna.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn263">154)</xref></sup> For the same reason he would never attend debates with those of a different faith, and he would say: &#x201C;Happy is he who repents while still in his full manly vigor.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn264">155)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav kept himself clean not only from any sin with regard to women, but he was also very scrupulous in all his other actions. He used to say: &#x201C;A man should never have a lighter and a heavier measure, so that he has never a chance to use them.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn265">156)</xref></sup> In the same way he would say: &#x201C;if one has a coin whose metal has been lightened, he should not keep it with him, because he may have a chance to use it in a transaction and thereby swindle people.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn266">157)</xref></sup> Concerning a similar matter Rav said; &#x201C;Whoever lends anything to another person without a witness, tempts the borrower to deny the loan, and this is equivalent to placing stumbling blocks before the blind.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn267">158)</xref></sup> More than anything else, however Rav fought against corrupt manners and loose morals. He ordained the severest laws and when he saw that their effect was slight, he tried to influence people by little stories which we would weave into his lectures from time to time.</p>
<p>One of these stories is as follows: There was once an apprentice who coveted his master&#x2019;s wife. The master needed a loan of a certain amount of money to continue his work. The apprentice said to him; &#x201C;Send me your wife and I will lend you the money you need.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The master sent his wife off to the apprentice to fetch him the money. The apprentice kept her days. Then the master came to the apprentice and said: &#x201C;Where is my wife whom I sent to you?&#x201D; The apprentice answered: &#x201C;I was through with her immediately and sent her home. But I have heard that a band of young men seized her on the road and misused her.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then what shall I do now?&#x201D; said the master.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If you will hear my advice,&#x201D; answered the apprentice, &#x201C;you should divorce her.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Unfortunately I cannot divorce her,&#x201D; said the master, &#x201C;because her marriage contract calls for a large sum of money, and I haven&#x2019;t got so much.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then I will lend you the money to pay her contract,&#x201D; answered the apprentice.</p>
<p>The apprentice did as he had promised and lent his master the money to pay his wife&#x2019;s contract. Thus the master divorced his wife and the apprentice married her immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>When the time came for the master to pay his debt to the apprentice, he had no money to pay and the apprentice forced him to serve him as a slave until he had worked off his debt. Then when the apprentice and his wife sat at the table and entertained each other with food and drink, the master had to stand behind them and watch them kiss each other while he served them &#x2014; and when he would bring them wine his tears would fall into their cup.</p>
<p>The Almighty could not allow such a crime to go unnoticed and at that moment the doom of Jerusalem was sealed, and the place where such a thing could occur was condemned to be destroyed. <sup><xref rid="fn268">159)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav related such another tale in a lecture of his: There was once a man who fell sick of desire for a certain woman. Doctors were consulted. They said the man could not be cured until he possessed that woman&#x2026;. The scholars said: &#x201C;Let him die, but he shall not have the woman&#x0021;&#x201D;</p>
<p>The doctors said: &#x201C;If you show him the woman undressed there is a chance he may get better.&#x201D; The scholars replied: &#x201C;Let him die, but he shall not see the woman undressed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At last the doctors said: &#x201C;Just let him speak with the woman over a screen.&#x201D; The scholars answered: &#x201C;If his desire is so strong, he must be allowed to die, but he cannot be permitted to converse with that woman over a screen.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn269">160)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Besides the question of women, Rav paid a great deal of attention to education. He once set the age for beginning school in his remark to R. Samuel bar Shilet, who was a school teacher in Sura: &#x201C;Until a child turns six, do not begin to teach him, and if you should ever want to strike a child, use only the sole of a shoe. <sup><xref rid="fn270">161)</xref></sup> Study too was considered highly important by Rav. He would say: &#x201C;A man should not willingly stay even one hour away from school.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn271">162)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav was a &#x201C;rationalist&#x201D; in questions of religion, and he used to say: &#x201C;The Almighty gave us the commandments in order to refine the Jews, as the goldsmith takes gold in his crucible and refines it of the dross.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn272">163)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav fought shameless conduct with all his strength. He inveighed in the strongest terms against those who went in false ways and he frequently could not restrain himself from cursing them. He considered backsliding from religious faith to be a form of lax morals. But above all Rav fought for social justice, to protect the weak against the strong. He stood in principle for the workers&#x2019; right to freedom of movement when they were hired by the day and he said: &#x201C;A worker may change his mind about a job he has undertaken even in the middle of the day.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn273">164)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He attacked employers sharply when they oppressed their workers and he said: &#x201C;For four things the property of householders comes to ruin: when they withhold the wages of their hired workers, or when they deceive their employees, or when they shift the burden of public service to others, and when they are proud.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn274">165)</xref></sup> Rav&#x2019;s fight against those who refused to shoulder their share of public burdens was particularly bitter. This was a consequence of his own nature, for he himself was always prepared to assume responsibility for any community interest. He wanted to see the same sort of devotion on the part of officials to their posts as to the persons whom they loved. The leaders of the people should not feel themselves superior to ordinary folk. Rav said: &#x201C;Any representative of the people who creates an atmosphere of fear around him, and not for the sake of Heaven, will never have the fortune of seeing his son become a scholar.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn275">166)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav was particularly angry about proud people and he said: &#x201C;Whoever is proud and considers himself too good for other people, loses his learning, if he is a scholar, <sup><xref rid="fn276">167)</xref></sup> and if someone was proud, even though he was not a scholar, Rav said: &#x201C;Whoever struts about in the garb of a scholar, and is not a scholar, will never be admitted into the company of the Almighty.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn277">168)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As badly as he hated boastfulness and vanity, Rav dis-liked people who caused excessive fear in their own household. He said: &#x201C;Whoever causes excessive fear in his own house, drives people to laxity of morals, shedding of blood, and desecration of the Sabbath.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn278">169)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking about the inhabitants of neighboring cities whom he considered dangerous thieves, he said: &#x201C;If a citizen of Geresh ever kisses you, count your teeth to see if you have them all. If anybody from K&#x2019;far P&#x2019;kud falls into step with you, it is surely because he is pleased by your cloak and wants to take it away from you. If a man from Pumbaditha accompanies you, change your inn, so that he will not know where you are staying.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn279">170)</xref></sup> When he was told of a man who came to Babylon and could not get either food or work, he said: &#x201C;The rich men of Babylon are destined for hell; they are descended from the mixed multitude of Egyptians who went out with the Jews from Egypt, for only merciful people are descended from father Abraham.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn280">171)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we have said Rav traveled a great deal in Palestine as well as in Babylonia, and even though he considered his voyages burdensome and would say that &#x201C;A man&#x2019;s traveling is more difficult than a woman&#x2019;s traveling,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn281">172)</xref></sup> he loved the work of spreading the Torah with which he occupied himself on his travels. It seemed to him that &#x201C;the Almighty has made everyone&#x2019;s trade delightful in his own eyes.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn282">173)</xref></sup> Still it seems that he grew tired of the traveling and consequently he said: &#x201C;Any town where the roads go up and down hills makes man and beast old too soon.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn283">174)</xref></sup> Rav learned the value of hospitality on the road, he would often speak about the Patriarchs and their behavior towards strangers and wanderers. He praised Barzilai the Gileadite who brought king David various utensils and foodstuffs when he was in flight before his son Absalom (Samuel II, 17:28). Since the v e r s e mentions the word <span dir="rtl">&#x201E; &#x05E7; &#x05DC; &#x05D9; &#x05F4;</span> twice, Rav concluded that Barzilai brought two kinds of cooked food and stewed fruits. <sup><xref rid="fn284">175)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He interpreted the fact that David sent ten of his men to Nabal the Carmelite (Samuel I, 25) saying that because Nabal gave the ten to eat, although the Bible does not mention the fact, God granted him ten more days to live in return for the meal. <sup><xref rid="fn285">176)</xref></sup> Rav said also that if Jonathan, son of Saul, had given David two loaves of bread when he told him to flee from his father&#x2019;s wrath, David would not have had to take any bread from Ahimelech and the priests of Nob would not have been slain. <sup><xref rid="fn286">177)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we have said Rav was friendly with hunters and shepherds, from whom he learned a great deal about wild and domestic animals. <sup><xref rid="fn287">178)</xref></sup> Rav allowed his own son Chiya to shoot with a bow. <sup><xref rid="fn288">179)</xref></sup> In general hunting was not uncommon among the Jews of Babylonia. The story goes that a certain &#x201C;Tabi Rishba&#x201D; would set out nets and snares to trap birds and animals, <sup><xref rid="fn289">180)</xref></sup> and another named &#x201C;Joseph Rishba&#x201D; engaged in the same trade. <sup><xref rid="fn290">181)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav&#x2019;s aphorisms are very instructive:</p>
<p>&#x201C;The curse of a scholar,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;even if spoken conditionally will always be realized.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn291">182)</xref></sup> When a person gives a present to his friend, he should tell him about it. <sup><xref rid="fn292">183)</xref></sup> Even the casual conversation of a scholar demands careful analysis. <sup><xref rid="fn293">184)</xref></sup> The camel wanted to have horns so the ears he had previously were cut off. <sup><xref rid="fn294">185)</xref></sup> A prisoner cannot break jail by himself. <sup><xref rid="fn295">186)</xref></sup> You need not be surprised that your offspring can sometimes teach you wisdom. <sup><xref rid="fn296">187)</xref></sup> One should not speak insultingly of a Gentile in a Proselyte&#x2019;s presence. <sup><xref rid="fn297">188)</xref></sup> &#x201C;If a hound barks at you, you may enter the house, but if a bitch barks at you, do not enter the house.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn298">189)</xref></sup> This quotation is ordinarily explained as meaning that a person may enter his son-in-law&#x2019;s house even if he growls like a dog, but should not enter his son&#x2019;s house if his wife howls like a bitch.</p>
<p>A Jew, even though he has sinned, is still a Jew. <sup><xref rid="fn299">190)</xref></sup> On another occasion Rav advised one of his students to take to skinning carcasses in the streets rather than be dependent on charity. <sup><xref rid="fn300">191)</xref></sup> Whose hope lies on another person&#x2019;s table lives in a world of gloom. <sup><xref rid="fn301">192)</xref></sup> Pious people regard their money more highly than their lives, for they come by their money with difficulty since they do not practice robbery. <sup><xref rid="fn302">193)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav&#x2019;s aphorisms which speak of things which are found in threes, are particularly interesting:</p>
<p>Three sorts of people should be guarded: sick men, brides and grooms. <sup><xref rid="fn303">194)</xref></sup> There are three sins from which one cannot guard oneself: thinking of sin, inattention during prayer, hearing or repeating gossip. <sup><xref rid="fn304">195)</xref></sup> Three on whom God should have mercy, so that they may be not spoiled: a good king, a good year and a good dream. <sup><xref rid="fn305">196)</xref></sup> Three things shorten men&#x2019;s lives when a person is offered the privilege of reading from the Bible in the Synagogue and refuses, when he is offered the privilege of blessing the wine and he refuses, and when he lives in grand style. <sup><xref rid="fn306">197)</xref></sup> Three things which lengthen men&#x2019;s lives if much time is spent on them: prayer, eating at the table, and cleaning the body. <sup><xref rid="fn307">198)</xref></sup> Three sorts of persons whom God loves: one who never gets angry, one who never gets drunk, and one who is not stubborn. <sup><xref rid="fn308">199)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav dealt with hundreds of religious problems, as well as with problems of ordinary human conduct; in addition he had to settle hundreds of disputes concerning property, or the sale or purchase of various objects. He even had to judge a case once in which a thief sold his loot to the original owner. <sup><xref rid="fn309">200)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We can see that Rav had a sharp eye for people and events. He was incomparably sympathetic and interested in all phases of life. He always kept the limits of propriety in mind. His dearest wish was to see the Jewish people secure in their national existence. He overestimated people in his kindness and yet he was very concerned for the truth. He took a deep interest in the differences in human character and tried to learn the true worth of all human occupations. When teaching his students he was very watchful of their behavior and immediately detected any inattention. He was very strict in demanding religious regularity and did not recognize any obstacles in the way of observance.</p>
<p>It is related that when Rav came to Babylonia, he saw how lightly the Jews treated certain commandments, for instance, how they would mix meat and dairy dishes as though there were no law on the subject which forbade one to leave meat without special care. Consequently he was &#x201C;severe&#x201D; on all these questions even though in other cases he tried to make the legal prescriptions easier when he saw that times required it. In these matters he was very meticulous in discovering exactly the proper change required by the times or the case. For instance, when a case arose concerning oaths, he ruled differently concerning the oath a person took to guard anything that was given or lent to him, and which he later loaned to another or refused to return, and concerning the oath a person took to do or not to do something. <sup><xref rid="fn310">201)</xref></sup> Rav also ruled differently concerning &#x201C;sacred property&#x201D; when it was something which a person had voluntarily decided to give to God, that is to the priests, and when it was the gifts which a person was obliged to give to the priests. <sup><xref rid="fn311">202)</xref></sup> Rav made the same distinction in dealing with the difference between selling and giving away an object. <sup><xref rid="fn312">203)</xref></sup> He said also that if a man transfers his property to his wife he may no longer have its profits. But if he sells his field to his wife and she pays him with her own money, he may have the use of its fruits. <sup><xref rid="fn313">204)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav&#x2019;s ruling was also quite different in the case of an &#x201C;original marriage contract,&#x201D; which he considered as the price which a man had to pay for his wife, and an &#x201C;addition to the contract,&#x201D; which he considered a gift. In questions concerning the transfer of property he considered it to be of the highest importance by whom and under what circumstances the property was being transferred. <sup><xref rid="fn314">205)</xref></sup></p>
<p>These laws seemed particularly important in Rav&#x2019;s eyes because of the difference in the rights of a priest and an ordinary Jew, as well as between a Jew and a Gentile, or when an ordinary Jew owned something which he had inherited from his mother, which his mother had from her father, who was a priest. <sup><xref rid="fn315">206)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav held likewise that a man might change his mind in the middle of a transaction. He therefore established a rule that &#x201C;if a man begins something conditionally and then stops it unconditionally, we may assume that he has changed his mind.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn316">207)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since Rav felt the responsibility of a leader of his people he worried about the regulations governing all the Jewish cities and all the academies, the field work and the draining of swamps. At the same time he enacted laws concerning Jewish life and settled disputes.</p>
<p>The rules which tradition has handed down as those which guided Rav in his decisions are very interesting. Rav said that no man would lie about an event that had occurred in public. <sup><xref rid="fn317">208)</xref></sup> A man does not leave an oath as an inheritance to his children, since children cannot perform an act for their father which their father had sworn to do. <sup><xref rid="fn318">209)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He felt also that a dying man would not lie. <sup><xref rid="fn319">210)</xref></sup></p>
<p>If a person changes the conditions of a thing or sets it down in a place which is unsuited for it and it is later damaged by a second person, the latter is not required to pay the damages. <sup><xref rid="fn320">211)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although a Jew is forbidden to receive interest on money loaned, he may lend his own children money at interest so that they may know the feelings of one who has to pay it. <sup><xref rid="fn321">212)</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn150">&#x002A;) The question concerning the first-born of pure cattle was this: After the Temple was destroyed Jews could not slaughter the first-born of pure cattle unless it had suffered some injury. The extent of such an injury necessary to enable it to be slaughtered had to be certified by a court. R. Jehudah Hanasi permitted Rav to give judgment on all sorts of matters except in this case.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn160">&#x002A;) The text of this remark, which is quoted by Raba bar Machasia in the name of Rab Chama bar Gurya, who heard it from Rav, is certainly incorrect. It says, &#x201C;It is better to be subject to Ishmael than to Edom, to Edom than to a &#x201C;Chabar&#x201D;, to a &#x201C;Chabar&#x201D; than to a scholar, to a scholar than to a widow and an orphan.&#x201D; The part which says &#x201C;to Edom than to a Chabar&#x201D; is of a later period than Rav&#x2019;s referring to a time when the Babylonian fire-worshippers, the &#x201C;Chabarim&#x201D;, persecuted the Jews, and the Jews preferred the sufferings inflicted by the Romans to those of the Persians. But the following passages are simply meaningless in the context. Since the whole quotation comes to us at third hand, and the hand of the censor also did its share of damage, we may state with assurance that the end is an apocryphal addition, and God knows who its author is.</ftnote>

Samuel bar Shilet had all his needs provided for him in his house and did not need to work in the fields to get his food, as the other scholars in Babylonia had to do, and therefore he could sleep quietly in his bed as though it were a palace and the tax collector knew him not.</ftnote>

<title>Shmuel Yarchinaa of Nehardea</title>
<p>H<small>E WAS CALLED</small> S<small>HMUEL</small> Y<small>ARCHINAA</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn322">1)</xref></sup> although his real name was Shmuel ben Aba Hakohen. Together with Rav he was one of the first founders of the Babylonian Talmud. Shmuel lived in Nehardea where he conducted an academy and after the death of Rav Sheila he received the title <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05E9; &#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05F4;</span> (the Head of the Academy).</p>
<p>Concerning the relations of Shmuel and Rav it is impossible to arrive at definite conclusions. At times it appears that Shmuel was an intimate friend of Rav and even dependent on him.<sup><xref rid="fn323">2)</xref></sup> At other times Shmuel directed his questions to Rav as to his master.<sup><xref rid="fn324">3)</xref></sup> But sometimes he opposed the opinions of Rav and maintained contrary ideas.<sup><xref rid="fn325">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless it is related that when Rav died Shmuel rent thirteen garments and said: &#x201C;The man of whom I had so much use, has departed.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn326">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding Shmuel&#x2019;s scholarship it was said that he was primarily an astronomer versed in the ways of the stars, the moon and the planets and that he could calculate the seasons and the months. It is also known that Shmuel once declared: &#x201C;The paths of heaven are known to me like the streets of Nehardea.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn327">6)</xref></sup> Another time he said: &#x201C;I could calculate the leap years for all the Jews.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn328">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition Shmuel was also known to be a learned doctor and acquainted with the laws of nature.<sup><xref rid="fn329">8)</xref></sup> When Rabbi Jochanan wrote to him, he addressed him as &#x201C;our outstanding comrade in Babylonia&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn330">9)</xref></sup> Other scholars referred to him as the &#x201C;lion&#x201D; and allegorically called him &#x201C;the lion, the king of the laws.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn331">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Due to the great honor which was accorded to Shmuel, even his father was referred to as &#x201C;the Father of Shmuel&#x201D;, although he was a prominent man in his own right and was highly respected by the Nasi. He probably also occupied an important post among Babylonian Jewry for we find him addressing questions to Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi of a general religious nature such as the one concerning the order of &#x201C;Havdalah&#x201D; when a holiday begins on a Saturday evening.<sup><xref rid="fn332">11)</xref></sup> On another occasion Shmuel&#x2019;s father visited Palestine in order to ask Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi concerning a problem of money matters.<sup><xref rid="fn333">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was said of Shmuel&#x2019;s father that he was a silk merchant and Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra once sent him a message that he wanted to buy some silk. When Shmuel&#x2019;s father arrived with the merchandise he was told that Rabbi Jehudah had no intention of buying any. But Shmuel&#x2019;s father said: &#x201C;I have more faith in your words than in your money.&#x201D; To this Rabbi Jehudah replied: &#x201C;Because you have believed my words, you shall have a son who shall equal the prophet Samuel.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn334">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his youth Shmuel studied with his father and later he went to Palestine. There he became the physician of Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi and cured the latter of an eye disease. It was said at that time that the Nasi regretted that he could not ordain Shmuel. No cause for the inability of the Nasi to ordain Shmuel is mentioned and it may therefore be assumed that since Rabbi Jehudah was sick he could not convoke the other scholars to grant ordination. Shmuel consoled him by saying that most likely it was foretold even before Adam that he was destined to be a wise man but not an ordained Rabbi.<sup><xref rid="fn335">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Shmuel devoted much study to medicine he declared that three ailments he could not cure: the effect of eating bitter fruit on an empty stomach; the effect of wearing a moist flax belt and the effect of eating a meal and then not walking at least a distance of four ells.<sup><xref rid="fn336">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since many of the people in the neighborhood of Shmuel suffered from eye ailments, he found a salve which became famous. But although he was the discoverer of the salve he nevertheless declared that a drop of cold water in the morning and washing one&#x2019;s hands and feet with warm water in the evening are better than any salve in the world.<sup><xref rid="fn337">16)</xref></sup> Another time he said that he who does not wipe his face well after washing it, his skin will become rough.<sup><xref rid="fn338">17)</xref></sup> For one who suffers from a cold it is permissible to make a fire during the Sabbath, even if the weather is as warm as in the middle of the summer.<sup><xref rid="fn339">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In accordance with his medical theories he listed the foods that should be given to a person who faints from hunger.<sup><xref rid="fn340">19)</xref></sup> He also used the order of the Hebrew alphabet to explain his medical ideas. Thus he said that the letters <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05F3; &#x05E1;&#x05F3; &#x05E2;&#x05F3;</span> are the initials of <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D0; &#x05E1;&#x05DE;&#x05D0; &#x05DC;&#x05E2;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05D0;&#x05F4;</span> which means that eating fish is good for the eyes&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn341">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among Shmuel&#x2019;s friends there was a Gentile astrologer Ablat with whom he discussed the heavenly bodies. Shmuel proved to him that astrology did not influence the life of the Jews for by means of prayers they could change any decree that the stars might foretell for them.<sup><xref rid="fn342">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the death of king Artaban and his successor Ardeshir, the throne of Persia and Babylonia was ascended by king Sapor I who was a friend of Shmuel. (In the Talmud this king is known as &#x201C;Shavour Malka.&#x201D;) This king declared a war against Capadocia and conquered its capital where he slew 12,000 Jews. But Shmuel did not mourn this event for he was of the opinion that they had deserved their fate for fighting against Shavour Malka.<sup><xref rid="fn343">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shmuel was courageous in his convictions and he did not fear to attend the debates at &#x201C;Be Avidan&#x201D; and he also argued matters of faith with king Sapor.<sup><xref rid="fn344">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It may be assumed that upon his return from Palestine Shmuel brought the Mishna of Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi which he taught to his pupils. He was also the first one who allowed himself to add matters that were not included in the Mishna. He usually prefaced his additions by the words: &#x201C;Something is missing and it should be studied as follows.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn345">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The regulations which emanated from Shmuel&#x2019;s academy are usually referred to as the &#x201C;teachings of the house of Shmuel.&#x201D; It is related that in the academy of Shmuel there was a blind scholar who knew the entire Mishna by heart and who arranged the &#x201C;Boraithoth&#x201D; of Shmuel.<sup><xref rid="fn346">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From Shmuel&#x2019;s teachings it is evident that he always sought to find more lenient interpretations of the laws even against the opinions of other scholars. Thus he ruled that in regulations to mourning the law is always according to the less strict interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn347">26)</xref></sup> On another occasion when the regulations of fast days were discussed he said that the law was as Rabbi Meir said, because he believed Rabbi Meir to be the most lenient in these matters. But when he discovered that Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel was even more lenient in his interpretations, he ruled that the law was according to Rabban Simeon.<sup><xref rid="fn348">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears that Shmuel attempted to introduce some radical innovation in the matter of fasts when he said: &#x201C;There is no other public fast in Babylonia aside from the ninth day of Ab.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn349">28)</xref></sup> But the exact nature of the innovation is not entirely clear. It appears that he was not a believer in the merit of fasts for he said that &#x201C;one who spends too much time in fasts may be called a sinner.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn350">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among other innovations of Shmuel mention should be made of his modifications of the Sabbatical regulations.<sup><xref rid="fn351">30)</xref></sup> Among these he permitted lighting a fire for a woman in childbirth<sup><xref rid="fn352">31)</xref></sup> and cooling red hot metal which may happen to lie in a public thoroughfare and thus to constitute a danger to passersby.<sup><xref rid="fn353">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He also ruled in regard to Passover dishes, that the law did not require the destruction of dishes used for leavened food before Passover, but such dishes could be put away during Passover and be used after the holidays. He also permitted that dishes used for cold leavened foods could be used as Passover dishes.<sup><xref rid="fn354">33)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shmuel&#x2019;s contemporaries did not think highly of his abilities as an expounder. He was in the habit of introducing fantastic interpretations into the Biblical verses. Although these interpretations were very interesting they bore no relation to the text which they were supposed to explain. Thus he said that the only difference between his days and the time of Messiah was the subjection to government. This was a very novel statement but it was hardly related to the verse: &#x201C;The poor shall not cease from the earth&#x201D;, upon which he based it.<sup><xref rid="fn355">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In money matters or problems pertaining to personal rights the scholars always preferred the opinions of Shmuel to those of Rav.<sup><xref rid="fn356">35)</xref></sup> Thus it was also said that &#x201C;he who does not agree with the opinions of Shmuel does not know the laws pertaining to damages&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn357">36)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shmuel strived to adapt Jewish laws in money matters to those of the country. This is evident from the rule which he established that &#x201C;the law of the land is the law.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn358">37)</xref></sup> He likewise introduced the principle that the burden of the proof lay with the plaintiff.<sup><xref rid="fn359">38)</xref></sup> A similar rule established by him declared that in the case of doubt concerning a debt, the doubter had to offer proof that it had not been paid.<sup><xref rid="fn360">39)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite that fact that Shmuel Yarchinaa did not receive ordination from the Nasi in Palestine he is referred to in the Babylonian Talmud on numerous occasions as &#x201C;Mar Shmuel&#x201D; and in the Jerusalem Talmud we find him referred to as &#x201C;Rabbi&#x201D; on three occasions.<sup><xref rid="fn361">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the scholars discussed the margin of profit allowed before the price of an article could be considered exorbitant and the transaction invalid, Shmuel set the margin of profit at one sixth of the price of the article.<sup><xref rid="fn362">41)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From statements uttered by Shmuel we may conclude that he was dissatisfied with the leaders of Jewish communal life of his time and whose honesty he doubted. He therefore said that &#x201C;as soon as one becomes a representative of the community he immediately acquires riches&#x201D;. According to the concepts of that time, every &#x201C;leader&#x201D; had to come from a family bearing some taint. Shmuel explained this popular belief by saying: &#x201C;Why was the rule of Saul so brief? Because his family was untainted.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn363">42)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In accordance with his medical convictions, Shmuel believed in frequent washing and he said: &#x201C;The dust which gathers on one&#x2019;s head will blind one if he does not wash frequently. The dust on garments which are not washed frequently leads to moodiness. The dust on one&#x2019;s body leads to filth.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn364">43)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of the friendship of king Sapor (Shavour Malka) it is interesting to relate that whenever Shmuel visited the king, he would perform acrobatic feats; thus it was told that he would raise eight beakers full of wine without spilling a drop of their contents.<sup><xref rid="fn365">44)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of Shmuel&#x2019;s children it is known that one of his sons died during his father&#x2019;s lifetime.<sup><xref rid="fn366">45)</xref></sup> Regarding the clash between Rav and Shmuel it is said that during their first meeting Shmuel invited Rav to his house and offered him indigestible food. Rav thereupon cursed him that his children should die and this curse came true with the death of Shmuel&#x2019;s son.<sup><xref rid="fn367">46)</xref></sup> Of his other children there remained three beautiful daughters. Two of these were imprisoned during the wars of Rome against Babylonia and were taken to Palestine where they remained.<sup><xref rid="fn368">47)</xref></sup> Shmuel&#x2019;s third daughter was captured during an attack on the city of Nehardea and was married by a non-Jew. She later sought to convert her husband. The son which she bore him is mentioned in the Talmud as Rav Mari bar Giora and also as Rav Mari the son of Rachel, the daughter of Shmuel.<sup><xref rid="fn369">48)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shmuel always wanted to adapt Jewish laws to the laws of the land insofar as the former were not deeply grounded in religion. He was not always successful, however, for the other scholars failed to share his point of view. Thus the Persians held that one acquired the right of possession only after ownership over a period of forty years. Jewish law called for ownership over a period of three years only. Shmuel likewise wanted to introduce the Persian law according to which a wealthy man could appropriate the land of the poor in exchange for the taxes on the land which he paid to the government.</p>
<p>He questioned the principle of the need of a majority when rendering a verdict in money matters.<sup><xref rid="fn370">49)</xref></sup> He often preferred the opinions of individuals, which were not shared by the majority, when these individuals gave a strict interpretation of the law that was not in conflict with the Mishna.<sup><xref rid="fn371">50)</xref></sup> He was also of the opinion that customs accepted in a Jewish community carried more weight and could modify a law.<sup><xref rid="fn372">51)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shmuel also invalidated forced divorces in cases where there was no compulsion at the time of the marriage and where he had not done anything to justify the court in forcing him to grant a divorce to his wife.<sup><xref rid="fn373">52)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wishing to aid the oppressed and the weak Shmuel established humanitarian laws for widows and orphans. He thus ruled that movable property which was inherited by orphans who depended on their inheritance for their sustenance, should be sold at once.<sup><xref rid="fn374">53)</xref></sup> He also allowed lending money that was left to orphans on interest.<sup><xref rid="fn375">54)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He who registers his property in the name of his wife &#x2014; Shmuel said &#x2014; may afterward only manage that property. It is not to be considered that such a man deprives his children of their inheritance but rather that he wishes them to respect their mother more highly as a result of being dependent on her.<sup><xref rid="fn376">55)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A widow &#x2014; Shmuel ruled &#x2014; who finds some object becomes its sole owner.<sup><xref rid="fn377">56)</xref></sup> Also when her &#x201C;dowry&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05DB;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D4;&#x05F4;</span>) is about to be paid, the value of the garments she wears should not be deducted from it.<sup><xref rid="fn378">57)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At that time there was practiced in Babylonia the custom of declaring a moratorium on all debts during the Sabbatical year. The only exception to this custom were cases when instituted by Hillel the Old, allowing a creditor to transfer the lender wrote a so called <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E4;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05D6;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05F4;</span> a &#x201C;declaration&#x201D; the debt to a court before the Sabbatical year, so that he could collect after that time. Shmuel did not approve this custom but we have no knowledge of his plans for any reform. At first he objected to the idea that any three persons could declare themselves as a court and could write &#x201C;Prosbols&#x201D;. Later he objected to the principle of the &#x201C;Prosbol&#x201D; and said that if he could he would do away with it entirely.<sup><xref rid="fn379">58)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is improbable, however, that Shmuel wished the Sabbatical year moratorium to be enforced in all its implications. More probably he wished that all debts contracted without any definite condition concerning the Sabbatical year should be payable after that year. But being unable to put this view into practice, he merely warned that not all courts can write a &#x201C;Prosbol&#x201D;. Later he more specifically declared that only the courts of Sura and Nehardea could write &#x201C;Prosbols&#x201D;. All of these confusing statements make it impossible to ascertain just what Shmuel sought to achieve. Thus we find two contradictory statements in this matter, both quoted by his pupil Rav Jehudah in his name. The first statement states that &#x201C;if one loans money to his friend for ten years, the Sabbatical invalidates the debt&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn380">59)</xref></sup> Immediately after that we find the statement that &#x201C;if one loans money to his friend for ten years, the debt remains valid&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn381">60)</xref></sup></p>
<p>One thing remains certain, that although he did not succeed in doing away with the &#x201C;Prosbol&#x201D; altogether, nor did he reestablish the old Biblical law concerning the moratorium of the Sabbatical year, he at least exerted an influence that henceforth the significance of the &#x201C;Prosbol&#x201D; was diminished. He further ruled that orphans do not need a &#x201C;Prosbol&#x201D; and that the Sabbatical year could not void debts owed to them.<sup><xref rid="fn382">61)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like Rav he also insisted on the observance of all the moral regulations both so far as men and women were concerned. When the people of the city of Nehardea showed a certain amount of levity toward marriage ceremonies and divorces, Shmuel declared that &#x201C;one who is not thoroughly acquainted with marriage ceremonies and divorce procedures must maintain no attitude toward them&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn383">62)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shmuel considered marriage to be the most important moral principle of society. When he saw that people took the matter lightly because they could wed a woman with a ring worth less than a penny, he ruled that if one weds a woman even with a date, which in Babylonia is of very little value, the marriage is sanctified because a date is more valuable in other lands.<sup><xref rid="fn384">63)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is characteristic of Shmuel that he put but little trust in the chastity of women. He therefore was strict not to believe the testimony of women who had been held captive among pagans and who later declared that they had not been defiled.<sup><xref rid="fn385">64)</xref></sup> If a bride became pregnant while still living in her father&#x2019;s house even though it may have been known that the bridegroom was the father of the child, Shmuel nevertheless ruled that such a child was of doubtful parentage and that no Jew may later marry it, for a bride who could allow herself to conceive before the marriage ceremony could not be trusted as being of unquestionable conduct against other men.<sup><xref rid="fn386">65)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the attempt to keep men and women apart he declared that may not employ a woman servant either young or old, nor should one greet a woman in the street that she may not have to answer the greeting.<sup><xref rid="fn387">66)</xref></sup> Even the voice of a woman he held to be sufficient to inspire evil thoughts in men.<sup><xref rid="fn388">67)</xref></sup> He therefore ruled that a man may not remain alone with any of the 19 degrees of relatives which one is forbidden to marry according to the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn389">68)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rav arranged the prayers, he was sometimes aided by Shmuel. Shmuel likewise arranged a short prayer for travellers who have not the time to recite the entire &#x201C;Shmone Esre&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn390">69)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shmuel was known for his great modesty. He believed that it was the modesty of Hillel that was responsible for the fact that all of his opinions were accepted by the people. He also said that the quality of modesty was also transferred to Hillel&#x2019;s disciples.<sup><xref rid="fn391">70)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A like measure of modesty Shmuel exhibited toward his disciples. If one of them called his attention to a contradiction in his statements he never sought to justify the contradiction or to claim that he had been misunderstood, as some scholars were in the habit of doing; instead he admitted the correctness of the remark or he remained silent.<sup><xref rid="fn392">71)</xref></sup> Often he opposed the opinions of Rav nevertheless he would also concede whenever Rav was correct. When a pupil once asked him whether a certain regulation pertaining to <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;&#x05F4;</span> was to be practiced according to the opinion of Rav or of Shmuel, he admitted that Rav&#x2019;s opinion was the right one.<sup><xref rid="fn393">72)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At times he even tried to adapt his system to that of Rav.<sup><xref rid="fn394">73)</xref></sup> When Rav visited Shmuel and spent a Sabbath with him, Shmuel commanded the members of his household to follow all the observances of Rav.<sup><xref rid="fn395">74)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As was related above, both Rav and Shmuel had difficulties with the Nasi in Palestine regarding ordination. Rav&#x2019;s objections were not so great because he did receive partial ordination. But Rav was angry that when he asked Rabban Gamliel III to grant him a full ordination, the latter said that he could grant him no more than his father did.</p>
<p>Shmuel, on the other hand, did not receive even a limited ordination. He also never tried to change this state of affairs. When Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah I (the grandson of Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi) permitted the use of oil bought from pagans and the news of this regulation was received in Babylonia, Rav refused to abide by it. Shmuel at that time ordered him to obey it and threatened to expose him as a &#x201C;dissenting elder.&#x201D; <span dir="ltr">(&#x05D6;&#x05E7;&#x05DF; &#x05DE;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;)</span> <sup><xref rid="fn396">75)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is probable that Shmuel was most incensed at the fact that the Jews of Babylonia had to depend upon messengers from Palestine to inform them of leap years as well as of the date of the holidays. The Jews of Babylonia had to celebrate an additional day each holiday because of this custom despite the fact that Shmuel had calculated astronomically the order of the leap years and the exact time of the holidays.</p>
<p>He even wrote a so called &#x201C;Boraitha of the Secrets of the Leap Year&#x201D;, from which anybody could reckon the time of a leap year. But this &#x201C;Boraitha&#x201D; was not adopted by the scholars and it was said that Aba, the father of Rabbi Simlai, once asked Shmuel a question concerning the leap year which the latter could not answer. Aba then said to him: &#x201C;If you cannot answer my question, there must be many other matters concerning which you are ignorant.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn397">76)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Mar Ukba the Exilarch</title>
<p>T<small>HE</small> J<small>EWS OF</small> B<small>ABYLONIA</small> were isolated from the non-Jewish environment. This isolation was enhanced by the fact that they possessed an autonomous administration which regulated their religious and national life. To the central government they merely had to pay taxes in exchange for which they were promised protection, insofar as governments could protect their citizens at that time.</p>
<p>The taxes that were levied on the community were generally not paid to the government directly. Instead there were agents who were empowered to collect the taxes. There thus came into being a class of middlemen who acted as go betweens of the Jews and the government. Every time that one of these go betweens had to hand over the taxes gathered to the king or to his representative, he had an opportunity to request more efficient protection or to exert his influence against those regulations which the Jews considered to be harmful. Since the Jews knew that these men were close to government circles, they accorded them authority also in internal Jewish matters and in time these men assumed the right of expressing opinions in all internal Jewish matters.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D; was such a representative of the Jews and his authority extended over the entire region about the Persian gulf and between the Tigris river on the West to the Indian border on the East. The influence of the &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D; was still further enhanced by the coincidence that like the Nasi in Palestine he was also a descendant of the royal house of David.</p>
<p>We may assume that not all those who bore the title of Exilarch were generous in their relations with the people. The Talmud refers to Exilarchs who &#x201C;rule over Israel with the rod and the cane&#x201D; as against the &#x201C;Nasi&#x201D; of Palestine, the descendant of Hillel who devoted himself to cultivating the knowledge of the Torah among the children.<sup><xref rid="fn398">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately there exists no chronological record of the Exilarchs. The Talmud only mentions four or five of them by name and it is difficult to determine who preceded whom. A more exhaustive list is offered in the &#x201C;Chronicle&#x201D; of R. Jose but many of the names mentioned in that work have been proved by historians to be incorrect.</p>
<p>According to &#x201C;The Chronicle of Rav Sherira Gaon,&#x201D; Mar Ukba succeeded Rav Huna to the office of Exilarch. Rav Huna lived at the time of Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi. But there exists a statement in the Jerusalem Talmud to the effect that Mar Ukba once sent a letter to the Exilarch chiding him for his custom of going to sleep and waking in the morning to the sounds of musical instruments.<sup><xref rid="fn399">2)</xref></sup> This statement is interpreted by some to indicate that Mar Ukba was not an Exilarch. However, it is possible that at the time he wrote the letter he was not the Exilarch but that he later assumed that office.</p>
<p>It is known that when Rav came to Babylonia he was appointed by the then Exilarch to be in charge of weights and measurements in the market place of Nehardea. While holding this office, Rav did not fulfill his duties to the satisfaction of the Exilarch who had him arrested.<sup><xref rid="fn400">3)</xref></sup> We may assume that the Exilarch referred to in the above story was not Mar Ukba for he was a kindly and pious man and he would never allow a man like Rav to be arrested.</p>
<p>Another proof that Mar Ukba was an Exilarch is the fact that he was kept informed concerning the order of the leap years.<sup><xref rid="fn401">4)</xref></sup> He also found two letters from the high court in Palestine that were sent to a previous Exilarch in which the high court announced its decision to declare a leap year.<sup><xref rid="fn402">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>One thing is certain, that at some time during his career Mar Ukba was only head of the court. In this capacity he conducted an academy and exerted an influence on the development of Jewish life in Babylonia.</p>
<p>It is possible that Mar Ukba was a son of the Exilarch Rav Huna and succeeded him to the office. The Exilarch of the time of Rav may have been a different person. But of Mar Ukba&#x2019;s father we know only that he was an important man in the Jewish community. When the question arose as to how long one must wait after eating meat before he may eat cheese, Mar Ukba said: &#x201C;In this respect I am as vinegar is to wine when compared to my father. Whenever he ate meat he would not eat cheese until the following day.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn403">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mar Ukba held court in the city of Kafri in Babylonia.<sup><xref rid="fn404">7)</xref></sup> Shmuel Yarchinaa was one of the associate judges of Mar Ukba. Although was like a pupil of Shmuel and often quoted his statements, he nevertheless presided over the court. Thus it was related that whenever the two were engaged in study, Mar Ukba would sit four ells in front of Shmuel as one does in front of his master; but when they were sitting in judgement the order was reversed and Shmuel occupied a particularly low seat.<sup><xref rid="fn405">8)</xref></sup> Shmuel knew how to honor Mar Ukba and he told his pupil that he should consider Mar Ukba as the master of his master.<sup><xref rid="fn406">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mar Ukba often quoted laws in the name of Shmuel.<sup><xref rid="fn407">10)</xref></sup> It is also probable that Shmuel imparted to him some of his medical knowledge for we find an instance of Rabbi Yanai of Palestine who sent to Mar Ukba for some eye salve of Shmuel.<sup><xref rid="fn408">11)</xref></sup> Similar instances relate that when Rav Acha bar Joseph felt a pain near his heart, he came to Mar Ukba for treatment.<sup><xref rid="fn409">12)</xref></sup> Mar Ukba followed a custom, which he probably adopted from Shmuel, of not sitting in judgement on hot days.<sup><xref rid="fn410">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aside from being a pupil of Shmuel, Mar Ukba apparently also studied with Shmuel&#x2019;s father and with Levi ben Sisi.<sup><xref rid="fn411">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The stories that were told of Mar Ukba&#x2019;s generosity are of great interest. As he was blessed with great wealth, and his wife was also of a kind nature, he could distribute as much as he chose. Thus it was told that a poor man lived in the neighborhood of Mar Ukba and he wanted to aid him secretly lest the man refuse to take charity. He therefore placed four silver coins on the doorstep of the poor man so that he could easily notice them as he enters his house. When Mar Ukba saw that the man bought food with the money he repeated the same procedure for many days. But the beneficiary of these gifts once decided to find out who his benefactor was and he waited in his house all day until he heard a commotion at the door. As the door opened Mar Ukba fled and as he was being pursued he jumped into a lime pit and he burned his ankles.</p>
<p>Another story concerns a poor neighbor of Mar Ukba to whom he sent four hundred silver coins every year on the eve of the Day of Atonement. One time he sent the money with his son who returned, bringing the money back, and declared that those people did not need it since he saw them using valuable wines. Mar Ukba was angered with his son and said: &#x201C;If that poor man is used to a luxurious life, the money should be given to him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Mar Ukba&#x2019;s piety and kindness is also evident from his will. As he approached death, he asked that an account be given to him of the money that he had spent for charity. Finding the sum not to be more than seven thousand dinars, he was saddened and said: &#x201C;Are these all the provisions that I have prepared for such a long trip?&#x201D; He then commanded that half of his wealth should be distributed to the poor after his death.<sup><xref rid="fn412">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mar Ukba&#x2019;s fame spread as far as Palestine and when the scholars of that country wrote to him they addressed him as &#x201C;the one whose nobility is equal to the nobility of Moses who was like a son to Bathya the daughter of Pharaoh.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn413">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also related that when a son of his brother-in-law died, Mar Ukba wished to observe thirty days of mourning out of respect for the feelings of his wife, and Rav Huna, the pupil of Rav, then came to console him.<sup><xref rid="fn414">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At about the same time it occurred that a student named Gneiva had a dispute with Mar Ukba which greatly saddened the latter. The same Gneiva also disputed the opinions of Rav<sup><xref rid="fn415">18)</xref></sup> although on other occasions he quoted the decisions of Rav.<sup><xref rid="fn416">19)</xref></sup> Because of this tendency to dispute, Gneiva was called the &#x201C;half educated&#x201D; by Rav Hisda and Rav Huna. Rashi interprets this nickname to signify &#x201C;one who disputes&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn417">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mar Ukba then turned to Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath, in Palestine, with the following question: &#x201C;There are people who rise against me and I can report them to the government. What shall I do? Rabbi Elazar replied to him with a verse from Psalms: &#x2014; I have thought that I will guard my path from sinning with my tongue; I will make a lock for my mouth as long as the wicked one is confrontong me. Mar Ukba replied with another verse from Psalms: &#x2014; Wait for God&#x2019;s help and hope on Him. Rabbi Elazar answered him by interpreting the verse to mean: &#x2014; Hope to God that He will overthrow your enemies.<sup><xref rid="fn418">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The story ends that Gneiva finally fell into the hands of the government and was condemned to death.<sup><xref rid="fn419">22)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Raba bar Avuha</title>
<p>T<small>HROUGHOUT THE LIFETIME</small> of Shmuel Yarchinaa, no one dared to attempt to instal another man as head of the academy of Sura instead of Rav. The academy of Nehardea therefore remained the only center of Jewish spiritual life in Babylonia. All decisions pertaining to religious conduct emanated from there and the political representation of the Jews of the Persian empire was concentrated in that city.</p>
<p>After the death of Shmuel Yarchinaa, the academy of Nehardea remained orphaned for although a scholar of the calibre of Mar Ukba was Exilarch and the people were compelled to obey him, he never commanded the same respect as Shmuel did. Nor was Mar Ukba the only one who participated in the leadership of Babylonian Jewry. Raba bar Avuha, another representative of Jewry also lived and was active at that time. <xref rid="fn420">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>In his &#x201C;Chronicle&#x201D;, Rav Sherira Gaon lays claim to being a descendant of the Exilarch Raba bar Avuha. Some historians doubt this statement for if we assume that Mar Ukba was Exilarch, it would have been impossible for Raba bar Avuha to hold this office at the same time. Nevertheless such a situation is not altogether precluded. The office of Exilarch was of a political nature and its holder had to collect the taxes and to settle internal disputes. The government of Babylonia could easily have assigned to Mar Ukba and to Raba bar Avuha at different times.</p>
<p>Raba bar Avuha was a pupil of Rav (Aba Arecha) in whose name he quoted numerous statements. We may also assume that after the death of Rav many of his pupils went to Nehardea to continue their studies in the academy of Shmuel. But their devotion to the teachings of Rav was so great that even though they paid the highest respect to Shmuel, they did not quote any of his statements.</p>
<p>This was also true of Raba bar Avuha who later occupied a prominent position among the Jews of Babylonia and who probably conducted an academy of his own, even if we assume that he did not occupy the office of Exilarch. Aside from Rav Nachman bar Jacob, who quoted Raba about one hundred times, none of the other &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; ever mentioned his name. This situation may be explained by the fact that Rav Nachman was a son-in-law of Raba bar Avuha. But Raba bar Avuha was a friend of Rav Huna and Rav Jehudah with whom he studied at the academy of Rav.<sup><xref rid="fn421">1)</xref></sup> When Rav Nachman and Rav Huna visited Raba bar Avuha during his sickness they utilized the opportunity to ask him concerning certain decisions of Rav.<sup><xref rid="fn422">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Nachman&#x2019;s father was one of the judges in the court of Shmuel Yarchinaa. He frequently brought him to attend the trials and he later sent him to the school of Raba bar Avuha, who liked him so much that he gave him his daughter in marriage. The young man was beardless and some doubts were entertained as to his manhood. Raba bar Avuha then asked some scholars of Nehardea to investigate the matter.<sup><xref rid="fn423">3)</xref></sup> The scholars reported favorably and soon after that Raba bar Avuha gave his gifted daughter Yalta in marriage to Rav Nachman. The Talmud contains many stories about Yalta from which it appears that she wished to be treated as an equal and rebelled against the treatment then accorded to women. Thus it is told that Ula, a pupil of Rabbi Jochanan, once visited Rav Nachman and was invited to dinner. After the meal was eaten and grace pronounced, Ula handed the &#x201C;beaker of blessing&#x201D; to Rav Nachman, but the latter said: &#x201C;Let us send it to my wife Yalta.&#x201D; Ula refused to do so and quoted a statement of Rabbi Jochanan who held women in contempt. Yalta heard this remark and in her anger she wrecked four hundred barrels of wine. (&#x0021;) &#x201C;Let us send her another beaker&#x201D;, Rav Nachman then said to Ula, but Ula replied: &#x201C;Any wine that is contained in a barrel is like the wine of the beaker of blessing. If she wishes she may drink of it.&#x201D; To this Yalta retorted: &#x201C;From such wanderers one can hear only empty words and torn rags only harbor filth.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn424">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another story is related concerning Rav Amram the pious who suffered much from the servants of the Exilarch. The latter were annoyed by his extreme piety. Weary of their tormenting, he left the palace of the Exilarch and spent the night on the snow. On the following day the servants asked him what he would like to eat and he asked for lean meat and wine mixed with water. The servants then brought him fat meat and undiluted wine. Rav Amram became sick as a result of eating this food and his body was covered by a rash. When Yalta heard of this she took the man under her care and he allowed her to cure him.<sup><xref rid="fn425">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On another occasion, when Rav Jehudah &#x2014; a pupil of Rav and Shmuel &#x2014; quoted Shmuel to the effect that one may not send greetings to a woman even through her husband, Yalta said to her husband: &#x201C;Send away this person that you may not be confused with other Ame Aratzim.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn426">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition it was said that she questioned her husband concerning the accepted rule that everything which the Torah forbade had a counterpart that was permissible.<sup><xref rid="fn427">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is said that Raba bar Avuha met the prophet Elijah twice. The description of one of these meetings has a purely allegoriacl significance. Elijah took him to paradise and told him to remove his mantle. Raba did so and squeezing the garment he sold the extracted odor for twelve thousand ducats; half of this sum he gave to his sons-in-law.<sup><xref rid="fn428">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after Shmuel&#x2019;s death there broke out a great war in the vicinity of Nehardea. A leader of a Roman robber band named Papa ben Netzer &#x2014; referred to as Odenatus by Roman historians &#x2014; attacked the city of Nehardea and destroyed it. The academy was then closed for some time and Raba bar Avuha together with his son in law were forced to leave the city. They wandered from city to city until they finally settled in Mechoza on the banks of the Tigris. In that city Raba bar Avuha organized a court and continued to guide the life of the Jews of Babylonia.<sup><xref rid="fn429">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two of Shmuel&#x2019;s daughters were taken captive during the war on Nehardea and were led to Palestine. Despite Shmuel&#x2019;s rule that a woman who had been held captive should not be trusted when she declares that she had not been defiled, the scholars of Palestine did believe his daughters when they declared that they were pure.<sup><xref rid="fn430">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A third daughtr of Shmuel was also taken captive and married by a non-Jew. She tried to convert her husband and the son which she bore him is mentioned in the Talmud as Rav Mari bar Isur Giora or Rav Mari bar Rachel bath Shmuel.<sup><xref rid="fn431">11)</xref></sup> Later there occurred the question of the inheritance of this Giora for he was conceived before his father was converted.<sup><xref rid="fn432">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The above mentioned Odenatus succeeded in vanquishing the Persians in the district of Nehardea and he also interfered with their development. He thus rose from the status of a robber chieftain, which was punishable by death, and he became an important support of Roman rule in Asia Minor. The Roman government later recognized him as an independent ruler of Palmyra, a city that was built one thousand years earlier by king Solomon. With his power augmented, Odenatus declared a war against the Persian empire under the rule of king Sapor and he forced its king to abandon his capital Ktensiphon.</p>
<p>For six years Odenatus maintained himself in power and emperor Galianus had to recognize him as an equal in the rule of Rome. (264 C. E.) Then he was assassinated by one of his retainers and many believed that his wife Zenovia had a hand in the plot.</p>
<p>Christian historians relate concerning queen Zenovia that she was favorably inclined toward the Jewish faith. It was also said that in opposition to her husband&#x2019;s policy of aiding Rome she sought to liberate the Asiatic possessions of Rome. But the Jews of Palestine did not support queen Zenovia and when emperor Aurelianus waged war against her, he was supported by the Jews.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Rav Nachman bar Jacob</title>
<p>T<small>HIS</small> R<small>AV</small> N<small>ACHMAN</small> is often mentioned without the name of his father and he was one of the younger &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; of Babylonia. He was close to ninety years old when he died, and his period of influence extended between the year 235 and 325 C. E. His life occurred during an age of freedom. The Jews of Babylonia, living under conditions of comparative political security, were characterized by a certain self-confidence and gaiety.</p>
<p>As we have said, the city of Nehardea was attacked during the time of Raba bar Avuha and the academy there was forced into exile. This seems to have lasted only a few years, however, and it had no influence upon the situation of the Jews in general. Raba bar Avuha remained in Mechoza and may have died there. But his son-in-law, Rav Nachman, returned to Nehardea and guided his own academy which continued the work of Shmuel Yarchinaa and Raba bar Avuha.<sup><xref rid="fn433">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As son-in-law of the &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D; Rav Nachman had very lordly manners, and the reproach which Mar Ukba once directed against another &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D; that he did wrong because he went to sleep and awoke to the sound of music<sup><xref rid="fn434">2)</xref></sup> could have been applied to Rav Nachman in a much more severe form, although he was only a son-in-law of the &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D; and yet he lived in a style which was unparalleled among Jews at that time. Servants armed with staffs and whips always encircled him when he appeared in the street, or when he sat in court, ready to beat anybody who did not pay him the proper respect or refused to accept his decisions.<sup><xref rid="fn435">3)</xref></sup> His father-in-law had appointed him to the position of &#x201C;Chief Justice&#x201D; in Nehardea, and he felt himself superior to all his colleagues because of his position and he used to tell them that they had no right to criticize his decisions because he was the judge and not they.<sup><xref rid="fn436">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He never allowed for circumstances in making his decisions. A typical story tells of an old woman who came to him to complain about the servants of the &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D; because they robbed her of a few planks in order to build a religious Tabernacle (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D4;</span>) for the &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D;. She screamed that the &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D; and all his guests were feasting in a stolen &#x201C;tabernacle&#x201D;.</p>
<p>During the woman&#x2019;s testimony Rav Nachman paid no attention to her and he did not even heed her cries. This made the woman angry and she said, &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you listen to my outcry? Are you proud of your army of servants? Who do you think I am? I am a daughter of Father Abraham and in my father&#x2019;s house there were three hundred and eighteen servants, though nobody pays any attention to my cries here&#x0021;&#x201D; Rav Nachman answered, &#x201C;She is a noisy woman and all she gets is the money for her wood.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn437">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his pride of office, Rav Nachman once asked Rav Huna, &#x201C;Is the law as you say or as I think?&#x201D; Rav Huna answered, &#x201C;The law is certainly as you think, for you are close to the house of the Exilarch where the judges sit.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn438">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Until Rav Nachman&#x2019;s time it was an accepted rule that civil suits were heard by three judges. Only occasionally were such cases allowed to be heard by a single judge; Rav Nachman did this constantly, thus breaking with a longstanding rule.<sup><xref rid="fn439">7)</xref></sup> On another occasion when the case of a note of indebtedness was being judged, Rav Judah bar Ezekiel having torn up the note because he held it to be invalid, Rav Nachman said that only a &#x201C;child&#x201D; would have torn up that note, and added that &#x201C;they were all children compared to me.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn440">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Nachman was also ruthless in his treatment of his slaves. Whenever Shmuel Yarchinaa examined a female slave for medical purposes, it was his custom to pay the slave four gold coins to compensate for any shame which he was forced to cause her. When someone asked him why he did this, he answered, &#x201C;The Bible says, to be sure, that a slave must work forever, which we must understand as meaning that a slave is our property for work but not to humiliate.&#x201D; Rav Nachman, on the other hand, had no regard for the shame of his female slaves. Shmuel Yarchinaa, too, used to marry his female slaves to his male slaves, according to their own choice. Rav Nachman would mix them up at will, and when he chose he would take a woman from one of his slaves and give her to another, without regard to their moral sensibilities.<sup><xref rid="fn441">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Nachman also made an innovation in trial procedure. It had been the custom until then that when one party claimed a debt and wished to be repaid by a second party who entirely denied the debt, the second party did not have to pay and did not even have to take an oath, for they believed that when a person owed someone money, he would never have the nerve to deny it outright. In Rav Nachman&#x2019;s time, however, there was an increase in the number of daring swindlers who denied their debts and could not be forced to back up their denials with an oath. Rav Nachman ordained a so called <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E9;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05EA; &#x05D4;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05EA;&#x05F4;</span> which was an oath administered in cases where the claimant had no witnesses to substantiate his claim of debt and the accused denied the debt completely. Rav Nachman thought that a debtor would ordinarily deny his debt if he knew that he would not be forced to swear but nobody would claim a debt where it did not exist.<sup><xref rid="fn442">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a great deal of comment concerning Rav Nachman&#x2019;s wealth. His wife, Yalta, once flew into a rage because a certain scholar did not wish to send her the &#x201C;cup of blessing&#x201D;, and she broke 400 barrels of wine. It is related, also, that Rav Nachman would drive out in a golden wagon, covered with a robe of purple dyed wool and led by slaves.<sup><xref rid="fn443">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is related that once one of the Palestinian scholars named R. Isaac came to visit Rav Nachman. Rav Nachman welcomed him very cordially and after the guest had eaten and drunk his fill, Rav Nachman asked for his blessing. In answer R. Isaac told him the following story:</p>
<p>Once a traveller had lost his way in a desert and was wandering about tired, starved and thirsty. He came upon a tree unexpectedly, with sweet fruit, pleasant shade and watered by a stream which flowed under it. The wanderer ate the tree&#x2019;s fruit, sat in its shade and drank from the spring.</p>
<p>When he was ready to go on the wanderer turned to the tree and said, &#x201C;With what shall I bless thee, o thou excellent tree? Shall I say may your fruit be sweet? It is sweet already. Shall I say may your shade be pleasant? It is pleasant already. Shall I ask for a stream to flow beneath you? There is such a stream already. Then I will merely wish that all the plants that are cut from you may grow up to be like you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is the same with you,&#x201D; R. Isaac added, &#x201C;How shall I bless you? Shall I bless you with learning? You have learning enough already. Shall I bless you with riches? You have riches already. Shall I bless you with children? You have children already. Then I will merely wish that all of your descendants may be like you.<sup><xref rid="fn444">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Nachman&#x2019;s scholarly activity dealt mainly with the regulation of practical life and money matters. His decisions in these fields were considered binding by later Babylonian judges. As they said, &#x201C;In any money matter, the law is as Rav Nachman said.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn445">12)</xref></sup> In his decisions Rav Nachman was not bothered by the fact that very often the literal law of the Mishnah was opposed to his stand. Following the precedent of Shmuel Yarchinaa who held that the law of the Gentiles was valid, he adopted certain Persian regulations as part of Jewish law. It should be remarked also that in spite of his strict principles he often tried to moderate the severity of religious custom: for instance, he said that bricks or other building materials which had been left after a building was completed might be removed on the Sabbath because they were in the same category as vessels and utensils, no longer being considered as building materials.<sup><xref rid="fn446">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concerning &#x201C;Claims through possession&#x201D; Rav Nachman said that the household of the &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D; could lay no claim to the property of others on the basis of possession and <italic>vice versa</italic>: if a member of the Exilarch&#x2019;s household occupied the fields of another person, this did not constitute a claim of possession, just as it was not a valid claim of possession if anyone held some of the Exilarch&#x2019;s property, because the Exilarch&#x2019;s household could not be denied anything and they were allowed to do anything they chose. Similarly there could be not talk of claims of possession against the Exilarch&#x2019;s property, because his servants used to let strangers live in their houses and cultivate their fields and said nothing, because they did not care if other people took care of the Exilarch&#x2019;s houses or fertilized his fields, since they knew that they could take everything back by force whenever they wanted to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn447">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once there was talk of the Messiah in Rav Nachman&#x2019;s presence, and various opinions were expressed as to who the Messiah was. Rav Nachman said that &#x201C;if the Messiah was alive it might be that it was he himself.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn448">15)</xref></sup> On another occasion one of the scholars studying with Rav Nachman quoted the &#x201C;Boraitha&#x201D; which said that since the death of R. Judah Hanasi humility and piety had vanished. Said Rav Nachman in answer: &#x201C;As long as I am alive you need not say that piety has disappeared.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn449">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once Rav Nachman dared to order Rav Judah bar Ezekiel, the head of the academy in Pumbeditha, to appear on trial before him in Nehardea. The story was as follows: a certain Nehardean came to Pumbeditha to buy meat at a butcher&#x2019;s. He came at the same time as one of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel&#x2019;s servants. The butcher said to the fellow, &#x201C;Wait a while until I give Rav Judah bar Ezekiel&#x2019;s servant his meat.&#x201D; The man made a grimace of distaste and said, &#x201C;Who is this Rav Judah bar Shveskal, that I should wait for him.&#x201D; The story was related to Rav Judah who was considerably annoyed, and having heard similar tales about the same fellow, he had him excommunicated. The man complained about Rav Judah to Rav Nachman. Without hesitation Rav Nachman sent a &#x201C;summons&#x201D; to Rav Judah to appear and explain his action. Rav Judah would not have paid any attention to Rav Nachman&#x2019;s summons, if he had not gone to Rav Huna first and asked him what to do. Rav Huna told him that by right he should not go because his learning was greater than that of Rav Nachman. However, since he was the son-in-law of the Exilarch, Rav Nachman should be paid the respect of having Rav Judah appear before him.<sup><xref rid="fn450">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The scholars of Babylon were generally angry at Rav Nachman because he presumed too much upon the authority of his father-in-law, the Exilarch, and even expressed himself about earlier scholars in a manner which was considered sinful. For example he once swore in a discussion of a law of R. Jochanan&#x2019;s that he would not accept it if he heard it from R. Jochanan himself.<sup><xref rid="fn451">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we said above, Rav Nachman&#x2019;s wife was a woman of peculiar character and she also wore the pants in the house, so to speak. This may have been the reason why when Rav Nachman came to the city of Shchenziv he ordered his servants to find him a woman who would be willing to be his wife during his stay in the city and agree to a divorce thereafter.<sup><xref rid="fn452">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is also a frightful story about Rav Nachman&#x2019;s daughters who were captured by pagans. At first they used to stir the boiling pots on the oven with their bare hands so that whoever saw it would think that because of their great virtue they did not feel their hands burning. Later, however, Rav Ilish was captive together with them and wanted to ransom them because they were Rav Nachman&#x2019;s daughters. But he once heard them in conversation and they said: &#x201C;What do we lack here? In Nehardea we had man and here we have them, too. Let us have them take us far away from here so that our husbands cannot come and ransom us from captivity.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn453">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is interesting that when Raba sat by Rav Nachman&#x2019;s bed as he was dying, Rav Nachman promised him that he would appear to him from the next world. When Rav Nachman did appear to Raba, he asked him if he had felt any pain at death. Rav Nachman said that the departure of his soul was like drawing a hair out of milk. If the Almighty wanted to send him back now to whence he had come, he would not accept because he would be afraid to suffer once more the pains of life and the fear of the Angel of Death.</p>

<title>Rav Huna, Head of the Academy in Sura</title>
<p>A<small>T THE TIME WITH WHICH</small> we are concerned the Jews of Palestine were suffering terribly from material need and political oppression. Large sections of the country lay waste and uninhabited. As a result any Jew who could possibly leave the country did so, and anyone who was able to go to Babylonia was considered lucky. The whole neighborhood of Jerusalem was inhabited by Gentiles and in Babylonia, on the other hand, a new sort of Jewish life began to flourish. Since the community was based from the beginning upon the functions of prayer and study, the Torah was held in high honor and the scholars were the real leaders.</p>
<p>One of these scholars was Rav Huna of Diakora, called &#x201C;Diokra&#x201D; and &#x201C;Diokereth&#x201D; in the Talmud, who must not be confused with Rav Hunah Rabah, the &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D; of Babylonia, who lived at the time of Rabbi Judah Hanasi. This should be carefully noted, since the existence of several Rav Hunas has led some comentators to interchange the two men. Our Rav Huna of Diakora was born about 216 C. E. He spent most of his life in the academy at Sura where he arrived in his early youth as a student of Rav (Abba Arecha) and remained until the end of his days.</p>
<p>Like Rav Chisda, Rav Huna was called the pious Babylonian&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn454">1)</xref></sup> and it was said that he was worthy to have had the Holy Spirit rest upon him. But this did not happen because he lived in Babylonia.<sup><xref rid="fn455">2)</xref></sup> Most of Rav&#x2019;s enactments have reached us through Rav Huna&#x2019;s hands. In addition many of the sayings of Rav Huna are obviously quoted from Rav although this is not declared expressly. One should know also that Rav often spoke to Rav Huna in a contemptuous tone.<sup><xref rid="fn456">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Right after Rav&#x2019;s death Rav Huna became the head of the academy in Sura. During the life of Shmuel Yarchinaa, however, Babylonian Jews considered the academy in Nehardea as the more important. For a certain time Rav Hamnuna was considered the spiritual heir of Rav. In addition many of the scholars of Sura left in order to continue their studies elsewhere, in the new academies which were beginning to develop. Only after the death of Shmuel Yarchinaa and when the academy in Nehardea began to lose its former significance, and especially after the destruction of Nehardea, did Rav Huna receive the title of &#x201C;Head of the Academy&#x201D; in Sura.</p>
<p>Rav Huna&#x2019;s parents are not known. Since we know however from the &#x201C;Chronicle&#x201D; of Rav Shrira Gaon that he was descended from the family of the Exilarch, many historians state that he was a grandson of Rav Huna Rabah, who was Exilarch in the time of Rabbi Judah Hanasi. He himself does not mention his ancestors anywhere.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the mention of Rav Huna&#x2019;s wealth. At first stories are told of his poverty and suddenly he seems to have become a wealthy man. When he was still poor, it is related, he used to labor in his own field, and when people came to him for judgment he would say: &#x201C;Get someone to do my work for me while I listen to your arguments and I will undertake the judgment.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn457">4)</xref></sup> On another occasion it is said, Rav Huna was letting his cattle graze in the pasture, when someone approached him and asked him to give testimony for him in a certain matter, about which he seems to have been well informed. Rav Huna said to him: &#x201C;If you will pay me what I will lose by leaving my work, I will bear witness for you.&#x201D; Similarly when two persons came before him for trial while he was up in a date palm picking the fruit, he replied; &#x201C;If you will come up here and take my place, I will take on your case.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn458">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was from this time also that he derived his knowledge of trees of which he used to avail himself later in deciding cases.<sup><xref rid="fn459">6)</xref></sup> Other stories relate that when he once needed money for wine for the Sabbath, he pawned his girdle and belted himself with a rope. When Rav saw him enter school in this fashion he asked him what this meant. Rav Huna told him the whole story and Rav blessed him that another time he might be girded in silk.<sup><xref rid="fn460">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Then suddenly we hear that Rav Huna owned many fields and vineyards which he no longer cultivated himself, but hired out to tenants, and his flocks of sheep were pastured in the broad plains of southern Babylonia.<sup><xref rid="fn461">8)</xref></sup> At this time his family, too, had grown great in sons, daughters, in-laws and grandchilden, and when Rav Huna married off his son Rabah, he sat on a divan in a side room and, being short of stature, he remained unnoticed. Then his daughters and daughters-in-law cast their silken robes upon him and covered him up completely. When he was later uncovered, people were reminded of the time of his poverty when he belted himself with a rope and came so into the school, and Rav blessed him that he might some day be wrapped in silk.</p>
<p>A story is told of the accomplishments of Rav Huna and of his wealth, that whenever there was a storm, of the sort which often uprooted trees and overturned houses in Sura, Rav Huna would take a walk through the streets of Sura after it was quiet, and when he saw a shattered wall which had been damaged by the storm and was about to cave in, he would order his slaves to tear down the wall so that it might not injure passers-by, and then had a new one constructed at his own expense if he knew that the owner could not afford to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn462">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rav Huna sat down to eat, he opened the doors of his house wide and invited anyone who was hungry to eat with him.<sup><xref rid="fn463">10)</xref></sup> It is related that in the months of Adar and Elul when the students of the academy would gather, he would feed eight hundred students at his own expense.</p>
<p>In those two months Rav Huna was surrounded by thirteen scholars who acted as interpreters and whatever they heard him say was repeated to the students in a simplified form. In this connection we are given an idea of the number of students who sat at the feet of Rav Huna in his academy. &#x201C;When they stood up and shook the dust from their clothes, they would becloud the sun in Palestine.<sup><xref rid="fn464">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He said, &#x201C;whoever devotes himself entirely to study, and does not act generously towards his fellows, is like a man without a God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn465">12)</xref></sup> Nevertheless the scholars were never timid about it when Rav Huna needed upbraiding. Thus one time he had four hundred barrels of wine turn sour and suffered a great loss in money. The scholars came to console him and said; &#x201C;Now is the time when you should consider your past actions, for it is inconceivable that the Almighty should punish somebody unless he deserved it. You have probably treated your tenant unjustly and have not given him his proper share of the grapes.&#x201D; Rav Huna listened to their words and began to better his ways.<sup><xref rid="fn466">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Huna is supposed to have been &#x201C;Head of the Academy&#x201D; in Sura for forty years. Under his guidance the Jews in Babylonia slowly began to liberate themselves from their dependence in religious matters upon the Palestinian scholars. Rav Huna was the first to cut off relations with Palestine in many cases. He said: &#x201C;We have made ourselves like unto Palestine.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn467">14)</xref></sup> In fact the learning of Babylon surpassed that of Palestine at that time and it was only devotion to the old home of the Jewish faith that made the Jews continue to send their inquiries to Palestine for decisioin of such cases as the Babylonian scholars did not wish to decide on their own responsibility. It was an accepted rule among Babylonian scholars that &#x201C;one of them (Palestinian scholars) is as good as two of us, and one of ours who goes there is as good as two of theirs.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn468">15)</xref></sup> So long as Rabbi Jochanan (the compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud) was alive in Palestine, Rav Huna&#x2019;s prestige was great only in Babylonia, but when Rabbi Jochanan died, Rav Huna&#x2019;s importance was recognized even in Palestine, where he was called &#x201C;the head of all the chiefs.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn469">16)</xref></sup> Even though he was not of priestly family he used to read the first chapter in the synagogue on Sabbath and holidays, and the Palestinian &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D;, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, who were both high-born priests permitted him to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn470">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In examining Rav Huna&#x2019;s sayings one finds traces of the spirit of Rav, and a similarity of concise style which said everything in one word. Only in a few places does Rav Huna show a tendency to oppose Rav. Nevertheless he himself proclaimed the rule that &#x201C;the law in all religious matters is as Rav said, and in civil suits as Samuel said.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn471">18)</xref></sup> In other places we find Rav Huna yielding to a tendency to hair-splitting which led him to go away from the point at issue. <sup><xref rid="fn472">19)</xref></sup> It is characteristic of Rav Huna also that even when he disagreed with his friend and contemporary Rav Nachman bar Jacob in a matter of law concerning money he conceded that &#x201C;the law is probably on Rav Nachman&#x2019;s side because he is more familiar with these matters than I am.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn473">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Huna&#x2019;s statement is revealing as to the spirit of the times when he spoke concerning the problem of the books which were rescued from fire on the Sabbath. The Mishnah says that translations of Holy Scriptures which are not even read in the synagogue may be rescued on Sabbath and in any case should be hidden away and not left without care. Rav Huna, on the contrary, felt that &#x201C;Holy Scriptures in Aramaic translation or in other languages should not be rescued from fire on the Sabbath.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn474">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Certain moral teachings of Rav Huna&#x2019;s should be mentioned, as for instance, what Rav Helbo said in his name: &#x201C;Whoever sets aside a definite place for his prayer, is helped by the God of Father Abraham, for Abraham too had a definite place for his prayers.&#x201D; And further, said Rav Helbo, when such a person dies, he is mourned in the following manner: &#x201C;Alas, what a modest and pious man he was, one of the disciples of Father Abraham.&#x201D; Again Rav Helbo said in the name of Rav Huna that in leaving the synagogue one should not walk with long paces. And if a person makes a custom of praying behind the synagogue such a man should be called an evil-doer. One should be very careful to say the vesper prayers for the prophet Elijah was aided by God in his battle against the prophets of Baal during the time of vespers. One should know also that the words of the God-fearing are heard in Heaven. On another occasion Rav Helbo said in the name of Rav Huna that &#x201C;one who knows that his friend is accustomed to greet him should greet him first. If one person greets another and the latter does not respond to the greeting he is worthy of being called a bandit.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn475">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like many other scholars of the time, Rav Huna regretted that the Jews were no longer able to offer sacrifices and whenever he would come to the passage &#x201C;and Abraham called the name of the place God will see as is said today on the hill of God shall be seen&#x201D; (Genesis, 22:14) in the course of his reading in the Bible, he would shed many tears and say &#x201C;Oh how sad that a slave whose master wishes to see him should be forced to remain apart from his master&#x0021;&#x201D; It was the same way when he would reach the verse &#x201C;and thou shalt offer up peace-offerings and thou shalt eat there&#x201D; (Deuteronomy, 27:7) he would weep and say: &#x201C;O that a slave whose master wishes to eat at his table should be forced to remain apart from his master&#x0021;&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn476">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is probable that Rav Huna lived over eighty years and he was never sick until the day of his death. His significance was so very great that his successors used to pray that the Almighty might give them the wisdom of Rav Huna.<sup><xref rid="fn477">24)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rav Chisda the Priest</title>
<p>W<small>HEN</small> R<small>AV</small> H<small>UNA</small> was named &#x201C;Head of the Academy&#x201D; in Sura, Rav Chisda, who is called &#x201C;Rav Chisdai&#x201D; in the Jerusalem Talmud, was among the prominent pupils of Rav who lived there. It is said that he was a priest. <sup><xref rid="fn478">1)</xref></sup> When he was still a child, astrologers predicted that he would be a scholar. <sup><xref rid="fn479">2)</xref></sup> For a long time this Rav Chisda conducted his own academy in Kafri, and after Rav Huna and Rav Judah bar Ezekiel died he took Rav&#x2019;s place in the academy of Sura.</p>
<p>If we judge by the number of years that Rav (Aba Arecha) lived in Babylon, it seems likely that Rav Chisda was about 30 years old when Rav died. From this we may infer that he probably studied under Rav, although there is no mention of any personal encounter between Rav Chisda and Rav or Shmuel; for during Rav&#x2019;s life Rav Chisda apparently sat modestly in a corner of his school and listened to his words with pious attention. Several times, however, he repeats certain laws in the name of Rav. <sup><xref rid="fn480">3)</xref></sup> On one occasion in repeating a law of Rav&#x2019;s he termed him &#x201C;Rabbenu&#x201D; (our Rabbi). <sup><xref rid="fn481">4)</xref></sup> Since he considered himself the greatest expert in the laws of Rav, he once said that he would give away two portions of his &#x201C;perquisites of priesthood&#x201D; to anyone who could tell him of some new saying of Rav&#x2019;s. <sup><xref rid="fn482">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Only after the death of Shmuel Yarchinaa, when Rav Huna became the &#x201C;Head of the Academy&#x201D; did Rav Chisda attain recognition as a student of Rav Huna&#x2019;s. He was a man of forty at the time. In the meantime he had studied under a number of other pupils of Rav&#x2019;s, and people were beginning to pay attention to his opinions. Still it is characteristic that in all the time that Rav Chisda sat under Rav Huna as a student he was very careful never to say anything that might appear to be a statement of a law. <sup><xref rid="fn483">6)</xref></sup> And when someone once came to consult him on a question of law he immediately referred him to Rav Huna. <sup><xref rid="fn484">7)</xref></sup> Only one exception is recorded: when the &#x201C;Exilarch&#x201D; asked Rav Huna what was the basis of the law which forbade bride and groom to wear crowns on their heads at a wedding. Rav Huna answered: &#x201C;This was an enactment of the Rabbis who relate that in the time of the war against Emperor Vespasian it was forbidden to wear bridegroom&#x2019;s crowns and to celebrate engagement parties.&#x201D; After this statement Rav Huna left the school. Then Rav Chisda said: &#x201C;It is not only an enactment of the Rabbis, but there is also a Bible text for it: &#x2018;Remove the mitre and take off the crown.&#x2019; (Ezekiel, 21, 31). It is natural to ask what is the relation between the mitre and the crown? The following exegesis solves this problem: the verse means that so long as the mitre remains on the head of the High Priest, others may wear the crown, but when the mitre was removed from the head of the High Priest, the crown upon the heads of others had to fall also&#x0021;&#x201D;</p>
<p>In the meantime Rav Huna had returned and hearing Rav Chisda&#x2019;s interpretation he was not angry because Rav Chisda had allowed himself to express an opinion in opposition to his teacher, but he said: &#x201C;I swear to God that the prohibition of which we spoke is an enactment of the Rabbis. But concerning the words of Chisda we can only say that just as his name is Chisda so are his words full of <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D7;&#x05E1;&#x05D3;&#x05F4;</span> (grace). <sup><xref rid="fn485">8)</xref></sup> <xref rid="fn486">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>Rav Chisda and Rav Huna were usually called &#x201C;the elders of Sura&#x201D; by their contemporaries. <sup><xref rid="fn487">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The work of both served to raise the prestige of the academy in Sura, besides which Rav Huna attained great fame in Palestine. <sup><xref rid="fn488">10)</xref></sup> Both lived very long. Rav Chisda reached the age of 92 years, and it seems that he lived more than ten years after Rav Huna&#x2019;s death. <sup><xref rid="fn489">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like Rav Huna who was a poor man and later became rich Rav Chisda, according to his own story, became rich after an earlier period of poverty. Once when the importance of eating vegetables was being discussed, Rav Chisda said: &#x201C;I never ate any vegetables. When I was poor I did not eat them because they awaken appetite, and I had nothing with which to satisfy my appetite. When I became rich I didn&#x2019;t eat them because I preferred to eat meat and fish.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn490">12)</xref></sup> A story telling of Rav Chisda&#x2019;s riches says that it came to him in a natural manner. His own statement was that having occupied himself with the manufacture of beer he found the secret of how to become rich. <sup><xref rid="fn491">13)</xref></sup> In proof of the immensity of his wealth it is related that his deer ate nothing but the finest meal. <sup><xref rid="fn492">14)</xref></sup> His students, however, seem to have been treated differently because he used to train them in frugality and he would say: &#x201C;Anyone who can eat rye bread and eats a wheaten loaf, is guilty of a transgression against the commandment &#x2018;Thou shalt not destroy.&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn493">15)</xref></sup> In spite of his wealth which permitted him to maintain a large following of servants, he personally supervised all the work on his fields and kept an eye on every bit of expense. <sup><xref rid="fn494">16)</xref></sup> It is interesting, too, that he would entrust the whole conduct of his household to his servants, but he always kept the key to the woodshed himself. <sup><xref rid="fn495">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is related that Rav Chisda was the pupil of the Babylonian Amora Avimi for a long time. This man had no title and we know of him only through Rav Chisda&#x2019;s quotations of his enactments, as well as by Rav Chisda&#x2019;s statement that he had often been beaten by Avimi and he had borne the blows patiently. <sup><xref rid="fn496">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rav Chisda grew rich he felt a rebellion of his pride against Rav Huna, although he continued to be as modest as before in his ordinary life, and whenever he met anyone in the street, even a pagan, he met them with a friendly &#x201C;Good morning.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn497">19)</xref></sup> But since he seems to have felt injured in some way by Rav Huna he was on the lookout for a chance to pay him out for the injury. He found his opportunity when the two of them had an argument about the respect which one is obliged to pay one&#x2019;s teacher. Rav Chisda asked how the case stood with a student whose teacher needed him in order to sharpen his mind by answering his acute questions. Rav Huna understood that Rav Chisda meant himself by the reference and intended to cast a reflection upon Rav Huna. He replied; &#x201C;Chisda, Chisda, know that I need you not at all, but you do need me.&#x201D; Afterwards they parted from each other for forty long years. Rav Chisda left Sura and settled in Kafri where he established an academy of his own and taught students according to his own methods. <sup><xref rid="fn498">20)</xref></sup> Later Rav Chisda fasted forty times in repentance for having caused his teacher pain, and Rav Huna also fasted 40 times for having wrongly suspected Rav Chisda of wishing to insult him. <sup><xref rid="fn499">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Chisda was very keen in the interpretation of law and he was also very clever in reading new meanings into things by skillful analogies. We shall cite two examples of his way of thinking: In explaining the reason why a man is allowed to go two thousand ells away from his place on the Sabbath even though the Bible says, &#x201C;Let no man leave his place on the seventh day&#x201D; (Exodus, 17, 29) Rav Chisda said that in as much as the expression &#x201C;place&#x201D; was also used in the verse &#x201C;and I shall set up a place for you&#x201D; (Exodus, 21, 13) in the case of an accidental homicide the two passages were parallel and the word &#x201C;place&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E7;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;</span>) should be understood to mean a city. Later the word &#x201C;he will flee&#x201D; is used concerning an accidental homicide, so that we must understand the word &#x201C;place&#x201D; used concerning the Sabbath to refer also to flight. The problem arises how far one may flee. There is another verse &#x201C;the boundary of his city of refuge that he flees&#x201D; (Numbers, 38, 26) so that we must interpret the verse &#x201C;let no man leave his place&#x201D; as if it used the word &#x201C;boundary&#x201D;. The meaning of the word boundary must be inferred from its meaning in its use in the verse which uses the expression outside &#x201C;and their measures are two thousand ells outside the city&#x201D; (Numbers, 35, 5). We find therefore that the measure of a &#x201C;Sabbath pale&#x201D; from which a man is allowed to flee is the boundary of &#x201C;two thousand ells&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn500">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Chisda performed a similar feat of interpretation in connection with the law of &#x201C;searching out leaven&#x201D;. How do we know that leavened bread must be searched out before Passover with a candle? In dealing with the matter the Bible says &#x201C;rye shall not be found for seven days&#x201D; (Exodus, 12, 19) and since in the story of Joseph&#x2019;s cup the Bible says &#x201C;and he searched and he found&#x201D; (Genesis, 44, 12) it is clear that in order to find one must search, and there is a Biblical verse concerning searching which states &#x201C;I will search Jerusalem with candles&#x201D; (Zephaniah, 1, 12) so that we know that in order to search to find, one must use candles. And if we wish to know how many candles to use there is a verse which states &#x201C;The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord searching all the inward parts of the belly&#x201D; (Proverbs, 20, 27). From this we may infer that if one searches in order to find, one should search with one candle. <sup><xref rid="fn501">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After Rav Chisda left Rav Huna&#x2019;s academy they had frequent differences of opinion over matters of law in which each one directly contradicted the other, as for instance in the question of how pure a place must be in order that <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E7;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05D0;&#x05EA; &#x05E9;&#x05DE;&#x05E2;&#x05F4;</span> may be said there, <sup><xref rid="fn502">24)</xref></sup> or whether one may make a hole in a barrel on the Sabbath in order to put in a tap, <sup><xref rid="fn503">25)</xref></sup> or concerning the problem that all foods have to be salted and whether a dish kept overnight had to have spices. <sup><xref rid="fn504">26)</xref></sup> On another occasion they differed concerning an important problem of life: a man had given his agent a divorce for his wife and the agent had faithfully carried out his mission and delivered the divorce. Later the man regretted his action and claimd that he had simply given the divorce papers to his messenger for safe-keeping. The messenger, on the other hand, claimed that he had received the papers for delivery to the wife. Rav Huna said the man was to be believed and the divorce did not stand. Rav Chsida, on the other hand, said that the agent was to be believed and the divorce was valid. <sup><xref rid="fn505">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But even though Rav Huna was annoyed by Rav Chisda he told his son Rabah to go to Rav Chisda&#x2019;s academy. At first Rabah did not want to do so, but his father told him to go because Rav Chisda was very keen in his legal arguments and he could learn a great deal from him. <sup><xref rid="fn506">28)</xref></sup> Later Rabah bar Rav Huna became a devoted friend of Rav Chisda&#x2019;s. Since they used to study together they would often concur in their opinons, as the Talmud says, &#x201C;Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna who both say.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn507">29)</xref></sup> Later they would often sit in judgment together. <sup><xref rid="fn508">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Chisda was very much inclined to interpret various Biblical verses in order to derive new laws or to justify accepted laws. Thus, for instance, he said that anyone who prays for another person should not mention the name of the person for whom he is praying, just as Moses prayed for his sister Miriam and said no more than &#x201C;please Lord heal her please&#x201D; because the Almighty knows without being told for whom the prayer is meant. <sup><xref rid="fn509">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the Sabbath was the most important element in the Jewish religion at that time and everybody considered it a merit to aid in the preparation of the Sabbath, Rav Chisda said that a person should rise very early on Friday morning in order to be able to have everything ready for Sabbath. <sup><xref rid="fn510">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is certain that Rav Chisda spent some time in Palestine. It is not known however when this occurred. Some say that Rav Chisda went to Palestine for Rav Huna&#x2019;s burial. But this is hard to believe since Rav Chisda was a man of eighty at the time of Rav Huna&#x2019;s death and the trip from Babylon to Palestine would have been to difficult for a man of that age.</p>
<p>Rav Chisda&#x2019;s friends were Rav Nachman bar Jacob, Rav Sheshet, and, as we said above, Rabah bar Rav Huna. It is said that when Rav Chisda once met Rav Sheshet his lips trembled with fear lest Rav Sheshet ask him some difficult questions. At the same time Rav Sheshet was trembling throughout his whole body for fear lest Rav Chisda start on one of his involved disputations.</p>
<p>Rav Chisda was accustomed to stay up all night and study. It is said that once one of his daughters suggested that he get a little sleep. Rav Chisda answered that soon enough the long days of the grave would come and then he would have plenty of time for a long sleep. <sup><xref rid="fn511">33)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Chisda had six learned and prominent sons. Nevertheless he once said that daughters were preferable to sons. <sup><xref rid="fn512">34)</xref></sup> In his anxiety for the welfare of his daughters he once urged them to be restrained in their intimate relations with their husbands. <sup><xref rid="fn513">35)</xref></sup> Since he lived such a long time Rav Chisda had the good fortune to attend sixty weddings of his children and his grandchildren. <sup><xref rid="fn514">36)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Talmud relates that when the time of his death drew near the Angel of Death could not approach him because he did not interrupt his study for an instant. Therefore the Angel of Death seated himself upon a cedar in the garden of the Temple, and when the tree broke, Rav Chisda was silenced for a moment and died instantly.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Rav Judah bar Ezekiel</title>
<p>P<small>ARTICULARLY PROMINENT</small> both in his views and in personal traits was Rav Judah bar Ezekiel who is usually mentioned in the Talmud without his patronymic as Rav Judah. It appears from his sayings which have survived that he was very sharp-tongued in his dealings with people and when somebody dared to say something that did not please him, he practically murdered that person with his speech.</p>
<p>While Rav (Aba Arecha) was alive, Rav Judah bar Ezekiel was one of his outstanding students with whose opinions Rav was forced to reckon. Whenever Rav had to make a trip in the interests of the community he took Rav Judah along with him in order to have someone to talk to on the road. <sup><xref rid="fn515">1)</xref></sup> And when Rav sent away his son Chiya to study, he chose Rav Judah as his teacher. <sup><xref rid="fn516">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Judah bar Ezekiel was born in 219 C. E. on the very same day when Rabbi Judah Hanasi died in Palestine <sup><xref rid="fn517">3)</xref></sup> and died around 299 C. E. His father Rav Ezekiel was also a scholar. It is said that Samuel Yarchinai used to treat him respectfully and would rise when he met him. <sup><xref rid="fn518">4)</xref></sup> Rav Judah received his first instruction from his father. <sup><xref rid="fn519">5)</xref></sup> Later he made such progress through his own diligence that when his father was teaching his brother Rami, he permitted himself to tell his father that he was teaching him incorrectly. <sup><xref rid="fn520">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Samuel Yarchinai died the great academy of Nehardea was transferred to Sura under Rav Huna. At that time Rav Judah was about sixty years of age and he founded the academy in Pumbeditha. Even though Rav Judah was the head of that great academy, he was under the influence of Rav Huna in Sura for a long time. As we said Rav Judah was a student of Rav&#x2019;s and when Rav died he studied a short time with Rav Asi in Huzel. Later he studied with Samuel Yarchinai in Nehardea. It occurred frequently, however, that when Rav Judah would quote some statement of Samuel&#x2019;s, other scholars would deny that Samuel ever said it. Even Rav Judah&#x2019;s own brother, Rami bar Ezekiel, once said, &#x201C;Pay no attention to what my brother says in the name of Samuel.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn521">7)</xref></sup> On other occassions when Rav Judah said something in his own name, other scholars said: &#x201C;What Rav Judah is now saying in his own name is a quotation from Samuel&#x0021;&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn522">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Being extremely sharp-witted and more brainy than emotional, Rav Judah felt that study was the essential thing and prayer merely of incidental significance; and since he never wished to stop studying it is said of him that he prayed only once in thirty days. <sup><xref rid="fn523">9)</xref></sup> Nevertheless he once said on the same subject that he considered it one of his merits that he observed the commandment of contemplating the prayer. <sup><xref rid="fn524">10)</xref></sup> This saying of his was later interpreted in the sense that when he said his prayers once in thirty days, he would cleanse his soul first and only then would he pray. <sup><xref rid="fn525">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>His mind was of a logical bent and therefore he devoted himself mainly to problems of fiscal law, where he had a broad field for the exercise of his reasoning powers. It was related also that when he came across the laws of ritual purity in the course of his study, or other matters which had no legal significance in his own time, he would say: &#x201C;Such matters were of interest to Rav and Samuel.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn526">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of his keenness Samuel called him <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;&#x05F4;</span> which means sharp-witted. <sup><xref rid="fn527">13)</xref></sup> <xref rid="fn528">&#x002A;)</xref> At another time Samuel said of him that he was not born of woman because he was simply an angel. <sup><xref rid="fn529">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Being descended from very aristocratic stock which traced its descent straight to the prophets, he was very scrupulous in matters of racial purity, and this often involved him in very bitter disputes. He felt that the whole significance of the return of the Exiles in the time of Ezra the Scribe consisted in the fact that Ezra removed all the mixed families to Palestine and left all the pure families in Babylon.</p>
<p>As we have already noted the scholars of Babylon exerted themselves to free the life of the Babylonian Jews from the wardenship of Palestine. However there were always many scholars in the Babylonian academies who felt impelled to go to Palestine. This displeased Rav Judah and he said that &#x201C;anyone who lives in Babylon is as though he lived in Palestine.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn530">15)</xref></sup> And if a Babylonian still wanted to go to Palestine it was no less than a sin as the Almighty warned us through the prophet Jeremiah, &#x201C;To Babylon they shall come and there they shall be.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn531">16)</xref></sup> For many scholars however their love for Palestine was a stronger force than their teacher&#x2019;s opposition and they said nothing to him about leaving the country because they knew he would not permit them to leave. One of these students was Rav Aba, a native of Babylon, who studied with Rav Judah and left his teacher without asking his permission. <sup><xref rid="fn532">17)</xref></sup> Rabbi Zeira did the same. Even Rav Judah&#x2019;s own brother, Rami, did not regard his brother&#x2019;s opinion and left Babylon to settle in Palestine. <sup><xref rid="fn533">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we said the purity of the family was the most important element in the whole national existence of the Jewish people, according to Rav Judah. And since he was always examining into the purity of various families he found it difficult to get a suitable wife for his son Isaac, who had long been of marriageable age, until Ula, on one of his numberless trips between Babylon and Palestine, arrived in Pumbeditha and heard of Rav Judah&#x2019;s habit of inquiring into the history of various families. Said he: &#x201C;How do we know what our own origin is? Perhaps we too are descendants of those pagans which slipped into the fold during the time when the Temple was destroyed?&#x201D; Because of Rav Judah&#x2019;s agitation about the problem of purity of families, a number of betrothals were broken off in Jewish homes and there were even a number of divorces. The people grew angry at Rav Judah and a mob once got together in order to stone him. He was not the least bit frightened by the mob and he said: &#x201C;If they annoyed him, he would reveal that they all came from impure families.&#x201D; The crowd was frightened and they all threw away their stones and did not trouble Rav Judah any longer. <sup><xref rid="fn534">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Through his desire to reveal the impure families, Rav Judah once came into conflict with a certain political boss, Bati bar Tobia. This person was a freedman who had managed to win the esteem of king Sapor. In consequence the whole world toadied to him and tried to find favor in his eyes. Only Rav Judah had the courage to say that since the freedman in his pride had not asked his former owner for a certificate of liberation, he was still legally a slave and no free man could marry his children.</p>
<p>As we have already related, a certain person from Nehardea once came to Pumbeditha and went to a butcher to buy meat, just at the time when one of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel&#x2019;s servants came there. The butcher said to him: &#x201C;You will have to wait awhile until I give meat to Rav Judah bar Ezekiel&#x2019;s servant.&#x201D; The man made a grimace and asked: &#x201C;Who is this Rav Judah bar Sheveskal, that I must wait for him?&#x201D; The story was repeated to Rav Judah and he was highly annoyed. And since he was told in addition that the man boasted of an ancestry which reached back to the Hasmoneans and was accustomed to call everyone &#x201C;slave&#x201D;, Rav Judah excommunicated him according to Samuel Yarchinai&#x2019;s long-established rule that &#x201C;anyone who boasts of his descent from the Hasmoneans is certainly a slave,&#x201D; because king Herod killed off all the Hasmoneans without exception. The condemned man complained to Rav Nachman bar Jacob about Rav Judah. Rav Nachman did not hesitate a moment but sent Rav Judah a summons to appear before him and explain his actions. Rav Judah would not have heeded Rav Nachman&#x2019;s summons and would not have appeared for trial. But he went to Rav Huna first to ask his advice. Rav Huna said that by right he should not have to go, because his learning was greater than that of Rav Nachman. But seeing that the latter was the son-in-law of the Exilarch, he should do him the honor of obeying his summons.</p>
<p>When Rav Judah arrived at Rav Nachman bar Jacob&#x2019;s house he found him making a balcony for his roof, and Rav Judah said: &#x201C;How comes it that you are doing work unsuited to your social status, which ought to be done by someone else?&#x201D; And no matter what Rav Nachman had to answer him in the argument which followed, Rav Judah would correct the grammar of each sentence or prove to him that he was wrong as to the law. Yalta, Rav Nachman&#x2019;s wife, heard the argument and said to her husband: &#x201C;Send the man away or you will get a reputation as an ignoramus.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn535">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the destruction of Nehardea, the city of Pumbeditha became a center of the spiritual life of the Jews in Babylonia and when people spoke of the Jews in the Diaspora of that time, they meant Pumbeditha. <sup><xref rid="fn536">21)</xref></sup> Later the city of Pumbeditha became a holy city for the Babylonian Jews. People would say that whoever leaves Pumbeditha in order to go somewhere else is as if he left Palestine to live in the Diaspora.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn537">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Old documents tell us that Pumbeditha was a very clean city with many sanitary devices and the houses were like palaces. For a long time also there was a sort of competition between the academy in Sura, which was called <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05DE;&#x05EA;&#x05D0; &#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05D0;&#x05F4;</span> and the academy in Pumbeditha. One of the scholars enjoined his children that they should rather live &#x201C;in the dirt of Mata Mechasia than in the palaces of Pumbeditha.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn538">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whenever the academy of Pumbeditha was mentioned, interesting stories were told of the manner of study there and people would say that true wit flourished where Rav Judah had his seat. A story was told of one of Rav Judah&#x2019;s students, Rami bar Dikola, who once arrived in Pumbeditha from Sura on the eve of Yom Kippur and saw them discarding the udders of their cows: for in Sura they did not eat the flesh of the udders, fearing that a lick of milk might still have remained there, while in Pumbeditha they did eat it after having slit it in two directions. This Rami bar Dikola gathered the discarded udders and ate them. He was brought before Rav Chisda to explain his actions. Rav Chisda asked him what had brought him to eat the udders of cows, knowing as he did that this was not in accordance with the custom of Sura. &#x201C;I come from the city where Rav Judah is the head of the academy and there it is our custom to eat the udders of cows.&#x201D; &#x201C;You know the rule,&#x201D; said Rav Chisda, &#x201C;that a stranger who comes to a city in which there is a different religious custom from that of his own town should always follow the stricter practice of the two, and therefore you should not have eaten the udders.&#x201D; To this Rami answered: &#x201C;I ate the udders outside the city limits.&#x201D; &#x201C;And how did you roast them?&#x201D; asked Rav Chisda. &#x201C;With grape twigs,&#x201D; replied Rami. &#x201C;So, and what if they were the twigs of impure vines?&#x201D; said Rav Chisda. Rami replied, &#x201C;The twigs were more than twelve months old and all dry so that the law of impure vines does not apply to them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Later on they noticed that the man did not put on his phylacteries. When asked what was the reason for this, he replied: &#x201C;I have stomach trouble and Rav Judah has ruled that anyone with stomach trouble is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries.&#x201D; Later on they noticed that that man did not wear the ritual fringes on his garments. When he was asked the reason for this, he answered: &#x201C;My garment is borrowed and Rav Judah has ruled that a borrowed garment need not be worn with ritual fringes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>During this conversation Rami noticed that they were bringing in a man to be flogged for disrespect to his parents. When they had bound the man to a post, he said: &#x201C;Let him go. Wherever the Bible promises a reward for observing a certain commandment, as in the case of the commandment to respect one&#x2019;s father and mother, where the Bible promises long life for the observance of the law, the punishment for non-observance should be left to God and the courts of man should not deal with such cases.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn539">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Judah bar Ezekiel developed a whole group who were famous as the keen minds of Pumbeditha, <sup><xref rid="fn540">25)</xref></sup> and were said to be able &#x201C;to drive an elephant through the eye of a needle&#x201D; by their sharp logic. <sup><xref rid="fn541">26)</xref></sup> This sort of study was very popular with the younger students. There were others who did not care for Rav Judah&#x2019;s form of learning, however, and they left his academy. Many of them even used the excuse that they were suddenly seized by a desire to go to Palestine. In truth however we may assume that the sophistry of Pumbeditha was a very important factor in their decision to leave. It may be assumed also that Rav Judah&#x2019;s method of study was well known in Palestine also, and nobody granted it recognition. And when one of Rav Judah&#x2019;s students, Rav Aba, decided to go to Palestine he was afraid of being ridiculed for his ways of argument. When he came to Palestine and said something the scholars did in fact laugh at him. <sup><xref rid="fn542">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two years before the death of Rav Judah, Rav Huna died. Almost automatically Rav Judah became the head of all the Jews in Babylon. Since nobody was elected to take Rav Huna&#x2019;s place, all his students came to study under Rav Judah in Pumbeditha.</p>
<p>Many of Rav Judah&#x2019;s sayings prove that he was well-versed in natural history. This is not to be wondered at since he studied under Samuel Yarchinai who was always considered to be a great authority in such matters. <sup><xref rid="fn543">28)</xref></sup> He knew also the value of trees for human health and he said therefore that if one were out walking in the month of Nisan and saw the trees being covered with leaves, he must utter a special benediction. <sup><xref rid="fn544">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is an interesting story about the conduct of Rav Judah when he was a student in Samuel&#x2019;s school. Once a woman came, making an outcry about various injuries which had been done to her. Samuel paid no attention to her and to her outcries. Then Rav Judah said: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you respect the Biblical warning that anyone who stuffs his ears so as not to hear the outcries of the poor will some day have to cry out himself and no one will hear him?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn545">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is related also that one of Rav Judah&#x2019;s neighbors died without leaving any kin to mourn him; Rav Judah gathered together ten people to sit and mourn for him seven days. After the seventh day that man came to Rav Judah in a vision and thanked him for the kindness he had done him. <sup><xref rid="fn546">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In teaching Rav Judah placed most stress upon the matter of damages and said that &#x201C;Anyone who wants to pass as pious, must devote his attention to damages.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn547">32)</xref></sup> In his academy, too, most of the time was devoted to the study of the laws of damages. <sup><xref rid="fn548">33)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In spite of his greatness, Rav Judah did not make his learning a source of income, for it seems that he made his living from trading in wine. <sup><xref rid="fn549">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Judah was one of the tallest men of his time, but he only reached up to the shoulders of Rav. <sup><xref rid="fn550">35)</xref></sup> He also had large eyes <sup><xref rid="fn551">36)</xref></sup> and when he grew old his eyesight was spoiled. <sup><xref rid="fn552">37)</xref></sup> He was also a sickly person and would faint from an empty stomach. <sup><xref rid="fn553">38)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of his regulations we need only mention that he made a rule for the writing of a <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E9;&#x05D8;&#x05E8; &#x05D7;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05E6;&#x05D4;&#x05F4;</span> <span dir="ltr"><sup><xref rid="fn554">39)</xref></sup></span> and determined the form of the document for freeing a slave. <sup><xref rid="fn555">40)</xref></sup></p>

<title>Rabah bar Nachmani</title>
<p>A<small>FTER</small> R<small>AV</small> J<small>UDAH BAR</small> E<small>ZEKIEL</small> died, the inhabitants of Pumbeditha decided unanimously that the head of their academy should be Rabah bar Nachmani. But he was very poor and in addition a very modest man and did not wish to accept. Since the &#x201C;Heads of the Academy&#x201D; in Sura were mostly wealthy men, Rabah thought that Pumbeditha should have the same distinction. So 400 scholars, apparently at the suggestion of Rabah himself went to Rav Huna bar Chiya <xref rid="fn556">&#x002A;)</xref>. and crowned him head of the academy in Pumbeditha.</p>
<p>However, it became known immediately that Rav Huna bar Chiya made his fortune as a tax-collector over the Babylonian Jews for the Persian king. This occupation was considered highly dishonorable at the time and it was a widely accepted opinion that a Jewish tax-collector who served a pagan king lost his share in Heaven. The scholars therefore sent a special delegation to Rav Huna bar Chiya saying: &#x201C;Choose one of the two posts, either be head of the academy or tax-collector, for you cannot hold both these posts simultaneously.&#x201D; Rav Huna bar Chiya immediately resigned his post as tax-collector. But many scholars did not content themselves with the fact that Rav Huna bar Chiya had given up his position as tax-collector, for they felt that once a man had held that position he no longer deserved the respect of the Jews. <sup><xref rid="fn557">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>And in fact the prestige and the honor of the academy in Pumbeditha suffered at that time and when Rav Huna died they had to pick a man for his position who could restore the good name of the Pumbeditha academy by his great learning and his personal virtues. There were only two suitable candidates for this post, Rabah bar Nachmani and Rav Joseph bar Chiya.</p>
<p>Both were famous scholars, the greatest in their time. During the period when Rav Huna bar Chiya was head of the academy in Pumbeditha, Rabah bar Nachmani continued to grow in importance and he was called the &#x201C;uprooter of mountains,&#x201D; meaning that he could pull up mountains and grind them to powder by the sheer force of his argumentation. Since they believed that Rabah bar Nachmani would not accept the position, they had to have a second candidate. This was Rav Joseph bar Chiya who was called &#x201C;Sinai&#x201D;, because all the laws of the Torah were so systematically arranged in his head that it seemed as though he had really heard them directly from the mouth of God on Mount Sinai. The Babylonian scholars did not know what to do. They sent to Palestine for advice. The Palestinians replied that since &#x201C;Sinai&#x201D; is more important than an &#x201C;uprooter of hills&#x201D;, they should choose the &#x201C;Sinai&#x201D;. But Rav Joseph bar Chiya did not wish to accept the position because an astrologer once told him that if he became the head of an academy he would not live to officiate any longer than two years. <sup><xref rid="fn558">2)</xref></sup> Immediately on receiving this news the scholars forced Rabah bar Nachmani to accept the position. He had immediate success in raising the prestige of the academy in Pumbeditha, where twelve thousand people and sometimes more would gather in the school-months of Adar and Elul.</p>
<p>The dates of Rabah bar Nachmani&#x2019;s birth and death are obscure. The accepted opinion is that he lived no more than forty years. <sup><xref rid="fn559">3)</xref></sup> In another place it is said that Rabah&#x2019;s brothers told him to study with Rabbi Jochanan in Palestine <sup><xref rid="fn560">4)</xref></sup> and later it is said that he was head of the academy in Pumbeditha for twenty-two years <sup><xref rid="fn561">5)</xref></sup> and according to the &#x201C;Chronicle of Rav Shrira Gaon&#x201D; he died in the year 330 C. E. so that we must conclude that he lived much more than 40 years. Otherwise our Rabah would have had to be less than ten years old when he was a student of Rabbi Jochanan.</p>
<p>According to the Talmud, Rabah bar Nachmani came from a town called Mimla (Mimalis) in Babylonia, the majority of whose inhabitants were priests and, as they then believed, all of them were descendents of the family of the High Priest Eli, upon whom there rested a curse that all the males of his family would die early. Thus every traveller who visited Mimla would wonder at the absence of elderly people. <sup><xref rid="fn562">6)</xref></sup> It is related also that Rabah bar Nachmani had three brothers whose names were Chailil, Rav Chanina and Rav Oshaya, all three of whom were extremely poor. Rav Chanina and Rav Oshaya went to Palestine where they made a living making shoes. And since they avoided sin very carefully they were known as &#x201C;the holy Rabbis of the land of Israel.&#x201D; Their virtue expressed itself in the fact that although they sat in the market of the prostitutes and sewed their shoes and the prostitutes cast lecherous eyes upon them, they did not pay heed to these glances. <sup><xref rid="fn563">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From early youth Rabah bar Nachmani excelled in acumen. Like many other Babylonian scholars he went to Palestine as a young man to study, and when he returned to Babylon to study with Rav Nachman bar Jacob and with Rav Huna and Rav Chisda, his brothers would continually pound it into his head to go back to Palestine and study there. He obeyed them and returned to Palestine for a short time. However his keen mind found no satisfaction in the simplicity characteristic of learning in Palestine and he returned again to Babylon.</p>
<p>As we have noted Rabah was very poor and in addition he was an ailing person. People used to remark the injustice of fate, saying that Rabah was as great a saint as Rav Chisda had been, and yet Rav Chisda lived to the age of ninety-two and Rabah lived only to the age of forty. Rav Chisda lived to see sixty marriages among his children and grandchildren and Rabah&#x2019;s household suffered from sixty kinds of ailment. Rav Chisda&#x2019;s deer disdained to eat the finest wheat and the people of Rabah&#x2019;s house sought a bit of oaten meal and could not find it. <sup><xref rid="fn564">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As head of the academy it was Rabah&#x2019;s effort to try to popularize what he had heard from his teachers. In addition he specialized in the laws of ritual purity and tried to make them intelligible to his students; though he found few auditors for this subject, because people were interested in studying the laws which were still in force and not the laws of the Messianic era. As our Rabah complained: &#x201C;I am alone in studying the laws of blight and the laws of the impurity of a tent.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn565">9)</xref></sup> In his lectures Rabah bar Nachmani would give all the relevant aspects of a matter with great understanding, and would often weave a bit of legend into his legal disquisitions, to mend the ardure of the law with a portion of poetry. When he was teaching his students he had a custom of starting with a <italic>&#x201C;bon mot&#x201D;</italic> to capture the attention of the students.</p>
<p>For all these reasons the scholars held Rabah bar Nachmani in high honor, both because of his clear grasp of the Torah and his own virtues. Still, since he was a man of truth and very strict in the observance of the laws, and respected no sinner but punished them severely for their transgressions, the mob in Pumbeditha hated him. <sup><xref rid="fn566">10)</xref></sup> Once when there was no rain, Rabah ordered a fast and prescribed the prayers to be said. None of this was of any avail. People said to him: &#x201C;It seems that God held Rav Judah bar Ezekiel more dear because no prayer of his went unanswered.&#x201D; To this Rabah bar Nachmani answered: &#x201C;It is not by our fault that God is keeping back the rain, because in our knowledge of the Torah we are greater than Rav Judah&#x2019;s generation. But what can we do if the people today are not as good as the people of that generation?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn567">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the greater part of his life Rabah was very poor. As a result he had to depend on the aid of the Exilarch. The heads of the academy in Sura were rich, and usually maintained their students at their own expense. The heads of the academy in Pumbeditha, on the other hand, were poor folk and boxes had to be set up into which anyone who was able to do so threw his contribution to support the head of the academy of Pumbeditha and his students. <sup><xref rid="fn568">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At that time there also began a series of religious persecutions against the Jews of Babylon, and even though they were mere child&#x2019;s play compared to the persecutions which broke out in Palestine at the same time, nevertheless they did upset the political security which the Jews had enjoyed up to that time. The historical accounts of these events are very meager, yet they were serious enough so that Rabah bar Nachmani lost his life through their effects. They came during the reign of king Sapor the Second. He ruled longer than any other Persian king before him or after him, sitting on the throne more than a full human life. (309-380 C. E.) He was crowned king before he was born for the priests placed the crown on the pregnant body of his mother, Ifra Hurmiz in sign that the unborn child was the king of Persia.</p>
<p>Between King Sapor I, who was a friend of Samuel Yarchinai, and King Sapor II there was an interval of about seventy years (240-309 C. E.) In this interval six different kings ruled the Persians, and all maintained the tradition of friendship towards the Jews which had been established by king Sapor I. King Sapor II broke this tradition. Then all over the Persian kingdom persecution of the Jews broke out and because of the Jews the Christians too were persecuted.</p>
<p>Yet the condition of the Jews at that time was better than that of the Christians because Queen Ifra Hurmiz protected the Jews to the extent of her ability. It is said that Queen Ifra Hurmiz had a strong leaning toward the Jewish religion and respected the Jewish scholars. When she saw how severely her son was oppressing the Jews, crushing the marrow out of their bones for taxes, she took a pot of gold to the academy at Pumbeditha and gave it to the scholars to be used as they saw fit. It was decided to use this money to help those Jews who could not pay their taxes and were in danger of being sent to jail by the king. <sup><xref rid="fn569">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concerning those persecutions the Talmud relates that when the royal army came to Pumbeditha, Rabah bar Nachmani and Rav Joseph bar Chiya ran away. <sup><xref rid="fn570">14)</xref></sup> Then the king was told that there was a certain Jew around whom twelve thousand others would gather two months during the year, once during the winter and once during the summer, thus interfering with the work of the people and causing the king&#x2019;s treasury damage. The king sent out messengers to catch Rabah. Rabah heard of this and fled and hid among the swamps around Pumbeditha. He lost his way there and came to a forest and sat down under a tree. Suddenly he heard the footsteps of a man, and thinking that he was caught, he died of fright.</p>
<p>This flight and hiding of Rabah bar Nachmani has been adorned with many miracles. It is related that once in the course of his flight he met the king&#x2019;s messenger at an inn and was miraculously delivered from his hands. Then it is related how Rabah died in a miraculous manner. In the &#x201C;academy of Heaven&#x201D; a difference of opinion developed concerning a certain problem in the laws of ritual purity, and God Himself decided &#x201C;pure&#x201D;, and the rest of the academy decided &#x201C;impure&#x201D;. It was decided to call on Rabah bar Nachmani for his opinion because this was his special field. But this was impossible so long as he was alive and they sent out the Angel of Death to fetch Rabah. But the Angel of Death could not approach him because he did not cease studying a moment. Then the Angel of Death determined upon the above-mentioned trick, making Rabah think that he was caught, and he interrupted his study for a moment. The Angel of Death used this moment to seize his soul and bring it to the &#x201C;academy of Heaven&#x201D;. The scholars in Pumbeditha did not know what had happened to Rabah. A note fell from Heaven saying, &#x201C;Rabah bar Nachmani has been summoned to the &#x2018;academy of Heaven&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then Abayei and Rava along with other scholars went to seek Rabah&#x2019;s corpse in order to bury it. They did not know the place where his body lay. They went to the swamps where Rabah had been hiding. They saw a flock of birds and the scholars said: &#x201C;Apparently our dead is lying there.&#x201D; They mourned for Rabah three days and three nights. Then another note fell from Heaven, upon which was written: &#x201C;Whoever abandons the dead man now is excommunicated.&#x201D; The scholars mourned for Rabah seven days longer. Then another note fell from Heaven, saying, &#x201C;Go home in peace.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn571">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wherever the Talmud mentions Rabah without a patronymic, it means Rabah bar Nachmani. Concerning the years of his life we must add that apparently he studied with Rabbi Jochanan in his early years, for it is related that Rav Chisda once said to him what he used to say to others of Rabbi Jochanan&#x2019;s students: &#x201C;Who pays any attention to you and your teacher, Rabbi Jochanan?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn572">16)</xref></sup> We must remember that Rabah&#x2019;s brothers insisted on his going to Palestine to study and they wrote him: &#x201C;Although you are a very learned person, there is no comparison between studying by oneself and studying with a teacher; and if you should say that there is no teacher in Palestine we tell you there is.

<title>Rav Joseph bar Chiya</title>
<p>A<small>FTER</small> R<small>ABAH BAR</small> N<small>ACHMANI&#x2019;S</small> death Rav Joseph bar Chiya had to accept the position of head of the academy in Pumbeditha. For a long time they had been considered the two greatest scholars, and, as we have said, Rabah was called the &#x201C;uprooter of mountains&#x201D; meaning that he could tear up hills and grind them into dust by the power of his reasoning and Rav Joseph bar Chiya was called &#x201C;Sinai&#x201D; because all the laws of the Torah were as systematically arranged in his head as if he had heard them directly from the mouth of God on Mount Sinai. When the scholars wanted to appoint him head of the academy in Pumbeditha before they chose Rabah bar Nachmani, he went to consult an astrologer.</p>
<p>This Rav Joseph bar Chiya, who is always called simply Rav Joseph without a patronymic, was born about 270 C. E. and died 333 C. E. He was a sick man, always ailing, and very irritable. He would say, &#x201C;There are three kinds of people whose life is not worth living; merciful people, angry people and sensitive people, and I have inherited all these qualities.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn577">1)</xref></sup> It is related that later he grew even sicker and even became blind. He was not pained by the fact that he had to live in the darkness, but because he was exempt from all those commandments which require vision. <sup><xref rid="fn578">2)</xref></sup> Then Rav Joseph again suffered from a very severe illness, through which he lost his memory and all his learning. It then happened several times that some of Rav Joseph&#x2019;s own laws came up in study and he said that he had never heard of them, and had to be reminded that they were his own. <sup><xref rid="fn579">3)</xref></sup> Then he would say that just as the whole and the broken tablets of the Mosaic law lay side by side in the Holy Ark, so we must infer that when a scholar has forgotten his learning he must not be humiliated. <sup><xref rid="fn580">4)</xref></sup> Concerning his blindness it is not known whether this occurred before his last sickness and whether he remained blind until the end.</p>
<p>Unlike Rabah bar Nachmani, Rav Joseph bar Chiya was a wealthy man, who owned gold and silver, fields and vineyards of such excellent quality that his wine could be diluted with twice as much water as could be mixed with ordinary wine. <sup><xref rid="fn581">5)</xref></sup> It sounds somewhat strange therefore when he says that &#x201C;poverty suits a Jew like a red accoutrement suits a white horse.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn582">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On his sixtieth birthday, when he invited other scholars to a feast he said, in a similar whimsical vein: &#x201C;No matter how I misbehave I can no longer die young.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn583">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Joseph was different from his colleague Rabah in all his ways, in his private conduct as well as in his manner of studying. Though he was modest, he said &#x201C;a teacher who has no regard for his dignity, has no dignity.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn584">8)</xref></sup> The difference between the scholarship of Rabah and that of Rav Joseph was many-sided. Rabah would usually depend upon his own reason and never hesitated if his opinion was that in the minority, and when he brought proof of his contentions they ordinarily were of a very complex sort and at first sight subject to objections of various sorts. <sup><xref rid="fn585">9)</xref></sup> Rav Joseph&#x2019;s sayings were based, on the other hand, upon simple declarations and did not require complex reasoning, because he always kept the Mishnah and the Boraitha in mind, and avoided refinements and interpretations. <sup><xref rid="fn586">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since it was known that Rav Joseph was acquainted with metaphysics and cosmology, he was often asked to teach these subjects to his students. He would never agree to do so, however, and when they pressed him hard he evaded them with a quotation, interpreting the verse &#x201C;honey and milk under your tongue&#x201D; to mean that when some subject is as good as honey and milk it should be kept under the tongue and not expressed. <sup><xref rid="fn587">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Joseph bar Chiya also paid much attention to the Aramaic translation of the Bible and especially to the &#x201C;Haftaroth&#x201D;. Since the masses understood very little Hebrew, the biblical portions that had to be read on Sabbath and holidays were to be read in the Babylonian tongue. Rav Joseph tried to prepare a correct translation of these synagogual readings in the Chaldean language, following the Greek translation of Aquilas (or Onkelos the convert) and this became the basis of our &#x201C;Targum Onkelos.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He was very fond of using folk-proverbs in his scholarly statements, as for instance: &#x201C;A master who makes a spoon may still burn his tongue with it when it is full of broth,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn588">12)</xref></sup> or &#x201C;even if you utter curses upon a dog&#x2019;s tail, he will continue to do the same thing.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn589">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since Rav Joseph was very rich he fed his students at his own table, stating their number as about four hundred. <sup><xref rid="fn590">14)</xref></sup> It is said that he was very modest and was aware of it himself and when people said that since the death of Rabbi Judah Hanasi modesty had died out among the Jews, he said: &#x201C;Do not say that, for I am here.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn591">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Along with Rabah bar Abahu, Rav Joseph held that just as Jews should not leave Palestine to come to Babylon, so Babylonians should not leave their homes to go to another country, even not so far as from Pumbeditha to Be-Kobi, which was the nearest city. When someone left Pumbeditha for Be-Kobi, Rav Joseph excommunicated him. Another person left Pumbeditha for Asthonia, which is located in southern Mesopotamia, and he died at once. <sup><xref rid="fn592">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When he was nearing his end, Rav Joseph wanted assurance that the Torah would remain in his family and he fasted forty days until he saw in a dream the verse &#x201C;my words which I have placed in thy mouth will not pass from out of thy mouth&#x201D; (Isaiah 59, 21). Not being satisfied with this he fasted forty more days until he was shown the verse &#x201C;they shall not pass from thy mouth and from the mouth of thy seed.&#x201D; When he fasted another hundred days he was shown the verse &#x201C;they shall not pass from thy mouth and from the mouth of thy seed and from the mouth of the seed of thy seed.&#x201D; With this he was satisfied, for knowing that his grandchildren would be scholars also, he believed that the Torah would remain in his family. <sup><xref rid="fn593">17)</xref></sup></p>

<title>Rabah bar Rav Huna</title>
<p>Rav Huna, the head of the academy in Sura, left a son named Rabah, who studied a great deal with his father and also inherited all his good qualities. When this Rabah bar Rav Huna died, the academy at Sura was orphaned, for it lacked a great central personality. Then the greater part of its students left it, and went to Pumbeditha to study. It seems that Rabah bar Rav Huna was fortunate enough to have studied under Rav and Samuel. He quoted many Talmudical sayings in their name. Later he went to Palestine and studied a short time under Rabbi Jochanan. <sup><xref rid="fn594">1)</xref></sup> Later he headed his own academy, even while Rav Chisda, who succeeded Rav Huna to the position of the head of the academy in Sura, was still alive.</p>
<p>It is certain that Rav Huna urged his son to be friendly with Rav Chisda because once when Rabah omitted his visits to Rav Chisda, Rav Huna punished him and Rabah had to defend himself. <sup><xref rid="fn595">2)</xref></sup> In addition Rabah was a judge in Rav Chisda&#x2019;s court <sup><xref rid="fn596">3)</xref></sup> and Rav Chisda regarded him so highly that in spite of the difference in age Rav Chisda would often honor him by attending his lectures. <sup><xref rid="fn597">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet the achievements of Rabah bar Rav Huna in the development of the Talmud are practically unknown. It is known only that he was modest and would treat inferiors respectfully when dealing with them. In addition he was also quite rich, with fields and forests of his own from which he made his living. <sup><xref rid="fn598">5)</xref></sup> Even in later times Rabah&#x2019;s modesty was still a matter of comment and many of the later &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; expressed the wish that they might attain to Rabah bar Rav Huna&#x2019;s modesty. <sup><xref rid="fn599">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabah bar Rav Huna&#x2019;s relations with the Exilarch are highly interesting. It is not clear how close these were. In spite of the fact that he would make the &#x201C;holiday visits&#x201D; to the Exilarch with Rav Chisda <sup><xref rid="fn600">7)</xref></sup> and when the Amora Ula once came to the Exilarch on the Sabbath he found Rabah there, <sup><xref rid="fn601">8)</xref></sup> this is not to be taken as an unequivocal sign of loyalty and devotion, because it may be that these occurrences were limited to the time of Rav Chisda&#x2019;s life. Later when Rabah bar Rav Huna became an independent leader of an academy in Sura, he once had a quarrel with the men of the Exilarch and he said: &#x201C;I did not get my right to teach from you, but from Rav (Aba Arecha) and Rav got it from Rav Chiya and Rav Chiya got it from Rabbi Jehuda Hanasi.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn602">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabah bar Rav Huna died at the same time as Rav Hamnuna and they were both brought for burial to Palestine. The two coffins were carried abreast all the way until they came to a narrow bridge where they had to go in single file one behind the other. The camels which bore the coffins stopped still before the bridge. A travelling merchant approached and asked why they had suddenly stopped. They told him that they were bringing two scholars to burial and each one desired his colleague to precede him. After the travelling merchant was told who the two scholars were, he said that Rabah bar Rav Huna should go first. They sent Rabah&#x2019;s camel ahead. But this, it seems, did not please the dead scholar, because his camel kicked up his heels and knocked out the merchant&#x2019;s teeth. <sup><xref rid="fn603">10)</xref></sup></p>

<title>Abayei bar Chyailil</title>
<p>W<small>HEN</small> R<small>ABAH BAR</small> R<small>AV</small> H<small>UNA</small> was at the head of the academy in Sura the Pumbedithans could not unite on a candidate for the position of head of the academy to take the place of Rav Joseph bar Chiya. There were four men who were considered for the position: Abayei bar Chyailil, Rava (Rav Aba bar Chama, the priest) Rav Zeira the second and Raba bar Matana. These four agreed to resolve some difficulty about a law and the one whose answer would be the best, clearest and unanswerable, would be crowned as the head of the academy of Pumbeditha. Abayei won this contest, because his remarks were not subject to criticism. Thus he was chosen as the head of the academy. <sup><xref rid="fn604">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abayei was born in the year 280 C. E. and died about 338 C. E. He is often called Nachmani after his grandfather Nachmani, the father of Rabah, at whose home he was brought up. His father died before he was born and his mother died in giving birth, and his uncle Rabah took the orphaned child to bring him up. He acquired his great legal learning from this uncle of his. He also inherited his depth and keenness from him. Besides this he was characterized by nobility of character and a pure-mindedness which was best expressed in the following saying: &#x201C;A man should always be open-hearted in his dealings with God, friendly and careful, never to anger anyone. Particularly must he be at peace with his relations as well as with every other person, even a pagan in the street, so that he may be loved by all who are superior to him and welcome to all who are inferior.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn605">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>With a childlike respect Abayei mentions his nurse who took the place of his mother and gave him various bits of counsel in life, and concerning human nature and the nature of the world. He quotes a score of her remarks with the greatest esteem as though they had been the sayings of some prominent Rabbi. He would usually preface these sayings with the words &#x201C;my foster-mother said to me,&#x201D; and all these quotations show that this nurse of Abayei must have been an extraordinary woman with a great deal of experience and broad understanding. <sup><xref rid="fn606">3)</xref></sup> It is probable also that this woman deserved the honor which Abayei paid her, for she cared for him like the apple of her eye, and saw that he lacked nothing, and was not disturbed in his studies. He said in one place that if his foster-mother had asked him to do the smallest thing, he would be disturbed in his studies. <sup><xref rid="fn607">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abayei owned gardens and vineyards which he ordinarily rented out to tenants for cultivation. Yet it is uncertain whether he was wealthy, because he led a modest life, as we see by the fact that when Abayei&#x2019;s widow asked the court to grant her food and wine, they answered that as far as they knew there was never any wine on Abayei&#x2019;s table. <sup><xref rid="fn608">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We may see how widespread was Abayei&#x2019;s fame from the fact that even the Samaritans, who normally lived on bad terms with the Jews, were admirers of Abayei. Once they found a lost ass of his and they returned it on his saying that it was his, without asking for any signs of identification. <sup><xref rid="fn609">6)</xref></sup> It is therefore a puzzle why the number of students in Pumbeditha decreased to two hundred from the previous mass of thousands during the time that Abayei was head of the academy in Pumbeditha. We may assume that this decline in the number of students in Pumbeditha was not because the desire for learning grew suddenly weaker among the Jews of Babylon, but because all the students at that time tried to go to Mechoza, drawn by the personality of the head of the academy there, Rava, who, although he had the same system of study as Abayei, was nevertheless always found to be in conflicts with him, in which the students tended more to Rava&#x2019;s side.</p>
<p>Almost all the scholars at that time had ceased to feel the need to make new interpretations of the commandments of the Torah. As everybody thought then, the laws of the Jewish religion had already been interpreted in every possible way. It was at this time that Abayei and Rava began to turn up new problems which had not yet been covered by others. These were problems which developed out of the daily life of the people and had not previously been noticed. Their attempts to solve these problems as best they could are known in the Talmud as <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05D5;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05EA; &#x05D3;&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05D9; &#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D1;&#x05D0;&#x05F4;</span> (discussions of hypothetical cases which may sometimes arise.)</p>
<p>In order to explain the nature of these <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05D5;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;&#x05F4;</span> more clearly we will mention two of them. One question was as follows: When witnesses appeared and testified to a certain matter, and later others came and proved that those witnesses had lied, their credibility as witnesses was lost forever and they were no longer trusted. Now the problem is how far back did this losing of their credibility reach? Did it begin with their false testimony or only after the proof of the lie was established? For if these witnesses had signed documents or given true testimony in other matters during the interval between their false testimony and its proof of a lie, the question arises whether their signatures or their later testimony should be credited or not.</p>
<p>The second question was whether a money-lender, getting collateral from the borrower has the rights of the owner to the property from the very first day of the loan and could dispose of it according to his own wishes or has he only the right to do so if it is clear that the borrower cannot or will not pay his debt?</p>
<p>There are a number of different opinions about the length of time that Abayei was the head of the academy in Pumbeditha. Some say that is was only five years and others say that it was twelve or thirteen. Towards the end of Abayei&#x2019;s life bad news began to be heard from Palestine. The Jews were being terribly oppressed by Emperor Constantius. Many refugees from Palestine arrived in Pumbeditha, bringing with them the learning of Rabbi Jochanan, and they aided in the further development of the law in Babylon.</p>
<p>These people told Abayei, citing Rabbi Jochanan as their authority, that a woman whose two first husbands had died was allowed to wed a third time, for Rabbi Jochanan held that it could not be declared that such a woman was one whose husbands died because of her sins. Abayei accepted Rabbi Jochanan&#x2019;s opinion and immediately married the beautiful woman Huma, a grandchild of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel, who had already been twice a widow. And after she married Abayei, he soon died at the age of fifty-eight.</p>
<p>His name was Abayei bar Chyailil the priest, and as the &#x201C;Chronicle of Rav Sherira Gaon&#x201D; relates, this Chyailil was the brother of Rabah bar Nachmani. Neither the meaning of the name &#x201C;Chyailil&#x201D; nor that of &#x201C;Abayei&#x201D; is known. Some say about this that the name Abayei is an anagram of the verse <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D0;&#x05E9;&#x05E8; &#x05D1;&#x05DA; &#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05DD; &#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;&#x05F4;</span>. Others say that the name &#x201C;Abayei&#x201D; is a Syrian name, meaning solace, which is almost equivalent to Nachmani as others called him. <sup><xref rid="fn610">7)</xref></sup> At the time when Abayei was born his uncle Rabah bar Nachmani was still a young man, not more than 17 years old. He was a student under Rav Judah bar Ezekiel in Pumbeditha. When Abayei had grown up somewhat his uncle immediately sent him to study in the academy of his own teacher. And even though the work there was beyond Abayei&#x2019;s comprehension at the time, his uncle wished him to hear it anyway. When Abayei was mature enough to grasp what he was being taught, his teachers were Rabah bar Nachmani and Rav Joseph bar Chiya, who had become the leaders of the academy in Pumbeditha. Abayei acted towards his uncle like a pupil towards his teacher, with deep respect mixed with a certain childlike love. Rabah bar Nachmani also was always trying to fill up his young nephew with every variety of wisdom, and to sharpen his mind in every possible way. <sup><xref rid="fn611">8)</xref></sup> For Rav Joseph bar Chiya, Abayei felt nothing but respect. It is related that when Abayei saw the ears of Rav Joseph&#x2019;s ass, as a sign that his teacher was approaching, he would stand up in respect. <sup><xref rid="fn612">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even when Abayei was still young he was famous for the depth of his learning. He had his own academy even when his teacher Rav Joseph bar Chiya was still alive. <sup><xref rid="fn613">10)</xref></sup> As we have said Rav Joseph once forgot his learning in his illness. Abayei would often remind him of his own laws. But even before this, Rav Joseph would discuss various problems with Abayei, treating him like a colleague and not like a student.</p>
<p>Abayei grew up from childhood with his colleague Rava. <sup><xref rid="fn614">11)</xref></sup> Later things developed in such a way that while Abayei was studying with Rabah bar Nachmani, Rava studied with Rav Nachman bar Jacob in Mechoza and Nehardea. This was the reason for the continuous differences of opinion between them which were always prosecuted in a friendly spirit. The phrase which the Talmud uses &#x201C;Abayei and Rava who both say&#x201D; refers to the time when they were studying together. In addition we find many times, &#x201C;Abayei questioned Rava&#x201D; or &#x201C;Abayei explained to Rava.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Abayei was very scrupulous about the cleanliness of people who go out into the street. Since people were very careful to wash their hands and mouth before eating, Abayei said, &#x201C;It is even more important to wash the hands and mouth after eating.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn615">12)</xref></sup> Concerning the problem of leavened bread on Passover or after Passover, which must not be used, Abayei said that if a person uses it against his will he has not committed a sin. <sup><xref rid="fn616">13)</xref></sup> Concerning a divorce he said that talk of giving a woman a divorce does not impose the obligation to do so. <sup><xref rid="fn617">14)</xref></sup> If a man says to a woman that he weds her with a gift of a previous loan, the marriage is not valid, but, if he says that he weds her with the gift of the interest on that loan, then the marriage is legal. <sup><xref rid="fn618">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>If a witness came to court and testified that he saw a certain thing and later another witness proved that the first had lied, making his testimony inadmissible forever, Abayei said that this inadmissibility begins with the moment of the false testimony. <sup><xref rid="fn619">16)</xref></sup> Concerning the mortgaged property of a debtor, Abayei said that the property belongs to the moneylender from the moment of the loan and he can dispose of it as if it were his own. <sup><xref rid="fn620">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another important problem was when someone lost something and gave it up for lost. This gave the finder the right to keep it. But if the loser was unaware of his loss this was called &#x201C;unconscious renunciation&#x201D; and Abayei held that this was not true renunciation, and any finder had no right to keep his find. <sup><xref rid="fn621">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abayei often used folk proverbs in his lectures, as for instance when he said: &#x201C;Let no man open his mouth to evil, lest he give the Satan a chance to do harm.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn622">19)</xref></sup> On another occasion he said: &#x201C;A servant who angers her mistress very often gets paid for it all at once&#x201D;, <sup><xref rid="fn623">20)</xref></sup> or &#x201C;When a peasant becomes a king, one can always detect the place of his origin&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn624">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Abayei studied with his uncle Rabah bar Nachmani, he did not cease day or night, and when he was asked why he did not make an &#x201C;Eruv&#x201D;<xref rid="fn625">&#x002A;)</xref> at the entrance of his house he said: &#x201C;How can I keep such things in mind, when I am always busy studying?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn626">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abayei was afflicted with illness a long time. He suffered from so-called &#x201C;watery stomach&#x201D; which did not permit regular digestion of food so that he was simply starved. <sup><xref rid="fn627">23)</xref></sup> He was unable to perform the priest&#x2019;s duties in the synagogue because of his ailment. <sup><xref rid="fn628">24)</xref></sup> He suffered a great deal also from bad teeth. <sup><xref rid="fn629">25)</xref></sup> His mouth was full of dangerous sores around his teeth, for which he used various remedies which did him no good, until a travelling merchant came to Pumbeditha, and gave him the right remedy. <sup><xref rid="fn630">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>To be able to put on phylacteries, which required a clean body, was apparently considered a cause for rejoicing by our scholars at the time. It is related that Abayei was once sitting with his uncle Rabah bar Nachmani and saw that he was very pleased about something. Abayei asked how it was that his uncle alowed himself to be over-happy when the Bible warned to &#x201C;rejoice with trembling.&#x201D; His uncle answered: &#x201C;I have just worn my phylacteries.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn631">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we said above Abayei owned gardens and vineyards which he rented out to tenants, but he worked in the fields himself nevertheless. It seems that he had an agreement with his tenants concerning this, for it is related that he sat and studied all day and at night he irrigated his fields. And when a student came to him once and asked him to study with him, Abayei replied that he could not do it because all his time was taken up, what with his own study during the day and irrigating his fields during the night. <sup><xref rid="fn632">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the death of Rav Joseph bar Chiya they had to choose a head of the academy in Pumbeditha, and when Abayei emerged as the victor over three other candidates his name grew even more famous than before. This attracted large numbers of students to him and he said: &#x201C;The reward for hearing the Rabbi&#x2019;s lecture is the crush trying to get in to hear.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn633">29)</xref></sup> He had great love for his students and he said: &#x201C;May it be remembered that whenever I saw that a student had finished a tractate of the Talmud, I made a celebration for the scholars.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn634">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is related that every Friday evening Abayei would receive a greeting from Heaven. He then heard that the pious Aba Umna got such a greeting every day. This irked him, not because the other had such great merit, but because he had not such merit; so he sent a few students to investigate the merit of that Aba Umna. They discovered that Aba Umna was really great in his good deeds and deserved the distinction. <sup><xref rid="fn635">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abayei was tolerant and would think the best of everybody, since he understood that it was impossible for a man to sit and study all the time. <sup><xref rid="fn636">32)</xref></sup> Similarly he would say that the whole world could not be like Father Jacob. <sup><xref rid="fn637">33)</xref></sup> And if a scholar did not know something that was no proof that he was not a great man. <sup><xref rid="fn638">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Abayei once had to scold the people for a carelessness in regard to Sabbath observance, he said, that this was the very cause of the destruction of Jerusalem. <sup><xref rid="fn639">35)</xref></sup> When Abayei saw that there were Jews who helped the government in its merciless squeezing of money out of the Jews, he told a story of a Jewish royal officer who was bitten by a snake and could not be aided by any remedies. All this was a result of the fact that he had no regard for the honor of the scholars, whose bite is as the bite of the snake.</p>
<p>Because of Abayei&#x2019;s descent from Eli the High Priest, he should have lived forty years like his uncle Rabah bar Nachmani. But he spent much time in study and charitable works and therefore an exception was made for him out of his whole family and he lived sixty years. <sup><xref rid="fn640">36)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rava bar Joseph bar Chama</title>
<p>T<small>HE NEAREST FRIEND</small> of Abayei bar Chyailil was Rava, the son of Rav Joseph bar Chama, who is always called simply &#x201C;Rava.&#x201D; Even though the two were always sharply divided in opinion and lived far apart also, they are nevertheless always mentioned together. They were brought together from the days of their youth, though the details of this are not known. In spite of their conflicts of opinion there are rare instances in which they said the same thing.</p>
<p>It is interesting that when their differences are mentioned, Abayei is usually mentioned first and then Rava. We cannot deduce from this, however, that Abayei was the greater of the two. It is simply because Abayei became famous first by winning a contest for the position of the head of the academy of Pumbeditha. In addition it should be mentioned that even though Rava headed his own academy in Mechoza, he would often go to Pumbeditha to hear Abayei&#x2019;s opinion in matters which he found somewhat difficult to decide by himself.</p>
<p>Rava learned most of what he knew from Rav Nachman bar Jacob, who laid the foundation of all his learning. Every one of Rav Nachman&#x2019;s words was carved deep in his memory and anyone who found some difficulty in Rav Nachman&#x2019;s words would come to Rava for an explanation. Before he studied with Rav Nachman bar Jacob, Rava was a student of Rabah bar Avuha. Later he studied a great deal under Rav Huna and Rav Chisda, whose daughter he married after she was widowed of her husband, Rami bar Chama.</p>
<p>Concerning this marriage it is related that when Rav Chisda&#x2019;s daughter was a child and sat upon her father&#x2019;s knee while he was teaching, the two students who sat in the first row were Rami bar Chama and Rava, trying to hear exactly what their teacher said. Rav Chisda asked the child which of the two students she wished to have for her husband, and the child answered, &#x201C;I want both.&#x201D; To this Rava answered: &#x201C;First Rami will be her husband and then I.&#x201D; And so it happened in fact. First Rav Chisda&#x2019;s daughter married Rami bar Chama and after she was widowed she married Rava. <sup><xref rid="fn641">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>For a while after Rav Nachman&#x2019;s death, Rava studied under Rav Joseph bar Chiya and also under Rav Sheshet.</p>
<p>It is said that Rava was blessed with riches. He had fields and vineyards which he hired out to tenants. He also engaged in trade and owned ships. <sup><xref rid="fn642">2)</xref></sup> Because of his riches he was able to keep the whole population of Mechoza under his control. And being blessed with wisdom also he was accorded the greatest respect by everybody. Therefore he would say concerning himself that &#x201C;I requested the Almighty to give me the wisdom of Rav Huna and the riches of Rav Chisda and He gave them to me. There is only one good thing which I have not been granted. I prayed the Lord to grant me the modesty of Rabah bar Rav Huna and I did not receive it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn643">3)</xref></sup> But it may be said with certainty that what Rava says about his modesty is not true. Some of his sayings prove that he could compare with the greatest of the prominent modest men. Only through modesty could a person in Rava&#x2019;s place have the insight that &#x201C;When a man does not insist upon the dignity of his rank, God pardons his sins.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn644">4)</xref></sup> And in speaking of learning Rava said that &#x201C;the Torah was not given to angels.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn645">5)</xref></sup> Once too he mentioned the verse &#x201C;it is not in Heaven&#x201D; referring to the Torah, and he said that Torah cannot be grasped by those who are as proud in their opinions as the height of Heaven. <sup><xref rid="fn646">6)</xref></sup> At the end of his prayer every day, Rava would say: &#x201C;Before I was born I did not deserve to be born, and now that I am born I am as though I had never been born. Dust am I in my life and how much more so after my death.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn647">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was characteristic of Rava also that he loved truth and hated flattery fearfully. <sup><xref rid="fn648">8)</xref></sup> Therefore he said; &#x201C;A scholar who is otherwise when alone than he appears in company cannot be considered a scholar.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn649">9)</xref></sup> Rava did much to increase the honor of the Torah and scholars flocked around him in thousands. He asked, however, that they should not come to him in the months of Nisan and Tishri, for in Nisan the harvest was gathered in from the fields, and in Tishri the grapes were trodden in the winepress, because in these two months people prepared their livelihood for the rest of the year. <sup><xref rid="fn650">10)</xref></sup> <xref rid="fn651">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Rava had his school in Mechoza. It seems that he was born there and his father, Rav Joseph bar Chama, had his own school there in the days of Rabah bar Avuha, after Papa bar Netzer destroyed Nehardea and the scholars had to flee. Mechoza was a large city in which the Jews were a majority of the population. Most of the people were merchants. <sup><xref rid="fn652">11)</xref></sup> Some were very wealthy. <sup><xref rid="fn653">12)</xref></sup> The happy situation of the Jews in Mechoza caused many pagans to be converted. <sup><xref rid="fn654">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless there were poor people in Mechoza, as we may see by the fact that when Rafram bar Papa spoke in praise of Rav Huna saying that when he broke fast he would have his gates and doors opened to every needy person to come and eat with him, Rava replied: &#x201C;All this could be imitated here except the part of breaking fast with bread for we have here too many poor people who would be glad to come if they were invited. <sup><xref rid="fn655">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rava founded a center of Jewish learning in this town which competed successfully with the academy in Pumbeditha. In a city of such a mixed population it is easily understood that the head of the academy needed a large degree of tolerance towards the various elements. It is remarkable therefore that Rava instructed his children not to marry converts. <sup><xref rid="fn656">15)</xref></sup> This might make us think that Rava was very careful never to come in contact with pagans. Yet he once sent a certain pagan named Bar-Shishach a present, or perhaps even a &#x201C;sacrifice&#x201D; in honor of a pagan holiday, for he said that this Bar-Shishach was not an idolater. <sup><xref rid="fn657">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We may see how Rava venerated the Torah from the fact that when he saw Rav Hamnuna spending a long time at his prayers, he said: &#x201C;People abandon eternal life and devote themselves to their temporal interests,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn658">17)</xref></sup> from which we may infer that Rava did not consider prayer to be particularly important, and the scholars who observed the commandments of the Torah were far more important in his eyes, as he would say, &#x201C;How foolish are those people who stand up before a Bible scroll and do not stand up before a great man.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn659">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rava&#x2019;s attitude to poor people is particularly interesting. It is said that when a poor man came to Rava once and asked for food, Rava asked him: &#x201C;What sort of food do you ordinarily eat?&#x201D; The pauper replied: &#x201C;I am accustomed to eat stuffed birds and to wash them down with old wine.&#x201D; To this Rava said: &#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you concerned about the bad times which afflict the general public?&#x201D; The man answered: &#x201C;Does my food belong to them then? I eat only what the Almighty has destined for me.&#x201D; While they were speaking a sister of Rava arrived, whom he had not seen for thirteen years, and she brought with her a stuffed bird and old wine. Rava turned to the poor man and said: &#x201C;I have been given this because of you; come then and eat with me.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn660">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is related that thieves dug their way into Rava&#x2019;s stable and stole some sheep. The loot was later recovered and Rava refused to accept them because, since the thieves had accomplished their theft at the risk of their lives, the property belonged to them. <sup><xref rid="fn661">20)</xref></sup> There are dozens of legends about Rava. For instance it is said that Rava would be greeted from Heaven every year on the eve of Yom Kippur. He was therefore a little disappointed that Abayei would get such greetings every Friday. When Rava inquired the reason, he was told to be satisfied to be able to protect a whole city with his merit. <sup><xref rid="fn662">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The old queen Ifra Hurmiz, the mother of king Sapor the Second, felt particular affection for Rava. As we said, king Sapor II was bad to the Jews. His mother, Ifra Hurmiz, would often stop him from proclaiming some evil against the Jews because of her affection for Rava. Rava once had a Jew flogged for marrying an Aramitess. The victim died of his wounds. On hearing this the king wanted to punish Rava severely. The old queen said to him, &#x201C;I pray you do not get into a fight with the Jews because whatever these people want, their God does for them.&#x201D; &#x201C;What, for instance, can their God do for them?&#x201D; the king asked his mother with a skeptical smile upon his lips. &#x201C;For instance, he gives them rain whenever they ask for it.&#x201D; &#x201C;Then let this Rava bring it about that now, suddenly in the month of Tammuz, there be rainfall, and I will remit his punishment,&#x201D; said the king. So Rava stood up to pray for rain and after a short pleading with the Lord there was a violent rainfall which extended from Mechoza to the Tigris. <sup><xref rid="fn663">22)</xref></sup> On another occasion it is related that the queen Ifra Hurmiz sent four hundred golden armlets to Rav Ami who did not wish to accept her gift. Rava did accept this donation and divided it among the poor Gentiles. <sup><xref rid="fn664">23)</xref></sup> It is related that the queen once sent Rava a sacrifice to be offered up in the name of the Jewish God. <sup><xref rid="fn665">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question of how long and when Rava lived is very complicated. According to Rashi, Rava lived only forty years. <sup><xref rid="fn666">25)</xref></sup> There is a place in the Talmud which says that Rava was born on the day when Rav Judah bar Ezekiel died. But the &#x201C;Chronicle of Rav Shrira Gaon&#x201D; says that Rava was born in the year 352 C. E. which contradicts the place cited from the Talmud, for if it is true, then Rava would have been born not on the day of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel&#x2019;s death but thirteen years later. Another theory is that of Maimonides who amends the Talmudical source to read that Rava was born <italic>before</italic> the death of Rav Judah. The Talmud also mentions once that Rava said something to Rav Judah. <sup><xref rid="fn667">26)</xref></sup> On another occasion he quoted something in Rav Judah&#x2019;s name. <sup><xref rid="fn668">27)</xref></sup> Since Rava was head of the academy in Mechoza for fourteen years, there are some who estimate his life at 74 years.</p>
<p>We should note that during the time of Rava&#x2019;s life the greatest worry of the Babylonian scholars was to determine the beginning of a new month and the holidays since they always had to wait for the decision of the High Court in Palestine. Then Hillel the Second, the Nasi of Palestine, wished to introduce a radical change in the manner of determining the Jewish calendar. Times were such as made it a risk of life to send out messengers with the news of the observation of the new moon and the ratification of the new month by the High Court, even within Palestine itself. We can imagine what dangers were involved in sending messengers to Babylon. At that time Rav Huna bar Abin gave Rava the system of the leap years. The scholars also possessed the system of leap years composed by Samuel Yarchinai. Later Hillel II set up the Jewish calendar in such a way that anyone could figure out the beginnings of the months and the dates of the holidays by himself. It was provided however that even though the Babylonians would be able to determine the months by themselves they should nevertheless continue to observe the second day of the holidays as they did previously before they had correct calendars. Rava was very strict in this matter with himself, more even than with others and he used to observe &#x201C;Yom Kippur&#x201D; two days, for he thought that perhaps the High Court in Palestine had set the day of Yom Kippur one day later than he had done himself. <sup><xref rid="fn669">28)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rav Nachman bar Isaac</title>
<p>T<small>OWARDS THE END</small> of the third century of the Christian era the persecution of the Jews in Palestine assumed a terrible form and the academies disappeared entirely. Learning continued to flourish in Babylon, however, although it lost its former intensity. After Rava died nobody could be found who was learned enough to fill his place. The academy in Mechoza, which he had headed, disintegrated and the fame of Pumbeditha grew again. But even Pumbeditha was not as brilliant as previously. At the same time a new center of Jewish life and learning was established in the city of Narash (Nares). Then Rav Nachman bar Isaac was chosen as head of the academy in Pumbeditha.<xref rid="fn670">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Rav Nachman bar Isaac was born about 280 C. E. and died 356 C. E. This was the time when the Babylonian &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; began to write down their Talmudic teachings. The &#x201C;Mishnahs&#x201D; of Rabbi Judah Hanasi as well as the &#x201C;Boraithas&#x201D; of Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Oshaya had long been written down. Similarly the Jerusalem Talmud circulated among the scholars in written form even if not complete. Since they were afraid that the teachings of the Babylonian &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; might be lost, every scholar wrote down for his own use what he remembered of what his predecessors had taught. Rav Nachman bar Isaac had a great part in the written composition of these teachings. Therefore he used to say of himself: &#x201C;I am not learned nor skilled in interpretation, so that I might express my own opinion. I never say anything on the authority of one man either, because whatever I say I heard in studying in the academy and I always arranged what I heard to meet the approval of my teachers&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn671">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Nachman was held in high esteem by his contemporaries for his far-renowned piety and because he was a man of courage and did not fear even the Exilarch. It is related that when he was sitting with Rava, a member of the Exilarch&#x2019;s family was carried by in a golden sedan-chair, sitting wrapped in a green mantle. Rava hastened to greet the person and Rav Nachman bar Isaac did not stir from his place saying: &#x201C;Rava may need him, but I do not need him.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn672">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a youth Rav Nachman bar Isaac studied with Rav Nachman bar Jacob. When Rava sat in the same school, Rav Nachman bar Isaac sat one row behind Rava. <sup><xref rid="fn673">3)</xref></sup> Later Rav Nachman bar Isaac studied under Rav Chisda. <sup><xref rid="fn674">4)</xref></sup> And while Rav Joseph bar Chiya was still alive and Rava conducted his own school in Mechoza, Rav Nachman bar Isaac was his <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05E9; &#x05DB;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05F4;</span> (the chief of the lecturers.) <sup><xref rid="fn675">5)</xref></sup> Even at that time he was famous for his piety. Abayei said he was very scrupulous in his religious conduct. <sup><xref rid="fn676">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even though Rav Nachman bar Isaac was Rava&#x2019;s <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05E9; &#x05DB;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span> Rava did not treat him with much respect when he asked a question which did not please Rava. On such an ocassion Rava said: &#x201C;We will have to wait for the prophet Elijah to settle that question for us.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn677">7)</xref></sup> On another occasion Rav Nachman tried to reply to some ruling of Rava by changing the interpretation of a Boraitha, and Rava grew very angry with him. <sup><xref rid="fn678">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Nachman used to call himself &#x201C;a whole man, son of a half.&#x201D; Rashi explains that this was because his father was not an ordained scholar. Other commentators say that this was because Rav Nachman was a wealthy man and his father was not. <sup><xref rid="fn679">9)</xref></sup> It is said that Rav Nachman&#x2019;s mother always tried to lead her son in the paths of the righteous and when astrologers once told her that her son was destined to become a thief, she never allowed him to go into the street with a bare head, saying, &#x201C;Cover your head so that you may fear God. You should also pray for his mercy so that evil impulses may not overcome you.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn680">10)</xref></sup></p>

<title>RAV PAPA</title>
<p>R<small>AV</small> P<small>APA WAS</small> about twenty years younger than Rav Nachman bar Isaac, but a more prominent figure. He was a student of Abayei in Pumbeditha and he remained there studying with Rava until the latter died. <sup><xref rid="fn681">1)</xref></sup> Rav Papa was born about 300 C. E. and died 375 C. E. In his youth it appears that Rav Papa was a poor man. Later he began to make beer out of dates and became very rich. <sup><xref rid="fn682">2)</xref></sup> He also dealt in poppy-seeds. <sup><xref rid="fn683">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Papa carried on his business affairs in partnership with Rav Huna the son of Rav Joshua, and the friendship of these two scholars was so great that they never parted from each other all their life, neither at home nor on journeys. <sup><xref rid="fn684">4)</xref></sup> And when Rav Papa later became head of the academy, Rav Huna the son of Rav Joshua was his <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05E9; &#x05DB;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05F4;</span> <span dir="ltr"> <sup><xref rid="fn685">5)</xref></sup></span></p>
<p>After Rava died, Rav Nachman bar Isaac became the head of the academy in Pumbeditha and Rav Papa conducted his own school in Nares. Almost all the scholars in Mechoza went there and when they would get up after studying, their number would reach over two hundred. <sup><xref rid="fn686">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is said that Rav Papa was more scrupulous than the law required in his everyday conduct. Once he bought a field from a man who needed the money to buy an ox. Later this seller no longer needed the money and he regretted the bargain. Rav Papa returned his field without any difficulty even though legally he did not have to do so. <sup><xref rid="fn687">7)</xref></sup> For such acts Rav Papa&#x2019;s good name was known to all the people and even Samaritans who did not ordinarily have any confidence in Jewish scholars also came visiting to him. <sup><xref rid="fn688">8)</xref></sup> Very different was Rav Papa&#x2019;s attitude to the pagans, whom he did not trust. It is said that he once went to collect a debt from an Aramitess. She invited him to sit down upon the bed. He would not sit down until he had examined the bed to see whether there were not something about it that would enable her to fix up a false charge against him and as the story goes he did indeed find a dead child in the bed. <sup><xref rid="fn689">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We should add that Rav Papa was a warden of charity in his city and as such, in the conditions of that time, it was impossible to act to everybody&#x2019;s satisfaction. <sup><xref rid="fn690">10)</xref></sup> It is, in fact, related that Rav Papa once slipped on his step and almost fell. He said: &#x201C;If I had fallen I should have suffered the punishment prescribed for a profaner of the Sabbath without having deserved it.&#x201D; Said Chiya bar Rav Medafti to this: &#x201C;It may be that you deserved it because a poor man came to you and you did not provide for him.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn691">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Papa was also known as a great eater, who consumed at least four times as much as an ordinary man. <sup><xref rid="fn692">12)</xref></sup> Although Rav Papa was the head of an academy and a very prominent scholar, he had a pupil named Rav Shimi bar Ashi who used to catch Rav Papa with such questions that they humiliated Rav Papa because he was unable to answer them. He therefore prayed to God to be delivered from Shimi&#x2019;s questions. <sup><xref rid="fn693">13)</xref></sup> Rav Papa and his above-mentioned friend, Rav Huna the son of Rav Joshua, once had a trial with several merchants who complained against the two of them to Rava. And when Rava decided in favor of those merchants Rav Papa said: &#x201C;White geese try to pull the clothes off man.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn694">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The laws and proverbs of Rav Papa number hundreds. Being a merchant with a wide experience of life, he said things which still have value today: &#x201C;At the door of a food-shop there are many brothers and friends, but at hunger&#x2019;s door there are no brothers and no friends. <sup><xref rid="fn695">15)</xref></sup> When you set out on a journey settle your accounts with your enemies first, so that they may fear you. <sup><xref rid="fn696">16)</xref></sup> In a house of sorrow it is well to be silent. <sup><xref rid="fn697">17)</xref></sup> Whoever has a short wife, should bend down to speak with her. <sup><xref rid="fn698">18)</xref></sup> If you let a quarrel stand over night, it disappears by itself. <sup><xref rid="fn699">19)</xref></sup> Anybody who takes vengeance in the midst of his wrath destroys his own house. <sup><xref rid="fn700">20)</xref></sup> In the presence of a convert, even after the tenth generation, one should never refer to a Gentile in any derogatory manner. <sup><xref rid="fn701">21)</xref></sup> Sow your wheat so that you need not buy, because no matter what you realize out of it it will still be a blessing. <sup><xref rid="fn702">22)</xref></sup> Even wool-washing is an honest occupation and one should not be ashamed to call one out to the gate and sit down near him. <sup><xref rid="fn703">23)</xref></sup> If somebody tells you that your friend is dead, don&#x2019;t believe it. <sup><xref rid="fn704">24)</xref></sup> A dog and a cat sometimes make a meal together in peace, when they get rid of a common enemy. <sup><xref rid="fn705">25)</xref></sup> When the grain runs out of the jar, conflict comes into the house. <sup><xref rid="fn706">26)</xref></sup> Go down a degree to take a wife; go up a degree to choose your relations. <sup><xref rid="fn707">27)</xref></sup> Many old camels carry the skin of young ones upon them. <sup><xref rid="fn708">28)</xref></sup> Be quick in buying a field and slow in taking a wife. <sup><xref rid="fn709">29)</xref></sup> Go put silk on a pig, when he wallows in the mud. <sup><xref rid="fn710">30)</xref></sup> Anybody who can drink beer and insists on drinking wine, transgresses against the commandment &#x2018;Thou shalt not destroy.&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn711">31)</xref></sup></p>

<title>Rav Huna the Son of Rav Joshua</title>
<p>A<small>S WE HAVE WRITTEN ABOVE</small>, Rav Huna, son of Rav Joshua, was a friend of Rav Papa. They were in business together and they were so friendly that they were never apart whether at home or on a journey. When they were young they both studied under Abayei and Rava, and when Rava was still alive they both conducted a school in Nares, where they were both judges. Even though Rav Huna is always mentioned with his father&#x2019;s name and his father is given the title of Rav, we do not know who and what Rav Huna&#x2019;s father was.</p>
<p>It is related that when Rav Papa and Rav Huna, the son of Rav Joshua, once went somewhere with Abayei, Rav Papa walked on his right side and Rav Huna walked on his left side. Suddenly there sprang up a violent wind from the left side and Abayei commanded Rav Papa to walk on his left side and Rav Huna on the right. <sup><xref rid="fn712">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we have said, Rav Nachman bar Isaac was the head of the academy in Nares and his friend, Rav Huna, the son of Rav Joshua, became the <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05E9; &#x05DB;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05F4;</span> (chief of the lectures); but even though Rav Papa was the head of the academy and Rav Huna only held the title &#x201C;Rosh Kalah&#x201D;, they were both equal in their dignity. They also made all decisions on religious and social affairs conjointly, because what one of them said the other always agreed to. It seems that Rav Huna did not have any students of his own. All the students in the academy of Nares were considered the students of Rav Papa. Whenever they quoted a saying, it was quoted in Rav Papa&#x2019;s name and yet nowhere is there any evidence that Rav Huna, the son of Rav Joshua, was jealous about this. Only one student named Rav Jacob from N&#x2019;har P&#x2019;kud once quoted a law in the name of Rav Huna, the son of Rav Joshua. <sup><xref rid="fn713">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As dependent as they were on each other, their friendship nevertheless was without sentimentality. It is related that once when Rav Huna was sick, Rav Papa came to see him and thought that he was near to death. Without a sign of grief he ordered them to prepare shrouds. And then later when Rav Huna got better, confounding their expectations, Rav Papa did not show the least sign of pleasure that his friend had remained alive, but he simply wanted to know what Rav Huna had heard and seen when he lay so near death. <sup><xref rid="fn714">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is clear from Rav Huna&#x2019;s Talmudical sayings that he was an expert in medicine. <sup><xref rid="fn715">4)</xref></sup> Of his remarks only this has remained: &#x201C;May I be aided by the fact that I never went four paces with a bare head.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn716">5)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rav Chama of Nehardea</title>
<p>T<small>HIS</small> R<small>AV</small> C<small>HAMA OF</small> N<small>EHARDEA</small>, who is usually called just Rav Chama, was fortunate enough to have been the student of Rav Chisda. <sup><xref rid="fn717">1)</xref></sup> It is possible that after Rav Chisda&#x2019;s death he studied under Rava. <sup><xref rid="fn718">2)</xref></sup> It is not known, however, exactly where he had his academy, in Pumbeditha or in Nehardea. He was called &#x201C;Rav Chama of Nehardea.&#x201D; But it may be that he was named so simply because he was born there, although his academy was in Pumbeditha. We are certain only that he was the head of the academy for 21 years, from 356 to 377 C. E.</p>
<p>It is said that in the time when Rav Papa was the head of the academy in Nares and there was no academy in the whole of Palestine, king Sapor II of Persia once asked Rav Chama whether the burial of the dead was simply a folk-custom among the Jews or if it was a commandment of the Bible. The reason for this question was that the Persians, who worshipped fire, used to cremate their dead. King Sapor was not pleased with the Jewish custom of burial and he wished to order the Jews to burn their dead as the Persians did. Rav Chama of Nehardea was silent and did not answer the king&#x2019;s question. At the moment, it seems, he did not know what to answer. Rav Acha bar Jacob heard of this and said: &#x201C;The world has been handed over into the hands of fools who do not know that burial of the dead is a commandment of the Bible and when they are asked they forget the verse which says expressly, &#x2018;for thou shalt bury him on that day.&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn719">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Rav Chama&#x2019;s times a great change in the government of the Roman Empire took place, which had a great influence upon the history of the Jews in Babylonia. Emperor Flavius Claudius Julianus, or as history calls him Julian the Apostate, because he denied the Christian religion, was educated in the ideas of the Greek philosophers and his teachers inculcated a love for the Greek idols. He abjured the Christian faith, which was the state religion of the Roman Empire already and attempted to reestablish the ancient Greek idolatry in its place.</p>
<p>For a long time the Emperor Constantius had suspected that he had his eye upon the position of Roman Emperor. At first he drove him into exile, and later he made him his assistant in ruling, and after a successful attack upon the Germans who had fallen upon the northern districts of the Roman Empire, Julian had himself proclaimed Emperor by his soldiers. Hearing this the Emperor Constantius went out to attack the usurper with a great army. But Constantius died on the way. With this there was no longer any obstacle to Julian&#x2019;s climb to the throne. Immediately he recognized the old Greek religion and had himself chosen as <italic>&#x201C;Pontifex maximus&#x201D;.</italic></p>
<p>He did not persecute the Christians, he simply took away from them those privileges which earlier Emperors had given them. In addition it is said that he lived simply, without luxury and superfluity. His philosophy taught him that the only task of a ruler was to extend his protection to all his subjects without regard to religion and he wished to apply his maxims to the rule of his land. Julian always manifested a particular interest in the condition of the Jews in the Roman Empire. Since Emperor Alexander Severus, the friend of Rabbi Judah N&#x2019;siah II, there was no emperor of the Romans who took as much interest in the Jews as Julian. In his youth he read the writings of the Bible, and learned to respect the wisdom of the Jews; and after he became the Emperor of the Romans, he declared publicly that he regretted all the evil that his predecessors had done to the Jews. And since he undertook to revive the ancient Greek idolatry, he thought a great deal about sacrifices. He therefore was much taken with the idea of rebuilding the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, where God would be served with sacrifices.</p>
<p>Many believe that Julian&#x2019;s kindness had no more than political motives. They think that since he intended to destroy the Persian control over Babylonia and he began warfare against king Sapor, he wished to win over the Jews, for he knew that the Jews of Babylonia had great influence in politics, and therefore he made the announcement that he wished to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Julian did not content himself with a simple promise to build a Temple in Jerusalem, for in spite of having his hands full preparing the war against the Persians he set about the work of rebuilding the Temple in full earnest and appointed a special official, Alifius of Antioch, who had previously been the Roman governor of Britain. He instructed him also not to spare any money in building the Temple but to finish it quickly. At the same time he sent an imperial command to the governors of Syria and Palestine to support Alifius in his work and supply him with all necessaries.</p>
<p>All the materials were ready in Jerusalem. Great camps of workers were clearing away the ruins which had accumulated on the site of the Temple in the three centuries since its destruction. When they had cleared away the wreckage, the gases suddenly exploded and many workers were killed. This was regarded as a sign from Heaven that God did not wish the Jewish Temple to be rebuilt. Thus the history of Emperor Hadrian&#x2019;s times repeated itself, for Emperor Hadrian too wanted to have the Temple rebuilt and the work was interrupted by an explosion of gases while the debris was being removed. It was said then that the Almighty did not wish to allow His Temple to be rebuilt by the same people who had destroyed it.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the Jews were not enthusiastic about the project. In the Jewish books of the time it is not even mentioned. Only Christian chronicles relate that the Jews sent gold and silver from all corners of the earth for the construction of their Temple. It is possible that previous experience of failure in revolutions against the Romans discouraged the Jews from any adventure with them, lest it fail and they have to pay dearly for its failure. In any case, before the Jews had a chance to study the matter it was too late, because Emperor Julian ruled no more than twenty months, and after twenty months of his rule he died in the war against the Persians in 363 C. E. at the age of thirty-two.</p>
<p>In his war against the Persians Julian wished to break king Sapor&#x2019;s might in Babylonia. His dream was that the Roman eagle should spread his wings over the Tigris. King Sapor wanted not merely to maintain his rule over the land of Babylonia but to drive the Romans out of Asia entirely. Between these two giants the small people of Israel stood as between two fires. The end of this conflict of the Titans was not good for the Jews, both as to the attitude of king Sapor and as to the attitude of Julian&#x2019;s successors.</p>

<chapter>
<title>RAV SHESHET</title>
<p>W<small>HEN</small> P<small>APA BAR</small> N<small>ETZER</small> destroyed Nehardea such famous scholars as Rav Nachman bar Jacob, Raban bar Avahu and Rav Joseph bar Chama had to flee. Among those who fled was also Rav Sheshet who did not become the head of the academy in his new residence and not even the judge; even though he conducted his own school and many of the most prominent &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; of that time were his students. All those scholars who fled from Nehardea dwelt in Mechoza, in Pumbeditha or in some other city near the Tigris, where new centers of Jewish life sprang up at the time. Rav Sheshet settled in Shilhi (Fhoum al Selhi).</p>
<p>In his youth Rav Sheshet was among the pupils of Rav Huna, when he occupied the seat of Rav (Aba Arecha) in Sura. <sup><xref rid="fn720">1)</xref></sup> Later Rav Sheshet sat in Rav Chisda&#x2019;s school and often disagreed with him about various problems of law. His diligence in study was so great that even in the midst of prayer he did not cease studying. <sup><xref rid="fn721">2)</xref></sup> He was blind and his memory was so strong that he knew not only the whole Mishnah by heart, but all the &#x201C;Boraitoth&#x201D; and &#x201C;Toseftoth&#x201D;. Many of the scholars said about him therefore that he was a man as hard as iron. <sup><xref rid="fn722">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Sheshet was also a pupil of Rav Jeremiah bar Aba, who was a student and a friend of Rav. <sup><xref rid="fn723">4)</xref></sup> But he did not always show the proper respect for Rav&#x2019;s opinions and when he did not like them, he dared to say: &#x201C;Rav could have said such a thing only when he was sleepy or snoring.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn724">5)</xref></sup> On another occasion he said, &#x201C;Rav&#x2019;s words on this matter are like those of a Kuthite (meaning an &#x201C;Ignoramus&#x201D;). <sup><xref rid="fn725">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>If there was any difficulty in anything studied, all one had to do was to ask Rav Sheshet. When Rav Chisda once met Rav Sheshet he was afraid to speak to him of matters of scholarship, lest he be overshadowed. <sup><xref rid="fn726">7)</xref></sup> In addition he was very keen-witted. Rav Chama of Nehardea said that the verse &#x201C;Wisdom is good with inheritance&#x201D; referred to Rav Sheshet and meant that it is good to have wisdom and acuteness together with the inheritance of the Mishnah. <sup><xref rid="fn727">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless it sometimes happened that in spite of his great keenness and prodigious memory Rav Sheshet forgot something. When this happened once he asked his students: &#x201C;When you ever catch me forgetting something, do not tell anyone about it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn728">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is evident that Rav Sheshet did not care for logic-chopping in contriving new laws or in deriving them out of old ones in a hair-splitting fashion. Once when there was a debate about the question of whether a prisoner should be considered as dead and his children permitted to receive their inheritance even though it is not certain that he had died, an attempt was made to derive this law from the verse &#x201C;and I shall kill you and your children will be orphans and your wives widows.&#x201D; It was remarked that if God wanted to kill anyone there was no need to add that his children would be orphans and his wives widows, since this was self-evident. Then what was the purpose of these words in the verse? We must infer therefore that the verse intimates that the widow of the dead man would desire to remarry and would not be allowed to do so and his children would desire to inherit his property and they would not be allowed to do so. This interpretation was told to Rav Sheshet by one of his students as an answer to the problem, and Rav Sheshet said to him: &#x201C;I see that you are one of those people from Pumbeditha who can drive an elephant through the eye of a needle.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn729">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Sheshet himself always supported his views by a quotation from the Mishnah. <sup><xref rid="fn730">11)</xref></sup> When he studied he was interested in finding the origin of every law, whether it came from the Mishnah or from the Boraitha. <sup><xref rid="fn731">12)</xref></sup> He also had a man with him who was engaged in composing the &#x201C;Boraithoth.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn732">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here we may mention that just as Rav Nachman bar Jacob&#x2019;s decisions in matters of money were considered authoritative, so were Rav Sheshet&#x2019;s decisions in matters of permitted and prohibited actions.</p>
<p>It is not known who and what Rav Sheshet&#x2019;s father was. And since he once said himself: &#x201C;I am no scholar and I am not the son of a scholar,&#x201D; many historians believe that Rav Sheshet&#x2019;s father was not a scholar. But this cannot be proved by this statement, for he says that he too was not a scholar. <sup><xref rid="fn733">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Sheshet was blind and a story is related about this. Once the people of his town went to welcome the king and Rav Sheshet went along. A certain wag wanted to fool him. Whenever a party of the king&#x2019;s company went by that wag said to him: &#x201C;Here comes the king&#x0021;&#x201D; But Rav Sheshet was not fooled. When at last it grew quiet and the wag said nothing, Rav Sheshet understood that the king had really come. And when the wag later asked him how he knew when the king was coming even though he was blind, Rav Sheshet explained that it was in the same way that the prophet Elijah recognized the presence of God&#x2019;s Majesty when He came to him in the cave where he was hiding from the wrath of Ahab and Jezebel. <sup><xref rid="fn734">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We may assume that Rav Sheshet was not born blind. How he went blind is explained in the interpretations of the elderly Talmudists who apparently had it from earlier generations. It seems that since Rav (Aba Arecha) never lifted his eyes from the ground so that he would not see any impure thing. Rav Sheshet and Rav Joseph bar Chama wanted to imitate him and they strained their eyesight by not lifting their glances from the earth until they grew blind.</p>
<p>There are many who seek to prove that Rav Sheshet was not born blind by the fact that he is said once to have seen a snake in a dream and killed it. <sup><xref rid="fn735">16)</xref></sup> For if he had been blind from birth, he would not have had any conception of the appearance of a snake and he would not have been able to dream about it. On another occasion it is related that his mother came into his school once to pray for a student of his named Ahadboy bar Ami who had been stricken dumb because he had taken a notion to mock at Rav Sheshet. When Rav Sheshet refused to listen to his mother&#x2019;s pleas, she cried out: &#x201C;See the breast which you suckled.&#x201D; And if he had been born blind she would not have used the word &#x201C;see.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn736">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Sheshet did not make his living from scholarship but from trade. It is related that he dealt in clothes which he used to sell on credit. <sup><xref rid="fn737">18)</xref></sup> He also used to carry burdens on his shoulders for pay and he would say: &#x201C;Work is a great thing because it warms people up.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn738">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Sheshet was a delicate soul who ate meagrely and had a weak stomach. If he ate something in the morning, he could not eat at night. Therefore he fasted on the Eve of Passover so that he could eat the matzoth with appetite at night. <sup><xref rid="fn739">20)</xref></sup> Nevertheless his spirit was as hard as steel. <sup><xref rid="fn740">21)</xref></sup> It is related that Rav Sheshet had continual conflicts with the Exilarch and his household. It seems that the people of the Exilarch&#x2019;s house would treat the scholars with contempt and they were careless in the observance of the commandments also. When Rav Sheshet once sent one of his people, Rav Gada, to set up the &#x201C;Eruv&#x201D; at the Exilarch&#x2019;s house he was arrested there. <sup><xref rid="fn741">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Exilarch often invited Rav Sheshet to eat with him, but Rav Sheshet always excused himself with one alibi or another. Once he claimed that the servants of the Exilarch served meat that was torn from the living flesh. <sup><xref rid="fn742">23)</xref></sup> Another time Rav Nachman bar Jacob and Rav Chisda were at the Exilarch&#x2019;s table on the second day of the holiday and they were served a stag which was caught on the first day of the holiday and slaughtered on the second. Rav Nachman and Rav Chisda ate the deer&#x2019;s meat but Rav Sheshet refused. <sup><xref rid="fn743">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The cause of Rav Sheshet&#x2019;s conflict with the Exilarch is not known. It may be that Rav Sheshet felt insulted because the Exilarch once told him: &#x201C;Although you are all very famous and venerable Rabbis, the Persians have better manners at the table.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn744">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Sheshet was not fortunate enough to have any sons to whom to hand on his learning. When he became a widower he was asked why he didn&#x2019;t marry a second time and have a son, he answered that his daughter&#x2019;s children were as dear to him as though they were his own. <sup><xref rid="fn745">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rav Sheshet was about to die it is said that the Angel of Death met him on the street and tried to take away his soul. So he said to him: &#x201C;You want to kill me on the street like a steer? If you want to take my soul come into my house.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn746">27)</xref></sup></p>

<title>Rav Ashi, the Compiler of the Babylonian Talmud</title>
<p>A<small>FTER THE DEATH</small> of king Sapor the Second, the condition of the Jews in Babylonia was greatly improved. The successors of this king were just to all the peoples of their realm and they treated the Jews with particular kindness. They held Jewish learning in great esteem and if only the Jews paid their royal taxes in time, they were allowed to maintain their academies and they were not disturbed in their religion.</p>
<p>Then there arose a man who collected all the lore of the Mishnah and the interpretations made by the scholars of Babylonia and Palestine up to that time. The name of this man was Rav Ashi and the people of his time gave him the title &#x201C;Rabbana&#x201D;, our Rabbi, meaning that he was not only a teacher like other teachers with pupils, but he was really the teacher of the whole generation. Others would say that he was a &#x201C;Sinai and uprooter of hills&#x201D; filled with Torah like the mountain of Sinai and at the same time a subtle thinker who tore up the hills with his dialectic.</p>
<p>Rav Ashi was born about 352 and died in the year 427 C. E. The year of his birth is not certain for it is possible that he was born earlier and lived longer than is generally supposed. When he was still very young &#x2014; some say that he was hardly 14 years of age &#x2014; he had already distinguished himself by his keen mind, deep insight and personal virtues. He was then chosen head of the academy at Matha Mechasia near Sura <xref rid="fn747">&#x002A;</xref> which had been waste and deserted for a long time.</p>
<p>The magnetic personality of Rav Ashi raised the prestige of his academy. All the scholars of his time were respectful when they heard his words, in a way that had not been paralleled since the death of Rava. People would say that &#x201C;since the time of Rabbi Judah Hanasi and Rav Ashi there was no one who united wealth with Torah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn748">1)</xref></sup> Raised in wealth, Rav Ashi continued wealthy all his life and owned many fields and forests. He would allow his wool to be sold for the uses of idol-worship without regard for the prohibition which forbade this. <sup><xref rid="fn749">2)</xref></sup> But this cannot be considered as evidence of his tolerance of the customs of the pagans, for his expressed opinions were that the pagans in his neighborhood were a worthless crew. Thus he could never understand the fact that the pagans in Matha Mechasia did not recognize the worth of the Torah and become converts to Judaism even though they had the opportunity of seeing the splendor with which it endows its scholars twice a year. <sup><xref rid="fn750">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>No details of Rav Ashi&#x2019;s youth are known, nor is the name of his father known. It seems that he studied under the most prominent students of Abayei and Rava. It is likely also that he was born in Matha Mechasia and tried to aid his city in everything he could. In earlier times there was a synagogue there which lay in ruins in his day because of its age. Rav Ashi had it rebuilt and stood there each day himself to see that the workmen did not loaf in their work. He had a bed set up for him there until the building was finished. <sup><xref rid="fn751">4)</xref></sup> Then he built a splendid school so that there would be room for his students as well as for the auditors who came to hear his lectures in the &#x201C;lecture months&#x201D; of Adar and Elul of every year. He never allowed the people of Matha Mechasia to build their roofs higher than the roof of the synagogue or the academy, because he believed in an old saying of Rav (Aba Arecha) that a city whose dwelling houses are taller than its synagogues or its academies was doomed to destruction. He said therefore that this rule of his saved Matha Mechasia from destruction. <sup><xref rid="fn752">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to many historians Rav Ashi occupied the post of head of the academy in Matha Mechasia all of sixty years. At the same time the academy at Nehardea regained some of its former splendor, under its head Amemar. The same thing took place at Pumbeditha. There were eight heads there during Rav Ashi&#x2019;s days. But not a single one of the &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; reached the heights of Rav Ashi who was listened to by everyone and supported in his efforts to regulate religious life. Even the two Exilarchs of that time (Rav Cahana and Mar Zutra) who were recognized scholars and also rulers of the country always looked up to Rav Ashi and followed his words.</p>
<p>There was a custom in those days that the Exilarch used to come for a visit once a year to those cities where the best academies of Babylonia were in order to receive the greetings of the Jewish communities. Even though there were several academies of importance in Rav Ashi&#x2019;s time, the Exilarch came only to Sura which was near Matha Mechasia. Usually this would take place on the Saturday during which the chapter <italic>&#x201C;Lech-l&#x2019;cha&#x201D;</italic> was read, in the beginning of the month Marcheshvan. This was the festival Sabbath in honor of the Exilarch who would then make a feast in honor of the head of the academy. In Sura or in Matha Mechasia also the &#x201C;assemblies&#x201D; would convene at which the Exilarch made his reports concerning the political situation. Although the Exilarch lived in a different city, he used to call these assemblies to Sura during Rav Ashi&#x2019;s time. The city Matha Mechasia, therefore, became the capital of Jewish life in Babylonia to which almost all the Jews of the land would assemble during the &#x201C;lecture months&#x201D; (Elul and Adar) when the head of the academy would lecture about the laws of the holidays; as well as upon a holiday sabbath when the people came to greet the Exilarch, or when they gathered for a general assembly.</p>
<p>Since Rav Ashi united all the virtues, surpassing all the men of his times, he also had the ability to undertake the great task of compiling and arranging all the legal decisions and religious interpretations of the Mishnahs, as well as the Boraithoth and Tosefthoth, in one great work out of which the Babylonian Talmud later developed. One reason for the collection of this work was probably the desire to facilitate the preservation of all this religious and legal material which kept on growing from generation to generation in order to perpetuate its memory among men and to maintain it alive in their hearts. After many of those interpretations and decisions had been forgotten, as Rav Ashi complained, and the memory of people seemed to be growing weaker, he said that &#x201C;if the hearts of former generations were as wide as the gates of a palace, our hearts are as narrow and insignificant as the eye of a needle.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn753">6)</xref></sup> Since the time of Rav (Aba Arecha) the material of scholarship had increased so much that it surpassed the capacity of human memory. Rav Ashi collected all this material and had it written down so that it would not be forgotten.</p>
<p>It seems that Rav Ashi occupied the seat of the head of the academy in Matha Mechasia for sixty years, and he spent all this time in collecting all the interpretations of the Talmud which had accumulated in the various academies. He was very careful and wrote things into his collection only after long scrutiny. In the &#x201C;lecture months&#x201D; of each year when all of Rav Ashi&#x2019;s students would assemble from all corners of Babylonia, he would assign a given topic for study or a section of that topic to be discussed by the scholars and the students. In this way the whole of the Mishnah and the Talmud were divided into sixty parts (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E1;&#x05DB;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span>). Thus Rav Ashi completed the division of the Mishnah, the great work of Rabbi Judah Hanasi 200 years back. This was a very difficult task, not to be compared with the editing of the Mishnah, which contained short, simple statements of the laws of the Torah, as they were interpreted at that time. Incidental matters and details were collected separately in the &#x201C;Boraithoth&#x201D;. The &#x201C;Gemara&#x201D;, however, contains everything and excludes nothing which has the slightest connection with the topic under discussion.</p>
<p>The Babylonian Talmud became the cornerstone of the further development of the Jewish people. Rav Ashi did not finish this immense work. He was the one who felt that the time had at last come to assemble all the material. Each academy had had its own system of interpreting the Mishnah, which was taught at that academy. The urge to find new interpretations of the commandments was still alive. Rav Ashi could not restrain himself merely to collecting and arranging the matter, because he was called upon to decide all sorts of differences of opinion at the same time and to resolve doubts and supply explanations where they were needed.</p>
<p>For almost the whole of the time that Rav Ashi was head of the academy in Matha Mechasia the Persian king Yezdigerd the Second ruled the land. His religious conduct was displeasing to the Persian priests and they called him &#x201C;the sinner.&#x201D; He was criticized particularly for his behavior towards the Jews, whom he protected from harm so long as he ruled. The Babylonian academies, three in number, flourished under his protection. Jews were invited to all the court celebrations, and the heads of the three academies, Rav Ashi of Matha Mechasia and Sura, Mar Zutra of Pumbeditha, and Amemar of Nehardea, had to represent the Jews among the prominent leaders of the realm who were present at all the feasts in the king&#x2019;s house.</p>
<p>King Yezidgerd lavished special honors upon the Exilarch of the time, Rav Huna bar Nathan. It is related that the Exilarch once appeared before the king wearing a girdle under his sleeves after the fashion of ordinary people. The king lowered his girdle to his loins and said: &#x201C;You Jews are the priests of God Almighty and should wear your girdles after the fashion of our priests.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn754">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In those days finally arrived the historic day of reckoning for the Roman Empire. On all sides Rome was pounded by different enemies. Internal conflict and outer war united for the same purpose, and any clear-eyed person could see that the days of the Roman Empire were numbered. There were many Jews who saw these political complications as signs of the advent of the Messiah. At the same time the &#x201C;Book of the Jubilees&#x201D; from the Apocrypha became known among the people in which all the historic occurrences of the world were reckoned according to the count of the jubilee years. It was found that this book stated that the world had only eighty-five jubilee-years for the count of its existence. They calculated that this meant that the year 439 C. E. would mark the end of the world, and since this year was rapidly approaching, they expected the near arrival of Messiah.</p>
<p>All these fantasies inflamed the imaginations of the people and they fell easy prey to all sorts of cranks. Such a movement was started in Crete in Rav Ashi&#x2019;s days and the Jews there were deluded into following a crank. He was a semi-lunatic who called himself Moses. He promised his following to perform miracles like those Moses performed in leading the Jews out of Egypt. He would lead them through the Mediterranean Sea to Palestine and the sea would dry up under their feet. The Jews of Crete believed in him and abandoned their work and their property and followed their Messiah who would split open the sea for them like Moses of old. At last the day came when the new Moses had promised the great miracle to occur. Moses went ahead and all the Jews of Crete with their wives and children followed him to the shore of the sea. There the new Messiah stood at the crest of a cliff and ordered his followers to jump into the sea and it would split immediately. Following the precedent of Moses, for whom Nachshon ben Aminadav sprang into the sea and it opened up when he was standing neck-deep, all the followers of the new Moses sprang into the sea. All but a small remnant were drowned. Sailors who were out on the sea in small boats saved those who survived.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Roman Empire came nearer to its doom with every passing day. The Romans were fanatical Christians at the time, full of hatred for the Jews. One after another the academies in Palestine were shut down, and the love of learning was almost extinct there. At the same time the power of the Jewish &#x201C;Nasi&#x201D;, whose position had been the most brialliant light in the darkness of the Exile previously, was destroyed. After the &#x201C;Nasi&#x201D; Rabbi Hillel the Second, who introduced the regular calendar, there were three N&#x2019;siim: Rabban Gamaliel V, Rabbi Jehudah N&#x2019;siah III, and Rabban Gamaliel VI. But the position of Nasi was without practical importance. The government no longer supported the Nasi. It merely demanded that he squeeze the last penny out of the Jews for taxes, and in order to cover the expenses of his establishment, the Nasi had to send agents to all the communities of the Jewish Diaspora to collect charity.</p>
<p>Theodosius the Great was Emperor then and he always protected the Jews, even though the Christian priests always agitated against them and threatened that Theodosius&#x2019; soul would burn in Hell because he did not assist in the persecution of the Jews. Theodosius paid no attention but he issued a decree which permitted the Nasi to continue to excommunicate anyone whom he considered harmful to the Jewish community. He forbade anyone to interfere with the inner government of the Jews and in their internal quarrels. The justice of Emperor Theodosius for the Jews was best proven, when the Nasi Rabban Gamliel V complained that the Roman Consul Hesichius had robbed him of many valuable documents. Calling the Consul for a hearing, the Emperor found him guilty and sentenced him to death. Theodosius was hard put to it to soothe the fanatical hatred of the priests for the Jews. They were continually trying to disturb the Jews at their worship. Whenever the Jews would erect a synagogue, they were subjected to all sort of trouble, their synagogues were pilfered, sacred objects were stolen and fire would be set to the building.</p>
<p>The outstanding figures in this destructive mania were John Chrysostom of Antioch and Ambrosius of Milan in Italy. Chrysostom was enraged when he saw that many of the Christians were sympathetic to the Jews. Every Saturday and holiday certain Christians would come to the Jewish synagogue for religous inspiration. Especially aristocratic ladies were known to visit the synagogue regularly, fast on Yom Kippur and sit in a Succah. When Christians fell out between themselves they would often choose to go before a Jewish court because they knew that they would get justice there. This was something Chrysostom could not bear and he fought against with all his strength.</p>
<p>Meanwhile other occurrences enraged Chrysostom still further. In Rome the Christians burned a Jewish synagogue. The Emperor ordered the Senate to rebuild the synagogue at the expense of the Roman Christians. On another occasion the bishop of Kalinikat in northern Mesopotamia ordered his priests to tear down the Jewish synagogue. Theodosius not only ordered him to rebuild the synagogue at his own expense, but made him punish all those who took part in the destruction. On hearing this Chrysostom was fearfully angry and threatened the Emperor with the fiercest pains of Hell until he was forced to rescind the bishop&#x2019;s punishment.</p>
<p>In order to put a stop to all these attacks upon the Jews, Theodosius issued a proclamation which declared that the Jewish religion had always been allowed in Rome and the Jews were always recognized as citizens. Then the Emperor ordered all his consuls to punish anyone who disturbed the peace of the Jewish religion or who destroyed their synagogues.</p>
<p>Wishing to secure the safety of his successors&#x2019; empire, Emperor Theodosius divided it into two parts: the western part of the Empire with the city of Rome as the capital divided from the eastern part with its capital in Byzantium. This arrangement did not secure the peace of the Empire, however, and the Jews had to suffer in both parts of the Empire. They knew, however, how to soften the wrath of their rulers by the use of coin. In this way it came about that the Emperor issued a proclamation that protected the Jews from attack, just as the Jewish Nasi was protected from insult. The Emperor&#x2019;s proclamation ordered the rulers not to allow the mobs to attack Jewish synagogues. He also renewed the rule that the Jewish N&#x2019;siim were exempt from taxes in each country just like Christian priests. In addition he ordered that disputes between Jews be settled in the Jewish court, and the Roman officials were to support the Jewish courts in the execution of their decisions.</p>
<p>In the time of Emperor Theodosius II (in Byzantium) Jewish gifts could accomplish very little. The Emperor prohibited the building of new synagogues and he denied the Jewish courts the right to judge disputes between Jews and Christians. In this Emperor&#x2019;s time the office of Nasi was abolished. The last Nasi of the Jews was Rabban Gamaliel VI, the son of Rabbi Judah N&#x2019;siah III. He was more honored in the royal court than all his predecessors. In all this esteem however, there was not the least hint of power. It is related that he received some titles for his great learning in medicine, especially for having found a remedy for a sick spleen.</p>
<p>He was in error, however, if he thought that he could accomplish anything for the good of his people. Thinking that he was not required to obey the letter of all the imperial commands, he built new synagogues and judged disputes between Jews and Christians. The result was that Theodosius revoked all his titles and took away all his importance as Nasi. This happened in 415 C. E. The Emperor left him only the title of Nasi without any power. Without leaving any children the line of N&#x2019;siim in Palestine was broken after five centuries and fifteen generations, when he died in 426 C. E.</p>
<p>And these are the names of all the &#x201C;N&#x2019;siim&#x201D;: Rabban Gamaliel the Old, Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel, Rabban Gamaliel of Javneh, Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel II, Rabbi Judah Hanasi, Rabban Simeon ben Rabbi Judah Hanasi. Rabbi Judah N&#x2019;siah, Rabbi Gamaliel ben Rabbi Judah N&#x2019;siah, Rabbi Judah N&#x2019;siah II, Rabbi Gamaliel V, Rabbi Judah N&#x2019;siah III, Rabbi Hillel (II), Rabbi Gamaliel ben Rabbi Hillel, Rabbi Judah N&#x2019;siah IV, and Rabbi Gamaliel VI.</p>
<ftnote id="fn747">&#x002A; Rav Sherira Gaon, who lived in Babylonia all his life and who wrote the history of its academies, says that Sura is the same as Matha Mechasia, although other historians cite proof that they were two separate places. They remark however that the two cities were close together. Today of course it is hard to decide this question. Neither of the cities exists any longer and their sites are not even known. It is notable however that wherever the name of Rav Ashi is mentioned in the Talmud, it is always in connection with the name of Matha Mechasia instead of Sura.</ftnote>

<title>Tavyomi Mar Bar Rav Ashi</title>
<p>F<small>OR HUNDREDS OF YEARS</small> the Jews of Babylonia lived in peace and quiet and knew nothing of persecution. They made their living from agriculture and trade. And since they lacked for nothing and the government protected their lives, they were able to devote themselvs to learning and observe the commandments of the Torah. The Jews were especially well off under the rule of the Parthians who defeated the Chaldeans and conquered their land. But even later under the Persians only the early years were bad, when the Persians were still religious fanatics and had not learned to be tolerant to people of other faiths. Later the situation changed and the Jews entrenched themselves in complete security as a &#x201C;nation within a nation.&#x201D; The cities where the great academies were to be found, were purely Jewish cities and governed themselves. The Jews lived in Babylonia as though in their own state, which had only to pay taxes to the central government and had the right to protection from outside enemies in return.</p>
<p>Those good times suddenly changed, and the former difficulties with king Sapor the Second were made to seem like mere sport by the troubles which the Jews suffered later. Since the scholars decided that the government had resolved to destroy the Jewish people and its religion, they felt that the time had come finally to colect all the documents of Jewish tradition, and save them from oblivion and all mischances. The Babylonian Talmud was created which contained all the creations of the Jewish spirit and everything the Jews had thought from the last prophets to Rav Ashi and Ravina.</p>
<p>It is a revealing fact that about thirty years after the death of Rav Ashi the leaders of the academy in Matha Mechasia near Sura were merely nominal leaders, for their work made no impression upon the life of the Jews, and in Pumbeditha conditions were still worse. One of the most prominent among those heads of the academy was Rav Nachman bar Huna, a student of Rav Ashi&#x2019;s. After his death they were about to choose for his successor a son of Rav Ashi by the name Tavyomi, who had long deserved to occupy that position. This son is known in the Talmud as &#x201C;Mar bar Rav Ashi.&#x201D; Various elements interfered with the choice of Tavyomi with their intrigues. Then another Amora, named Rav Acha Midifto, who was related to the Exilarch, was chosen as head of the academy in Matha Mechasia. While this was happening Mar bar Rav Ashi was away on a trip to Mechoza. The news hurt him very much for he had set his heart on filling his father&#x2019;s post.</p>
<p>When it became known that Mar bar Rav Ashi had returned from his trip, the scholars in Matha Mechasia realized that they should have asked his opinion about the man whom they had chosen to fill the post that should rightly have been his. They sent two scholars to meet him and tell him whom they had chosen as head of the academy. Tavyomi kept the two scholars and would not let them depart. They sent two other scholars. Tavyomi kept them also. The same thing was repeated until Tavyomi had ten scholars with him. Then he answered their report of the election of a new head of the academy with a lecture which so enthralled them that they ended by begging him to become the head of their academy, and he accepted the post.</p>
<p>This happened in the year 456 C. E. In the same year the terrible persecutions of the Jews broke out, unparalleled in the previous history of Babylonia. The persecutions were carried out by a concerted campaign of slaughter and murder which aimed at the total extinction of the Jews.</p>
<p>Mar bar Rav Ashi was the greatest of the later &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; and his contemporaries were fully aware of his importance so that his opinions were law. Nevertheless he was unable to restore the academy in Sura to its former importance. He continued the work of his father in the compilation of the Talmud. He also gathered all the legal rulings of his father and cleared up some obscure points in his father&#x2019;s teachings. Beyond this very little is known of him. Because of the troubles of that time there is no record of the accomplishments of a whole series of important scholars who lived then.</p>
<p>The Jews suffered particularly at that time from the hand of king Yezdigerd (Harmizdas) the Third who was a very evil person and bore a special hatred to the Jews. His first step was to prohibit the observance of the Sabbath. At the same time he shut down the academies.</p>
<p>There are various legends which purport to explain the reasons which caused this sudden wrath of the Persian kings against the Jews who had always been loyal and true to them. The true reason is simply religious fanaticism. Since the Persian priests had a strong desire to convert the Jews to their faith, they sought every opportunity for religious debates; in these contests the Jews did not spare the religious beliefs of the Persians and insulted them together with their idols. The priests were terribly enraged and began to persecute the Jews as enemies of their faith.</p>
<p>In one such debate between a Persian priest and the head of the academy of Nehardea, Amemar, the priest was determined to prove that the universe was ruled by two divinities, Ormuzd, who was the god of light and life, and Ahriman who was the god of darkness and destruction. Seeing that Amemar would not be convinced, he tried to argue on the analogy of the human body, the upper half of which belonged to Ormuzd because it is the seat of the understanding and all good sensations, and the lower half belonged to Ahriman, because the beastly part lies there. Amemar answered that the analogy with the human body would not hold, because a god like Ahriman should not have allowed the whole of human filth to be borne through the canals of his kingdom. Amemar said further that in the universe too there was no boundary between good and evil for they were both derived from the same God. <sup><xref rid="fn755">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we said the first law of king Yezdigerd III against the Jews forbade the observance of the Sabbath. Whoever refused to profane the Sabbath had to pay with his life. There is no report, however, of the measures the Jews took to avoid this law, or how many Jews were killed for disobedience. The law did not last long because the king was killed after ruling one year, and his two sons, one named Hodor Varda and the other Piruz, could not agree about the: succession to the throne. They fought each other for a year and had no time to cause trouble for the Jews.</p>
<p>Concerning the death of king Yezdigerd the chronicles tell us merely that he was slain. Rav Shrira Gaon says in his Chronicle: &#x201C;We have heard elders relate what is also written in the chronicles that the Jews prayed God to have mercy upon them, and a snake came and killed king Yezdigerd in his bedroom and the hostile laws fell into discard.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After a year of fighting over the Persian throne king Piruz (Pherases) took his father&#x2019;s place and ruled about thirty years. The situation of the Jews in Babylonia went from bad to worse. Yezdigerd III occasionally had a Jew killed for refusing to profane the Sabbath, but his son Piruz had Jews killed as a sport. The mere existence of a Jew so enraged the king and his soldiers that they felt forced to kill him.</p>
<p>It was alleged that the cause of these murders was that Jews had killed two Persian priests and skinned them, and this caused the king to take revenge on all the Jews in the borders of his kingdom. He therefore ordered the slaughter of half the Jews in Ispahan. Then he ordered all the children of the Jews to be taken away from their parents and educated in the Persian faith.</p>
<p>One of the first Jews to be slain at the time was Huna Mari bar Mar Zutra. The king had demanded that he get a large sum of money from the Jews and bring it to him. The Exilarch refused and gave up his life. The king demanded that two other scholars, Amemar bar Yanka and M&#x2019;sharshia bar P&#x2019;kud, publicly declare that the Jewish Sabbath was abrogated. When they refused he put them in jail and later killed them. This happened in the year 471 C. E. Later the persecution grew worse and around 473 C. E. all the schools in Babylonia were ruined; the cities of Sura, Pumbeditha and Nehardea were burned, there was no Jewish court and all Jewish children under the age of ten had been taken from their parents and sent to be educated in the Persian faith.</p>
<p>In his malevolence against the Jews king Piruz reminds one of the Roman Emperor Hadrian. Like him Piruz wanted to destroy the Jews with their Torah, and just as the Talmud always adds the expression &#x201C;may his bones be crushed&#x201D; to the name of Hadrian, so to the name of Piruz there is always added the title <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E8;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05E2;&#x05D0;&#x05F4;</span> (the wicked). <sup><xref rid="fn756">2)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Ravina, the Final Compiler of the Babylonian Talmud</title>
<p>A<small>FTER THE DEATH OF KING</small> P<small>IRUZ</small> (495 C.E.) the persecutions against the Jews ceased for a while, and normal times such as Babylonia had enjoyed previously returned. The academies were reopened in Sura and Pumbeditha. The heads of these two rebuilt academies were appointed. The head of Sura was Ravina (Rav Avina) and a certain Rav Joseph, of whom very little is known, was chosen head of Pumbeditha.</p>
<p>We must note that a generation later there was another Ravina who was a brother&#x2019;s son to this Ravina, who was active as an &#x201C;Amora&#x201D;, and according to the &#x201C;Chronicle of Rav Shrira Gaon&#x201D; his name was Rav Avina the son of Rav Huna. This Ravina was a student of his uncle and in order to make a distinction between them the scholars called him &#x201C;Ravina the younger&#x201D;.</p>
<p>It seems that Ravina was head of the academy in Sura not more than one year, from 499 to 500 C. E. In those days the Babylonian &#x201C;Amoriam&#x201D; saw only one purpose for their work and this was to finish the great work begun by Rav Ashi in compiling the Talmud. The contemporary persecutions were the cause for the decrease in the numbers of the students and the decline of the influence of the Torah upon the life of the Jews. In Palestine there had long ceased to be any academies and in Babylonia evil monarchs sought to bring about the same condition in their own land. The &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; understood that in order to save the spiritual treasures of the Jewish people, created by its scholars in the course of so many centuries they would have to hasten the completion of the Talmud which Rav Ashi had begun.</p>
<p>Rav Ashi and Ravina were the last to leave their stamp upon the development of the Jewish law. <sup><xref rid="fn757">1)</xref></sup> With these two the work of the &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; in Babylonia was finished. There were, to be sure, still two generations of Amoraim but these were simply people who had no original contribution to make to the development of the law and simply echoed the teachings of their predecessors.</p>
<p>When Ravina is mentioned he is usually coupled as a second after Rav Ashi, even though it seems that Ravina was the older of the two. He outlived Rav Ashi by a long time. Like all the scholars of his time he was considered a student under Rav Ashi, and he would listen to Rav Ashi&#x2019;s words without ever contradicting him. <sup><xref rid="fn758">2)</xref></sup> It should therefore be mentioned that Rav Ashi treated Ravina not like a student but like a colleague and friend. <sup><xref rid="fn759">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He was born in Matha Mechasia near Sura and was an owner of fields and forests, and even though the time was one in which a person could easily grow rich from speculation, it was said of Ravina that he renounced any sort of profit that was not in harmony with his religious and moral principles. As an outstanding student of Rav, Ravina would often go from Matha Mechasia to Mechoza where Rava had his academy to listen to Rava&#x2019;s interpretation of the Torah, or to ask some question concerning a matter of law. Ravina grew in learning before the eyes of Rava. And when the people of Mechoza once addressed an inquiry to Ravina, Rava permitted him to instruct them and to answer their questions according to his understanding. He did not wish to do this in Mechoza, however, for Rava was active there. Not being the head of any academy at the time he would travel through the large cities of Babylonia and wherever he would stop, he would set up the tent of the Torah and he would teach there even while Rava was still alive. There are therefore laws which are quoted in the names of both Rava and Ravina. <sup><xref rid="fn760">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ravina would study day and night. The verses of the Bible served him as foundations of the law. Sacred and not to be tampered with was the text of the Mishnah for him. It was only with a Boraitha or a saying of some &#x201C;Amora&#x201D; that he would permit himself to make an emendation, even if it changed the meaning of the quotation. <sup><xref rid="fn761">5)</xref></sup> On another occasion he said: &#x201C;since the beginning of that Boraitha contradicts the end, it is clear that there is a mistake somewhere and it has not been quoted in the form which it had the first time the teacher said it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn762">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ravina always tried to make the commandments easier to observe, whenever possible. He believed that the dignity of man was more important than the dignity of the commandments. <sup><xref rid="fn763">7)</xref></sup> And the law almost always followed Ravina&#x2019;s decision. <sup><xref rid="fn764">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Justice is the main thread in all of Ravina&#x2019;s work, and the people called him &#x201C;the Just.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn765">9)</xref></sup> Like a righteous man he was active in charitable works and begged money from the rich to care for the needs of the poor. Rich ladies used to take off their jewelry and give it to him for the poor. <sup><xref rid="fn766">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the time that Rav Ashi was head of the academy at Matha Mechasia near Sura, prominent Babylonian Jews approached him with the idea that the time was ripe for the Babylonian Jews to set up a &#x201C;Babylonian Talmud&#x201D; just as the Palestinian Jews in a similar time had set up the &#x201C;Jerusalem Talmud.&#x201D; The government, they argued, was no longer as favorable to the Jews as formerly, study was suppressed and almost entirely prohibited. The behavior of the last two kings towards the Jews had proved how little the favors of monarchs could be depended upon, and how uncertain was Jewish existence. There was a danger therefore that if everything was not written down that had been created by the scholars after Rabbi Judah Hanasi, the learning of the Jews might be forgotten. They desired to collate everything that had been said since the edition of the Mishnah, to select and arrange it critically. All the scholars proposed to Rav Ashi the inclusion of their own words or of what they had had from their teachers and whatever met the approval of Rav Ashi was included in the canon of the &#x201C;Gemara&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Of the scholars who assisted Rav Ashi in his work, there is first of all Ravina, and besides him the following scholars: Rav Acha bar Rava, Rav Mordecai, Rav Hillel, Rav Acha bar Ivia, Rava Mibarnish, Rav Yemar, Rav G&#x2019;vihah from Bei K&#x2019;sil, Rabah Zuti, Rav Asi and Rav Aba from Palestine who told Rav Ashi all the customs of Palestine in the observance of the law. <sup><xref rid="fn767">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It should be noted that the Palestinian scholars who came to Babylonia at the time were of great assistance in the collation of the &#x201C;Babylonian Talmud&#x201D;, contributing the finest and the best that was in the &#x201C;Jerusalem Talmud&#x201D;. Just as the &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; of Palestine had formerly included the sayings of the Babylonian scholars in their Talmud, so the Babylonians now included the wisdom of Palestine.</p>
<p>There was no system of arranging the sayings in the Talmud of Jerusalem. The Babylonian Jews, living in relatively secure circumstances, had a better chance to assemble, to debate and agree on the order of the work. Because of the unceasing persecutions, the Palestinian scholars never had the chance to arrange their Talmud patiently as it should have been arranged. Therefore the &#x201C;Jerusalem Talmud&#x201D; remained a fragmentary thing unsuited to be a &#x201C;national work,&#x201D; for much of it certainly was lost and the lost portion may have been the finest and the best. Only a small part of the Jerusalem Talmud was saved from oblivion by those Palestinian scholars who succeeded in escaping to Babylonia. It is therefore a great merit of those scholars who edited the Babylonian Talmud that they gave us all the conjectures in law that were in the Jerusalem Talmud. Further we must make note that a great part of the Babylonian Talmud, even a majority of the sayings included, came from Palestinian scholars.</p>
<p>It may be assumed also that the Jerusalem Talmud was well known in Babylonia and everything in it which fell in with the Babylonian laws was included in the Babylonian Talmud. Thus the Jew and the Talmud are a twin birth, and even if certain periods of Jewish history spent less time in the study of the Talmud, its ruling spirit was inherited by every period of Jewish history and strongly influenced their character. Various historical causes brought it about that the Babylonian Talmud and not the Jerusalem Talmud became the unchallenged ruler of Jewish life, and formed its every detail so that anyone who wanted to renounce it, renounced God&#x2019;s covenant with His people.</p>
