Version Notes,
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.1","A<small>NY TREATISE ON THE</small> A<small>MORAIM</small> must begin with the Amoraim of Palestine who were the direct heirs of the Tanaim and the last link in the long chain of the development of the oral law which stretched from the days of the Men of the Great Synagogue down to their time. <sup>*)</sup><i class=""footnote"">*) For a better enlightment of the subject, we have to repeat that a teacher of the ""Mishna"" was called ""Tana"" (plural: ""Tanaim"") and a teacher of the ""Gemara"" was called ""Amora"" (plural: ""Amoraim"").</i> The Amoraim of Babylonia, on the other hand, marked the beginning of a new historical epoch for the Jews of that country which continued for centuries after the spark of spiritual life expired in Palestine."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.2","With the completion of the Mishna, whose authority was recognized both in Palestine and in Babylonia, the Jewish law assumed its final form. In both countries the Mishna was recognized as the deciding factor in all problems of life, but the subsequent development of the laws followed different lines in each country. None, however dared to question the interpretations of the Tanaim even when these concerned Biblical verses which had no direct relationship to religious problems."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.3","When we consider the teachings of the Tanaim and Amoraim it becomes obvious, that they sought to establish a worthy continuation to the teachings of the prophets, who aimed to elevate the ethics of the Jews to the highest possible level. They therefore interpreted the commandments of the Torah in such a manner as to inculcate the people with feelings of justice, love of peace and love of one's neighbor. This aim caused some of the scholars to believe that study of the Torah and the fulfillment of its commandments was most important in life even though one did not agree with the commandments. Others said that after the coming of Messiah all commandments would be done with and there would no longer be any need for written laws. <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) נדה ס""א ב׳, מדרש תהלים פּרשה נ""ו.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.4","There is a Midrash extant which declares that those Jews who had left Egypt and wandered in the desert belonged to a ""generation of knowledge,"" because they possessed a measure of civilization and not, as might be assumed, they were untutored slaves who had just acquired freedom. Many critics ironically nod their heads at sight of this Midrash, but on closer observation of the commandments of the Torah it becomes obvious that those Jews possessed a high measure of culture."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.5","Like other civilized peoples of that time, the Jews understood the art of cloth making while still in Egypt. Even if we assume that their garments were not made of the finest stuffs, skill was nevertheless required to weave the linen of which their garments were made. They understood the art of agriculture and the various occupations involved in it such as plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, grinding and baking. They also were acquainted with animal husbandry and its attendant occupations. While still in bondage they built houses and cities and they learned to bake bricks out of clay. Woodwork, masonry, metal work, wine making and hunting were also not strange to them. They knew how to find water in the depths of the earth and how to maintain fires. They made decorations out of precious metals and they pressed oil out of olives."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.6","In their social relationships they maintained a civilized system of order which included representatives and judges, policemen and arrests. They understood how to divide time into weeks, months and years. In commerce they used money as is obvious from the stories of Abraham's purchase of the cave of Machpelah and of Jacob's purchase of a tract of land from the sons of Chamor for which he paid 100 Kesitah. In general we may say that the people of that time possessed a high level of intelligence and that the Jews were not behind the times. When other nations were governed by laws we may assume that the Jews did not live in lawlessness."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.7","In the case of some commandments the Torah merely added legal sanction to customs which were already practiced. Thus Rashbam (Samuel ben Meir, the grandson of Rashi) states in his interpretation to the Torah that rules governing robbery, sexual relations, covetousness, courts and hospitality were accepted among the Jews even before the Torah was granted. In this case the Torah merely strengthened the accepted conduct and insured the observance of these laws in the future."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.8","All the civilized peoples of that time, including the Jews of the period preceding the granting of the Torah, were called the ""sons of Noah."" As such they only had to observe seven commandments, namely, to deal out justice, not to desecrate the name of God, not to worship idols, not to commit adultery, not to commit murder, not to rob and not to eat flesh that was cut from a living animal. Some maintain that the prohibitions against consuming the blood of a living animal, castration, witchcraft, mating different breeds of animals and planting mixed seeds were included in the above mentioned seven commandments. <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) סנהדרין נ""ו ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.9","The Talmud declares that even Adam was commanded to obey these commandments with the exception of the one concerning eating the flesh of a living animal, since the consumption of meat was altogether prohibited until the deluge. Others said that the ""sons of Noah"" had thirty commandments to observe. <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) חולין צ""ב א׳.</span></i> But these probably included many observances which were derived from the original seven commandments. It is quite understandable, that in order to conduct trials it was necessary to know which people to select as judges. Likewise, in the matter of adultery, regulations had to be established defining which women were forbidden. The concept of robbery also required definition since borrowing money and not repaying it and not paying the wage of a laborer were then considered to be robbery."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.10","The offering of sacrifices from animals, fowl and fruit was customary since time immemorial. Cain offered a sacrifice from the fruit of his fields and Abel offered his best sheep. After the deluge Noah erected an altar and offered sacrifices. Abraham and Jacob likewise erected altars for the offering of sacrifices. When Moses asked Pharaoh to release the Jews, he said that they had to go to the desert to offer sacrifices to God. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon declared that since sacrifices and circumcision preceded the establishment of the Sabbath, both of them superseded the Sabbath. During the later development of divine service, which at that time consisted of sacrificial offerings, the belief became accepted among many peoples that ordinary men could not fulfill this task since they were not acquainted with all the regulations governing the offerings. This caused the establishment of a separate group of people who devoted themselves solely to sacrifices and who abstained from ordinary labor. For the support of these people tithes were offered by all. Thus we find Abraham giving tithes to Malchi-Zedek, who was a priest of ""the highest God""; Jacob vowed to tithe all his possessions if God would bless his journey and would provide him with bread and garments."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.11","The first born son at first performed the divine service. This procedure was also accepted among the Jews until the tabernacle was built. Later the performance of this office was taken out of the hands of the first born and was entrusted to the descendants of Aaron. Further development necessitated the establishment of a class of assistants to the descendants of Aaron and the Levites were added to the service. The priests performed the offering of sacrifices and they received the first fruit, the first born animals and similar gifts. The Levites who worked in the tabernacle were granted tithes, one-tenth of everyone's income. Of this the Levites had to give one-tenth to the priests. But the rights of the first born were preserved in the government of the family as a representative of the father. The first born also received a double share in the inheritance. If a man had children by two wives one of whom he loved and the other he hated and the first born was a son of the despised wife, the father nevertheless had to recognize the rights of this son to a double share in the inheritance. The custom of the priests blessing the people is very ancient. The first priest to do so was Malchi-Zedek who blessed Abraham. Thus it is also related that Aaron blessed the children of Israel even before the Torah explicitly commanded him to do so."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.12","Even before the deluge Noah could differentiate between animals that were considered as clean and between those that were considered to be unclean. The Talmud questions this and the answer was given that when all the animals sought safety in the ark it admitted only one pair from some kinds of animals and seven pairs from other kinds. By this token it was known which were the clean and which the unclean animals. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) סנהדרין ק""ח ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.13","Soon after man began to develop family life he recognized his near relatives as part of himself. When rights of property were established he enacted laws to secure his possessions for his relations and he likewise made certain that after his death his possessions would remain within the family. In this manner laws of inheritance were established. Abraham complained to God and said: ""Since you gave me no offspring, the manager of my house will inherit me."" Jews also practiced the same custom that was accepted among other peoples in denying a daughter a share in the inheritance. Every father gave his daughter her share as a dowry at the time that she was married. Since daughters could marry men of other tribes, they could not share in the inheritance of their fathers in order that the possessions of one tribe should not pass to another tribe."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.14","Long before the Torah was granted, the descendants of Abraham observed the commandment of circumcision. It may even be assumed that the descendants of Ishmael and the sons of Keturah observed this commandment with greater strictness than did the Jews who did not practice circumcision for forty years while in the desert."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.15",Among other civilized concepts man also learned to observe vows and oaths. He understood his duty of abiding by his word whether that concerned himself or others. All of these concepts civilized peoples possessed long before the Torah was given. The patriarch Abraham swore to Abimelech not to harm him or his descendants. Jacob vowed and later swore to Laban not to trespass his boundaries with evil intent.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.16","The slaughter of animals for food was always considered to be a natural procedure and was practiced from time immemorial. It may also be assumed that such slaughter was always done by cutting the throat of the animal. This form was probably adopted as a reaction against the savage method of beasts of prey which break the necks of their victims. Since the commandments of the Torah aim to refine the people and are based on mercy, it was strictly forbidden to cause unnecessary suffering to any living creature. <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) שבת קכ""ה ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.17","Since ancient times man recognized the concepts of purity and impurity. As soon as man could esthetically comprehend the concept of cleanliness, he avoided coming in contact with things that were unclean. It was then believed that evil spirits inhabited the unclean objects and that they would gain control of the clean body which touched the impure one. Thus Jacob commanded his household when he left Shechem and said: ""Cast out the strange idols from your midst, clean yourself and don other garments."" People likewise avoided coming in contact with a woman in the days of her separation, with unclean animals or insects."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.18","Bathing in water was the accepted mode of purification. In this manner all impurity was washed away. Before giving the Torah, God commanded the people to consecrate themselves and to wash their garments. This was also the reason why a proselyte had to immerse himself in water and even though he was circumcised, he was not accepted as a proselyte until after immersion. Menstruating women were also required to bathe before being considered pure. This appears to have been an ancient custom observed by all civilized peoples."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.19","There is no doubt that all of these commandments later evolved into numerous supplementary observances. With the development of society punishments were determined for infractions of these commandments. But no matter how much the scholars wanted that the commandments of the Torah should be observed, they nevertheless warned against observing a commandment at the expense of committing a sin, as in the case of obtaining an object illegally in order to do some good deed with it. <sup>6)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">6) ברכות מ""ז ב׳, סוכה ל׳ א׳, בבא קמא צ""ד א׳.</span></i> But in some exceptional instances the ignoring of one commandment could aid in the fulfillment of another as when study of the Torah was interrupted in order to perform some philanthropic deed. <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) מנחות צ""ט ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.20","Ordinarily there was no prohibition which could not be broken in order to save a life with the exception of committing murder, worshipping idols or committing a sexual offense in order to save one's life. <sup>8)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">8) יומא פּ""ב א׳.</span></i> These three sins were considered to be so great that even if one's life depended on one of them it was forbidden to employ them. <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) פּסחים כ""ה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.21","Observance of the Sabbath was treated differently. Even though it was also considered to be very important and one who desecrated the Sabbath was to be punished by death, it was nevertheless accepted that the Sabbath could be desecrated in order to aid one whose life was in danger. <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) יומא פּ""ג א׳.</span></i> The Tana Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia thus said that ""the Sabbath was given to the people and not the people to the Sabbath."" <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) מכילתא מסכתא דשבתא פּיסקא י""ד.</span></i> In order to save the life of a person Rabbi Nathan said that ""it is permissible to desecrate one Sabbath in order that he may observe many Sabbaths to come."" <sup>12)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">12) מכילתא כי תשא פּיסקא מ""ז.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.22","The Talmud declares that the basic purpose of religious regulations was to enable people to live and not to kill them. <sup>13)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">13) סנהדרין ע""ד א׳.</span></i> It likewise states that he who destroys one Jewish soul is like one who destroyed a whole world and he who maintains one Jewish person alive is like one who saved a whole world. <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) סנהדרין ל""ז א׳</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.23","People were forbidden by the scholars to harm themselves even as they were forbidden to harm others. <sup>15)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15) בבא קמא צ""א ב׳.</span></i> When the Torah said that fruit trees should not be cut down during the siege of a city, the scholars added that one may not cut down a fruit tree even in his own garden and he who did so was to be punished. <sup>16)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">16) מכות כ""ב א׳, ספרי דברים פּיסקא כ""ג.</span></i> On other occasions the scholars said that endangering one's life was worse than committing a sin. <sup>17)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">17) חולין ו׳ א׳, תענית י""א א׳, ויקרא רבה ל""ב ג׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.24","The Talmud further declares that the Torah was concerned with the honor of the people. In its eyes the worth of man was so great that one could sometimes overlook a commandment because of it. <sup>18)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">18) ברכות י""ט ב׳, שבת כ""א ב׳, ערובין מ""א ב׳, מנחות ל""ז ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.25","Thieves were usually enslaved after they were forced to pay twice the price of the stolen goods. If a living animal was stolen, the thief had to pay four or five times its value. At times thieves were also sentenced to death or to be flogged. The death sentence was imposed by the Torah for stealing a human being and selling him into slavery. Nevertheless the Torah showed consideration even for the thief and the scholars declared that the reason why a thief had to pay five times the value of a stolen ox and only four times the value of a stolen sheep was that an ox can be led easily but a sheep has to be carried and this accounted for the easier punishment for one stealing a sheep. <sup>19)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">19) בבא קמא ע""ט ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.26","Other punishments, aside from death and flogging, were meted out to offenders against God or man. Prisons then existed and when one was flogged for an offense and he later committed a similar offense he was imprisoned. <sup>20)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">20) סנהדרין פּ""א ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.27","Self-inflicted torture as a religious ritual was known to man for a long time. The forms of this torture were numerous. Some renounced food and drink while others avoided pride. The drinking of wine was considered to be a luxury and he who wanted to deny himself pleasure for the greater glory of God renounced the drinking of wine. Shaving one's head or letting one's hair grow wild was at various times considered to be a means against pride. The scholars differed in their evaluation of these forms of self-torment. Some praised them while others condemned them as sinful. <sup>21)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">21) תענית י""א א׳, סוטה ט""ו א׳, כריתות כ""ו א׳.</span></i> The majority of the scholars agreed with the opinion of Rabbi Jose that one should not torment himself with too many fasts. <sup>22)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">22) תענית כ""ב ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.28","The custom of mourning for dead relatives, as it is accepted in the form of a Biblical commandment, was a subject often questioned by the scholars. From the story of Joseph they deducted that mourning should last seven days. Others reached the same conclusion from the verse ""I shall turn your feast days into mourning"" and they said that even as each holiday lasts seven days so also must mourning last for seven days. There were also differing opinions among the scholars whether mourning was a Biblical commandment or whether it was instituted by the Rabbis. The Jerusalem Talmud declares that ""Moses instituted for the Jews seven days of mourning and seven days of merry making."" <sup>23)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">23) כתובות פּרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.29","For seven centuries from the time of Simon the Just till the last Amora, Greek, Roman and Persian culture influenced Jewish life, which was so closely joined with it. For that reason we come across ideas which arose at different times under different circumstances and differentiated in their spirit and character. At times it is difficult to discover which event preceded and which followed and to separate fact from legend."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.30","Our ""Spiritual Heroes"" ofttimes rise to great spiritual heights, while at the same time their ideas are rooted not alone in the past but look forward to the future as well. Their roots cleave a path through stem reality to the high ideals of mankind as a whole and emphasize those means which serve as a realization of those ideals."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Introduction.31",It is this Talmudic forest whose trees contain the seed for the plants of future generations. It is also the source from which later law-givers derived their notions as well as being the form for the pursuit of learning in all its branches.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.1","R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HIYA</small> R<small>ABA BAR</small> A<small>BA</small> had two sons, Jehudah and Ezekiah. These at one time incurred the displeasure of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah. As they sat at the table of the Nasi without uttering a word, he commanded his servants that they be served wine to loosen their tongues. His command was obeyed and as the two young men became merry with wine they exclaimed: ""Messiah will not come as long as the two ruling houses in Israel, the house of the Exilarch in Babylonia and the house of the Nasi in Palestine, is not destroyed."" As proof of their statement they quoted a passage from the Bible. In great anger the Nasi replied: ""Will you throw thorns in my eyes?"" <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) סנהדרין ל""ח א׳.</span></i> As a result of this altercation the two young men never received ordination although they were both called ""Amoraim of the West."" <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) בבא בתרא ע""ה א׳.</span></i> The older brother, Jehudah, is sometimes referred to as Rabbi in the Talmud, but this appears to be an error."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.2","The two brothers died in their youth. It was also said that their birth was unusual, and although they were twins, one of them was three months older than the other (!). The older brother was born at the beginning of the seventh month of pregnancy, while the younger one was born at the end of the ninth month. <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) יבמות ס""ה ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.3","Together with their father Rabbi Chiya, the two young men came to Palestine from Babylonia when they were already of age and well versed in learning. It was then said that the learning in Palestine was in a decline and that Rabbi Chiya and his sons re-established it in the minds of the people. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) סוכה כ׳ א׳.</span></i> It was also related that as long as they lived it was not necessary to thresh the flax in the country and because of their merit the wine never turned sour. <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) חולין פּ""ו א׳, ירושלמי מעשר שני פּרק ה׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> When the land was affected by a drought, the Nasi declared a fast day and he commanded Rabbi Chiya and his sons to pray for rain out of conviction that God would not refuse their prayer. <sup>6)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">6) בבא מציעא פּ""ה ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.4","After the death of their father the two sons engaged in tilling the soil, <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) ביצה ט׳ ב׳.</span></i> and being so far removed from the academy, they once expressed concern lest their father be troubled in his grave at their neglect of their studies. <sup>8)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">8) ברכות י""ח ב׳.</span></i> This conversation is not entirely clear for, although they were not ordained, they were both known as prominent scholars. Jehudah's name is often mentioned in the Talmud in connection with various legal matters. Ezekiah was mentioned even more frequently and it appears that he compiled a collection of ""Boraithoth."" His opinions are quoted in the Babylonian Talmud with the introducing words ""we have learned in the house of Ezekiah"" and in the Jerusalem Talmud they are prefaced by the words ""Ezekiah taught."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.5","Jehudah, the older brother, was a son-in-law of Rabbi Jannai Raba and he died during the lifetime of his father-in-law. Jehudah was in the habit of spending his days in the academy and of returning home only at nightfall. When he once failed to appear at the usual time, Rabbi Jannai ordered his bed to be covered believing him to have died. <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) כתובות ס""ב ב׳.</span></i> The reverence with which Rabbi Jannai regarded his son-in-law may be gauged from the following story which is told of their relations. Jehudah always visited his father-in-law each Friday and Rabbi Jannai would seat himself on the top of a high mountain to observe the approach of his son-in-law. As soon as he would see him coming in the distance he would rise out of respect. His disciples asked him for the meaning of his action and explained that his son-in-law equalled Mount Sinai in sanctity and that none was allowed to sit down in front of Sinai. <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) ירושלמי בכורים פּרק ג׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.6","Jehudah's statements on various problems can best be understood when one considers the events of that time and the persecution at the hands of the Romans to which the Jews were subjected when their rights were denied, the academies were destroyed and unbearable taxes were imposed upon them. These persecutions were believed to be a punishment for the sins of man. When many people repented their sins, but the persecutions continued, Jehudah said: ""Repentance avails against half of the punishment while prayer may undo all of it."" <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) ויקרא רבה פּרשה י׳ פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i> To this he often added that ""the suffering of exile brings forgiveness for the second half of the sins, so that one should not suffer in the world to come."" <sup>12)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">12) סנהדרין ל""ז ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.7","Because of the numerous afflictions it was at that time customary for a congregation to request one of its members to pray to God for deliverance, but when no aid was in sight many lost their faith. It was then that Jehudah declared that a ""scholar who devotes himself to learning despite his needs, his prayers will surely avail."" <sup>13)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">13) סוטה מ""ט א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.8","Like most of his contemporaries Jehudah highly praised the worth of the Torah and compared it to a healing balm which cures all diseases unlike ordinary cures each of which is effective only for one limb. <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) ערובין נ""ד א׳.</span></i> Ezekiah expressed a similar sentiment when he said of the Torah that ""its words are a crown for one's head, an adornment for one's neck, a joy for one's heart, salve for one's eyes and balsam for one's wounds."" <sup>15)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15) ויקרא רבה פּרשה י""ב פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.9",The following are the most characteristic statements of Ezekiah:
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.10","""Most important of all is peace. All the commandments a man must observe if they are at hand. When one meets with a situation, he must act in a certain manner, but if he does not meet with it, he is absolved. But where peace is concerned one must go out of his way to seek for it. The value of peace is so great that the Bible refers to all the wanderings of the children of Israel in the desert in the plural (<span dir=""rtl"">ויסעו ויחנו</span>) because they travelled in discord and they rested in discord, but when they reached Mount Sinai the singular is used (<span dir=""rtl"">ויחן ישראל</span>) for then they were at peace and united in one wish; it was then that God said: 'Now the time has come that I should give the Torah to my children.' "" <sup>16)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">16) ויקרא רבה פּרשה ט׳ פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.11","""Well did the prophets do when they described the power of God by comparing the creation to the Creator. Thus they compared the voice of God to the roar of a lion or to the sound of mighty waters, for the human ear can conceive only that which it can hear. Man should likewise be shown only that which he can see."" <sup>17)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">17) מדרש שוחר טוב פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.12","""He who would add to what he had heard in order to strengthen its impression only succeeds in detracting from it. Thus God commanded not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, but when Eve spoke to the serpent she added that He had also commanded not to touch the tree. The serpent then pushed Eve until she touched the tree and seeing that she had not died the serpent said: 'Touching the tree has caused you no harm, neither will you suffer any harm by eating of its fruit.' "" <sup>18)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">18) סנהדרין כ""ט א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.13","After the Jews had made the golden calf, Moses prayed to God to forgive their sin and he reminded Him of His promise to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to increase their offspring like the stars in the sky. Ezekiah formulated the prayer of Moses in the following words: ""Had You sworn by heaven and earth, You could break your oath for heaven and earth may be done away with and You would be free of your oath. But since You swore by Your own name and You are eternal, Your oath is therefore eternal and You must forgive them."" <sup>19)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">19) שמות רבה פּרשה מ""ד פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.14","We do not know where Jehudah lived, but mention is made that Ezekiah resided in Tiberias. <sup>20)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">20) מגלה ה׳ ב׳.</span></i> Although Ezekiah was not ordained, he had prominent disciples among whom was Rabbi Jochanan.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya.15","Both brothers died about the same time and they were buried near their father Rabbi Chiya.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.1","S<small>OME OF OUR ENLIGHTENED PEOPLE</small> are of the opinion that while death and destruction raged in Palestine the scholars of that country secluded themselves within the walls of the synagogues and debated irrelevant religious problems. Such a view is highly superficial. In between wars and aside from the Talmudic discussions the people pursued their normal occupations. They sowed their fields, they engaged in various trades and they developed a highly complex Jewish cultural life."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.2","There are but few sources of information concerning the mode of life of that time. The Talmud is the most trustworthy of these, although it was written much later when many of the previous customs were nearly forgotten. In addition to the Talmud there are less faithful descriptions in the writings of Josephus Flavius, the geographer Strabo and the naturalist Pliny."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.3",During all these centuries the overwhelming majority of the Jews were agriculturists. These tillers of the soil were but little affected by the numerous incursions of the Romans. In the worst cases their cattle and produce were robbed but the farmers and their families were not molested. Even when the Romans were determined to destroy Judaism they understood that the farming population was the foundation of the productive forces in the country and should be spared. It is therefore certain that even when many Jews were exiled from the country the farmers were left to till their fields.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.4","It must also be borne in mind that the Jewish farmer of that time was religious more than he was patriotic. As long as the Romans did not interfere with his offering of sacrifices he was satisfied and probably indifferent whether he paid his taxes to the Jerusalem aristocrats, who looked down upon him, or whether the taxes were collected by the Romans."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.5","When the Hasmoneans ruled Palestine they acquired a number of seaports but the merchants and sailors of these cities were largely Phoenicians. Jews were then in the initial stages of learning the arts of commerce and navigation and their share in these occupations was negligible. Even the Jews of Galilee who were close neighbors of the Phoenicians excelled in agriculture and fruit growing rather than in commerce and Josephus described their land as ""covered with fields of grain and resembling a large garden."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.6","The Bible described Palestine as a land of milk and honey but this blessing was not always realized. The Biblical curse that the heavens shall be like copper over their heads and the earth shall be like iron under their feet often approached nearer the truth when periods of drought affected the land. Nevertheless the tillers of the soil always managed to secure their bread despite the fact that the country was rocky and sandy to a large degree. The Jews loved their land and each one was convinced that it was the most beautiful in the world. They learned to improve the soil and to fertilize it artificially, to clear it of stones and to destroy obnoxious weeds. The fields were surrounded with cactus fences to prevent the cattle from trampling them and those that were located on steep hills were terraced. Every handbreadth of land was utilized and there were no more diligent workers than the farmers of Palestine. Agriculture was highly regarded by all and was especially revered by the Romans. Whereas in other lands the Romans encountered difficulties in persuading the people to till the soil, Palestine farmers were happy if they were left to pursue that labor."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.7","The fertility of the soil of Palestine varied in different regions of the country. Jericho and its environs was praised by the writers of all times as ""the city of dates."" Other districts excelled in wheat growing. It was said that the grain growing about the city of Ophroim attained such height that it provided sufficient straw for the needs of the whole country. The wheat of Galilee was also famous for its quality and some said that it excelled even the wheat of Judea. Rye, oats, barley, sorghum and other grains grew in abundance. Bread made out of barley meal was considered to be the staple article of food of the poorer elements. There was a great abundance of this meal and considerable quantities of it were exported to other countries from which rice was introduced and sowed in Palestine."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.8","In ordinary years the grain crop was between five and ten fold that which was sown, but in years when the rains descended in time and the sun did not scorch the germinating seed the crop reached as much as a hundred fold. In years of bumper crops Palestine exported grain, but during lean years grain had to be imported from Egypt. Palestine abounded in all kinds of greens and vegetables such as cabbage, cucumbers, onions, garlic, radishes and various beans. In time new vegetables which had not grown there previously were introduced into the country. These different kinds of vegetables were avidly consumed. Due to the stringent regulations governing the offering of sacrifices people often abstained from eating meat and indulged in it only on Sabbaths and holidays or other festive occasions. After the destruction of the temple, when the offering of sacrifices was done away with, many people gave up meat altogether as an item in their diet."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.9","Many varieties of fruit trees thrived in Palestine including figs, grapes, olives, carobs, oranges, ethrogim, plums, cherries, walnuts, almonds, dates, mulberries, pomegranates, apples and pears. In addition to these, new improved varieties were introduced and cultivated. Palestine was especially renowned for its wine, dates and wheat. The coins that were minted by the Hasmoneans bear ears of wheat, bunches of grapes and date palms as symbols of the fertility of the land. The vineyards of Judea were considered the most beautiful in that part of the world. Between the rows of trees and vines flowers were planted which filled the air with their fragrance. Raisins and date honey were commonly used as food. Oil, which was plentiful, was exported in great quantities, and just as Judea was renowned for its wine Galilee was famous for the quality of its oil. The oil was used as food and also for medicinal purposes and it was widely sold in Sidon, Syria and Egypt."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.10","Pliny, the Roman ""Natural-philosopher,"" declared that Judea was famous for its dates just as Egypt was known for its incense. In the Talmud we find a story told by Rabbi Jacob ben Dostai that on his way from Lud to Ono, a distance of three miles, he waded ankle deep in fig honey. <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) כתובות קי""א ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.11",The shores of the Dead Sea were covered with balsam and the districts of Gilead and Jericho were especially noted for it. Balsam was used as a medicine and also as incense. It was a very expensive commodity and the Romans declared that the Jews did not plant it elsewhere in order to maintain its rarity and to be able to sell it for a high price. After the destruction of the temple the Romans said that the Jews uprooted all the balsam trees in revenge on the Romans.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.12","Sheep and cattle abounded in the land as a result of the need for sacrifices. There were many Jewish shepherds at that time and some of these also traded in cattle or in wool. This was especially true in the regions east of the Jordan. The women of Judea spun the wool and the women of Galilee spun flax and the garments were sold in the nearby cities. Many of the known varieties of fowl were introduced into the country at a later date. This is obvious from their Hebrew names which were never mentioned in the Bible. Geese, ducks and chickens were among the imported species and although they were not used for sacrificial purposes they were used as food. Many people also raised cattle and goats and considerable quantities of dairy products were consumed and exported."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.13",Although some Jews engaged in hunting animals and birds the number of these was not great due to the numerous laws regarding unclean animals and the restrictions affecting slaughter. But many people engaged in fishing especially in Galilee. The sea of Gennesaret (sea of Galilee) abounded in many of the varieties of the best edible fish and scores of fishing villages dotted its shores. A great part of the catch was also exported.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.14",The Dead Sea occupied a prominent place among the natural resources of the country. Various salts were extracted from its waters (salt of Sodom) as well as asphalt. These were sold far and wide and were used for medical purposes and also in the manufacture of cosmetics. Historical descriptions of Palestine also mentioned metal mines. Iron was mined in the Lebanon mountains and in the region north of Idumea. Josephus Flavius mentioned an iron mountain which extended to the boundary of Moab and in later years this metal was also mined in Trans-Jordania.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.15","The trades and occupations of the Jews of that time are a subject of endless interest. The Talmud is the best historical source on this subject and it lists the following occupations as being most widely engaged in: tailoring, shoemaking, building, quarrying, carpentry, hairdressing, metal working, weaving, dyeing, tapestry-weaving, bee raising, pottery, glass blowing, engraving, tanning, ink and arms manufacturing."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.16","But although all these trades were commonly practiced and Jewish artisans were accorded social recognition, they did not constitute a majority of the population. Farming engaged the efforts of the majority of the nation. This is evident from the fact that the Talmud devoted itself more to the interests of the farmers than it did to the interests of the artisans."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.17","From the available historical data we may conclude that the Jewish artisans could not compete with the artisans of the foreign countries and when vessels or garments of higher quality were desired they had to be imported. This conclusion is also substantiated by the fact that the Talmud refers to all superior vessels or garments by their Greek names. This was also true of vegetables for some time, but as the years went by the superior varieties were cultivated also in Palestine. However there was a common conviction that articles of foreign manufacture were superior in quality and people of means bought their garments and decorated their houses with foreign importations."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.18","Among the farming population the poorer peasants were in a majority. These were referred to in the Talmud as ""Baal Habaith"" and they usually possessed only a small tract of land from which they barely eked out a living. Together with the members of his family such a peasant would work in his field from dawn till sunset. Most of his produce he used for his own household and the remainder, after he paid his taxes and tithes, was marketed in the nearby cities where it was bartered or sold for money. Under such circumstances, the poorer peasants suffered every time a drought occurred or some other calamity overtook the country. He was then forced to hire out as a farm hand or to pawn his land to a richer farmer. But even when no unforseen calamities occurred, the poor peasant often had to become a wage-earner by working for another farmer. The parcelation of the land when it was being divided between the heirs left each of the heirs such a small holding that many were forced to hire out even during normal years. Those who could find no employment were forced to turn to begging or to brigandage."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.19","In Galilee and Judea there existed a small class of rich farmers who owned considerable stretches of land and had a comfortable income. It was these people who loaned money to the poorer peasants and in time increased their holdings by seizing the land in payment of outstanding debts. They were also the merchants in grain and the Talmud refers to them as <span dir=""rtl"">„עתירי נכםין""</span> (men of much property). Although their number was small, they were socially prominent and exerted an influence on the administration of the land. They were generally the officials, the elders and members of the priestly families which accumulated the land of the poor. It is told that they engaged ""Ikonomusin"" (managers) and ""Apitropsim"" (overseers) to supervise the cultivation of their fields and vineyards while the owners remained in the city or travelled about in connection with their business ventures."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.20","Thus the Talmud relates that Rabban Gamliel II, also known as Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh, employed a great number of laborers <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) דמאי פּרק ג׳ משנה א׳.</span></i> and he also leased a part of his lands. <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) בבא מציעא פּרק ח׳ משנה ח׳.</span></i> Such a procedure was engaged in by people who did not live on their land. Rabban Gamliel was presiding officer of the Sanhedrin and had to reside in the city. He administered his lands through the agency on an ""Economos"" or an ""Apitropos."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.21",Hired laborers were engaged for a definite period which may have been as much as a year or as little as a day or half a day but never for more than six years. Among the laborers there were men who owned small plots of land as well as those who owned no land at all. Those unskilled in agricultural work hired out as common laborers and engaged in the most difficult work.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.22","The scholars always sided with the laborers when they had complaints against their employers. They also established definite regulations concerning the food and drink to which the laborers were entitled, and although it is possible that most of these rules defining the rights of the workers remained theoretical, it is nevertheless certain that the social differentiation between poor and rich was not as sharp among the Jews as it was among the other nations of that time. The persecution at the hands of the Gentiles to which Jews poor and rich were subject partly accounted for this state of affairs."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.23","Contract farming was also a known phenomenon. A contractor would undertake to cultivate a field and he was responsible for all the operations. He would buy the seed, hire the laborers and work together with them. He was responsible for the payment of the taxes to the government and the tithes to the priests as well as for all other expenditures. In compensation he received half the crop. In addition there were ""Arisim"" (tenants) who received the seed, the tools and the animals required for cultivation from the owner. Tenants supplied only their labor."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.24","Artisans and peasants in Palestine were free men. They could choose their own occupation and when they hired out they were free to leave at any time and the employer was legally bound to pay whatever wage was coming to them for the work which they had accomplished. The condition of the slaves was entirely different. In some respects the slaves were in a better position than the hired laborers but socially they occupied the lowest level. The slave was assured of his food and shelter, but he was not free to choose his occupation and he was dependent on the whims of his owner who could force him to work day and night."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.25","The condition of the Jewish slave was peculiar. It was only on rare occasions that a Jew bought a Jewish slave. When the Gentiles from the surrounding countries brought Jewish slaves to sell, they were ransomed and immediately freed. But there were occasions when a Jew was in debt and he voluntarily sold himself into slavery to be able to repay his debt. Similarly, when a man was caught stealing and he had to pay twice the value of the article stolen, the court would sell him into slavery if he could not pay the required sum. Like the artisan and farm laborer, the Jewish slave sold only his labor power, but he did not have definite working hours and he could be called upon to perform some task at any hour of the day or night. However, he enjoyed the privilege of resting on the Sabbath and the holidays together with his owner."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.26","Because of the preferred treatment which the owner had to accord a Jewish slave there were not many that were anxious to own them, and a statement current at the time declared that ""He who buys a Jewish slave buys an overlord."" But there undoubtedly existed slave owners who did not grant their Jewish slaves any privileges and on the year of the Jubilee the courts had to force them to liberate their Jewish slaves. Human nature did not change much during the centuries and it is apparent that the generations of the time of the Talmud had to contend with the same problem that was recorded by Jeremiah (Ch. 34) that king Zedekiah commanded that all Jewish slaves be liberated and their owners soon enslaved them again."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.27","Jewish slave owners were enjoined to treat their non-Jewish slaves with humaneness. Although the owner could beat his slave at will he was strictly warned not to starve him, and in case the slave was crippled through the loss of an eye or a limb, he was immediately liberated. If a slave died as a result of a beating, the Torah commanded that the owner be put to death; but when the slave survived his punishment by a day or more, the owner was not to be put to death."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.28",Judging from numerous circumstances we may conclude that Jewish slaves felt a greater kinship to their owners than the non-Jewish slaves. They participated actively in the various rebellions against Rome and Josephus relates that during the war which ended with the destruction of the temple Bar Giora proclaimed the liberation of all Jewish slaves as the first step in his mobilization of an army. At the same time the Romans announced that all non-Jewish slaves who would betray their owners would be granted their freedom.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.29","Non-Jewish slaves were brought from the markets of Tyre and Sidon. Their treatment in Palestine could compare favorably with their treatment in other countries. Every slave was branded on the forehead or he was given a cap with a bell on it to wear that he might be recognized. Compared with the treatment of slaves in other lands, these measures were relatively humane."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.30",Slaves were the unrestricted property of their owners. If the owner so desired he could marry a slave to his mother or sister. But the marriage of a slave was of no significance and the owner retained his rights of possession. Children of slaves also belonged to the owner and could be sold at will. All possessions of a slave automatically belonged to his master who also claimed any object found by the slave. In addition the owner could rent the labor power of his slaves to others without consulting the slaves.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.31","The Midrash relates the case of a man who persuaded his neighbor to divorce his wife because of her immoral conduct. When the husband complained that he could not divorce her because he did not have enough money to pay her dowry, the man offered to loan him the necessary sum. After the woman was divorced the creditor married her and enslaved her previous husband for inability to repay his debt. The man thus became the slave of his ex-wife and he was forced to witness her relations with his creditor."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.32","But if the position of the male slave was unenviable, the condition of the women slaves was even worse. In addition to their labor they were held at the disposal of the owner and his sons. It is therefore remarkable that some women were sold by their own parents into such life."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.33",There undoubtedly were many Jews who treated their slaves in a more humane manner. In many homes the slaves were employed in skilled work and were trusted with all confidence. Some of them were tailors or barbers; others were bakers and cooks. In some cases the owners even entrusted the education of their children to the slaves. Among the women slaves there were singers and dancers who entertained their owners and their guests.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.34","The Mishna tells that Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh owned a slave named Tabbai whom he respected greatly and for whom he mourned a long time after his death. Another slave of Rabban Gamliel was called ""father"" and his wife was referred to as ""mother."" It is quite probable that these were not isolated instances and that the lot of the slave of a Jew was better than that of a non-Jewish owner."

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.36","It must be borne in mind that the whole Jewish people was not mourning constantly for the destruction of the temple and the cessation of the sacrifices. It is even related that when Jerusalem was destroyed the people of Betar celebrated the occasion. It is also quite certain that the institution of sacrifices had lost much of its significance in the minds of many leaders and some of them were satisfied that Jabneh had been saved as a cultural center. Others, however, were convinced that the destruction of the temple was temporary and that it would soon be restored even as the first temple was rebuilt a short time after its destruction. This belief found a deep echo in the hearts of large sections of the population who looked upon themselves as people whose house had been burned and who were waiting for the construction of a new house. There is also no definite proof that the institution of sacrifices ceased with the temple and that small groups did not gather secretly to offer sacrifices. It is even possible that they brought their offerings on the site of the demolished altar. The fact that the regulations pertaining to the priests and the tithes were observed for a long time after the destruction is ample proof of the expectations of the people of a rapid restoration."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.37",This was not an impossibility under the political conditions then prevailing. It was quite likely that some emperor would grant permission to rebuild the temple out of respect for the Jews or through the intercession of some influential person who could also pay for the right. But these hopes vanished with the rebellion of Bar Kochba against Hadrian. Over half a million Jews were killed in the uprising and hundreds of thousands of others were sold into slavery. The country was devastated and a temple to Zeus was erected in Jerusalem. Jews were not even allowed to approach the gates of the city.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.38",But this was not the final expulsion from Palestine. Jews continued to reside in other cities and subsequent Roman emperors allowed them to visit Jerusalem on the ninth day of Ab to mourn for the destroyed temple.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.39",Various historical events of that time are described in the Jerusalem as well as in the Babylonian Talmud and also in the Midrash. Most of these descriptions were not clearly understood until a recent date when certain Jewish historians made a careful study of these sources. Whenever the Talmudic descriptions are not in agreement with the facts as they are related by Roman historians it is safer to rely on the Talmudic sources.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.40",That the destruction which followed the conquest of Jerusalem by Titus was not complete was also a result of other factors. Many people did not actively participate in the rebellion and after the war they rearranged their lives to conform with the situation that had been created and they maintained peace with the Romans. But the zealots who participated in the war were branded as bandits after the conflict. Their desparation in the struggle also harmed the interests of the people and hastened the ultimate destruction.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.41","Titus and the rulers that immediately followed him did not intend to interfere with the religious practices of the Jews. According to Josephus, Titus even commanded that the temple be spared and it was the princess Berenice who set fire to it out of conviction that the Jews would never surrender as long as it remained in existence. After the revolt was quelled Titus did not wish to do any further harm. In all religious matters the Jews remained free and they retained the right of judgment in religious and also in secular cases. Even non-Jews often appeared before a Jewish court when in dispute with a Jew and the Roman authorities allowed Jewish courts to handle all cases when both parties consented to be tried by it. The Church-father Origines even declared that Jewish courts tried cases involving life although they were not authorized to do so."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.42",The teachings of the Pharisees then developed to an extent which would have been impossible had the temple been in existence. The Sadducees disappeared altogether and the oral law became the dominant influence in Jewish life. All national life concentrated about the religious regulations which were strictly observed. In their devotion to the Torah and in the observance of its commandments the people found consolation for the destruction of the temple; Jabneh took the place of Jerusalem and the offering of gifts to the scholars in Jabneh took the place of the offering of sacrifices on an altar.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.43","Sixty years after the destruction of Jerusalem, during the reign of Hadrian, another uprising took place which affected the whole people. The cause of this uprising is sought in the events which occurred during the reign of the preceding emperor Trajan. During his reign Babylonia rebelled against Rome and the Jews extended aid to the insurgents. (The Talmud refers to this revolt as ""Polemos Quietus."") A number of Jews from Palestine also joined this uprising in the hope that the defeat of the Romans would lead to the liberation of Palestine."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.44","Trajan entrusted the conduct of the war to general Lucius Quietus and he commanded him to execute all Jews that would fall into his hands. After he quelled the revolt, Quietus was appointed governor of Palestine. Uprisings of the Jews occurred simultaneously in Egypt, Cyrenaica and Cyprus and the rebels vented their pent up anger on the neighboring Greek population and slaughtered many of them. Greek authors of that time speak of hundreds of thousands of slain Greeks, but these numbers were undoubtedly highly exaggerated. Marcius Turba was dispatched to quell the revolt and he triumphed over the Jews in ""Bikat Yadaim"" (Alexandria). A Talmudic legend describes the slaughter that followed and states that twice as many people as left Egypt were killed at that time."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.45","Hadrian was by nature a peace loving and kindly man and he is said to have permitted the restoration of the temple, but the Samaritans objected to such a step and he withdrew his permission. One legend states that when the foundations for the new temple were being excavated flames burst out from the diggings and consumed the laborers. The Jews then asked that the work be stopped because of their belief that this was an omen of God's desire that the temple should not be rebuilt. However, it has been historically established that the relations between the Samaritans and the Jews during the reign of Hadrian were friendly and they also participated on the side of the Jews during the uprising."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.46","Recent historical investigations ascribe the rebellion to Hadrian's prohibition against circumcision. Both the Jews and the Samaritans observed the law of circumcision and they therefore united against Rome. It seems inexplicable why the Romans, who did not interfere with the religious customs of the subject peoples, should have prohibited circumcision, but the Christian historian Schuerer explains this in the following manner: Emperor Domitian issued a law against castration as a barbaric custom. This law Hadrian extended to include circumcision and the death penalty was established for those who broke the law. This explanation is obviated by the fact that Antoninus Pius again allowed the Jews to practice circumcision and his edict declared the practice to be an old Jewish custom and not to be confused with castration. In issuing this edict he was also influenced by the stubborness with which the Jews clung to this practice."

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.48","When Moses sent spies to Palestine they reported that the cities of Palestine were well fortified (Numbers, 13:28). Moses informed the Jews that they would find ""cities great and fenced up to heaven"" (Deut. 9:1). It is therefore remarkable that after so many invasions and wars the people believed that many of the gates and fortresses dated back to the days of Joshua ben Nun. The Bible mentions that the Jews lived in ""Ir"" (city), ""Chatzer"" (court) and ""Kefar"" (village). The Talmud makes no mention of ""Chatzer"" but contains the additional concept of ""Kerach"" (large city) and in addition to the ""Ir"" (city) it makes mention of ""Ayarah"" (town). There are differing opinions concerning the exact meaning of ""Chatzer"". Some declared it to be a suburb; others maintained that it referred to an enclosure or a group of houses where a large number of people lived. We also find references to cities named ""Hatzar"" (Numbers, 34:4; Joshua, 19:3), and these probably developed from small groups of houses. The name ""Kefar"" appears both in the Bible and in the Talmud. The size of a ""Kefar"" (village) was not definitely determined but Josephus declares that the smallest ""Kefar"" in Palestine contained fifteen thousand inhabitants. However, his statement may be discounted as exaggerated. There were also cities in Palestine which developed from villages as is indicated by their names: ""Kefar Haamoni,"" ""Kefar Hananiah"" and ""Kefar Aziz."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.49","When the scholars tried to define the difference between a city and a village they said that a city is a place where there are always ten ""Batlonim"" (idlers) available for various religious functions which require that number. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) מגלה ג׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.50","The name ""Kerach"" was derived from the Aramaic. The name signifies a fortified city. The Talmud sometimes refers to the same city by all three names (Kerach, Ir, Kefar), but it is obvious that ""Ir"" usually referred to an unfortified city."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.51","The fortified ""Kerach"" was surrounded by a wall as protection against sudden attacks and was generally situated on the top of a mountain or on a rocky hill which was difficult of access and could be easily defended. Whenever an ""Ir"" was fortified it was expressly referred to as a walled city."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.52","A ""Kerach"" was limited in area by its walls and could not grow indefinitely; the name therefore described the strength of the city and not its size. Whenever we find statements such as ""the great Kerach of Rome"" these refer to the defenses of the city rather than to its size."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.53","The Talmud relates that when God wanted to determine the size of Jerusalem the angels said: ""You have created so many Kerachim of the Gentile nations without determining their size. Why should you do so for your own city?"" <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) בבא בתרא ע""ה ב׳.</span></i> This legend is interpreted by some to indicate that ""Kerach"" referred to Gentile cities or to those whose garrisons were largely non-Jewish. The Talmudic reference to Betar, which was a Jewish city, as ""Kerach"" they hold to be an exception."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.54","The walled cities of Palestine were thus named ""Kerachim"" and were considered as Gentile places of residence. There were ten such cities which bore the collective name of Decapolis. In the course of time they developed into separate centers of activity apart from the rest of Palestine, <sup>6)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">6) שקלים פּרק ג׳ משנה ד׳.</span></i> although some of them were surrounded by Jewish settlements. <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) חגיגה כ""ה א׳.</span></i> The administrators of these cities discriminated against the Jews who were denied privileges enjoyed by the other inhabitants. This was also a distinction between a ""Kerach"" and an ""Ir"" which was not autonomous. The ""Kerach"" contained garrisons; this is evident from the reference of the Talmud to ""Burganin,"" that means the barracks which housed the soldiers or the government tax collector. <sup>8)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">8) שבת ק""ג ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.55","This fact explains the Talmudic saying that a man who is about to enter a ""Kerach"" should pronounce the following prayer: ""May it be Thy will to lead me into this Kerach in peace."" Once within the city one was supposed to recite another prayer which said: ""I am thankful to You that You brought me into the city in peace."" Upon leaving, one said: ""May it be Thy will to lead me out of this city in peace,"" and after one was out of the limits of the city he was to say: ""I thank You for leading me out of the city in peace and I pray that You shall further lead me and protect me in peace and that You shall save me from any enemy who may lurk by the roadside."" <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) ברכות ס׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.56","This prayer was instituted because of the danger of entering and leaving a ""Kerach."" It was composed during the rule of the Romans who afforded no protection to Jewish travellers when they did not molest them themselves. But despite the danger, Jews constantly had to visit these cities because of their business enterprises. Sometimes they only had to pass through these cities, as in the case af sea journeys when the ships touched at these ports. The scholars therefore at times forbade entrance into these cities or even into towns which were located in their neighborhood, but these prohibitions were usually ignored out of necessity. <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) תוספתא עבודה זרח פּרק א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.57","Even wicked kings who ruled the land with brutal force and persecuted the Jewish religion could gain the admiration of the people by building a new city. This act was enough to justify many of his cruel deeds in the eyes of the people. Such was the case of Omri, the king of Israel, who encouraged idolatry, nevertheless the Talmud declared that he gained the kingdom for four generations of his successors because he built the city of Samaria. <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) סנהדרין ק""ב ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.58","The number of cities in Palestine was usually highly exaggerated. Speaking of the conquests of Alexander Jannai, R. Jochanan thus declared that the area occupied contained 600,000 cities each of which was inhabited by 600,000 people. The total number would thus be larger than the population of the whole world today. Similar exaggerations we find in the writing of Josephus who said that there were 1200 cities in Galilee alone and in the writings of the Greek historian Dio Casius who related that during the uprising of Bar Kochba the Romans conquered 950 fortified cities."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.59","We may conclude, however, that the large cities were subdivided into quarters each of which was significant in itself. From the descriptions of ancient Jerusalem we know that the city was divided into an upper and a lower part. During the time that we are dealing with, Jerusalem was in ruins and uninhabited, and when the scholars attempted to describe the beauty of the city they relied upon their imagination of the Jerusalem of the future after Messiah would come. But the descriptions of ancient Jerusalem were not exaggerated. The image of the city lived in the memory of all the people and they sought to make the other cities resemble Jerusalem in appearance. Most of the Palestine cities were built on mountain tops and the synagogues were erected at the highest point so as to be seen from all sides. The court which dispensed justice and controlled the observance of the commandments of the Torah also held its sessions there. The academies were located nearby and the sexton of the synagogue blew the Shofar there to announce the beginning of the Sabbath. The watch tower was also located in that vicinity to observe the countryside over a great distance and to announce the coming of an enemy."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.60","Nearly all Palestine cities had suburbs which were called in Hebrew ""Migrash"" or ""Parvar"" (Kings II, 23:11). Houses in these suburbs were part of the cities for purposes of taxation and maintenance of order, but in time of war they were abandoned except such houses as bordered on the city walls."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.61",The scholars established a rule by which all inhabitants of a city were compelled to build a wall with gates about the city. This rule was enforced in those towns that were near the border of the country and were subject to attacks. Every city also had one or more market places and was traversed by streets.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.62","Speaking of the greatness of Jerusalem, a Midrash relates that the city contained twenty-four palaces each of which had 24 entrances. Near every entrance there were 24 large market places, each of which was divided into 24 small ones. Each small market place had 24 courts in each of which there were 24 houses. <sup>12)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">12) איכה רבתי פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.63","Every market place was usually designated by a name which described the type of merchandise that was sold there. Thus there were poultry markets and fish markets. Others were named after the people that lived in the neighborhood such as ""the market of the Arameans."" ""the market of Rabbi Yitzchak"" and ""the market of Rabbi Chanin."" In addition every city had ""corners"" (Kranoth) where different stores were located and where idlers (<span dir=""rtl"">יושבי קרנות</span>) congregated awaiting strangers from whom they could earn something."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.64","The <span dir=""rtl"">„מבוא""</span> (entrance) to the city also served as a market place and frequently resembled a court which extended for some distance and led up to various houses and courts within the city. The ""Mavo"" was significant and played an important role in the development of the rules pertaining to ""Eruvin."" <sup>*)</sup><i class=""footnote"">*) The law concerning the transportation of objects from one place to another on Sabbath.</i> The inhabitants living in the neighborhood of the ""Mavo"" were also responsible for its upkeep."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.65","The Romans were great city builders and they generally laid out new cities in squares. Jewish scholars therefore developed the theory that cities should be built in that form in order to facilitate defining the 2000 ell limit outside of the city which was the distance allowed to walk on the Sabbath. <sup>13)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">13) ערובין נ""ג א׳.</span></i> Jews also built the walls surrounding their cities with uneven surfaces. The unevenness of the walls increased their defense capacity and when the enemy attempted to demolish them with iron rams the upper stones would fall on the attackers. The numerous corners and turns in the walls were also strategically important and hard to conquer."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.66","As a result of the limited space within the walled area, houses were built close together and some of them were built into the protecting walls. Such houses generally served as gates to the city. Thus we find that during the conquest of Jericho, Rahab's house was built into the city wall and it was also said of one of the ""Amoraim"" of Palestine that the gate of the city led into his house. <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) ירושלמי שבת פּרק ו׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Some cities had double walls for greater protection in face of a superior enemy. The Romans were in the habit of erecting imposing gates on each side of the city, but such gates were built only in the Gentile inhabited cities. Jewish cities, on the other hand, presented a poor appearance architecturally both in the construction of their houses and protecting walls."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.67","Life in the cities differed greatly from that in the villages so far as food, clothing and general behavior was concerned. Life in the cities was more refined in all its aspects when compared to the primitive mode of life in the villages. For the convenience of the city dwellers there were markets and hostelries where food supplies were sold and travellers were accommodated. These two institutions also served as the foundation for commerce in the country. On certain days of the week the villagers would bring their produce to the cities and would buy those necessities which they could not raise themselves. These market days were called <span dir=""rtl"">ימי הכניסח</span> (days of entrance) and occurred on Mondays and Thursdays. In honor of the visitors a chapter from the Torah would be read in the synagogue on those days and other religious needs of the villagers would be fulfilled. The court held its sessions and the scholars lectured on religious questions. Friday was another market day when the villagers brought food supplies such as fowl, cattle, fish and wine for the Sabbath. The artisans also had their shops in the city and the villagers paid them for their labor with their farm produce. Among these were also the scribes, the doctors and the teachers."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.68","This trade was defined in the Talmud as ""give and take"" (<span dir=""rtl"">משא ומתן</span>) because it largely consisted of barter. It was only rarely that the villagers possessed any money. Cities were generally built near a supply of water, but when there were no springs or wells in the vicinity, water would be brought in pipes or aqueducts from some distance. Many cities also had reservoirs to store water in anticipation of drought or the drying up of wells and the people knew how to utilize water pressure to raise it to higher levels. Some cities had canals for drainage purposes and these canals were also used to bring the water to the fields for irrigation purposes. Wells were provided with buckets for raising the water."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.69","The abundance of water in Palestine enabled people to maintain cleanliness and its effects on the health of the population was noticeable. The need and the justification of baths was recognized by the Talmud and was expressed in the following words: ""If a city dweller does not allow his wife to bathe at least once a week or a villager does not allow his wife to bathe at least once in a fortnight the woman may demand a divorce and the full payment of her dowry, likewise if a villager forces his wife to go barefoot three months in succession, or if a city dweller commands his wife to go barefoot one day."" <sup>15)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15) ירושלמי פּסחים פּרק ח׳ הלכה א׳, כתובות פּרק ז׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.70","Every city was surrounded by fields and in some cases part of the fields were within the city walls. This was also true of wine cellars and threshing floors which sometimes were found within the confines of the city walls. Although numerous trees were grown within the cities the orchards and the gardens were outside the walls. The roads leading through the gardens were often lined with avenues of trees. Torches and oil lamps were used to illuminate the entrances to the courts. These were provided by the owners of the houses at their own expense. <sup>16)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">16) תרומות פּרק י""א משנה י׳, פּסחים נ׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.71","In addition to the weekly market days every city had special fairs once a month or once every half year. At these fairs various kinds of merchandise from distant places and foreign lands were sold and money changers (<span dir=""rtl"">„שולחני""</span>) were present to exchange the coins of the foreign merchant who came to buy Palestine products."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.72","Aside from their economic significance market places were also social centers where people congregated to look at the displays of merchandise and at the artistic arrangement of fruit. The grains most commonly marketed were rye or wheat for bread. In addition there were articles of apparel and flax, wine, wool, leather and slaves. Stores provided the city dwellers with all their needs in addition to the markets. These stores contained all possible articles including arms. In the smaller towns and villages there were also peddlers who carried their wares from house to house and many villagers preferred to dispose of their goods in this manner out of fear of being cheated in the cities."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.73","The more refined tastes of the city people was apparent also in the food which they consumed and the Talmud mentions the difference in the flour which they used as compared to the flour used by the villagers. <sup>17)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">17) פּסחים מ׳ א׳.</span></i> A delicacy frequently used at that time consisted of dough baked in honey, but in the cities this was made with much honey while in the villages only a trace of it was used. <sup>18)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">18) ברכות ל""ז ב׳.</span></i> The villagers also ate coarse bread which was not liked in the cities. <sup>19)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">19) ערובין פּ""ב ב׳.</span></i> Similar differences were apparent in the garments worn. The garments of the villagers were primitive and are referred to in the Talmud as <span dir=""rtl"">בגדי בני חקליתא</span> (garments of the farmers); in the cities various styles were used and it was often impossible to distinguish between the garments of men and women. <sup>20)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">20) שבת י""א א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.74","Difficult as conditions were in the cities, the farming population met with still greater hardships. Their struggle for existence was more arduous and they were also exposed to ridicule. Villagers were called ""Am Haaretz"" and even those scholars who showed respect for the city artisans often expressed disdain for the ""Am Haaretz."" In later years the name ""Am Haaretz"" was no longer used and <span dir=""rtl"">„בן כפר""</span> (villager) was substituted instead, but even then it was pointed out that a great difference existed between the city dweller and the villager. The contempt in which the villager was held is apparent from many descriptions and popular sayings of that time. From these it is obvious that only city dwellers were considered as civilized and the rural population was held to be ignorant."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.75","Cities were held to be the home of wisdom and only their inhabitants knew how to show proper respect to scholars and to prominent men. Whenever a villager did not accord the proper respect to one greater than himself, he was not punished and it was ascribed to his ignorance."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.76","The most striking analysis of the difference between city and village inhabitants is contained in the statement of the scholars concerning the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel both of whom described their visions of God and his heavenly retinue. Isaiah described what he saw as a city dweller who had frequent opportunities to see the king, but Ezekiel described his vision like a villager who may have seen the king only once in his life. <sup>21)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">21) חגיגה י""ג ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.77","All political upheavals of that time originated in the cities, for only there the people showed understanding of political events. Villagers were not much concerned with political matters and they suspected everyone of trying to rob them. This state of mind resulted partly from the fact that the country was overrun by Jewish as well as non-Jewish bands of robbers in addition to soldiers, tax collectors and others who prayed upon the villagers."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.78","The entire mode of life of the villagers was thus on a low plane. Their food was poorer, their garments coarse, their furniture made of unplaned boards. The regulations of the Talmud concerning cleanliness of vessels specifically mentions a ""bowl of the villagers"" which was different from those used in the cities. <sup>22)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">22) ביצה ל""ב א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.79","Villagers were allowed to celebrate Purim earlier than the city celebrations. Although the Book of Esther expressly states that Purim should be observed on the 14th and 15th days of the month of Adar, the Mishna declared that villagers may read the Book of Esther on market day when they come to the city on a Monday or Thursday even when those days are only the 11th, the 12th or the 13th of the month."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.80","As soon as darkness fell, all villagers were afraid to leave their houses because of the wild animals that roamed the land <sup>23)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">23) ירושלמי ברכות פּרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> and also for fear of the soldiers and of robber bands. But whereas the soldiers would only rob the farmer and force him to provide all their needs, the robber bands, which were common in peace time as well as during years of war, frequently killed their victims if any resistance was offered. Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta therefore said that the life of a villager might be compared to that of wanderers in the desert who were never sure of their lives, and whose wives and children could be seized. <sup>24)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">24) ערובין נ""ה ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.81",The doors of city houses were usually locked and when they were open there was always a bell present to announce the visitors. But the houses in the villages were always open and visitors with honest intentions could always be sure of generous hospitality.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.82","But despite the disabilities of the villagers, their mode of life had certain advantages. Due to the crowded conditions in the cities contagious diseases were common and frequent bathing did not counteract them. The disease germs bred in the walls of the houses, as may be seen from the Biblical laws concerning leprosy."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.83","The scholars ruled that every city must possess ten things for the convenience of its inhabitants. These were: a court, a charity fund, a synagogue, a bath house, a comfort station, a doctor, a barber, a scribe, a butcher and a teacher. <sup>25)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">25) סנהדרין י""ז ב׳.</span></i> But all of these did not suffice in time of epidemics and the inhabitants sought refuge in the villages."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.84","By far the greatest difference between city and village consisted in matters of administration. The cities possessed courts and a police force to maintain order; each one was also taxed a definite sum for the city government and also for charitable purposes. In the villages, on the other hand, anarchy reigned and he who was more powerful could do as he pleased."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.85","Jews exhibited a dislike for dogs and only in rare cases were dogs allowed in the cities and then they had to be chained. The opinion was common that one who keeps a dog is like one who raises pigs, and stories were related of pregnant women miscarrying when frightened by the barking of dogs. <sup>26)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">26) בבא קמא פּ""ג א׳.</span></i> But in the villages dogs were common, especially for herding purposes."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud.86",Villages were often traversed by many people when they journeyed in connection with their business enterprises or to announce the regulations of the Sanhedrin. There were also travelers who went about to acquaint themselves with different peoples and lands. All of these found shelter and hospitality in the villages where they stopped overnight for fear of robbers who hid along the highways. Tax collectors especially were subject to such robberies when it was known that they carried considerable sums.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.1","A<small>S WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY POINTED OUT</small>, the political and economic situation of the Jews of Palestine was indescribably tragic at that time. But there seems to have been a constant migration from and into Babylonia. The Roman authorities did not object to the fact that many Jews of Palestine went to Babylonia to seek a livelihood while Babylonian Jews came to Palestine to study. This was the case despite the fact that the Babylonian Jews had by that time attained a higher degree of development of learning. They then enjoyed full liberty in the observance of the religious regulations; they had their own courts and they passed sentences as they saw fit. It was only rarely that they had to consult the High Court in Palestine. The determination of the beginning of the months and of the holidays was the only thing that the Jews of Babylonia could not do. Nevertheless they considered the teachings emanating from Palestine as the only correct ones and they believed that despite the destruction of the Temple the rule that out of Zion would come learning was still sound."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.2","Rabbi Aba bar Kahana was one of the ""Amoraim"" who came to Palestine from Babylonia at this time. He brought with himself numerous Hagadic interpretations which he repeated in the name of Rav (Aba Arecha). <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) ירושלמי סוטה פּרק ט׳ הלכה י""ג, בראשית רבה פּרשה ד׳ פּיסקא ט׳; ויקרא רבה פּרשה ל""ה פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i> Some people therefore claim that he was a disciple of Rav but the dates of the lives of the two men do not coincide and at the time that Rabbi Aba began to study, Rav had undoubtedly died already. It is more probable that Rabbi Aba had been a pupil of a disciple of Rav. This view is also substantiated by the fact that he sometimes quoted Rabbi Chiya bar Ashi who had been a pupil of Rav. <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) ירושלמי ברכות פּרק ו׳ הלכה ו׳; שבת פּרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳, פּרק ו׳ הלכה ה׳, יבמות פּרק ד׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.3","When Rabbi Aba bar Kahana arrived in Palestine, Rabbi Chanina bar Chama was probably still alive, for we find him quoting statements in the name of Rabbi Chanina. <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) שבת קכ""א ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.4","Another reference concerns a question which he asked of Rabbi Ami. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) ירושלמי פּסחים פּרק ד׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i> But we possess little information concerning the personality and the life of Rabbi Aba bar Kahana. On one occasion he mentioned the name of Kfar Chitaa and we may assume that he lived there, but it is unknown whether he conducted a seminary there. <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) בראשית רבה פּרשה ס""ה פּיסקא י""ב.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.5","Like his contemporaries Rabbi Aba was also a master of exposition. The people were then tired of legal disputations, but they responded eagerly to Hagada. We thus find hundreds of expositions of Rabbi Aba. Many of these are not clear for his interpretations of the Biblical verses often seem incomprehensible. We will therefore cite only a few to illustrate his method of interpretation."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.6","Speaking of the verse ""the sun rises and the sun sets,"" Rabbi Aba said: ""What is the intention of this verse? Does not everyone know that the sun rises and sets every day? But this verse intends to show how God conducts the world. Before the sun of Moses set, the sun of Joshua ben Nun rose; the sun of Samuel rose before the sun of Eli set and on the day that Rabbi Akiba died Rabbi Jehuda ha-Nasi was born."" <sup>6)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">6) בראשית רבה פּרשה נ""ח ב׳; קהלת רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא י׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.7","The verse ""if a snake bite without venom"", Rabbi Aba explained in a different manner than the other scholars did. The word <span dir=""rtl"">„לחש""</span> means both, ""venom"" and ""whisper"". Rabbi Aba interpreted this verse to mean that a snake would not bite unless it had been commanded from above, nor would a lion stalk its prey without heavenly sanction, nor would a government oppress its people unless it was so commanded from above. <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) קהלת רבה פּרשה י׳ פּיסקא י""ד.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.8","Of the effect of a false oath Rabbi Aba said: ""Some things which are not consumed by fire are consumed by a false oath. Wood is burned by fire but stones are not, but a false oath will consume both."" <sup>8)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">8) ויקרא רבה פּרשה ו׳ פּיסקא א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.9","""The slightest command of the Torah"", Rabbi Aba said, ""is rewarded as well as the greatest. God thus determined the reward of commandments in order to encourage the people to lead honest lives. The easiest commandment is to send the mother bird away from the nest when the fledglings are taken, in order that it may not suffer the anguish of seeing them killed. The hardest commandment to observe is honoring one's father and mother. These two commandments are nevertheless rewarded by long life."" <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) ירושלמי פּאה פּרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.10","The following interpretation of a Biblical verse by Rabbi Aba gives a picture of the mood of that time: ""The anguish of death has surrounded me"" (in Babylonia); ""rivers of wickedness have horrified me"" (in Media); ""the suffering of the grave surrounded me"" (among the Greeks); ""the traps of death were set for me"" (in Rome). The fact that the term ""death"" was employed in the first and the fourth of these Rabbi Aba explained by saying that both, Babylonia and Rome, undertook to annihilate the Jews; the Babylonians destroyed the first temple and the Romans destroyed the second temple. <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) מדרש שוחר טוב פּרשה י""ח.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.11","Like many other scholars of that time Rabbi Aba also believed that a war between Babylonia and Rome would result in the liberation of the Jews. He therefore said: ""Whenever one will see many Babylonians in Palestine it will be a sign of the approaching redemption."" <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) שיר השירים רבה ה׳ י""א; איכה רבתי א׳ מ""ג.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.12","In a discourse concerning the peoples that lived in the neighborhood of Palestine, Rabbi Aba bar Kahana explained the Biblical verse to indicate that the ""Pathrothim"" and the ""Kasluchim"" intermarried freely and from these mixed marriages were descended giants like the Philistines and dwarfs like the ""Kaphtorim."" <sup>12)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">12) בראשית רבה פּרשה ל""ז פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.13","Rabbi Chanina bar Papa was also of great prominence at that time and his name is constantly linked with R. Avahu, R. Yitzchak Napcha and R. Ami. In the Jerusalem Talmud as well as in the Midrashim his first name at times appears as Hinna or Chananiah. The name Papa is an Aramaic form of the Greek name Papos."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.14","Rabbi Chanina bar Papa was a pupil of Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani who praised him for his knowledge of the Scriptures. <sup>13)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">13) ירושלמי שביעית פּרק ד׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> Rabbi Chanina was also a close friend of the outstanding disciples of Rabbi Jochanan and he frequently debated with R. Chama bar Chanina and with R. Acha bar Chanina. The Talmud contains some statements of this time whose authorship is in doubt and these are generally introduced by ""R. Zeira said, but others claim that R. Chanina bar Papa said"". <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) ברכות ה׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.15","Rabbi Chanina par Papa also differed with Rabbi Zeira in the matter of explaining the good deeds of the Israelitic King Abiyah the son of Jeroboam. <sup>15)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15) מועד קטן כ""ח ב׳.</span></i> The Talmud also cites some of his public lectures but one of these is sometimes ascribed to R. Simlai."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.16","The personality of Rabbi Chanina is surrounded with numerous legendary adventures. One of these relates of an attempt made by a Roman matron to seduce him. When she failed in her attempt, she commanded that Rabbi Chanina be found and he was forced to hide all night in a bath house which was reported to be haunted by evil spirits, but since he did not succumb to sin, he escaped unharmed. <sup>16)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">16) קדושין ל""ט ב׳.</span></i> Another time Rabbi Chanina encountered an evil spirit while he was on a mission of charity. The spirit said to him: ""Have you not learned that one must not tresspass the boundary of another?"", intending to say that evil spirits are in control at night and that no man should appear outside at that time. But Rabbi Chanina replied: ""The Bible says that he who gives charity secretly appeases wrath."" As he said this he turned around and fled. <sup>17)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">17) ירושלמי פּאה פּרק ח׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.17","When the hour of his death approached, Rabbi Chanina implored the Angel of death to grant him thirty days in which he could review his learning. The Angel of death granted him this request and Rabbi Chanina asked him to show him his place in Paradise and also to let him hold his sword on the way. But the Angel of death refused this last request remembering what had happened when he granted such a request to R. Joshua ben Levi. When Rabbi Chanina died, his body was surrounded by a pillar of fire and none could approach it. Rabbi Alexandri then asked the body to cause the pillar of fire to depart. ""Do it for the sake of the scholars who have come to your funeral"", Rabbi Alexandri said, but the pillar of fire did not depart; ""do it for the honor of your father"", he continued to implore and still the pillar of fire remained; ""do it for your own honor that we may be able to approach to mourn for you and to attend to your burial"".

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina Bar Papa.22","The verse ""the lions roar for prey"", Rabbi Chanina interpreted that lions refer to the unbelieving peoples (<span dir=""rtl"">כפירים־ כופרים</span>) who deny God and who seek to devour the Jews who depend upon God.

Rabbi Chanina asked: ""What is the distinction between Jewish and Heathen prophets?"" He replied that God spoke to Jewish prophets directly as a king who removes the curtains of his palace to speak to his friends. To the Heathen prophets he spoke indirectly as a king who speaks to strangers through a partition. <sup>23)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">23) בראשית רבה פּרשה נ""ב פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.1","T<small>HE TWO</small> A<small>MORAIM</small>, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, were always mentioned together due to the great bond of friendship which united them. But before we proceed to describe the lives of these two Amoraim we must mention an event which transpired in Palmyra (in the Bible ""Tadmor,"" in the Talmud ""Tarmud""), a city located in an oasis in the Syrian desert between the Euphrates and Damascus."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.2","In the city of Palmyra there lived a robber chieftain who became a legitimate ruler when he aided the Romans in their war against the Persians of Babylonia. The name of this chieftain was Barnezer Odenate. When the Romans were defeated by the Persians and their leaders were taken captive, Odenate librated them and preserved Roman rule in Syria. Emperor Galianus (264 C. E.) then recognized him as co-ruler in Syria. However, this situation did not last long for the wife of the chieftain, later queen Zenobia, hired assassins to murder her husband in order that she might rule in his stead. With her wisdom and her organizational talents she succeeded in transforming Palmyra into a metropolis. In this she was aided by the fact that the city was situated at the crossroads of important caravan routes. The city was then enlarged by the construction of beautiful palaces in the Roman style."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.3","Some historians maintain that Zenobia embraced Judaism or that she was sympathetic to the Jewish faith. Jewish historians, however, deny this and make no mention of any kind acts toward the Jews on her part. But all Roman historians concurred in their praise of her beauty, education and good taste. She was a gifted diplomat and she succeeded in persuading all the rulers of western Asia to unite against emperor Aurelius. Aurelius advanced against Zenobia with a large army when he realized that she planned to liberate her country from Roman domination. In this venture he was also successful and he devastated her land."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.4","It appears that the Jews of Palestine were not satisfied with the proximity of Zenobia's kingdom and they aided the Romans. An expression current among the Jews of that time stated: ""Happy is he who will live to see the destruction of Tadmor"". The problem also arose whether converts from Palmyra were to be accepted since the population of this city was of mixed origin."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.5","According to the Scriptures (Kings I, 9:18) Palmyra was founded by king Solomon who colonized it with people from various nations. It is also known that Zenobia was herself an offspring of a mixed marriage. For this reason it was an accepted opinion that ""Jews would celebrate the day of the destruction of Tadmor."" <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) יבמות ט""ז ב׳, ירושלמי תענית פּרק ד׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.6","That the Jews participated in this war on the side of Rome is evident from numerous statements in the Talmud. Thus it is told that Rabbi Ami interceded for a man named Zeira bar Chanina who was captured in the city of Saphsipha as a warrior against Palmyra. Rabbi Ami then implored Zenobia to spare the man's life, but she said to him: ""Do you permit yourself to do anything you choose because God always performs miracles for you?"" At about the same time Rabbi Asi was also captured by the soldiers of Palmyra and was condemned to death. Resh Lakish then hastened to save him saying that he would sacrifice his own life if necessary to achieve his aim. <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) ירושלמי תרומות פּרק ה׳ הלכה י׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.7","The Palestinian Patriarch of that time was R. Jehudah N'siah the Third. He was nearly always ignored by the scholars, and when the latter consulted him in some matter out of deference for his office, he always sought the advice of Rabbi Ami. The Nasi once sent Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi to the various cities of Palestine, to appoint teachers of the Bible and the Mishna. They then arrived in a certain city where there were no teachers and they asked the leaders of the community whether they had engaged watchmen. The city watchmen were pointed out to them, but they remarked: ""These are not watchmen! The real watchmen of a city are the teachers who instruct the children."" <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) ירושלמי חגיגה פּרק א׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.8","The animosity between Jews and Samaritans grew acute at that time due to the friendship of the latter toward the Romans and the Christians. Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi then instructed the Jews to avoid the Samaritans and to consider them as pagans in all matters and particularly in the matter of the use of their wine. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) חולין ז׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.9","Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi came from Babylonia where they previously studied together. <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) מועד קטן כ""ה א׳.</span></i> Both immediately became pupils of Rabbi Jochanan, <sup>6)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">6) שבת קמ""ה ב׳.</span></i> and later they were ordained at the same time. The day of their ordination was a feast day for the other pupils who sang their praise in the following words: ""Only pupils like you should be ordained."" <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) כתובות י""ז א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.10","Travel between Palestine and Babylonia was free and undisturbed at that time and scholars constantly went from one country to the other. In Babylonia the academies of Sura and Pumbeditha were renowned. Whether Rabbi Ami quoted a law which he heard in Babylonia he would say: ""Our teachers in Babylonia said."" <sup>8)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">8) שבועות מ""ז א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Asi's coming to Palestine was said to have been caused by his desire to escape his capricious, aged mother. <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) קדושין ל""א ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.11","We have mentioned above that Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi lived in great friendship. They attended the same academy and after their ordination they enjoyed the same measure of honor. They were referred to as ""the Judges of Palestine"" <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) סנהדרין י""ז ב׳.</span></i> or ""the honorable Priests of Palestine"". <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) גטין נ""ט ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Ami was also called ""a great man,"" <sup>12)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">12) יבמות כ""א ב׳.</span></i> and Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath referred to Rabbi Asi as ""the example of the generation."" <sup>13)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">13) חולין ק""ג ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.12","After the death of Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath both headed the academy in Tiberias. It was related that when prayer time came each one of them would pray alone between the columns of the academy. <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) ברכות ה׳ א׳, ל׳ ב׳.</span></i> Often they interrupted their studies and called out: ""He who wants to know the law or seeks judgment, let him enter."" <sup>15)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15) שבת י׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.13","Together with Rabbi Chiya bar Aba they once judged a licentious woman named Tamar and they sentenced her to be beaten with rods. The woman complained to the Roman authorities that they had exceeded their rights in passing judgment affecting the life of a person. Rabbi Avahu successfully interceded for them since he was influential with the Romans, but the woman could not be persuaded to withdraw her complaint. Rabbi Avahu then sent an allegoric message to the defendants. Because of the original form of the message we offer here a literal translation of it: ""We have conciliated the three accusers, the Good Child, the Educated one and the Man of the Sea, but the Date (Tamar) persists in its bitterness and we sought to sweeten it, but vain were the efforts of the Goldsmith."" The explanation of this message is as follows: Rabbi Avahu conciliated the three judges, one of whom was named Eudokos (good child), the other Eumathes (educated), and the third Thelaseus (sea man). But the woman Tamar persists in her bitterness and would not be placated with money. <sup>16)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">16) ירושלמי מגלה פּרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>"

Thus it was related that an epidemic once broke out in Sephoris, but it did not affect the street where Rabbi Chanina resided. The people were angered and said that he refused to pray for them, but Rabbi Chanina denied that his prayer could be of any avail as long as they conducted themselves immorally. Another time a drought occurred and although a fast day was declared no rain fell. Rabbi Chanina was then blamed and it was said that because he spoke evil of the people, God refused to heed their prayers. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) ירושלמי תענית פּרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Chanina Bar Chama.8","Rabbi Chanina was modest toward his master, but he consciously maintained his dignity among his colleagues.

He repeated this also when Rabban Simeon, the son of the Nasi, entered in the middle of the reading, but when Rabbi Chanina entered, he refused to begin the chapter anew. This offended Rabbi Chanina and on thirteen successive eves of the Day of Atonement Rav visited Rabbi Chanina to ask his forgiveness, but the latter would not become reconciled. <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) יומא פ""ז ב׳.</span></i>"

Due to differences of opinion with Rabbi Chanina, Rabbi Jochanan left Sephoris and settled in Tiberias, <sup>15)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15) ירושלמי ביצה פּרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> but these differences did not weaken their friendship and Rabbi Jochanan often visited his master in Sephoris. <sup>16)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">16) ויקרא רבה פּרשה כ""א פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i> When Rabbi Chanina fell sick before his death, Rabbi Jochanan went to visit him, but on the road he met a man of Sephoris and he asked him: ""What new things have happened in your city?"" and the man replied: ""A great rabbi died and everybody is hurrying to the funeral."" Rabbi Jochanan then understood that Rabbi Chanina had died and he rent his garments as a sign of mourning. <sup>17)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">17) ירושלמי בבא מציעא פּרק ב׳ הלכה י""א.</span></i> Others told that Rabbi Jochanan carried thirteen garments to wear and that he tore all of them exclaiming: ""The man who nourished me with Torah has gone."" <sup>18)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">18) מועד קטן כ""ד א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Chanina Bar Chama.10","Every word which Rabbi Chanina had heard directly from Rabbi Jehudah, or which he heard repeated in the name of Rabbi Jehudah, he considered to be sacred and he would not deviate from it. In all questions that arose, Rabbi Chanina relied on the conduct of Rabbi Jehudah in similar cases and whenever a question arose to which Rabbi Chanina could find no answer in the Mishna, he consulted his colleagues and even his disciples. Rabbi Jochanan and Resh Lakish were thus greatly surprised when he asked their opinion in a matter which could easily be explained; but Rabbi Chanina said to them: ""May evil come upon me if I ever made any statement which I have not previously heard from Rabbi Jehudah as many times as I have hair on my head. In all matters of law I would observe the conduct of Rabbi on three occasions in similar cases, but this matter concerning which I asked you I only witnessed Rabbi Jehudah observe twice. I therefore asked your opinion in order that it should be as if I had seen it observed a third time."" <sup>19)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">19) ירושלמי נדה פּרק ב׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Chanina Bar Chama.11","This strict adherence to tradition and the constant repetition of opinions of previous authorities was disapproved of by the other scholars of the time who did not want to allow the interpretation of the Torah to lose its vitality. Many of them therefore left Rabbi Chanina and opened academies of their own. But these differences were only theoretical and did not diminish the personal regard which they felt for each other. On the contrary, Rabbi Chanina was always glad of the honor which was bestowed upon his pupils of the past."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Chanina Bar Chama.12","Thus it is told that as he was once strolling in the street he saw all people abandon their work and don festive garments. He asked what the occasion for rejoicing was and he was told: ""Your pupil Rabbi Jochanan has arrived and he will lecture at the academy; everybody therefore hastens to hear him."" Rabbi Chanina then pronounced the blessing of ""Schehechayanu"" that he had lived to see the honor accorded to his disciple. <sup>20)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">20) ירושלמי הוריות פּרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>"

He was said to be able to distinguish between the soil of Palestine and soil of other lands by merely taking a lump of it in his hand. When one of his young pupils, Rabbi Simeon bar Aba, asked him whether he should go to a foreign land and requested a letter of recommendation to the scholars in Babylonia, Rabbi Chanina said to him: ""I cannot give it to you, for tomorrow I may see your parents (I may die) and they may complain to me that they had owned a beautiful flower in Palestine and that I had allowed it to be transplanted to a foreign land."" <sup>22)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">22) ירושלמי מועד קטן פּרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>"

Upon his arrival in Palestine he still found the first of the Amoraim Rabbi Chanina bar Chama and Rabbi Joshua ben Levi who were then already old men. When Rabbi Chiya came to Sephoris he was befriended by Rabbi Chanina bar Chama who often leaned on him when he walked through the streets; he was also respected by Resh Lakish who engaged him to tutor his children.

Finally he was compelled by circumstances to leave when he no longer wanted to gain his sustenance from tithes which in his eyes amounted to charity and made him feel dependent. He was at that time the ""Cohen"" of the family Silone which gave him its tithes. When a dispute arose concerning the interpretation of a law which Rabbi Chiya wanted to interpret more leniently than the other scholars, he feared that his action would be explained as an attempt to favor the family from whom he derived his livelihood. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) ירושלמי שביעית פּרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> He then went to Babylonia and he was detained by no one.

He is very seldom referred to by his patronymic and nothing is known of the position of his father in Jewish life."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.2","Although he was not ordained, when he arrived in Palestine, he was then well versed in learning. <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) כתובות קי""ב א׳.</span></i> While still in Babylonia he was a pupil of Rav (Aba Arecha), whose legal opinions he later quoted. <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) שבת קנ""ג א׳, ערובין ס""ה ב׳, ירושלמי פּסחים פּרק ד׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> Later he was a disciple of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama and scores of statements in the Talmud begin with the words: ""Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Chanina."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.3","Rabbi Elazar always named the authors of the opinions which he quoted even when these were commonly known as in the case of the statement which declared that: ""He who repeats a word in the name of its authors brings redemption to the world."" <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) מגלה ט""ו א׳.</span></i> It is therefore incomprehensible that Rabbi Jochanan complained about Rabbi Elazar that he appropriated statements of others. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) ירושלמי ברכות פּרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> This attitude of reverence toward authorship also caused a dispute between Rabbi Elazar and Resh Lakish, when he heard the latter state a law which he had previously heard from Rabbi Jochanan. <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) מכות ה׳ בי.</span></i> In the popular mind Rabbi Elazar was considered to be a disciple of Rabbi Jochanan, although he denied it, and when a colleague of his referred to ""your master R.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.4","We may assume that a personal misunderstanding existed between Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Jochanan, although no specific mention of it is made anywhere in the Talmud.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.5","Rabbi Elazar earned his livelihood from testing coins. <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) בבא קמא ק׳ א׳.</span></i> This occupation provided him with an insufficient income and he lived in great want. Once, after he bled himself and there was not a crust of bread in his house, he ate a piece of garlic for want of something better and fainted. While swooning he asked God how much longer he would have to suffer want, but God replied: ""Would you have me upset the world in order that you might be born in a more lucky hour?"" <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) ברכות ט""ז ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.6","From the original statements of Rabbi Elazar in the Talmud we gather that he was gifted with noble qualities. Thus he declared that ""humility adds to one's life."" <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) סנהדרין י""ד א׳.</span></i> In his personal life he was always humble and he never prided himself on his learning before others. <sup>12)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">12) בבא בתרא קכ""ח ב׳.</span></i> His love for the Torah was indescribable <sup>13)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">13) ערובין נ""ד ב׳.</span></i> and he often said: ""Just as a child must be nursed by its mother every hour during the day even so should every man devote each hour of the day to the Torah."" <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) ירושלמי ברכות פּרק ט׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.7","The great poverty of Rabbi Elazar was well known to the Nasi who sometimes sent him gifts to alleviate his need, but Rabbi Elazar always refused to accept these. When he was invited to attend a feast at the house of the Nasi he also refused to attend. <sup>15)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15) מגלה כ""ה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.8","""Charity,"" Rabbi Elazar said, ""atones for all sins and is more important than sacrifices."" <sup>15a)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15א) סוכה מ""ט ב׳.</span></i> ""It may be compared to armor; just as armor is made up of small pieces, in charity one adds penny to penny until there is formed a considerable sum."" <sup>16)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">16) בבא בתרא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.9","Great trust was therefore placed in Rabbi Elazar and he was entrusted with the feeding of the poor. <sup>17)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">17) כתובות ס""ח א׳, ירושלמי פּאה פּרק ה׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i> It was then observed that in distributing charity, he sought to make the recipients feel as if they were not receiving charity. When Rabbi Elazar was made head of the distribution of charity he also had to collect taxes from the Jews. He then asked Rabbi Jochanan whether taxes should be levied according to wealth or according to the number of persons in a family. Rabbi Jochanan replied that taxes should be levied according to one's wealth. <sup>18)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">18) בבא בתרא ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.10","His hatred of charity was so great that Rabbi Elazar said: ""When Noah sent out a dove to see whether the waters of the flood had receded, it returned with an olive leaf in its beak. By this it implied that food bitter as an olive leaf obtained from the hand of God, is to be preferred to food sweet as honey which is obtained at the hand of man."" <sup>19)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">19) סנהדרין ק""ח ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.11","Rabbi Elazar was not the only needy scholar at that time. Due to the difficult economic circumstances there were many such. Among these was also Rabbi Simeon bar Aba. It was related that Rabbi Elazar once lost a ducat which was found by Rabbi Simeon, but he refused to take it back declaring that he had already given up the search for it. <sup>20)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">20) ירושלמי בבא מציעא פּרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.12","Following the death of Rabbi Jochanan, Rabbi Elazar was elected representative of the academy and since that time the Babylonians began to call him ""The lord of the Land of Israel."" <sup>21)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">21) יומא ב׳ ב׳, גטין י""ט ב׳, נדה כ׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.13","We have previously mentioned that the Babylonians were not held in high repute in Palestine and they therefore prided themselves on their countryman Rabbi Elazar.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.14","In his teachings Rabbi Elazar followed logical reason in his attempts to find the correct interpretations and to explain apparent contradictions. He did not fear to differ from the interpretations of others and his opinions were at times even contrary to the obvious meaning of the Mishna. <sup>23)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">23) ירושלמי תרומות פּרק א׳ הלכה בי, שקלים פּרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i> When he sought to establish the original intentions of various laws, he set up rules which were later accepted by other scholars.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Elazar Ben Pedath.15","As soon as Rabbi Elazar came to Palestine, he established close relations with the scholars of that time.

This custom of celebrating an extra day was introduced during the time when messengers of the Palestine High Court could not be sent to inform the Babylonians of the beginning of a new month. Although the Babylonian Jews could have determined the new months themselves, because they also followed the lunar calendar, the Exilarch nevertheless added an extra day to all holidays for fear that his calculations might differ from those of the High Court in Palestine. But at times the Romans relaxed their vigilance and the messengers were free to announce the findings of the High Court, at such times the Babylonian Jews would ignore the extra added day.

Even the ceremony of the ""consecration of the month,"" which was always held in a city of Judea, Rabbi Jehudah performed in Tiberias. <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) ירושלמי סנהדרין פּרק א׳ הלכה בי.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.12","Like his grandfather, Rabbi Jehudah N'siah was also called Rabbi or Rabenu. This appellation which was applied to both grandfather and grandson still further confuses the records. The historian Graetz thus maintains that the Talmudic story of the friendship of Rabbi and emperor Antoninus refers to Rabbi Jehudah N'siah and Alexander Severus."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.13","History records that Alexander Severus was a Roman of Syrian birth. He ruled from 222 until 235 (C.E.) and was friendly to the Jews. His bedroom was said to contain the statues of Orpheus, Jesus and Abraham. On all occasions he repeated the maxim of Hillel: That which you would not have done to yourself, do not unto others. He also commanded that this maxim be engraved on the gates of all courts and whenever his legions were about to march, a herald pronounced these words to the soldiers that they might remember them."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.14","Being a friend of the Jews and Christians (who were then still considered to be a Jewish sect) he always set them up as an example of honesty and moral conduct. The Greeks of Antioch and Alexandria therefore ridiculed him and called him ""Imperator Archisynagogos,"" but although the emperor knew of this attitude of the Greeks he did not deviate from his path. He presented the synagogue at Tiberias with a golden Menorah and he gave the Nasi a large field for the maintenance of his pupils. The friendly attitude of the emperor brought about more cordial relations between the Romans and the Jews and Christians. The Christian Church-father Origines complained in his writings that the emperor thought more like a Jew than a Roman."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.15","It was characteristic of Rabbi Jehudah N'siah that he did not distinguish between scholars and ordinary people in administrative matters and he taxed everyone equally for the government of the city of Tiberias. This was against the accepted axiom that one who undertakes the burden of the Torah should be freed from the burden of the government. Many of the scholars therefore spoke against the Nasi and on one occasion, as they studied the laws pertaining to a Nasi who commits a transgression, Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish asked: ""If a Nasi has committed a transgression, should he be flogged or not?"" He was answered that a court of three judges could condemn such a Nasi to be flogged and that it was not even necessary to convoke the small Sanhedrin of 23 members to try him."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.16","Later Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish further asked whether a Nasi who had been flogged could be reinstated to his office. One of the pupils, Rabbi Chagai, replied that such a Nasi could not be reinstated for fear that he would execute his judges."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.17","When Rabbi Jehudah N'siah heard of this discussion he understood that it was directed against himself and he sent one of his non-Jewish soldiers to seize Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish, but Rabbi Simeon escaped."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.18","The following day Rabbi Jochanan came to the academy and before the studies were begun he pretended to look in all the corners of the buildings. When he was asked by the Nasi what he was searching for, Rabbi Jochanan answered: ""I search for Ben Lakish; we cannot begin our studies without the key."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.19","""Where is Ben Lakish without whom we cannot pursue our studies,"" the Nasi asked, and Rabbi Jochanan replied that he was hiding in Magdala.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.20","Rabbi Jochanan at once sent a messenger to announce the good news to Ben Lakish and when they met on the following day Ben Lakish said to the Nasi: ""You have this day done an act which is similar to that of the Creator. When God wanted to free his people from bondage he did so Himself and not through a messenger or an agent."" The Nasi asked him why he proposed his questions in the academy in a manner that would insult the Nasi and Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish replied: ""You must not think that out of fear of you I will refrain from studying God's Torah."" <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) ירושלמי סנהדרין פּרק ב׳ הלכה א׳, הוריות פּרק ג׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>"

The priests would then reply: ""Creator of the world! You have given us nothing."" God would then go to the Jews and ask them: ""Why did you not give to the priests the 24 gifts which I have commanded in my Torah?"" and the Jews would reply: ""Because the servants of the Nasi take everything away from us."""

Lack of documentary information makes it impossible for us to fit the events of these years into the historical frame work of the Roman empire of that period. It is also entirely possible that due to the political changes there was an interregnum in the rule of the N'siim. It is also noteworthy that Rabbi Jehudah N'siah II was only nominally Nasi, for although he was recognized by the government as head of the Sanhedrin, the religious authorities of the people were Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Jochanan. We may assume that even Rabban Gamliel IV did not make any religious decisions without consulting the opinion of other scholars. Rabban Gamliel was looked upon as a mediocre man and a similar attitude was shown toward Rabbi Jehudah N'siah II who always sought the advice of Rabbi Ami. When Rabban Gamliel asked Rabbi Abahu whether it was permissible to go to a Gentile fair to buy slaves, the latter sharply responded in the negative. <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) ירושלמי עבודה זרה פּרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.28",Meanwhile scholarship declined in Palestine. The political unrest in the country and the growing weakness of the Roman empire resulted in a chaotic state of affairs. Emperors changed frequently and the central government lost much of its ability to govern lands as distant as Palestine. Babylonia then developed into a center of Jewish learning and in Palestine academies existed only in Galilee. But the Jews of Babylonia continued to cherish a great love for the Land of Israel and they still believed that one who would be a scholar must go to Palestine. Various anecdotes then became current in each country about the inhabitants of the other.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.29","Determining the day of the new month was then a most important religious question. This day could be determined only on the basis of the testimony of witnesses who declared that they had seen the new moon. This became a very difficult procedure due to the interference of the Romans and also because of internal enemies. The beginning of the months of Tishri and Nisan were especially significant because the date of the Passover and leap years were then established. Rabbi Ami insisted on maintaining the old procedure, but Rabbi Jehudah N'siah reminded him of the ruling of Rabbi Jochanan that one must be so strict with the witnesses who testify about the new moon, that even if they had not seen it in time they should declare that they had. <sup>18)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">18) ראש השנה כ׳ א׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.32","Some historians claim that Diocletian was friendly to the Jews and it is true that there is no record of any unusual persecution during his reign. But the Christian Church-father Eusebius relates that Diocletian persecuted the Christians. This is hard to explain in view of the fact that the Christians were then still considered to be a Jewish sect. This hatred of Christianity is ascribed to Diocletian by some historians as due not to religious fanaticism but to the realization that the Christians aimed to destroy the ruling religion. He therefore forced them to worship idols and commanded that all Christian churches be closed. From Jewish sources we learn that Diocletian also persecuted the Samaritans in Palestine and forced them to offer sacrifices to Roman idols. It is even said that he forced all the peoples of the empire, with the exception of the Jews, to worship the idols and to pour wine before their images. The Samaritans obeyed and since that time the wine of Samaritans was prohibited to Jews as unclean. <sup>20)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">20) ירושלמי עבודה זרה פּרק ה׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>"

But the same spirit cooled the bath before they entered it, and when they finally appeared before the emperor he asked them whether they allowed themselves to ridicule the emperor because of their assurance that miracles would occur to them.

But the adherence of the people to the dynasty of the Nasi remained steadfast. As long as the Nasi was descended from Hillel, who traced his descent from king David, the people felt that they had a ruler of the royal house of David whose power was temporarily limited by the Romans. The people considered it to be their duty to provide the needs of the Nasi and to maintain him in the greatest honor.

Church-father Epiphanos thus saved the history of these N'siim from oblivion even as Josephus saved for future generations the chronicle of many of the events which transpired during the time of the second temple. Epiphanos appeared to have been born a Jew and he described the history of the N'siim in the belief that those were the last days of the Jewish faith. In this respect he also resembled Josephus who believed that he was writing the history of a people doomed to extinction.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.44",Until the year 325 (C.E.) the Christians were considered to be a Jewish sect and they had a large following in the country.

In this respect the situation took a radical turn for the worse with the accession of Constantine to the throne of Rome (306-337). Constantine embraced Christianity and established it as the state religion. Persecution of the Jews on religious grounds was then intensified. The council of the Christian Patriarchs was then held at Nicea and this gathering severed all bonds with the Jews. The emperor lent his aid to the Christian church in its persecution of all other religions. Constantine II who ruled together with the co-emperor Gallus (337-349) revived the policies of Hadrian in not allowing the Jews to practice their religious commandments. Gallus was especially known for his brutality to the Jews. Upon his return from a war in the east he laid waste the southern half of the country, and it seemed that this region which contained many educational institutions headed by the disciples of Rabbi Jehudah, would never be rebuilt"

The scholars of Palestine lost the creative powers of the previous generations. There was also not much time to devote to such matters, for everyone was concerned with finding a way to escape from the country.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.50","Although the Jews of Palestine realized that scholarship was on the decline, they were still proud of their heritage and they were convinced that the handful of scholars in Palestine outweighed those of Babylonia. They said: ""The small group of scholars in Palestine is of greater significance than a large Sanhedrin in a foreign country."" <sup>28)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">28) ירושלמי נדרים פּרק ו׳ הלכה ט""ז.</span></i> Palestine scholars did not allow their pupils to emigrate, and when Rabbi Simeon bar Aba asked Rabbi Chanina bar Chama whether he should go to Babylonia and he requested a letter of recommendation, Rabbi Chanina refused to give him such a letter not wishing to see a promising pupil leave the country. <sup>29)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">29) ירושלמי מועד קטן פּרק ג׳ הלבה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.51","The increasing lack of interest in Halacha and the difficult situation of the country led to the emigration of many scholars despite the opposition of others. This attitude toward Halacha is illustrated in the following story: ""Rabbi Abahu and Rabbi Chiya bar Aba once came to a city where Rabbi Abahu lectured in Hagada and Rabbi Chiya expounded Halacha. All the inhabitants of the city came to hear Rabbi Abahu but Rabbi Chiya had no audience. Rabbi Chiya was greatly hurt and Rabbi Abahu consoled him by saying that but few people go to buy valuable diamonds and pearls but everybody readily buys cheap toys."" <sup>30)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">30) סוטה מ׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.52","But Palestine still maintained a position of authority.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.53","Thirteen generations after Hillel the Old, another Hillel, the son of Rabbi Jehudah N'siah III, was elected Nasi. Of his activities we only know that in the year 359 (C.E.) he finally solved the problem of a calendar by basing it on exact calculations. The new calendar was to be permanent and all holidays were to be determined by it. The book of genealogy lists the following as the last N'siim: R. Hillel II, R. Gamliel V, R. Jehudah N'siah IV, and R. Gamliel VI (or Bathraah—the last). About sixty years passed from the time of Hillel II till R. Gamliel the VI, and this period was a very difficult one since it coincided with the rise of Christianity to power."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.54","The political decline of the Jews began during the reign of Constantine the Great and continued at an eccelerating pace. During the first years of his rule Constantine was quite tolerant to the Jews and he repealed the limitations which were imposed by Diocletian. He was then convinced that every man should have the right to choose his own faith and he also freed the Jewish scholars and all ""the servants of the synagogue"" from payment of taxes to the government. He recognized the Nasi as the head of the Jewish religious community and teachers of Jewish law were commanded to obey his edicts. But this liberalism of the emperor was not of long duration and soon after he embraced Christianity, he fell under the influence of religious fanatics and he was guided by them in his policies toward the Jews. The emperor's religious advisers followed the leadership of Bishop Sylvester of Rome, Bishop Paul of Byzantium and Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea. It was they who called the attention of the emperor to the belief that the Jews were a cursed and forsaken people condemned to suffering. They insisted that since the emperor had seen the light and had embraced the only true faith, he had to abstain from the sin of protecting the Jews."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.55","Constantine then ruled that Jews could not convert others to their faith, and if they did, both parties were to be punished. A free man who embraced Judaism was to lose all his property and a non-Jewish slave who was circumcised against his will was to be liberated. If a Jew who embraced Christianity was persecuted by other Jews, his tormentors were to be burned at the stake."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.56","All these years of persecution were only broken for a brief moment by the short-lived reign of Julian the Apostate who ruled for 18 months (Nov. 361—June 363). In his struggle against Christianity Julian befriended the Jews. He reduced the burden of their taxes, he did not allow them to be insulted and he called the Nasi ""Honored friend and brother."" In a letter to the Nasi Rabbi Hillel, he promised to improve the condition of the Jews and to permit the rebuilding of the temple after his return from the war with the Persians."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.57","After Hillel II the post of Nasi was occupied by his son Gamliel V. The Christian Church-father Hieronymus relates that Emperor Theodosius the Great, who ruled from 378 till 395, took the part of the Nasi against the Roman consul in Palestine, who infringed upon his rights, and had him executed."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.58","R. Gamliel V was succeeded by Rabbi Jehudah N'siah IV. The son of Rabbi Jehudah, Rabbi Gamliel VI, was the last Nasi. In his time the Roman empire was divided into two parts—eastern Rome with the capital at Constantinople (395-1453) and western Rome with its old capital (395-476). Rabbi Gamliel the last is mentioned in the decrees of emperor Honorius (395-424) and of Theodosius II (408-450)."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.59",There is also in existence a decree of the year 426 which commands that all the payments which the Jews of Palestine made to the Nasi should henceforth be paid to the imperial treasury. This decree was probably issued at the death of Rabbi Gamliel. Rabbi Gamliel the Sixth died childless and with him the dynasty of Hillel came to an end.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.60","Thus we find that although the Nasi was recognized by the government at all times his significance in the eyes of the Jews diminished toward the end. In religious matters he was no longer the highest authority and his political influence with the Roman officials was negligible. His only important religious functions were the consecration of the new month, the sending of messengers to report the appearance of the new moon, questioning the witnesses and the determination of the holidays and the leap years. Traditionally all of these had to be determined in the presence of the Great court in Palestine in order to be valid."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.61","The Romans frequently seized the messengers that were sent to announce these matters to the scholars in Babylonia which was outside the boundaries of the Roman empire. Whenever caught the messengers were hanged and few people volunteered for such dangerous work. Although the Babylonian scholars could calculate the time of the holidays and the leap years, they were not allowed by tradition to determine these occasions on the basis of their calculations. Thus it once occurred that throughout the month of Adar it was impossible to send messengers to Babylonia to announce that a leap year had been declared. Only late in the summer there were found people who were willing to risk their lives in this mission and the Babylonian Jews observed the month of Ab twice in order that the New Year might coincide with that in Palestine. The messengers were given a letter written in code so that in case they were caught the Romans should not be able to understand its contents. The letter read and was interpreted as follows: ""A pair (two witnesses) came from Reketh (Tiberias) and they were caught by the eagle (the Romans) who found in their possession things that are made in Luz (Tzitzith). Through God's mercy and because of their own merit they escaped in peace (from the hands of the Romans). The descendants of Nachshon (the Nasi who was descended from the tribe of Judah) wanted to decide upon a crescent (declare a leap year), but the Idumean (the Roman) did not permit them. But the men of the assemblies gathered and declared a crescent for the month that Aaron died (the month of Ab). <sup>35)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">35) סנהדרין י""ב א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.62","The function of determining new months and leap years lent some prestige to the Nasi and he had to be looked up to as the religious leader. But when Rabbi Hillel II established a permanent calendar he did away with the last important role of the Nasi. The office of Nasi thus became an empty title. The government looked upon the Nasi as upon a Jewish official, but the Jews could see no use in maintaining the office. Emperor Theodosius issued a decree that ""whoever insults the Nasi should be heavily punished."" From other sources we may conclude that this decree was aimed primarily at the Jews."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.63","We have previously recounted some of the laws promulgated by Constantine against the Jews, especially in relation to their attitude toward converts to Christianity. When he was informed that the Jews were planning a revolt against Rome he issued a decree prohibiting them from approaching the gates of Jerusalem. He also exhibited a certain sense of justice in not repealing a previous order which freed scholars and servants of the synagogue from taxes. In 336 he also ruled that Jews who embraced Christianity must not insult or do harm to their previous co-religionists."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.64","This law was very timely because new converts to Christianity persecuted the Jews, and before the latter could get redress from the governor or the emperor, much harm was accomplished. Such was the case of one Joseph of Tiberias who was considered to be one of the scholars of the court of the Nasi. The Nasi trusted him and sent him to gather the offerings of the people. When Joseph came to Cilicia in Asia Minor, it became obvious from his lectures that he was no longer an adherent of Judaism and the people would pay no attention to him. Joseph then said that he had been thrown into a river and was only saved through a miracle. After he openly embraced Christianity, the priests interceded for him with the emperor and he was appointed in charge of the new converts. Utilizing the confidence of the Emperor, Joseph fabricated numerous false stories about the Nasi and he particularly tried to convince the emperor that the Jews were planning revolt."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.65","The rumor of a planned revolt must have been based on some truth. We find that in 351 an attempt was made to overthrow the Romans. The records of that rebellion, both Jewish and non-Jewish, are very inadequate, but even from these meager sources we can obtain a picture of the events."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.66","The uprising began in the city of Sephoris which was a natural fortress. The Jews overwhelmed the Roman garrison of that city on a dark night and with the weapons which they seized they attacked other cities and succeeded in capturing Tiberias and Lud. Constantine II (350-361) dispatched several legions which subdued the uprising and mercilessly persecuted the rebels. Sephoris was destroyed entirely. Tiberias, Lud and southern Palestine were laid waste. The pursuit of the rebels continued until they were annihilated."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.67","The Roman commander Arsikanus was especially severe with the inhabitants of Sephoris who were forced to hide in the caves about Tiberias. Some of them tried to mask their faces in order not to be recognized, but numerous informers reported them to the authorities. <sup>36)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">36) ירושלמי יבמות פּרק ט""ז הלכה א׳, סוטה פּרק ט׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors.68","Because of the great perils that attended the announcement of the new months and leap years Rabbi Hillel II decided to do away with the traditional procedure and he established a permanent calendar. It was thus no longer necessary to question witnesses concerning the appearance of the new moon nor to send messengers to announce the findings to the Jews of foreign countries. In the matter of holidays, Jews in foreign countries were freed from the decisions of the ""Great Court"" in Palestine."

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.1","T<small>HE LIFE OF THIS PROMINENT</small> ""A<small>MORA</small>"" consisted of an unbroken chain of misfortunes. His parents he did not know, for he became an orphan at his birth. His father died before Jochanan was born and his mother died in childbirth. <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) קדושין ל""א ב׳.</span></i> When he came of age and married, Rabbi Jochanan became the father of ten sons all of whom died before him. Rabbi Jochanan then carried about the tooth of his tenth son who had died and he pointed out on all occasions that ""this is a bone of my dead tenth son."" <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) ברכות ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.2","The occupation of Rabbi Jochanan's father was hinted at when Rabbi Jochanan was called ""the son of the blacksmith."" <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) כתובות כ""ה ב׳, בבא מציעא פּ""ה ב׳, סנהדרין צ""ו א׳, ירושלמי ראש השנה פּרק ב׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> Since his father died before his birth, Rabbi Jochanan lived with his grandfather who made him the pupil of Rabbi Simeon bar Elazar. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) ירושלמי מעשרות פּרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.3","Rabbi Jochanan was gifted by nature with the highest physical and spiritual qualities. He possessed deep understanding exceeding that of others and he was renowned for his beauty. <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) ירושלמי עבודה זרה פּרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> His diligence was also uncommon and love of the Torah filled his whole being. Only once did he forsake study of the Torah when a friend of his named Ilfa, who was older and probably also better educated than Rabbi Jochanan, suggested that they engage in business in partnership. However, this venture did not last long and Rabbi Jochanan soon realized that it was undesirable to leave the permanent values of the Torah for the transitory gains of commerce. He then parted with his friend Ilfa and returned to the academy. <sup>6)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">6) תענית כ""א א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.4","The years of Rabbi Jochanan's youth coincided with the period of the last Tanaim and he often told of how in his early youth he attended the academy of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah where he sat 17 rows behind Rav (Aba Arecha) and he listened to the debates between the two whose words flew like coals of fire, but which he could not understand because of his unripe age. <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) חולין קל""ז ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.5","Later Rabbi Jochanan was a pupil of Rabbi Jannai Raba, <sup>8)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">8) בבא מציעא פּ""ח ב׳, בבא בתרא קנ""ד א׳.</span></i> but he also attended the lectures of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama, <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) נדה כ""ו ב׳, ירושלמי הוריות פּרק ב׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i> and when he began to lecture in the academy of Rabbi Banaa, Rabbi Chanina pronounced a benediction and praised God that he had been allowed to see the fruit of his labor. <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) ירושלמי בבא מציעא פּרק ב׳ הלכה י""א.</span></i> But even after he already ranked among the scholars, Rabbi Jochanan still heeded the words of older scholars and for a period of thirteen years he often attended the lectures of Rabbi Oshaiah in Caesarea. <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) ירושלמי ערובין פּרק ה׳ הלכה א׳, סנהדרין פּרק י""א הלכה ו׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.6","From the above we may conclude that Rabbi Jochanan was ready to learn from every one, but the foundation of his learning was the Mishna of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah. The Mishna he considered as his highest authority and he often repeated that ""I have nothing but the Mishna."" <sup>12)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">12) ירושלמי תרומות פּרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳, קדושין פּרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> He considered every word of the Mishna to be holy and he believed that nothing could be added nor detracted from it. <sup>13)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">13) ירושלמי נזיר פּרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.7","Rabbi Jochanan weighed and analyzed every word in the Mishna just as other scholars did to the text of the Torah. Statements of earlier scholars were sacred in his eyes and he said: ""The hearts of earlier scholars were as wide as the gate of a palace"" <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) ערובין נ""ג א׳.</span></i> and ""The least finger nail of an earlier scholar was of greater worth than the whole body of the later ones."" <sup>15)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15) יומא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.8","His belief in the words of earlier scholars was unshakable and every one of their statements was sacred in his eyes. He delved in antiquities and no other Amora strived as hard as he did to retain for later generations all the old traditions and what they signified. He therefore said: ""Whatever is written in the Mishna has been commanded to Moses from Mount Sinai."" <sup>16)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">16) ירושלמי פּאה פּרק ב׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.9","Many customs of that time were considered by the other scholars to have been originated by the ""Soferim"" for various purposes and any man who broke one of these customs was merely said to have transgressed a Rabbinical commandment. But Rabbi Jochanan declared, that even such customs as those regulating the quantity of matter in questions pertaining to the prohibition of the use of certain articles <sup>17)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">17) יומא ה׳ א׳, ירושלמי פּאה פּרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> or the customs of beating willow branches and pouring water during the feast of Succoth were laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai. <sup>18)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">18) ירושלמי שביעית פּרק א׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i> Likewise he declared that the Biblical prohibition against eating the fruit of trees which only began to bear, was mandatory also outside of Palestine as a Mosaic law. <sup>19)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">19) ירושלמי ערלה פּרק ג׳ הלבה ח׳.</span></i> It is also characteristic that he always spoke highly of the rabbinical commandments because of the fact that he considered all of these to partake of the same sacredness as the biblical commandments, <sup>20)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">20) פּסחים נ׳ ב׳.</span></i> and in this connection he said: ""The words of the scholars are very near to the words of the Torah and often they are even more loved by the people than the words of the Torah."" <sup>21)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">21) ירושלמי ברכות פּרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.10","Aside from his great learning Rabbi Jochanan was also renowned for his moral qualities which were equalled only by few others. Because of his love for learning he despised wordly advantage and he preferred a life of suffering if only he would not be disturbed in the sacred work. From his father, or from his grandfather, he inherited a small field between Sephoris and Tiberias, and even this he sold in order to be free from mundane cares."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.11","The death of his sons he suffered patiently and he found consolation in his studies. He was kind to all, even to his slave whom he gave meat to eat and wine to drink. When he was asked for the cause of such treatment of his slave he replied: ""The slave was born in the same manner that I was born."" <sup>22)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">22) ירושלמי בבא קמא פּרק ח׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.12","But although he led a pious life he believed that for the welfare of the community, or even for that of an individual, it was permissible to depart from the strict letter of the law. It was thus related that weak from hunger he once ate food without ascertaining whether it was clean. Another time he ruled that it was permissible to desecrate the Sabbath to save the life of a sick man who would later live to observe many Sabbaths. <sup>23)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">23) ירושלמי יומא פּרק ח׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i> He also appeared indifferent to the habit of the people of painting various images on the walls of their houses under the influence of their Greek neighbors, although this was against the injunction of the Bible not to make any graven images. <sup>24)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">24) ירושלמי עבודה זרה פּרק ג׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.13","He was likewise tolerant in his interpretation of Biblical passages. Thus he explained that the injunction not to let ""thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray"" (Deut. 22) applied even to the possessions of one who had renounced his Judaism. <sup>25)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">25) עבודה זרה כ""ו ב׳.</span></i> He also sought to modify the rule which forbade Jews to eat the flesh of an animal that was slaughtered by a Samaritan, if the slaughter was carried out in the presence of a Jew, who could testify that it had been performed according to law. It was then said that Rabbi Jochanan once ate of such flesh. <sup>26)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">26) חולין ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.14","Due to the difficult political and economic circumstances of the country, many sought to emigrate and to settle in the neighboring lands. In an attempt to stem the tide of emigration, the Talmudic teachers declared that any scholar who left the country to settle in a foreign land was to be excluded from their society. Rabbi Jochanan, on the other hand, was opposed to this measure. <sup>27)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">27) ירושלמי דמאי פּרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.15","In addition to his tolerance Rabbi Jochanan also preached patience toward sinners. This was especially true in the case of the relations with the Romans. The Romans showed contempt for the Jews and the latter repaid them with the same measure.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.64","When Rabbi Jochanan became convinced that no help could come from Babylonia he began to look forward to aid from Tiberias which was the last home of the Sanhedrin. <sup>82)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">82) ראש השנה ל""א ב׳.</span></i> In order to encourage the people and to persuade them to remain in the country he declared that God said: ""I cannot enter the heavenly Jerusalem until I have come to Jerusalem on earth,"" <sup>83)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">83) תענית ה׳ א׳.</span></i> or ""he who walks four ells in Palestine is certain of his share in life to come."" <sup>84)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">84) כתובות קי""א א׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.66","Of the old age of Rabbi Jochanan it is told that for a period of three and a half years he did not come to the academy out of grief for his brother-in-law who had died. <sup>86)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">86) ירושלמי מגלה פּרק א׳ הלכה י׳.</span></i> When he realized that his death was approaching he instructed those that were to bury him that he be interred in a shroud which was neither black nor white. For if he be buried in a black shroud he may, at the resurrection, come to life among just men and he would be put to shame. Likewise if he be buried in a white shroud, he may come to life among wicked men and he would be shamed by his garment of a just man. <sup>87)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">87) ירושלמי כלאים פּרק ט׳ הלכה ג׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה צ""ו פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.68","Aside from the statements of Rabbi Jochanan that we have quoted so far in connection with various moments of his life there also exist many expressions of his that are concerned with the interpretation of passages of the Bible. Although most of these are of value only in exposition, some of them contain important philosophic observations concerning the conduct of men and the ways of the world."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.69","At a certain period of Rabbi Jochanan's life it was forbidden to the Jews to determine the month through lunar observation and the Romans were especially strict in preventing them from celebrating their holidays. At the same time the observance of the Sabbath was not interfered with. Under the influence of Rabbi Jochanan the court in Tiberias therefore decided to observe the Day of Atonement on a Sabbath, although it really occurred on a week day, in order to deceive the Romans. The exact date of this occurrence is unknown as is also the duration of this decree. We can only guess under what administration this took place, for we only find hints about this event. <sup>88)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">88) חולין קנ""ה ב׳.</span></i> Historians are therefore confused as to the exact date and also as to the motive which prompted Rabbi Jochanan to instruct even the Jews of Babylonia to observe the Day of Atonement on a Sabbath, although the latter were not under the rule of the Romans and could have celebrated the Day of Atonement in its proper time. We find an explanation of this hinted in the statement of Rabbi Jochanan who said that the angels gather about God and ask him: ""When is the New Year and when is the Day of Atonement?"" and God answers them: ""Why do you ask me? Let us go to the Court on earth and we will find out."" <sup>89)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">89) ירושלמי ראש השנה פּרק א׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> By this statement he meant to imply that the court in Tiberias had the complete right to determine holidays as it saw fit under the circumstances."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.70","The following is a similar statement concerning the determination of holidays: If the court had said that today is New Year then God says to the angels: ""Erect a platform and let the prosecutor and the defense appear before me, for my children have said that today is New Year and so it shall be."" If the Court decided to postpone the New Year till the following day, then God says to the angels: ""Take this platform away and remove the prosecutor and the defense for my children have postponed the New Year till the following day and so it shall be."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.71","Rabbi Jochanan was always poor even when he headed the academy and when he received assistance from the Nasi. He then said: ""When one depends on the charity of men, the color of his face changes to pale and blue."" In general we may assume that it was very difficult to earn a livelihood at that time from his statement that ""It is difficult to earn a livelihood, twice as difficult as the pains of a woman in childbirth, more difficult than the arrival of the redemption."" <sup>90)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">90) פּסחים קי""ח א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.72","It appears that it was customary at that time for the people of a city to do the work of the scholars that resided there. When Rabbi Jochanan was asked how great a scholar one must be, to deserve such a service from his townsmen, he replied: ""Only a scholar who renounces all worldly occupations and devotes himself solely to heavenly matters deserves this service; but the obligation rests on the people only to provide him with his daily bread but not with luxuries."" <sup>91)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">91) שבת קי""ד א׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.74","There are grounds to assume that he also believed in hypnotism and in the ability of a person to convince himself that he was in a healthy or a sickly state. Thus it is told that when Rabbi Chama bar Aba fell sick Rabbi Jochanan came to visit him and asked him: ""Do you accept your suffering with love?"", by which he meant that suffering atones for the sins of man who enters the world to come purified of wrong doing. But the sick man replied: ""I do not want the suffering nor its reward."" ""Then give me your hand,"" Rabbi Jochanan said. Rabbi Chama gave him his hand and he was healed."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.75","Another version of this story relates that Rabbi Jochanan came to visit Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath who fell sick and he found him lying in a dark room. Rabbi Jochanan then bared his arm which illuminated the room and he saw that Rabbi Elazar was weeping. ""What is the cause of your weeping?"" he asked. ""Is it because you have not studied as much as you had wanted to? We have a rule that it is all the same whether one studies much or little and that only the good intention counts. Do you weep because you cannot earn your livelihood? One cannot deserve two tables, the table of the Torah and the table of worldly goods. Do you weep that you leave no son? Then look at me that I carry a bone of my tenth son."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.76","To this Rabbi Elazar replied: ""I weep because I am reminded that beauty such as yours will rot in the ground.""

""You must not say so,"" Rabbi Chanina answered, ""you should rather say that God is just."" It is further related that when Rabbi Jochanan's pains increased, Rabbi Chanina pronounced an incantation and the pain ceased. We may conclude from this Midrash that Rabbi Jochanan believed in incantations."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud.79","It must be remarked, however, that this matter is not entirely clear, for Rabbi Akiba had already declared that ""one who attempts to heal a wound with incantations loses his share in the life to come."" <sup>95)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">95) סנהדרין ק""א א׳, שבועות מ""ז ב׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.1","A<small>MONG THE DISCIPLES OF</small> R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HIYA</small>, Rabbi Jonathan ben Elazar, sometimes called <span dir=""rtl"">„שר הבירה""</span> or <span dir=""rtl"">„איש הבירה""</span> (the Man of the Capitol), was very prominent. He excelled in Hagada and after he reinterpreted some biblical text it seemed that it had never really been understood before. His deductions were primarily religious and ethical."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.2","The times were such that the masses of the people lost much of their interest in legal disputations and preferred the legendary explanations of the Scriptures and the wondrous stories concerning the heroes of the Bible. These stimulated their imagination and momentarily removed them from their sad realities into a beautiful world of dreams. We therefore find Rabbi Jonathan mentioned hundreds of times in Hagada, but only once in Halacha. <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) שׁבת מ""ט א׳ וב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.3","It appears that Rabbi Jonathan ben Elazar was a grain merchant and that he lived in Sephoris. He was a close friend of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama with whom he frequently discussed various matters. The following story is characteristic of the lifetime of Rabbi Jonathan. As he once came to a merchant to buy lentils, the merchant offered him wheat at a low price but demanded a high price for lentils. Rabbi Jonathan's relative then instructed him to inquire for the price of wheat whenever he wanted to buy lentils, so that he might obtain it at a low price. <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) מדרשׁ שׁוחר טוב פּרשׁה י""ב פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.4","Rabbi Jonathan also conducted an academy and one of his most prominent disciples was Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani, who often repeated the Hagadic sayings of Rabbi Jonathan. Rabbi Shmuel came from Babylonia to Palestine to ascertain the meaning of three biblical verses of which he was in doubt. He met Rabbi Jonathan who gave him a satisfactory explanation. Another version declares that he met Rabbi Jonathan in the street, but the latter refused to answer his questions there and instructed him to visit the academy where he would teach him the meaning of these verses. Rabbi Shmuel attempted to prove that it was permissible to teach the Torah in the street and he quoted Proverbs (1:20) to prove his contention. But Rabbi Jonathan declared that the reference was not to an ordinary street, but to a highway of learning. He added further that one does not sell precious stones in a vegetable market. <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) תנחומא בחוקותי פּיסקא נ׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.5","Rabbi Shmuel related that whenever Rabbi Jonathan came to the passage, ""For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it"" (Isaiah 28:20), he explained it to mean that the whole world is too small for God to share its rule with any other power. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) יומא ט׳ ב׳, סנהדרין ק""ג א׳.</span></i> This statement of Rabbi Jonathan is no doubt part of his argument against people who believed in dual rule out of conviction that God could not alone govern the world and required the assistance of another."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.6","Rabbi Jonathan was always kind to those he came in contact with and there is no mention of any outburst of anger on his part. But he was strict with Rabbi Simlai, who later became one of the outstanding exponents of Hagada; he said to Rabbi Simlai: ""It is a tradition of my forefathers not to teach Hagada to a Babylonian nor to an inhabitant of the south, for these possess vain pride and little Torah."" <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) ירושׁלמי פּסחים פּרק ה׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.7","The problem of fair judgment in Jewish courts was then of paramount importance and of this Rabbi Jonathan said: ""One who sits in judgment should consider that a sword hangs over his head and the pit of damnation opens at his feet, <sup>6)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">6) יבמות ק""ט בי.</span></i> for every judge who passes just sentence causes the Shechinah to dwell among Jews, but one who is unjust drives the Shechinah away and a judge who illegally deprives one man of his possessions and gives them to another will lose his life."" <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) סנהדרין ז׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.8","Rabbi Jonathan's custom when passing sentence in a dispute was illustrated by the following story: Rabbi Jonathan lived in the neighborhood of a Roman and the branches of a tree in his garden overhung the property of the Roman, who did not complain about this for a long time. One day two men came to Rabbi Jonathan to decide a dispute between them which involved such a case of an overhanging tree. Rabbi Jonathan heard the arguments of the contending parties and told them to return on the following day when he would pass sentence. The Roman was anxious to hear his decision and if he was to command that the tree be cut down, he would ask him, why he did not do so to his own tree. That evening Rabbi Jonathan had his tree trimmed of all branches overhanging the property of the Roman and when the litigants appeared on the following day, he commanded them to do likewise. To the query of the Roman, he replied: ""My tree has been trimmed since the previous night."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.9","Another story concerns a woman who brought a basket of figs as a gift to Rabbi Jonathan. He refused the gift and he asked the woman to take the basket back with her; if the basket of figs had been covered when she brought it then she should take it away covered, but if it had been uncovered then she should carry it out uncovered lest people should suspect that she had brought a basket of gold but was taking back a basket of figs. <sup>8)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">8) ירושׁלמי בבא בתרא פּרק ב׳ הלכה י""א.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.10","""He who commits a good deed,"" Rabbi Jonathan said, ""will be rewarded for it in the world to come and he who commits an evil deed will be followed by it until judgment day."" <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) סוטה ג׳ ב׳, עבודה זרה ה׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.11","Seven different sins bring punishment upon the whole world and the innocent suffer for them together with guilty; these sins are: slander, bloodshed, false oath, immorality, pride, robbery and envy. <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) ערכין ט""ז א׳.</span></i> Punishment for these sins is visited during a time when there are wicked men and the punishment first affects the just men. <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) בבא קמא ט׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.12","He who teaches Torah to the son of another man deserves to sit among the angels and one who teaches Torah to the son of an Am Haaretz, God will undo all decrees against Him. <sup>12)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">12) בבא מציעא פּ""ה א׳.</span></i> It is a worthy deed for a man to point out to his neighbor the evil of his ways and one who does so with pious intention merits the grace of God, <sup>13)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">13) תמיד כ""ח א׳.</span></i> but it is a sin to slander another person. However, should one do so to quarrelsome people then he has committed no sin, for against such people anything may be said. <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) ירושׁלמי פּאה פּרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.13","We may assume that Rabbi Jonathan disapproved of the kindness of the Romans, for he declared: ""The curse of Achijah of Shilo was preferable to the blessing of Balaam. Achijah cursed the Jews that they should shake like the reed which grows in the water, but water reeds are deeply rooted and no wind can uproot them; after the wind calms down the reed remains upright in its place. But Balaam blessed the Jews that they should be like cedar trees growing near water and even though all other winds will not budge a cedar tree, a south wind will uproot it."" <sup>15)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15) תענית כ׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.14","When Rabbi Jonathan heard the words of the pagans who could not understand how the Jews clung to their faith despite all suffering and persecutions he said: ""Other nations wish to know what is our consolation in time of need and how we withstand the anger of our God; we must tell them that even though He punishes us, He immediately heals us of our suffering and creates us anew."" <sup>16)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">16) אגדת בראשׁית פּרשׁה ח׳.</span></i> In line with this point of view was also Rabbi Jonathan's explanation of the origins of storms and he said: ""When God remembers that His children suffer among the Gentiles a sigh escapes Him and such sighs cause storms."" <sup>17)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">17) ברכות נ""ט א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.15","Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani quoted Rabbi Jonathan as follows: ""When Moses was writing the Torah and he reached the verse 'Let us make man', Moses said to God, 'Why do You give unbelievers an opportunity to say that You did not create man alone?' but God replied: 'Write as you are told and he who would err may err.' Later God added: 'Moses, these people whom I created consist of large ones and small ones and I give them an example that the great ones should consult the small ones before doing anything even as I consulted the angels before creating man.' "" <sup>18)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">18) בראשית רבה פּרשה ח׳ פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Jonathan Ben Elazar.16","When God completed the creation of the world, He looked upon it and found it good in His eyes. Rabbi Jonathan compared this to a king who was giving his daughter in marriage and who prepared a beautiful canopy for the bride. As the king looked upon the canopy he said to his daughter: ""Daughter, may I always be as pleased with this canopy as I am pleased now.""

Among these he occupied an important position and his life history was surrounded with wondrous legends. It was said that he spoke to the prophet Elijah as one speaks to an equal and that he obtained from him whatever he requested. When in doubt concerning the meaning of some passage he would send Elijah to inquire its meaning from the deceased Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai. <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) בראשית רבה פּרשה ל""ה פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i> Often he prayed for rain and his prayer was never denied.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.2","Some people claimed that Rabbi Joshua was a son of Levi ben Sisi who had been a disciple of Rabbi Jehudah. But this appears to be unlikely since Levi ben Sisi came from Babylonia whereas Rabbi Joshua was a Palestinian, also, had he been the son of the renowned Tana, he would have quoted his father in legal matters. <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) יבמות מ""ה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.3","Rabbi Joshua was a pupil of many of the scholars of his time. For a time he even attended the academy of Rabbi Jehudah whose legal observances he later quoted. The high esteem in which Rabbi Joshua was held here is apparent from the fact that one of his statements was included in the ""Boraithoth"" to the tractate of Aboth. This statement declares that every day a ""Bath Kol"" is heard from Mount Horeb announcing: ""Woe to those who allow the Torah to be put to shame."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.4","Rabbi Joshua lived in Judea, in the city of Lud where he was born and where he also headed an academy. We may assume that he was already prominent during the days of Rabbi Chiya, for it was told that Rabbi Chiya once visited him in Lud and in honor of the guest 24 different courses were served. Rabbi Chiya was surprised and asked what they did on the Sabbath if so many courses were offered during a week day. Rabbi Joshua then told him that the number of courses was doubled on Saturday. Some time later Rabbi Joshua visited Rabbi Chiya and the latter gave his pupils several golden ducats with which to buy food for a repast such as Rabbi Joshua was accustomed. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) איכה רבתי פּרשה ג׳ פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.6","Rabbi Joshua was an authority in both Halacha and Hagada, but from some of his declarations we gather that he did not approve of Hagada.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.11","Like many of his contemporaries Rabbi Joshua often disputed with the ""Minim"" (early Christians), but he based his arguments on sentiment rather than on logic. This gave rise to the opinion that his opposition to Hagada was a result of the fact that the ""Minim"" often used biblical passages to uphold their views. One of the ""Minim"" especially caused much trouble to Rabbi Joshua and he was ready to curse him, but he remembered that God had mercy on all his creatures and he refrained. <sup>21)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">21) ברכות ז׳ א׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.18","We have previously mentioned the ""intimacy"" between Rabbi Joshua and Elijah which legends described. One of these legends relates that Rabbi Joshua once met Elijah at the mouth of the cave where Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai hid for thirteen years and he asked him when Messiah would come. Elijah replied that he would have to ask Messiah and Rabbi Joshua said: ""Did I but know where he is I would ask him."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.19","Then Elijah said: ""He sits at the gate of the great city"" (referring to Antioch or Caesarea where the Romans had their camp). He also gave him a token whereby he could recognize him saying that Messiah sat among the sick beggars."

When Rabbi Joshua complained that Messiah had deceived him in saying that he would arrive on that day, Elijah informed him that he would have come that day, had every one obeyed the will of God as is indicated by the Biblical verse: ""This day, if you will heed his voice."" <sup>28)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">28) סנהדרין צ""ח א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.23","Another legend related that a man had been devoured by a lion three miles from where Rabbi Joshua lived. This caused Elijah not to appear to R. Joshua for three days, because Elijah felt that R. Joshua should have prayed to God that such an occurrence should not have happened so near his home. <sup>29)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">29) מכות י""א א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.24","Legend coupled the name of Rabbi Joshua with the prophet Elijah on still another occasion. A certain man, Ula ben Kushab, had incurred the anger of the Roman authorities and soldiers were sent to capture and to execute him. But this man hid in the house of Rabbi Joshua and the soldiers surrounded the city and threatened to destroy it, if the man was not handed over to them. Rabbi Joshua then persuaded the man to surrender to the Romans and thus save the city. He even pointed out that a law in the Mishna permitted surrendering a man to the government when a whole city was threatened as was the case at Abel when Joab besieged the city and the inhabitants gave him the head of Sheva ben Bichri who had revolted against king David.<sup>*)</sup><i class=""footnote"">*) This proof of Rabbi Joshua is contained in Tosephta (<span dir=""rtl"">תרומות פּרק ז׳ הלכה כ""ג</span>) and not in the Mishna.</i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.25","After Ula bar Kushab surrendered to the Romans, Elijah failed to appear to Rabbi Joshua for a long time. Rabbi Joshua then fasted a number of times and Elijah finally appeared to him. When he was asked why he did not appear for such a long time, Elijah replied: ""How could I appear before an informer?"""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.26","""Have I not acted according to the Mishna?"" Rabbi Joshua asked. But Elijah retorted: ""Is this a Mishna to be observed by pious people? A man like you should not have been involved in this matter."" <sup>30)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">30) ירושלמי תרומות פּרק ה׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.27","Rabbi Joshua also maintained friendly relations with the angel of death whom he deceived when the latter came to take his soul. He asked the angel of death to show him his place in Paradise and the angel gave him his sword to carry on the way as a token that he would not harm him. When they reached the gate of Paradise, Rabbi Joshua jumped in alive. The angel of death seized his garment in an attempt to hold him back, but Rabbi Joshua escaped. The angel then begged for his sword, but Rabbi Joshua refused to return it until a Bath Kol commanded: ""Return the sword for the world needs it."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.28","Glad to have regained his sword, the angel of death departed and the prophet Elijah proceeded before Rabbi Joshua announcing: ""Make way for the son of Levi."" As Rabbi Joshua looked about himself, he saw Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai seated on thirteen rugs of gold. Rabbi Simeon asked him: ""Are you the son of Levi?"" and Rabbi Joshua replied that he was. ""Has a rainbow been seen during your lifetime?"" Rabbi Simeon asked, and Rabbi Joshua answered that a rainbow was seen. ""Then you are not the son of Levi,"" Rabbi Simeon said, ""for your merit should have protected your generation so that no rainbow should be needed."" As a matter of fact no rainbow was seen during the lifetime of Rabbi Joshua, which was the best proof of his piety, but he refused to boast of it. <sup>31)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">31) כתובות ע""ז ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.29","Another time Rabbi Joshua engaged in conversation with the angel of death and the latter instructed him to avoid three things in order to escape death. One of these was not to stop in front of women who return from a funeral, for the angel of death is then among them with his sword and he has permission to do harm. <sup>32)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">32) ברכות נ""א א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.30","As was previously mentioned, Rabbi Joshua issued ordination without the consent of the Nasi. This was not a sign of opposition to the Nasi. He merely did not want to see Babylonia become a center of ordination, for it frequently happened that those who encountered difficulties in obtaining ordination in Palestine went to Babylonia to have themselves ordained. Rabbi Joshua therefore ruled that ordination obtained in foreign countries was not valid. <sup>33)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">33) סנהדרין י""ד א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.31","Rabbi Joshua taught his own children and he was accustomed to hear his grandson repeat the portion of the week every Friday.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.32","Although Rabbi Joshua insisted that the Hagada should remain oral and declared that: ""Only once have I read a book of Hagada and since then I am afraid of evil dreams,"" Hagada nevertheless occupied a prominent place in his lectures and a great number of them were repeated in his name. He entrusted one of his disciples with the arrangement of the Hagadoth. <sup>35)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">35) ברכות י׳ א׳.</span></i> Tanchum ben Chanilai, another one of his disciples, was considered to be an authority in Hagada and was always consulted by Rabbi Chiya. <sup>36)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">36) בבא קמא נ""ד א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.33","The Biblical passage stating that all the days of a poor man are evil, Rabbi Joshua interpreted to indicate that any person who lacked wisdom, who was angry or who was covetous could be considered poor. Covetousness Rabbi Joshua considered to be the worst human trait and he said that ""whoever derives any benefit from a covetous person commits a sin, for king Solomon had commanded not to eat the bread of such a person."" <sup>37)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">37) בבא בתרא קמ""ה ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.34","When the body of a slain person was found and it was not known who the slayer was, the Bible enjoined that the elders of the nearest city must slaughter a heifer and declare that their hands had not shed the blood of the slain man. This passage was questioned by Rabbi Joshua who said: ""Could anyone suspect the elders of shedding the blood? What then did they have to declare?

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.42","Rabbi Joshua, who was on such ""intimate"" terms with the prophet Elijah and with the angel of death, once decided to visit Paradise and Gehenna. He spoke of this to the angel of death who was not at all pleased with this request. The angel of death complained to the then Nasi, Rabban Gamliel the Third, but Rabban Gamliel declared that Rabbi Joshua was right in his request and he commanded the angel of death to escort Rabbi Joshua. Rabban Gamliel also instructed the angel of death to request Rabbi Joshua to send a complete description of what he saw to the Nasi. The Nasi was particularly curious to know whether there were any Jews in Gehenna or any pagans in Paradise."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.43","In his description what he saw, called ""Massecheth Gan Eden,"" Rabbi Joshua relates that he went throughout the length and breadth of Paradise which was divided into seven different parts. In one part of Paradise he found Elijah and the Messiah of the House of David, who asked him what the Jews were doing. Rabbi Joshua replied: ""They are waiting for your coming,"" whereupon Messiah wept bitterly and all the saints wept with him."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.44","Rabbi Joshua further relates that he was not admitted into Gehenna, but was merely allowed to stand at the gate and to observe that which went on within."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.45","""I have measured the area of Gehenna,"" Rabbi Joshua wrote, ""and I found it to be one hundred miles long and fifty miles wide. Fiery lions are stationed everywhere and whoever falls into Gehenna is devoured by these lions and is afterward recreated in his previous form. Later I measured a second part of Gehenna and I found it to be of the same dimensions as the first. I then asked: 'For whom is the first part set aside?' and I was informed that it was set apart for ten nations, and that among them was also Absalom, the son of king David, who rebelled against his father. One nation says to another: 'We have sinned in not accepting the Torah; what have you done?' and the other nation replies: 'We have committed the same sin that you have committed.' Then they all turn to Absalom and ask: 'What was your sin?' and Absalom replies: 'I have sinned against my father.' """
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.46","""An angel then beats them all with fiery rods and the name of the angel is Kushiel. He throws them into fire until they are burned and then they come out in their previous form. Finally the angel is ready to chastise Absalom, but a Bath Kol announces: 'Do not beat him, for he is descended from a people which promised at Mount Sinai to obey God's commandments before they even knew what these commandments would be.' """
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.47","""After all the sinners are chastised and burned, they emerge from the fire as if nothing had happened. This occurs seven times during each day and three times during each night. Only Absalom is neither chastised nor burned and his punishment consists in observing the others' chastisement."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.48","Of the second chamber of Gehenna Rabbi Joshua related the same as of the first. It also contained ten nations which were punished in the same manner as those in the first. Together with them was Doeg the Edomite who had been a guard of king Saul. The avenging angel was named Lahatiel and he did not chastise Doeg because of his Jewish descent. In the third chamber there were another ten nations and the name of the angel was Shaftiel. Korach and his congregation was found among these, but he also escaped chastisement and merely had to observe the punishment of the others."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.49","The fourth chamber contained ten nations and Jerobeam ben Nebat. The punishing angel was Machtiel. Jerobeam escaped punishment because of his knowledge of the Torah and because of his descent. The fifth chamber was similar to the preceding ones and it contained Ahab, king of Israel. The name of the angel was Chutriel. The sixth chamber contained Micah who built the famous idol of Micah. He was punished together with the others by an angel named Pusiel. The seventh chamber also contained ten nations and Elisha ben Avuyah. The name of the angel was Dalkiel."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.50",Of his visit in Paradise Rabbi Joshua also related the following:
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.51","""There are two gates of clear crystal and on top of each there stand six hundred thousand angels each of whose faces shines like the sky. When a saint enters they remove the garments in which he was buried and they dress him with eight new garments made out of clouds. Two crowns are then placed upon his head, one made out of precious stones and the other of pure gold; in addition they place eight strands of myrtle in his hands and they say to him: 'Go eat your bread in gladness.'

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.52","""He is then led to a place of rivers surrounded with flowers. A canopy of gold is erected and from the canopy there flow four rivers: one of oil, one of milk, one of wine and one of honey.

To every canopy is attached a table laden with precious stones and pearls and sixty angels stand ready to serve every saint and they say to him: 'Eat your honey and drink your wine, for it has been prepared for you since the six days of the creation.' Even the least of the saints equals Rabbi Jochanan in beauty and is endowed with grace like that of Joseph."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.53","""There is no night in Paradise, and each day is divided into four parts. During the first part God comes to the children and plays with them as one would with children; during the second part God comes to the young men and plays with them as one would with young men; during the third part God comes to the middle aged men and plays with them as one would with middle aged people; during the fourth part of the day God comes to the aged and converses with them as one would with aged people."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi.54"," ""There are eighty thousand trees in every corner of Paradise and the least of them is more beautiful than incense trees. There are also six hundred thousand angels in every corner and they all sing the praise of the Creator."""

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.1","R<small>ABBI</small> O<small>SHAIA WAS A DISCIPLE</small> of Bar Kapara and Rabbi Chiya Raba. The title ""Raba"" was added to his name, to distinguish him from a later ""Amora"" of the same name."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.2","Collaborating with his master Rabbi Chiya, Rabbi Oshaia compiled over seventy Boraithoth and it became an accepted rule to doubt the authencity of any Boraitha which was not examined and explained by these two, <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) חולין קמ""א א׳.</span></i> for—as Rashi explains—they were careful to repeat every word as it was originally said unlike the other scholars who often added to the texts which they received."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.3","Some scholars even referred to Rabbi Oshaia as ""the father of the Mishna."" <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) ירושׁלמי בבא קמא פּרק ד׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i> But primarily he was the first commentator on the Mishna because of his position as disciple of Rabbi Chiya who passed on to him the opinions which he had heard from Rabbi Jehudah. The Boraithoth of Rabbi Oshaia are therefore referred to as ""the great Mishnayoth."" <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) ירושׁלמי הוריות פּרק ג׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.4","Rabbi Oshaia was descended from a family of scholars and his father, R. Chama bar Bisa, was highly respected by Rabbi Jehudah who called him ""a great man."" <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) נדה י""ד ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Oshaia was at first a pupil of Bar-Kapara and later of Rabbi Chiya. <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) ירושׁלמי שׁבת פּרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> It appears that he also studied with Rabbi Ephes for some time and he accompanied him on a journey to Antioch in the interests of the people. In addition he maintained close relations with Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the first. <sup>6)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">6) ירושלמי ביצה פּרק א׳ הלכה י""א, בבא קמא פּרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.5","Throughout the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the first Oshaia attended his academy at Sephoris and it was his duty to go to Ein Tov every month to question the witnesses concerning the appearance of the new moon in order to determine the beginning of the new month. As long as it was possible it was customary to hear such testimony in a city of Judea and the Nasi who lived in Galilee maintained a court in Ein Tov. <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) ירושׁלמי נדרים פּרק ו׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.6","Of Rabbi Chama, the father of Rabbi Oshaia, it was said that he engaged in study away from home for twelve years. When he returned and entered the academy he did not recognize his son. In the discussion that followed Rabbi Chama was amazed at the learning of the young man and he felt grieved that he had been away for so long and had neglected the education of his son. As he came home he was met by his son, but he thought that the young man followed him to continue the discussion and he rose out of reverence. His wife then remarked to him: ""Who has ever seen a father rise to greet his son?"" <sup>8)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">8) כתובות ס""ב ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.7","Rabbi Chama was a judge together with Bar-Kapara during the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) מועד קטן כ""ב א׳.</span></i> and he is frequently mentioned in the Talmud as the father of Rabbi Oshaia. <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) ירושׁלמי מועד קטן פּרק ג׳ הלכה ה׳, נדה פּרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.8","Rabbi Bisa, the grandfather of Rabbi Oshaia, was also a scholar and at least on one occasion he sided with his grandson against his father in some legal question. <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) בבא בתרא נ""ט ב׳.</span></i> Various legal opinions of Rabbi Bisa were also quoted by the scholars at Caesarea. <sup>12)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">12) ירושׁלמי גטין פּרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.9","Following the death of Rabbi Jehudah N'sia the first, the Nasi was no longer the head of the Sanhedrin and Rabbi Oshaia established an academy in Caesarea which was attended by many scholars. <sup>13)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">13) ירושׁלמי תרומות פּרק י׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> The Christian Church-father Origines appears to have had religious discussions with Rabbi Oshaia and during one of these (the Midrash there mentions the name as ""Philosophos"" instead of Origines) he was asked why God had not commanded Adam to practice circumcision if this commandment was of such great significance. Rabbi Oshaia replied with a counter question: ""Why do men shave the hair on their heads but not their beards?"" <sup>*)</sup><i class=""footnote"">*) The question of Rabbi Oshaia was in accord with the oriental custom of allowing the beard to grow which was also followed by Origines. It could not have applied to the Romans who shaved their beards but allowed the hair on their heads to grow.</i> Origines replied: ""Because the hair on one's head grows since childhood when man was still foolish, but the beard begins to grow when man attains wisdom."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.10","""According to your answer,"" Rabbi Oshaia said, ""I could say that man should gouge his eyes or cut off his arms or break his legs, since these have grown with him since childhood. But the matter is entirely different for everything that was created requires improvement. Thus there are various bitter herbs which man eats after they are sweetened; wheat cannot be eaten as it grows, but must first be ground and only then can it be kneaded and baked. It is likewise true of man that he needs to be improved."" <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) בראשׁית רבה פּרשׁה י""א פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.11","Among the prominent followers of Rabbi Oshaia there was Rabbi Jochanan who declared that Rabbi Oshaia was as great in his generation as Rabbi Meir had been in his and even as Rabbi Meir was often misunderstood by his contemporaries, likewise were Rabbi Oshaia's ways often misunderstood. <sup>15)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15) ערובין נ""ג א׳.</span></i> Another disciple was Rabbi Pinchas, who gathered all the lectures of Rabbi Oshaia and these were later included in ""Midrash Raba"" on the book of Genesis."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.12","Rabbi Oshaia was a poor man and the Nasi often aided him. On a certain Purim he sent him meat and wine and Rabbi Oshaia told him that he had fulfilled both commandments of sending gifts to one's friends and donations to the poor. <sup>16)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">16) מגלה ז׳ א׳, ירושׁלמי מגלה פּרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.13",The following are some of the statements of Rabbi Oshaia:
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.14","He who strives for perfection in his conduct will certainly succeed, but one who is vainly proud will go to Gehenna. <sup>17)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">17) עבודה זרה י""ח א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.15","Why are the words of the Torah compared to water, wine and milk? These three liquids may be kept in cheap vessels and the words of the Torah are retained only by those who are humble. <sup>18)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">18) תענית ז׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.16","God was gracious to the Jews in that he scattered them among the nations and thus saved them from annihilation. When they suffer in one country, they are treated kindly in another land. <sup>19)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">19) פּסחים פּ""ו ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.17","Speaking of the same subject on another occasion, he explained it with a passage from the Bible. When Esau came to meet Jacob, Jacob had said: ""If Esau come to the company and smite it (referring to the Jews in Palestine), then the other company which is left shall escape"" (referring to the Jews in the lands of the Diaspora). But although the Jews in the Diaspora do not suffer as much as we do, they nevertheless fast every Monday and Thursday to intercede with God in our behalf. <sup>20)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">20) בראשׁית רבה פּרשׁה ע""ו פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.18","When Jews obey their leaders but the leaders do not that which is necessary than the blame is with the leaders. It is as if one blackens his hands and then wipes them on the wall; the wall is blackened thereby but his hands do not become clean. <sup>21)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">21) דברים רבה פּרשׁה א׳ פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Oshaia Raba.19","The prophet Zechariah said: Behold I take two canes, one of them I call ""Noam"" (pleasant) and the other I call ""Chovlim"" (pain). We may say that ""Noam"" refers to the scholars of Palestine and ""Chovlim"" refers to the scholars of Babylonia who cause each other pain with their constant doubts and questions while the scholars of Palestine are dear and pleasant to each other; they sit together and in study each improves the words of the other until the law becomes clarified. <sup>22)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">22) סנהדרין כ""ב א׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.1",A<small>FTER THE PERIOD OF THE BLOSSOMING OF LEARNING</small> in Palestine during the lifetime of Rabbi Jochanan and Resh Lakish a decline set in. This decline had been apparent for some time and was becoming more noticeable daily. A descendant of Hillel still occupied the office of Nasi and was thus the legal representative of the people. But the later N'siim were not noted for scholarly achievements and the veneration of the people toward them diminished. In time they lost all spiritual authority.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.2","<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">*) The name Bar-Nachmani is used throughout the Babylonian Talmud (with one exception). The Jerusalem Talmud uses the name Bar-Nachman throughout, except on four occasions, where Bar-Nachmani is employed.</i>Rabbi Shmuel Bar-Nachmani was one of the spiritual leaders of the people during this period. He left few legal decisions, but he was one of the most prominent exponents of the Hagada. He repeated hundreds of Hagadic statements of previous ""Amoraim"" and his disciples quoted hundreds of his own interpretations. All questions pertaining to Hagada during his lifetime were always referred to him for clarification. <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) ויקרא רבה פּרשה ל""א פּיסקא א׳, איכה רבתי פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא מ""ג.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.3",Rabbi Shmuel Bar-Nachmani was born in Palestine and while still a child his grandfather often carried him on his shoulders through Beth Shean on his way to Kefar Chanan that he should see the scholars at study and that he should absorb the sound of their voices. This took place during the last days of Rabbi Jehudah haNasi and it was then an accepted belief that a child which looked at Rabbi Jehudah or was in his presence for a few minutes was certain to become a scholar.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.4","Another legend related that Rabbi Shmuel was born in Babylonia and only came to Palestine to ask of Rabbi Jonathan the meaning of three verses in the Bible concerning which he was in doubt. But this apparent contradiction may be explained by the fact that Rabbi Shmuel spent his youth in Babylonia, where favorable circumstances prevailed, and that he later returned to Palestine. Rabbi Shmuel visited Babylonia a number of times at the request of the High Court of Palestine in order to determine ""leap years"" when that could not be done in Palestine. On one of these trips he spent a night in the house of Rabbi Jacob the Miller. That night Rabbi Zeira hid among the barrels in the house in order to hear Rabbi Shmuel recite the ""Shema"" and he later told that Rabbi Shmuel repeated the Shema many times until he was overcome by sleep. <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) ירושלמי ברכות פּרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Shmuel is also known to have been sent, together with his mother, to intercede with queen Zenobia for the life of a political offender."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.5","Rabbi Shmuel Bar-Nachmani lived for more than one hundred years and the time of his influence extended from the days of Rabbi Jonathan, whose pupil he had been, until the rule of Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the Second. It appears that the Nasi did not approve of Rabbi Shmuel and when he once asked him the interpretation of the expression ""by his name Jah"" (Psalms, 68:4), he was dissatisfied with the reply and remarked: ""It is regrettable that those scholars who could interpret this passage better are already dead."" <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) בראשית רבה פּרשה י""ב פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.6","At that time there broke out a famine and an epidemic and the people were at a loss for the deliverance of which of the calamities they were to pray. Rabbi Shmuel advised them to pray for the cessation of the famine, for ""when God will give us food, He will also grant us life during which to enjoy the food."" <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) תענית ח׳ ב׳.</span></i>. He also instructed that teachers should dismiss their pupil from eleven o'clock in the morning until three in the afternoon during the time between the seventeenth day of Tamuz and the ninth day of Ab, for this was a difficult period for the pupils who might lose their health from too great effort. <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) איכה רבתי פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ל׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.7","When Rabbi Shmuel grew old and realized that the Nasi did not regard him favorably he but rarely attended the academy. During one of his infrequent visits he found the scholars debating the request of a man to annul an excommunication which was imposed upon him by Rabbi Jehudah ben Ezekiel. Since R. Jehudah was dead at that time the scholars were inclined to consider favorably the petition of the man. But Rabbi Shmuel said: ""The maidservant of Rabbi Jehudah haNasi once banned a man who had beaten his grown up son and the scholars honored her decision; would you revoke the excommunication of our comrade Rabbi Jehudah?"" His opinion was then accepted and the ban was not lifted. <sup>6)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">6) מועד קטן י""ז א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.8",The following are characteristic expressions of Rabbi Shmuel:
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.9","""Everything in the world was created by God, except falsehood which is an outgrowth of human imagination."" <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) פּסיקתא רבתי פּ׳ כ""ד.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.10","After completing the creation of the world God saw everything that He had made and ""it was very good."" Rabbi Shmuel declared that ""very good"" referred to man's evil desires, for if it were not for these no man would build a house, nor marry a wife, nor beget children, nor engage in commerce. <sup>8)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">8) בראשית רבה פּרשה ה׳ פּיסקא ט׳, קהלת רבה פּרשה ג׳ פּיסקא ט""ז.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.11","Rabbi Shmuel devoted himself to classifying the prayers. One must pray thrice daily, he said, to conform with the three changes which occur every day. In the morning one should say: ""I thank Thee my God and God of my fathers for bringing me out of darkness into light."" In the afternoon one should say: ""May it be Thy will to permit me to see the sun in the West even as You allowed me to see it in the East."" At night one should pray: ""May it be Thy will to lead me out of darkness into the light even as You had led me out of darkness into light before."" <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) ירושלמי ברכות פּרק ד׳ הלכה א׳, בראשית רבה ס""ה י""א.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.12","Rabbi Shmuel lived during the last years of the third century C.E., when the Christians began the attempt to postpone the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday. Rabbi Shmuel opposed this effort with all his might and he warned the Jews against assuming that the Sabbath could be postponed to another day. ""Why did God bless the Sabbath?"" he said, ""because it may never be postponed to another day. Holidays and even the Day of Atonement may be postponed, when a leap year is declared, but not the Sabbath."" <sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) בראשית רבה פּרשה י""א פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i> <sup>*)</sup><i class=""footnote"">*) As long as the Jewish calendar was not definitely determined, it was the duty of the High Court to determine the holidays as they saw fit and even the Day of Atonement could be postponed, it has proved as when Rabbi Simeon b. Gamliel the First commanded Rabbi Joshua ben Chananiah to appear before him bearing his cane and his wallet on the day that he considered to be the Day of Atonement.</i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.13","Some of the Amoraim believed that Sabbaths and holidays were to be devoted to the study of the Torah solely, while others allowed half of these days to be utilized for personal enjoyment. <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) פּסחים ס""ח ב׳.</span></i> But Rabbi Shmuel declared that the Sabbath should be devoted to food and drink and that only in order to avoid idle talk was it allowed also to engage in study on that day. <sup>12)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">12) ירושלמי שבת פּרק ט""ו הלכה ג׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.14","The verse ""Many waters cannot quench love"" (Song of Songs, 8:7) Rabbi Shmuel interpreted in the following manner: Two kinds of love are referred to, the love of God for Israel which is so great that were all the nations of the world to try to thwart it, they could not do so, and the love of Israel for the Torah. Were all the nations to say: ""We will sell all our possessions in order to observe the Torah and its commandments,"" God would reply to them: ""Even if you were to sell all your possessions to obtain the Torah, you would only be ridiculed."" <sup>13)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">13) במדבר רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא ט""ז.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.15","The destruction of the Temple played an important role in the mode of thought of Rabbi Shmuel. Nearly two centuries had already elapsed since the destruction and none thought about sacrifices any longer. Many of the scholars of the time disapproved of sacrifices or had ignored the matter. The express commandments of the Torah to offer sacrifices, they easily refuted with passages from the Prophets such as the statement of Jeremiah that ""I spoke not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices"" (7:22). But the Temple remained a symbol of the liberation of the people and it was always mentioned with the hope of its speedy restoration and the renewal of the service as in days of old. It is also interesting to note that the people feared to speak of the second temple and they therefore always referred to the first temple. They spoke of Babylonians, but meant the Romans, they referred to Nebusaradon or Nebuchadnezzar, but really meant Titus or the reigning emperor."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani.16","Like other scholars Rabbi Shmuel also spoke of the destruction of the Temple in his lectures. Many such lectures are included in the introduction to ""Midrash Eicha Rabathi"" and these describe how Jeremiah went to the graves of the Patriarchs and begged them to intercede with God. It was characteristic of the times that the belief was commonly held that Rachel rose from her grave and wept at the fate of her children. Her weeping aroused pity in heaven and she was assured that they would soon be redeemed from the land of the enemy. (Jeremiah, 31:14.) Such descriptions delivered by good orators profoundly impressed the people."

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish.1","T<small>HE ACADEMY OF</small> R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>OCHANAN</small> was open for all those who sought learning. Men of two generations prided themselves on being disciples of Rabbi Jochanan. Among these there were some who saw and heard Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi, but themselves remained disciples while he grew in stature to become one of the most outstanding Amoraim. Among his disciples there were also some who themselves headed academies, but who came to the academy of Rabbi Jochanan in Tiberias as often as they could in order to be able to call themselves his disciples although their circumstances did not compel them to do so."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish.2","Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish was one of the most prominent of these colleagues and disciples of Rabbi Jochanan. In the Talmud he is more commonly referred to as Resh Lakish. <sup>*)</sup><i class=""footnote"">*) Resh Lakish is an abbreviation of Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish (<span dir=""rtl"">ר""ש</span>). The mark indicating the abbreviation was in time transformed into a Yud. We may also remark that his appelation Ben Lakish does not prove that Lakish was the name of his father, but might indicate that he was a native of a city called Lakish, possibly the biblical ""Lachish."" One of the last Tanaim was also called Rabbi Jehudah ben Lakish, and in this case also the appelation may indicate the city of origin rather than the name of the father.</i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish.3","Very little is known definitely of the youth of Resh Lakish and numerous terrifying legends surround his early years. It was said that he befriended robbers and that he was a robber himself. While going about the banks of the Jordan armed from head to foot, he saw a woman bathing and he entered the water. But the figure which he saw bathing was not a woman. Instead it was Rabbi Jochanan who remarked to him that such unusual strength as he seemed to possess should rightfully be devoted to the Torah. Resh Lakish replied: ""Such beauty as you possess, should belong to a woman."" Rabbi Jochanan is said to have told him: ""If you will turn to learning, I will give you my sister, who is more beautiful than I am, for a wife."" Resh Lakish then promised to give up his occupation and to turn to learning and he married the sister of Rabbi Jochanan. <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) בבא מציעא פּ""ד א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish.4","The legend is highly questionable and does not agree with other accounts of the youth of Resh Lakish. Thus it was accepted as a fact that in his youth he was a companion of Rabbi Jochanan in the academy of Rabbi Jehudah which would make any such error as the legend ascribes to him out of the question. Nor is there any mention anywhere as to who the teacher of Resh Lakish had been, for although he attended the academy of Rabbi Jehudah together with Rabbi Jochanan, they were both very young at that time and could not have been direct pupils of Rabbi Jehudah, although in later life they both declared that were it not for their contact with Rabbi Jehudah, they would not have attained their status as scholars. <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) ירושלמי ביצה פּרק ה׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish.5","It appears that both, Resh Lakish and Rabbi Jochanan, attained prominence rapidly, but Resh Lakish continued to be considered a disciple of the latter despite the fact that his importance was great enough, so that problems were brought to him for decision in the absence of Rabbi Ephes who was a disciple and a member of the household of the Nasi. <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) ערובין ס""ה ב׳.</span></i> In scholarship, however, the two were considered to be of the same rank by the Nasi and by Rabbi Hoshaia Raba. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) יבמות נ""ז א׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish.16","The reason why Resh Lakish never came to head an academy either in Tiberias or in any other city despite the fact that he was considered worthy for such a post is explained by the fact of his past, when he interrupted his scholarly career and followed ways not befitting a scholar. Like Rabbi Jochanan who left the academy for a short time to engage in commerce Resh Lakish also abandoned his studies for a time but not to engage in commerce. Instead he became a gladiator. <sup>28)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">28) שבת קי""ט ב׳, גטין מ""ז א׳.</span></i> <sup>*)</sup><i class=""footnote"">*) The Talmud says that ""he sold himself to the Luddites"" and some commentators said that the ""Luddites"" were a people of cannibals.

Resh Lakish then pursued the robbers and retrieved the stolen wealth."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish.19","Because of these stories there were rumors that Resh Lakish associated with robbers. The truth of the matter was that because of his poverty, for he had no income from his scholastic endeavors, he sometimes hired out as a gladiator and at other times as a watchman, but he is not known to have done any harm and even the robbers against whom he was supposed to protect he merely threatened with excommunication and not with that punishment which they deserved. Rabbi Jochanan brought Resh Lakish back to the Torah, as we have previously related, but even after he abandoned his earlier calling, the people continued to remember it. When Rabbi Jochanan was called upon to answer a question pertaining to knives and how they are contaminated, Resh Lakish found the correct answer and Rabbi Jochanan remarked: ""A robber understands in matters of his trade."" He said this although Resh Lakish was then already his brother-in-law and was held to be his equal in learning."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish.20","Like Rabbi Jochanan Resh Lakish also disliked the Babylonians who prided themselves on the fact that, when the Jews returned from Babylonia to Palestine, only the poorer families left while the more aristocratic remained behind.

Frequently he even spoke of it himself and he often introduced his remarks by comparing the situation in question to ""two athletes.""

Hundreds of these are quoted in the Babylonian Talmud in his name, but the Jerusalem Talmud contains only one Hagadic quotation from Rabbi Simlai. <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) פּאה פּרק ה׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.2","Rabbi Simlai was born in Babylonia in the city of Nehardea. The exact location of this city is unknown aside from the fact that it was situated on the river Malka, somewhere between the Tigris and the Euphrates. It is also known that Jews began to settle in that city several decades after the destruction of the Temple. Various horrifying stories were at first told about Nehardea, but later it became known as the seat of prominent academies which rivalled those in Jabneh and Tiberias."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.3","Rabbi Simlai's father was always referred to as ""Aba, the father of Rabbi Simlai."" However, he was a significant man in his own right and it was related that he once asked Shmuel Yarchinai, the mathematician of the Talmud, a question pertaining to the determination of ""leap years"" which the latter could not answer despite the fact that he had boasted that he could calculate the beginning of each month without recourse to the testimony of witnesses who had seen the new moon. On this occasion the father of Rabbi Simlai is said to have remarked: ""If you cannot answer this question, then it is entirely possible that there are other matters which you do not know."" <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) ראש השנה כ׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.4","When Rabbi Simlai arrived in Palestine he settled in Lud, but later he moved to Galilee where he spent most of the time in the city of the residence of the Nasi. Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First was Nasi at the time of his arrival. The following conversation is said to have taken place between the two, as the Nasi once leaned on the shoulder of Rabbi Simlai during a stroll: ""Yesterday you were absent from the academy when we permitted the use of oil bought from Gentiles,"" the Nasi said and Rabbi Simlai replied: ""I will yet live to see the day when you will permit the use of Gentile bread."" <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) עבודה זרה ל""ז א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.5","This new regulation was announced in Babylonia by a pupil of Rabbi Simlai, although it is also possible that Rabbi Simlai himself was delegated by the Nasi to announce the new regulation. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) ירושלמי עבודה זרה פּרק ב׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.6","In later life Rabbi Simlai served Rabbi Jannai the Old <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) בבא בתרא קי""א א׳.</span></i> and he was also a close friend of Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the Second. <sup>6)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">6) בכורות ל""ו ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.7","His debates with the ""Minim"" (Christian Jews), who annoyed him with various questions, are interesting. Since the Hebrew word ""Elohim"" (God) is in the plural form, the Minim asked him, how many gods shared in the creation of the world. Rabbi Simlai replied that the further text amply answered their question; thus the Bible says: ""Let us make man in our image"" (in the plural) and this is followed by ""God created man in his own image"" (in the singular). When his pupils said that it was easy to give such an answer to the ""Minim,"" but that they were not satisfied with it, he replied that the plural was used, because Adam was created out of earth and Eve out of Adam's rib, but in the future no increase could be had by man without woman or by woman without man, and both need the assistance of God."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.8","Another time the ""Minim"" asked him why the phrase ""Elohim Kedoshim"" (holy gods, in the plural) was employed in the Bible, and Rabbi Simlai replied that the subsequent phrase ""Elohim Hu"" (He is God) was a sufficient answer. To his pupils he explained that the plural was used to indicate that God was holy with all kinds of holiness."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.9","The number of commandments in the Torah is 613 and whoever transgresses even against one commandment is considered to have broken all of them. The Prophets sought to diminish the number of commandments and Hillel tried to express the essence of the Torah in one phrase: ""Do not unto others what you would not have done unto you."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.10","Rabbi Simlai said: ""The 613 commandments consist of 365 negative ones, equal to the number of days in the year, and of 248 positive commandments, equal to the number of limbs in the human body."" <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) מכות כ""ג ב׳.</span></i> One of Rabbi Simlai's pupils amplified this statement and said: ""The number of positive commandments is equal to the number of limbs in a human body, because every limb implores man to commit a good deed. The number of negative commandments is equal to the number of days in the year, according to the reckoning of the sun, because each day implores man not to commit a sin during its time."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.11","Another general statement of Rabbi Simlai declared: ""The Torah begins with an act of kindness and ends with an act of kindness. When Adam and Eve realized their nakedness and were ashamed, God made them coats of skins. When Moses died on Mount Nebo and no one was with him to bury him, God buried Moses."" <sup>8)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">8) סוטה י""ד א׳.</span></i> Later Rabbi Simlai somewhat changed his interpretation and said: ""One who would realize the kindness of God should consult the Torah and he will see that the first act of God was to adorn Eve as one adorns a bride when he led her before Adam. God adorns all brides as he adorned Eve; He visits the sick as He visited Abraham; He buries the dead as He buried Moses."" <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) מדרש תנחומא פּ׳ וירא.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.12","""The Bible says: ""Remember the day of Sabbath to consecrate it"" and also ""Observe the day of Sabbath."" Rabbi Simlai explained that one should remember the Sabbath before it comes and he should observe it after it had come. How can this be done? Every time one sees a good object or a new vessel, he should reserve it for the Sabbath. <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) פּסיקתא רבתי פּרשה כ""ג.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.13","Economic conditions in Palestine were very poor at that time and the population was so impoverished that no one possessed good garments. As Rabbi Simlai once explained the commandment to prepare special garments for Sabbath, the people wept, for they could not afford such a luxury. Rabbi Simlai then said: ""If one does not have a good garment to wear on Saturday, he should at least wear a different garment; even though it be torn it should be different from the one worn on week days."" <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) ירושלמי פּאה פּרק ה׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.14","""When Messiah will come,"" Rabbi Simlai said, ""God will take a book of the Torah in his arms and He will say: 'Whoever devoted himself to the study of the Torah, let him come and receive his reward.' All the nations will then come together, but God will say to them, 'Let each nation come separately.' """
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.15","""The first to come before God will be Edom (Rome) and He will ask them: 'What have you done in the world?' and they will reply: 'We paved highways; we built many bath houses; we gathered much silver and gold. All this we did for the sake of Your Jews that they might devote themselves to the Torah.' God will then answer them: 'Fools that you are. All that you did, you did for yourself. You paved streets that you might settle your harlots there; you built bath houses that you might anoint your bodies; you gathered gold and silver which belongs to me. But you did not study the Torah and you will receive no reward.' The sons of Edom will then leave with bowed heads."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.16","""After them will come the Persians and God will ask them: 'What have you done?' and they will reply: ""We have built many bridges; we have conquered many cities; we have waged many wars. All this we did for the sake of the Jews, that they might have time to devote themselves to the Torah.' To them God will say: 'All that you did, you did for yourself. You built bridges to collect tolls; you conquered cities to collect taxes; your wars I waged for you, but you did not study the Torah, then why do you seek reward?' """
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.17","""But the Persians will refuse to leave empty handed and they will say: 'Have you offered the Torah to us and we have rejected it?' and God will reply: 'Seven commandments I gave to the sons of Noah and you have not observed them.' The Persians will ask further: 'Have the Jews observed the seven commandments?' """
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Simlai Bar Aba.18",""" 'I will call your own witnesses,' God will answer, 'and you shall see that they have observed my commandments. Let Nimrod testify concerning Abraham that he did not worship idols; let Laban testify that he did not suspect Jacob of robbery; let Potiphar's wife testify that Joseph was not persuaded to sin; let Nebuchadnezzar testify concerning Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, that they refused to bow before an idol; let Darius testify concerning Daniel that he refused to interrupt his prayer.'

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.1","R<small>ABBI</small> Y<small>ITZCHAK</small> N<small>APCHA</small> (<small>THE</small> B<small>LACKSMITH</small>) was one of the most prominent disciples of Rabbi Jochanan and a master of Hagada who lived during the second, third and fourth generations of ""Amoraim."" His surname ""Napcha"" is variously interpreted. Some claim that it referred to his occupation as a blacksmith, although the Talmud never mentioned it explicitly, while others maintained that he was a native of a city of that name. Such a city is mentioned in the travels of Benjamin of Tudela. Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha, of whom this chapter treats, should not be confused with another man of the same name who lived during the days of Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai. <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) תוספתא ערובין פּרק ז׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.2","Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha is never mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud by this name. Some Talmud critics therefore believe that Rabbi Yitzchak bar Tavlai, who is mentioned there, is identical with Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha. References in the Jerusalem Talmud to Rabbi Yitzchak, without any further designation, are also believed to refer to Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.3","The poverty which characterized the time of Rabbi Yitzchak is best illustrated by his remark that ""the curse of God that people shall be forced to eat the grass of the fields applies only to the present generations. People suffer such hunger these days that they cannot wait for the grain to ripen in the field and they pluck it and eat it while it is still green."" <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) בראשית רבה פּרשה כ׳ פּיסקא כ""ד.</span></i> ""In such times,"" Rabbi Yitzchak added, ""people are not interested in learning and they merely wish to hear words of consolation."" <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) שיר השירים רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא י""ד.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.4","Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha lived in Tiberias together with his master Rabbi Jochanan and his friends R. Elazar ben Pedath and R. Ami. He also maintained close bonds of friendship with other scholars who frequently visited him at his house to discuss various laws and he also visited their homes for the same purpose. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) יבמות מ""ח ב׳, עבודה זרה כ""ד א׳, מועד קטן כ׳ א׳.</span></i> Differences of opinion at times marked his relations with Rabbi Ami. Thus one declared that if a needle was found in the lung of an animal its flesh was kosher, while the other held it to be unfit to eat. <sup>5)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">5) חולין מ""ח ב׳.</span></i> Similarly Rabbi Yitzchak passed sentence whether it was permissible to eat onions harvested during the Sabbatical year while Rabbi Ami didn't know how to decide this law. <sup>6)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">6) נדרים נ""ז ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.5","That the opinions of Rabbi Yitzchak were held above those of other scholars is also evident from the fact that when the Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah the Second, entertained priests at his table and he did not know whether it was permissible to serve them with the flesh of a first born animal, he first inquired the opinion of Rabbi Ami and later he asked the same question of Rabbi Yitzchak for a final decision. <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) ביצה כ""ז א׳.</span></i> It may be assumed that Rabbi Yitzchak was at that time a judge in Tiberias and since his teachings were popular, his decisions were accepted in all matters of Halacha. <sup>8)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">8) בבא קמא קי""ז ב׳, בבא בתרא ק""ע א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.6","At a later date Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha went to Babylonia. This journey apparently took place after the destruction of Tiberias during the Roman wars, when Rabbi Ami transferred his academy to Caesarea, where he could continue his teaching under the protection of Rabbi Avahu. Rabbi Yitzchak's stay in Babylonia coincided with the period of the influence of R. Shesheth. <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) מועד קטן כ""ד ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.7","When Rabbi Yitzchak returned to Palestine, he settled in Caesarea where he appears to have been a member of Rabbi Avahu's court. There he was once confronted with the problem whether it was permissible to read the weekly portion of the Bible in the Synagogue from a Torah which contained only one of the books of the Pentateuch. Rabbi Yitzchak could not answer this question, but Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani reminded him of the rule that a scroll of the Torah from which even one parchment was missing, could not be used for reading in the Synagogue; it thus became apparent that a scroll which contained only one of the books of the Pentateuch could not be used. <sup>10)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">10) גטין ס׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.8","Rabbi Yitzchak yearned for the restoration of Jerusalem. His heart was filled with anguish when he saw Caesarea in all its glamor while Jerusalem lay desolate. He then came to the conclusion that these two cities—Cesarea and Jerusalem—could not both thrive at the same time and that the prosperity of one of them was inevitably bound up with the destruction of the other. <sup>11)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">11) מגלה ו׳ א׳.</span></i> While speaking of these cities Rabbi Yitzchak mentioned a people, ""Germamia of Edom""—which could destroy the whole world, if God would only allow it. This people, he said, restrains the Romans. Rabbi Yitzchak was no doubt referring to the Germans, who then conducted a struggle against Rome and of whom vague rumors reached the Jews of Palestine."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.9","On another occasion Rabbi Yitzchak interpreted the verse ""A generation comes and a generation goes, but the earth endures for ever,"" as referring to the various kingdoms of the world which rise and fall while the Jewish people remains eternal. <sup>12)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">12) קהלת רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.10",Most of the expositions of Rabbi Yitzchak remained in the form of introductions to the books of the Scriptures. The following are some of the most interesting excerpts from his lectures:
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.11","""It is impossible to measure the strength of one's evil desires which become renewed daily. <sup>13)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">13) סוכה נ""ב א׳, קדושין ל׳ ב׳.</span></i> Even when one mourns for the dead, his evil desires are with him. <sup>14)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">14) קדושין פּ׳ ב׳.</span></i> Man is so controlled by his desires that even though these enter as visitors, they immediately possess his entire being. <sup>15)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">15) בראשית רבה פּרשה כ""ב פּיסקא י""א.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.12","""He who angers his neighbor, even though he does so with words only, must conciliate him. If he possesses money, he must seek conciliation through money; he should also ask his friends to intercede for him and to gain forgiveness for him. <sup>16)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">16) יומא פּ""ז א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.13","Rabbi Yitzchak highly valued charity, but he considered kind words spoken to the poor to be of even greater merit than money. He therefore said: ""One who gives a penny to a poor man, will be blessed with six blessings, but one who speaks kind words to the poor, will be blessed with all seven blessings."" <sup>17)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">17) בבא בתרא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.14","Like his contemporaries he also valued prayer and he said: ""Prayer is more important than sacrifices. Thus we see that when Samuel's father came to Shiloh, he first bowed and then he offered sacrifices."" <sup>18)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">18) מדרש שמואל פּרשה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.15","""Why were Abraham and Isaac childless?"" Rabbi Yitzchak asked. He provided the answer himself by saying that ""God yearns for the prayers of saints and He caused Abraham and Isaac to be childless in order that they might pray to him."" <sup>19)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">19) יבמות ס""ד א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.16","Of those who indulged in many vows in the hope of finding favor in the eyes of God, Rabbi Yitzchak said: ""He who makes a vow is like a person who pierces his heart with a sword. Are not the prohibitions of the Torah sufficient that people assume additional limitations?"" <sup>20)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">20) ירושלמי נדרים פּרק ט׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.17","Rabbi Yitzchak highly valued the study of the Torah and he said: ""The fact that people forget what they have learned, is for their own benefit, for if they would not forget that which they had learned then a person would devote himself to the Torah for two or three years and he would then turn to other occupations. But since it is in the nature of man to forget, he must always continue to study."" <sup>21)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">21) קהלת רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא י""ג.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.18","The two olives which the prophet Zechariah saw in one of his visions Rabbi Yitzchak explained as referring to the scholars of Palestine, who are as gentle and as dear to each other as oil, while the scholars of Babylonia embitter each other's lives like an olive tree. <sup>22)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">22) סנהדרין כ""ד א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.19","Remarkably interesting are Rabbi Yitzchak's descriptions of the emotions of Moses as his death approached. The soul of Moses refused to leave him and Moses said to it: ""It seems that the Angel of death desires to take you,"" but the soul replied: ""God will save me from death."" Moses then said: ""When you see the Jews weep for me, will you weep with them?"" and his soul replied: ""My eye will avoid tears.""

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.21",Even more interesting is Rabbi Yitzchak's explanation of Haman's accusations against the Jews:
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.22","""After Ahasweros decided to give a feast in celebration of the completion of the third year of his reign, Haman appeared before him and said: 'The Jewish God abhors adultery. You must therefore hire harlots and command all Jews to come to the feast and to gratify their desires.' When Mordechai heard this, he warned the Jews not to come to the feast since they were invited with the aim of causing them to sin."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.23","""But the Jews disobeyed Mordechai and came to the feast and Satan immediately appeared before God saying: 'It is time that You destroy this people which always sins against you, but never repents.'"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.24",""" 'I would do so,' God replied, 'but what will become of the Torah?' and Satan said, 'You can give it to the Creatures of Heaven.'"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith.25","""God was almost persuaded by this argument and He commanded that a parchment be brought that the decree of annihilation might be recorded. The Torah then appeared dressed in black and weeping bitterly. When the angels saw the Torah mourning, they also wept and said: 'If the Jews will be destroyed, of what use will we be in the world?' The sun and the moon, the sky and the earth likewise wrapped themselves in black and mourned. Thereupon Elijah ran and aroused the saints from their graves and said: 'The sun and the moon are darkened; the sky and the earth are wrapped in mourning; the Torah and the Angels weep and you lie peacefully.'"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.1","N<small>EXT TO</small> R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>OCHANAN</small> there was none among the ""Amoraim"" concerning whom so many legends were related as were told of Rabbi Zeira. These referred less to his greatness in learning than they did to his unusual personality and to the great friendship which united him with the other scholars who lived in Palestine during the fourth century of the Christian era. Rabbi Zeira came to Palestine from Babylonia when he was already well versed in learning. At the time of his arrival his opinions were already quoted in the academies of Babylonia and various occurrences of his life were being told. Rabbi Zeira was orphaned when he was very young. He was grieved at this and said: ""I wish that I had a father and a mother; I would then honor them as much as possible in order to earn a share in the world to come."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.2","Once he heard it told that when a shoe fell off the foot of Rabbi Tarphon's mother as she was walking outside, Rabbi Tarphon could not pick up the shoe because this happened during the Sabbath and he therefore placed his hand under his mother's foot to prevent her from trodding the bare ground, and she thus walked until she reached her bed. The scholars then added that had Rabbi Tarphon done a thousand fold for his mother, he still would not have done even half of what one is supposed to do in order to honor his parents. Later Rabbi Zeira heard it said that the mother of Rabbi Ishmael once came before the scholars to complain that her son was not according her due honor. Greatly shocked they asked the woman what Rabbi Ishmael had done that she had found it necessary to come before them to complain and the woman answered: ""Every time that my son comes home from the academy I want to wash his feet and to drink the water, but he would not allow me to do so."" The scholars then said to Rabbi Ishmael: ""If this is her desire, you must honor it."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.3","When Rabbi Zeira heard these stories he exclaimed: ""Blessed be the Lord that I have no father and mother for I could not do that which Rabbi Tarphon did and I would not want to do that which Rabbi Ishmael was advised to do."" <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) ירושלמי קדושין פּרק א׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>"

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.6","Rabbi Zeira's yearning for Palestine led him to leave his native land where he enjoyed great honor as a scholar.

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.11","Rabbi Zeira was also highly regarded by Rabbi Avahu who considered him as his disciple, <sup>22)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">22) נדרים ל""ו א׳, ירושלמי ברכות פּרק ח׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> and when he fell sick, Rabbi Avahu promised to give a feast upon his recovery. <sup>23)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">23) ברכות מ""ו א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.12","When Rabbi Zeira settled in Palestine he hoped to obtain ordination in that country. No ordinations were then being conferred in Babylonia. But in many of his statements he expressed his abhorrence of people who bought their ordination as frequently happened in Tiberias at that time. He would then purposely sit in places where scholars went by and whenever he saw one who, he thought, did not deserve the title of Rabbi, he would ostentatiously remain seated. To all other scholars he accorded due honor. <sup>24)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">24) ברכות כ""ח א׳, ערובין כ""ח ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.13","Finally Rabbi Zeira obtained his ordination. In Babylonia it was said that he hid for a long time in order to avoid ordination. <sup>25)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">25) סנהדרין י""ד א׳.</span></i> On the day that he was ordained, his colleagues sang his praise and the Nasi sent him gifts which he refused to accept. But when he was invited to the Nasi's table, he accepted the invitation out of respect for the Nasi. <sup>26)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">26) מגלה כ""ח א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.14","By trade Rabbi Zeira was a weaver and he once asked Rabbi Avahu how much effort he might devote to beautifying his cloth without deceiving the buyers with its beauty at the expense of its quality. <sup>27)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">27) ירושלמי בבא מציעא פּרק ד׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.15","In his time the Roman government prohibited the Jews from engaging in fasts. Rabbi Zeira was greatly worried when he heard of this regulation for he was devoted to fasting as may be seen from the previous description of his prolonged fasts. <sup>28)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">28) תענית ט""ז א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.16","Because of his conduct Rabbi Zeira was called the ""Pious from Babylonia"". <sup>29)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">29) חולין קכ""ב א׳.</span></i> He loved peace and he sought every opportunity to effect a reconciliation whenever someone offended him. <sup>30)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">30) יומא פּ""ז א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.17",The name Zeira was popular in Babylonia at that time. It appears to have been a diminutive endearing form used for children who were born late in the lives of their parents.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.18","Rabbi Zeira's parents died when he was still young. Of his father it is known that he was a tax collector for the Babylonian government for a period of thirteen years. It was told that he always protected the scholars from too heavy tax burdens. <sup>31)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">31) סנהדרין כ""ה ב׳.</span></i> He is also mentioned in connection with scholarly matters when he questioned a regulation of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. <sup>32)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">32) תענית כ""ו ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.19","On the day that Rabbi Zeira arrived in Palestine, he met a butcher who allowed himself to ridicule him, partly because of his appearance and partly because all Babylonian Jews were exposed to ridicule. Rabbi Zeira seemed to be a subject for mirth in the eyes of the butcher into whose shop he came to buy meat. When he asked the price of the meat the butcher named a sum and said that in addition to this sum the customer must be struck a blow with the hammer. Rabbi Zeira offered a higher price for the meat if he would be spared the blow, but the butcher insisted on his original statement and Rabbi Zeira finally consented."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.20","When Rabbi Zeira came to the academy that evening, he asked the meaning of this custom that every buyer of meat must receive a blow. All those present were surprised when they heard his question and they asked Rabbi Zeira where he had seen such a custom practiced. He then named the butcher and the scholars wished to send for him in order to have him punished for shaming a scholar, but they were informed that the butcher died on that same day. When they heard this, they believed that Rabbi Zeira must have cursed the butcher, but he assured them that he did not curse him and that he believed this to be the custom of the city. The scholars then concluded that Rabbi Zeira must be a very important man if God administered summary punishment to one who had insulted him. <sup>33)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">33) ירושלמי ברכות פּרק ג׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.21","The modesty of Rabbi Zeira is further illustrated by the following statement: ""If the generations which preceded us were like angels then we are like men; if they were like men then we are like asses."" <sup>34)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">34) שבת קי""ב ב׳, ירושלמי שקלים פּרק ה׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> He further said that when the Torah spoke of the cure of leprosy it referred to the cure of the flesh. From this he concluded that when one is humble and lowly as the flesh, he would be cured; but one who is proud would never be healed. <sup>35)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">35) סוטה ד׳ א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.22","Despite Rabbi Zeira's physical handicaps he always hastened to fulfill all commandments for he had heard it said that in order to fulfill a commandment one may run even during the Sabbath when running is ordinarily forbidden. He thus declared that ""the reward for learning is the haste with which one goes to the place of learning."" <sup>36)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">36) ברכות ו׳ ב׳.</span></i> Another characteristic attribute of Rabbi Zeira was his insistence that the name of the author should always be mentioned when he was quoted. On one occasion he even forced Rabbi Asi to admit that a statement which he had repeated in the name of a certain Amora, he had really heard from a pupil of that Amora. <sup>37)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">37) עבודה זרה ל""ו ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.23","Rabbi Zeira considered the spoken word to be sacred and he insisted that everyone should fulfill his promise. He held it to be especially important to fulfill promises made to children in order that they might not learn to tell falsehoods. <sup>38)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">38) סוכה מ""ו ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.24","But it is noteworthy that despite the modesty of Rabbi Zeira he demanded that due honor be accorded to scholars and he objected to their self debasement even when that was done during the fulfillment of a commandment. When he saw Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak at a wedding, dancing before the bride with three torches in his hands which he threw into the air and caught again, Rabbi Zeira remarked: ""The old man makes a fool of himself and he also shames us."" <sup>39)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">39) כתובות י""ז א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.25","Rabbi Zeira did not tolerate the Hagada. At that time there were already numerous books of Hagada extant and he referred to them as ""books of witchcraft"". He also commanded one of his pupils to refrain from studying Hagada because he would learn nothing from it. <sup>40)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">40) ירושלמי מעשרות פּרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.26","The observance of a commandment was of lesser importance in the eyes of Rabbi Zeira than the beautification of the act and he therefore said that one may spend one third of the cost of fulfilling a commandment in order to make its fulfillment more attractive. <sup>41)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">41) בבא קמא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.27","Rabbi Zeira stayed in the academy day and night and engaged in study. When he felt weak from overwork he would go to the door of the academy. There he would see scholars coming and going and he would listen to their discourses and he would feel refreshed. <sup>42)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">42) ברכות כ""ח א׳, ערובין כ""ח ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.28","A remarkable story is related of Rabbi Zeira and Raba who once became drunk during Purim festivities. While he was intoxicated, Raba killed Rabbi Zeira. On the following day he saw what he had done and he prayed to God and Rabbi Zeira was resurrected. The following year they made no feast for fear that the miracle might not occur a second time if needed. <sup>43)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">43) מגלה ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.29","Rabbi Zeira lived to a ripe old age and when his disciples asked him what he attributed his long life to, he said: ""I was never angry at anyone in my house and I never ran ahead of one who was greater than myself; likewise I never went a distance of four ells without Torah and phylacteries. I never pondered divine matters in unclean places and I never slept in the academy, not even an accidental nap. I was never glad at the misfortune of others nor did I ever nickname other people."" <sup>44)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">44) מגלה כ""ח א׳, תענית כ׳ ב׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.30","When Rabbi Zeira died he was eulogised in the following words: ""Babylonia gave him birth; the Land of Israel reared him as its darling; woe to the city of Tiberias that it had lost its most attractive vessel."" <sup>45)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">45) מועד קטן כ""ה בי.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., Rabbi Zeira.31","The following story is related of Rabbi Zeira's influence even after his death: ""In the neighborhood of Rabbi Zeira's house there lived some wicked men whom he rebuked for their evil and he prayed to God that they might improve their ways. The other scholars disapproved of this because even as they believed that it was a good deed to rebuke a person who might change his ways so also they considered it a sin to rebuke people who were hardened in sin. After the death of Rabbi Zeira, his wicked neighbors said: 'Until now the short dark man prayed for us and protected us. Now that he is dead who will pray for us?' They thereupon repented their sins."""

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.1",T<small>HE</small> H<small>AGADIC PART OF THE</small> T<small>ALMUD</small> consists of the interpretations of the texts of the Bible as well as of legendary and poetic descriptions of historical events in so far as these were not concerned with the law. It was the aim of the Hagada to inspire the people with higher moral concepts and to revive their courage during times of oppression.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.2","Throughout the numerous generations of Amoraim there were many scholars who underestimated the worth of the Hagada and even opposed it. Such opposition, however, remained ineffective. The demands of the people were stronger than scholastic theories. The masses yearned for words of consolation and they eagerly listened to the teachings of the Hagada."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.3","The economic and social pressure which resulted from the political developments, the constant impoverishment of the people and the burden of submission to foreign rulers weakened the interest in Halacha. A much more receptive attitude was maintained toward Hagada which caressed the fantasy and in times of sorrow it inspired hope for a brighter future. Even during the brief intermission when the situation of the Jews of Palestine improved, as during the reign of Alexander Severus, Rabbi Jehudah, then Nasi, complained of the suffering inflicted by the government which forced him to take the last earnings of the people for the payment of taxes. In an attempt to increase its taxes, the Roman government once issued an edict that Jews should cultivate their fields on the Sabbatical year and the scholars had to give their consent, otherwise the people would have been unable to pay their taxes."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.4",But such respites in the long chain of oppression which did occur were short lived and were intended to allow the people to recuperate and to prepare them to bear patiently the decrees that inevitably followed. It is also remarkable that the rich as well as the poor suffered equally whenever the Romans intensified their oppression. The rich were sentenced to death for not giving all that was asked of them and the poor met a similar fate for not having anything to give.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.5","All of these facts we learn from casual remarks in the Talmud and the Midrashim which are attached to various legal opinions. The scholars of that time did not appreciate the importance of recording the events, and when it was remarked that future generations would not know what had occurred, the answer was given that ""even if we should want to record everything we could not do so."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.6","Considering the unbearable position of the Jews at that time, it is therefore quite understandable why they thirsted for consoling words and why they so eagerly turned to the Hagada. But the masses of the people were not alone in this respect; their leaders also sought momentary respite from the bitterness of their fate. The Hagada offered them all that. It promised a glorious future for the Jews, it taught them to value their faith, and it assured divine justice and retribution for all the wrongs that they were suffering. The Hagada extolled the virtues of the Jewish nation; it listed the virtues of the Torah and of those who adhered to it; it related the events of the past and inspired courage to face the future."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.7","Not all the legends that were repeated by the scholars were written down and many of them were lost. Others were not concerned with problems of conduct and were considered unimportant. But all those legends that have come down to us are a rich source of ethical maxims and words of wisdom with a definite lesson for every eventuality. In addition they also explain many passages of the Bible which would otherwise remain inexplicable. Some of the legends may appear to be of minor worth today, but this is due to the fact that we do not understand them. Others are based on events of which we have no record or on events which we cannot conceive of today."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.8","The authors of the Hagada are usually known as the <span dir=""rtl"">רבנן דאגדתא</span> (teachers of the Hagada). Some of these also engaged in legal discussions and looked to the Hagada as a means of refreshing the minds of their pupils when they showed signs of weariness of the ""Sophistry."" There were some scholars who looked at the teachers of Hagada with a lack of respect; they refused to call them ""Rabbi"" and merely referred to them as ""the men of Hagada."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.9","Aside from the above mentioned purposes the Hagada also served to protect the Jews from Christian teachings which became common at that time. It taught them how to answer and to refute the arguments of the Christians which were based on the Bible. As long as the Christians were considered to be a Jewish sect and they preached moral principles which did not threaten the fundamental tenets of the faith, they were tolerated. But when they began to claim that God had repudiated the Torah and for this reason he had destroyed the temple they became a menace to the Jewish religion. When the Christians sent apostles to win the nations to their faith and these apostles were successful because they repudiated the Sabbath, the laws of cleanliness and circumcision, the scholars feared that Jews also might be misled."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.10",One must also bear in mind that the Jewish method of interpreting the Bible was also used by many Christians of that time. The difference consisted in that the Hagada never assumed the authority of law among Jews while many of the principles of Christianity were founded on such interpretations. Not only Jewish born Christians but also non-Jews who embraced Christianity employed this method of expounding the Old and the New Testaments and even in their attacks on Jews they based themselves on the texts of the Bible.
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.11","The Church-father Theophil of Antioch, who was born a non-Jew, thus explained that God was called ""Makom"" because He contained the whole world within himself but that the world was too small to be the ""Makom"" (place) of God. Likewise he said that when the animals were created they were powerless to do any harm and only the sin of Adam bestowed this power upon them. Another time he declared that when God said to Adam ""Where art thou?"" it might seem that He did not know where Adam was, but in reality He said so in order to begin a conversation with Adam and to give him an opportunity to repent."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.12","The Church-father Origines declared that the ""Seraphim"" which the prophet Isaiah saw in heaven were the Messiah and the personification of the Holy Spirit. He also explained the functions of the angels mentioned in the Scriptures: Raphael was appointed to heal the sick, Gabriel was in charge of wars, and Michael was in charge of the prayers of man."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.13","Hieronimus, the greatest of the Church-fathers, to whom Jews owed a debt of gratitude for preserving the Bible, held forth on the piety of Noah who lived in a generation of wicked men. The passage stating that God created a garden eastward (mikedem) in Eden, he explained to indicate that the garden of Eden was created before the rest of the world."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.14","It would take us too far afield to cite any more interpretations of the Christian Patriarchs (who were born non-Jews) to the texts of the Bible in so far as they resemble those of the Jewish scholars. It is obvious, however, that most of these interpretations were taken from Jewish sources."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.15","Nearly all Christian teachers attempted to prove their contention from the verse ""Let us make man."" The use of the plural in this verse, they said, indicated that God consulted with His son when He decided to create man."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.16","Rabbi Shmuel ben Nachmani quoted his teacher Rabbi Jonathan in this matter and said that when Moses had to write this passage in the Torah he said to God: ""Lord of the world! Why do you give an opportunity to claims that You had a partner in the creation of man?"", and God answered: ""You write as I tell you and those who err shall err."" <sup>1)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">1) בראשית רבה פּרשה ח׳ פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.17","The Church-father Justinus the Martyr once asked a Jew with whom he was debating religious matters: ""If the commandment of circumcision is so important in the eyes of God, why did He not impose it on Adam?"" The same question was once asked by a Min (a Jew who embraced Christianity) of Rabbi Oshaiah and the latter replied: ""Why does a man shave the hair on his head but not his beard?"" The Min answered: ""Because the hair on a man's head was already growing when he was still a foolish child."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.18","""Why then does not one gouge out his eyes or cut off his hands because they also were with him when he was still foolish?"" Rabbi Oshaiah continued, ""the truth of the matter is that whatever had been created by God during the six days has to be improved. Thus wheat has to be ground before it can be used. Likewise the human body has to be improved."""
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.19","An outstanding man among the teachers of the Hagada was Rabbi Simlai, a disciple of Rabbi Jehudah N'siah I and a friend of Rabbi Jehudah II whom he accompanied on all his travels. He was a constant companion of the Nasi who always relied upon him. Rabbi Simlai loved the Hagada and although most of his statements were lost we may conclude from the few that remained that his expositions consisted of wise and witty sayings."
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.20","Rabbi Simlai said: 613 commandments God gave to Moses; King David reduced them to 11; the prophet Isaiah reduced the commandments to six; Micha limited them to three, and Amos condensed all 613 into one commandment. Rashi comments on this that in earlier generations people were very pious and could observe all 613 commandments, but the later generations were not so pious, and when it is impossible to observe all the commandments it is necessary to be satisfied with fewer. <sup>2)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">2) מכות כ""ג ב׳, כ""ד א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.21","Characteristic of the condition of his times is his explantation of the passage in Hosea (2:7) as referring to scholars who shame the Torah with their deeds such as people who preach that one must not loan money for interest and yet they do so themselves, that one must not rob yet they rob others or that one must not steal and yet they steal from others. <sup>3)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">3) דברים רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא י""ב.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.22","Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani, several of whose Halachic opinions are cited in the Talmud, was even greater than Rabbi Simlai in this form of exposition. He loved to compare the virtues of the Jews with those of other peoples and at the same time he praised the Torah and its followers. But the moral life he held to be ""even more important than the study of the Torah."" He sought to explain and to justify the sins of the leaders of the nation. He always maintained that the story of these sins must not be taken literally and those who believed that such people as Reuben the son of Jacob, the sons of Eli or king David could have sinned, were in error. <sup>4)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">4) שבת נ""ו א׳.</span></i>"
"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.23","Even in legal matters he based his arguments on the Hagadic method of interpretation. Thus he said: ""How do we know that a court need not listen to the defense of one who incites to idol worshipping?

"Bader-Jewishspritualheroes-Vol2., The Hagadah and Its Authors.24","Another bright star in the firmament of the Hagada was Rabbi Levi. He lived during the time of the second and third generations of Amoraim in Palestine. The name of his father is unknown to us, for he is always referred to only by his own name. Like Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani he also found substantiation for legal decisions in the interpretations of Biblical texts. For a long time Rabbi Levi was not appreciated among the scholars. His work then consisted in calling the people to attend the lectures of Rabbi Jochanan. But one time Rabbi Jochanan was late and Rabbi Levi addressed the audience to pass the time until the arrival of Rabbi Jochanan. His words were greatly liked and since then he was allowed to lecture every Saturday in the academy of Rabbi Jochanan. <sup>7)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">7) ירושלמי סוכה פּרק ה׳ הלכה א׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה צ""ח פּיסקא ט""ז.</span></i>"

He also employed fables which were based on the behavior of men and animals. Thus he related that the lion, the king of the animals, was once angered by his subjects. The animals gathered to decide who should conciliate him and the fox undertook the task. At other times he uttered maxims to guide men in their conduct as when he said that man should eat according to his income, he should dress poorer than his income allows him and he should furnish his house better than his income permits him. <sup>9)</sup><i class=""footnote""><span dir=""rtl"">9) בראשית רבה פּרשה כ׳ פּיסקא ל׳.</span></i>"

It was then seen that the people on the ship leaving the shore were happy while some of those on the ship nearing the shore were sad. A wise man remarked: ""We see here a strange sight. People who leave the shore should not be happy, for they know not how long they will be at sea and what winds they will encounter, but people who near the shore should be happy in the realization that they have safely reached dry land.

Sin asked what it would receive for doing so and falsehood promised that everything which it would earn it would give to sin.
