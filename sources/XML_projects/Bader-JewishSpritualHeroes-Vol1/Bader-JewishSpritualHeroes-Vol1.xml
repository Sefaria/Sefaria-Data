<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>T<small>HE HISTORY OF A PEOPLE</small> is primarily constructed out of the biographies of those individuals whose activities characterize the specific nature of the progress and development of the national forces, both internal as well as external.</p>
<p>No prominent person can be entirely detached from his environment. It makes but little difference whether such a person influenced the environment in which he lived or whether his individuality was conditioned by it, for this type of influence is mutual and complementary. Just as the individual presents a picture of his environment in miniature, even so does an environment present a composite photograph of its component individual parts.</p>
<p>Every person develops in a different manner; neither does this development follow an unbroken path from beginning to end. Life, on the contrary, follows some very devious ways and the chronicler must find a suitable approach for each complex historical situation in order not to go astray.</p>
<p>&#x201C;World history is the history of heroes,&#x201D; is the claim of a German philosopher. This rule also applies to Jewish history with this difference that our heroes are generally &#x201C;spiritual heroes,&#x201D; master navigators of the deep and stormy literary sea and commanders on the battle fields of the Torah.</p>
<p>Especially heroic were the struggles of our spiritual heroes of the time when we lost our political independence and were becoming accustomed to the role of a wandering people which is forced to live in a foreign environment but insists on retaining its own mode of life.</p>
<p>World history is motivated by an eternal force which flows in an endless labyrinth of channels and is given form and direction by the leading spirits of each generation. It is therefore necessary, first of all, to observe the ways of the leading spirits rather than the events which transpire.</p>
<p>The historical development of a people contains no accidents. Every event has its cause and reason which are results of previous events. It is therefore important to bear in mind that a matter of fact relation of events is not as significant as the understanding of the spirit and the logical necessity of such an event. We must also remember that ever since we lost our homeland the spirit of our people has found its expression in ideas and theories.</p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>Concerning the Talmud in the form that it was taught in Babylonia (and therefore called the Babylonian Talmud) as well as in the form in which it was expounded in Palestine (and therefore called the Jerusalem Talmud), is recognized as the exclusive creation of the Jewish spirit to which the Gentile world can lay no claim.</p>
<p>As far as the Bible is concerned we are confronted with various accusations. The enemies of Jewry find it undignified to admit that the Jews are the creators of the greatest spiritual treasure which the civilized world possesses. They therefore claim that the Bible is not specifically Jewish. The liberal legislation of the Pentateuch and the noble ideals of the prophets, they say, have been borrowed from neighboring peoples. When they do recognize the greatness of the Bible, they give equal credit to other peoples.</p>
<p>The style of the Bible is today the possession of all civilized peoples and has become a fructifying element in every language; but the Talmud could not be taken away from us and the honor of being the creators of this great work will remain with us forever.</p>
<p>Seven centuries passed from the time of Simon the Just, the last of the members of the &#x201C;Great Synagogue&#x201D; or &#x201C;Great Assembly,&#x201D; when the oral law became popular among the masses of the people until the conclusion of the Talmud. On the foundations of the Torah there was erected an imposing structure&#x2014;an eternal monument to Jewish spirit as it developed in those seven centuries. This development began immediately after the conclusion of the Bible when the Jews lived on the soil of Palestine for the second time and even continued in Babylonia where they sought refuge and found freedom and happiness for many years. It lasted even in Babylonia until they had to flee the sword.</p>
<p>Seven centuries is a long time in the life of any nation, even in the life of such an old nation as the Jews are. For no matter how conservative our historical evaluation it would be impossible to assume that no changes occurred during seven centuries. As among other nations, so also among the Jews there appeared new ideas and new concepts during these centuries. In the course of the years these new ideas developed and spread, only to disappear later on and to be supplanted by others. This is especially true when we consider that we are dealing with a time when the political conditions of the nation changed radically. At times the Jews lived freely in their own land and at other times they were involved in wars, at times they were exiled from their own country and at other times they prospered in other lands.</p>
<p>It may also be stated with certainty that in all Jewish history there never was a period so involved and characterized by unusual events as were the seven centuries during which the Talmud was created. The sources of information concerning that period are very meager and every historian must fall back on his imagination in order to complete the picture that was handed down to us.</p>
<p>If one wants to establish the true facts concerning events which took place at that time from the information contained in Talmudic literature, he must bear in mind that these books were not written with the aim of presenting history. They were therefore not careful to present exact dates or precise information regarding the people of whom they wrote. Whenever history is dealt with, it is generally embellished with many legends and even the personalities of the heroes are not definite.</p>
<p>For our purpose the event which occurred may be of paramount importance but the authors stressed a personality; in other cases we may be interested in a personality while they stressed the event. It is also necessary to remember that the original text of the books regarding historic events and names of persons was not strictly adhered to. There therefore exist in the Talmud numerous versions pertaining to people and events. Thus we read a story regarding a certain Talmudic personality, but another version may vary by one word and change the sense of the event to have involved another person or to have occurred in a different manner.</p>
<p>Such variations could easily creep into the Talmudic books when the copyists made an error in transcribing a name or when they sought to shorten their work and employed abbreviations which can be interpreted in numerous ways. These errors are not so important in establishing a law. It makes but little difference if the name of the person who rendered the deciding opinion regarding a law was misspelled. But where we are concerned with establishing historical facts, such errors are very confusing.</p>
<p>The basis for the Talmud was provided by the &#x201C;Sofrim.&#x201D; These were the copyists of the Torah who were at the same time teachers explaining the sayings of the Torah to the people. The original text of many commandments was not very clear and could not be understood unless they were interpreted. But the interpretations of the Sofrim became accepted and on the foundation of their explanations there grew an organization of seers and elders which came to be called &#x201C;The Men of the Great Synagogue.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Great Synagogue acted as a Supreme Court in deciding all religious matters and it was presided over by the High Priest. The beginning of the Great Synagogue occurred in the time of the last prophets (Haggai, Zacharias, Malachi) when the people, under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemia, signed a written covenant to observe the laws of Judaism, and it ended with Simon the Just.</p>
<p>At first it was prohibited to put the interpretations of the Sofrim in writing and they were handed on orally. Later it became obvious that they would be forgotten and so they began to write down all the traditional interpretations to the commandments of the Torah and they were considered as laws which God orally instructed Moses from Mount Sinai. But before this was done the Bible was completed in twenty-four books so that no one should try to add any of the traditional interpretations to its text.</p>
<p>Even today it is difficult to establish with certainty the time of the duration of the Great Synagogue. Of the history of the second Temple we lack the chronicles of the events of a period covering about 200 years (from the time of Alexander the Great till the reign of Antiochus). All we know is that it was a time of turbulent political changes and that control of Palestine changed hands several times. It is considered that these were the years of the Great Synagogue.</p>
<p>Ezra the Cohen and Scribe was the greatest scholar of the Torah of that time. When he observed that the Jews did not faithfully follow the commandments he tore his clothes, gave himself over to fasting and grew melancholy. Later there arrived Nehemiah Ben Chachalia, the cup bearer of Artaxerxes, and together they introduced regulations which later became laws. Their first move was to nullify all mixed marriages and to expel the non-Jewish wives together with their children. They were strict in preserving the purity of the race in spite of the fact that the richest and most prominent Jews, not excluding the family of the High Priest, intermarried with non-Jews.</p>
<p>The main achievement of the Great Synagogue was in purifying the Jewish faith from imitation of the customs of other peoples which the Jews at that time freely engaged in. In order to prevent a return to idol worshipping, as occurred in the time of the first Temple, the Great Synagogue prohibited the erection of altars for offering sacrifices outside of Jerusalem. Instead they established prayers by means of which a person could praise his Creator in a few heart-felt words without having to resort to the blood of a sacrificed animal to attain nearness to God. The Talmud indirectly refers to this achievement when it states that the Great Synagogue killed the &#x201C;Tempter&#x201D; of idol worship. Of equal importance were the regulations of the Great Synagogue regarding inter-family marriages of which the Talmud says that &#x201C;they captured the &#x2018;Tempter&#x2019; of love and blinded his eyes.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn1">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition the Great Synagogue established the correct form of every word in the Bible. They introduced the custom of having all the inhabitants of the villages surrounding Jerusalem meet every Monday and Thursday to hear the reading of a chapter of the Torah. In Jerusalem itself the whole weekly portion was read every Saturday. They established a new calendar so that the count of years should begin with Tishri instead of Nisan, and that the day of the blowing of the ram&#x2019;s horn, the first day of Tishri, should be the New Year.</p>
<p>Many of the old institutions of the Temple were dispensed with. Thus no &#x201C;Cherubim&#x201D; were made for the second Temple because when Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s soldiers destroyed the first Temple they carried out the Cherubim and exhibited them as the Jewish God. The Jubilee was also done away with; since it was prohibited to hold Jewish slaves it was no longer necessary to observe a Jubilee to free such slaves. The &#x201C;Urim and Thummim&#x201D; were also done away with, although the High Priest retained all of the other vestments.</p>
<p>The Great Synagogue also appointed judges in all places where Jews resided so that everyone could find justice according to the laws of the Torah. They determined the content of &#x201C;Tefillin&#x201D; and &#x201C;Mezuzoth&#x201D; on the door posts and tightened all prohibitions, even forbidding many things which were previously permitted. This was done to prevent laxity in the observance of all prohibitions. The commandment of the Torah &#x201C;an eye for an eye&#x201D; they interpreted to mean that monetary compensation should be granted to the victim for the damage caused him instead of the literal meaning which is implied in Leviticus 24, 2.</p>
<p>The necessity for preserving the oral law from getting lost was especially keenly felt about the interpretations of the commandments. When sacrifices were done away with and prayers took their place it was necessary to codify the laws pertaining to prayers as well as to elucidate those laws which were not clearly explained in the Torah. In addition there was the constant change in the concepts of the people going on over a period of seven centuries. When the Jews returned to Palestine from the Babylonian exile they were primarily tillers of the soil and shepherds. Later there arose a class of wage workers, merchants and artisans. This necessitated new interpretations of the laws to conform with the development of the times.</p>
<p>Out of all these interpretations there developed a wide literature whose content is the pride of the Jewish nation. This includes sixty tractates of the Talmud in two different texts and in addition Tosephta, Safra, Sifri, Mechilta together with hundreds of various Midrashim.</p>
<p>This whole literature is divided into Halacha and Hagadah. The Halacha includes the injunctions of the law. The Hagadah, on the other hand, introduces a living spirit into the dry legal commandments; it enriches the law with poetic softness and lends to it characteristic beauty. The &#x201C;Halacha&#x201D; teaches how to observe the Sabbath and the feast days, how to make a Succah, what four kinds of plants are to be used on Succoth. The &#x201C;Hagadah&#x201D; explains the spiritual value of the Sabbath as well as the significance of the other feast days and their attendant customs. Both the Halacha and the Hagadah are basic foundations of the oral law and are of equal worth to the development of Judaism.</p>
<p>Concerning the Hagadah it is also worth remarking that it is of special significance for another reason. It deals continually with the concepts of justice even as it is concerned with the attributes of godliness. It relates many historical events, it cites scientific and medical knowledge as well as proverbs and axiomatic truths of life which accumulated among the Jews in the course of those seven centuries.</p>
<p>In the Halacha we find those religious injunctions which a Jew must follow as well as the code of just relationships between man and man. These two types of law the Talmud refers to as prohibitions and laws. The expounders of these two types of law are divided into two classes. One carries greater authority in religious matters and the other in matters pertaining to human relationship.</p>
<p>The scholars endeavored to define the boundaries of the &#x201C;fence around the Torah&#x201D; which the members of the Great Synagogue ordered to be erected in so far as this pertained to the religious regulations. But some of these limitations were considered too extreme by the later scholars and the Tanaim who created the Mishna ruled that &#x201C;whoever attempts to interpret a law more severely than is accepted must prove his source of authority.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn2">2)</xref></sup> Afterward it was said that &#x201C;anyone who attempts to abide by the restrictions of the school of Shamai and the school of Hillel is like a foolish man who walks in the darkness&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn3">3)</xref></sup> and Rabbi Chya warned against attaching more importance to the &#x201C;fence around the Torah&#x201D; than to the essence of the Torah itself. <sup><xref rid="fn4">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was for this reason that the scholars objected to having the people assume obligations to perform deeds which the law did not impose upon them and they said that whoever does something which is not made obligatory by law may be called a simpleton. <sup><xref rid="fn5">5)</xref></sup> One of the Amoraim expressed this attitude in the following words: &#x201C;Are there not enough prohibitions in the Torah already that one should seek to establish still other prohibitions?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn6">6)</xref></sup> and although some of the scholars were strict in the enforcement of certain rabbinical commandments, even stricter than in their interpretations of the commandments of the Torah, <sup><xref rid="fn7">7)</xref></sup> the general tendency was nevertheless to lighten the burden of the observance of the laws.</p>
<p>This &#x201C;fence around the Torah,&#x201D; which the scholars erected, was very timely because the masses of the people were not acquainted with the precepts of the law. From these preventive measures there later developed numerous and various laws as, for instance, the restrictions pertaining to regulations concerning marriage, of which it was said that they are like a garden watchman&#x2014;if a man watches his garden from the outside he protects it completely.</p>
<p>Very much concerned for the sanctity of morals and the purity of people&#x2019;s lives, the scholars ruled that a man might not remain alone with a strange woman in an unfrequented place. However, there are indications that this prohibition is derived from a much earlier period. <sup><xref rid="fn8">8)</xref></sup> In addition to the prohibitions of adultery which are listed in the Torah (Leviticus, 18), the scholars also prohibited marriage between twenty-six different degrees of relatives. <sup><xref rid="fn9">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the Sabbath was not properly observed in previous generations until the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, the people were warned to observe this day and to sanctify it by means of the restriction of its regulations in order to avoid false interpretations as to what may be done on that day and to prevent people from performing work which is not allowed. At this time the exact meaning of the word <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05DC;&#x05D0;&#x05DB;&#x05D4;</span> (work) was defined in order that everyone should know what work is permissible on the Sabbath. The scholars enumerated 39 major types of work which are forbidden on the Sabbath and the performance of which is punishable by death or by flogging. Among these are the following: sowing, plowing, reaping, hauling grain from the field, threshing, baking and cooking, lighting or putting out a fire, hunting, slaughtering, cultivating fields, writing and erasing, building and wrecking, sewing and tearing, carrying objects from a house to the street and vice versa. <sup><xref rid="fn10">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to these occupations they forbade many other activities, which do not properly speaking constitute work, but which introduce a week day atmosphere such as, climbing a tree, riding on an animal, swimming, judging, buying and selling, getting married and similar pursuits. All of these activities may not be performed on the Sabbath in order to insure complete rest and are also forbidden on feast days. <sup><xref rid="fn11">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Out of concern for the sanctity of the Sabbath, the scholars prohibited the carrying into the street of such objects as are used in the performance of week day labor. In order to safeguard the Sabbath they ruled that it is to be observed from sunset on Friday till the stars appear on Saturday. At the same time they introduced the custom of pronouncing the Kiddush (sanctification) and Havdalah (separation) over a glass of wine at the beginning and at the departure of the Sabbath. <sup><xref rid="fn12">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There also was appointed a man who was to give the signal with a Shofar (ram&#x2019;s horn) for everyone to stop working. The first blowing of the shofar was a signal to the laborers in the fields to cease working; the second blast of the shofar was a signal to the merchants and artisans in the city to put away their work; the third blast was signal to stop all work in one&#x2019;s house. The shofar was blown once more as a sign that the Sabbath has begun. <sup><xref rid="fn13">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Particular effort was exerted by the scholars to remove the disabilities and difficulties which surrounded deserted wives. This need was very keenly felt at that time due to the fact that many men had to leave their homes in search of a livelihood. The highways were then unsafe and many of these men lost their lives or were captured and sold as slaves after which they were never heard of again and the status of their wives remained indefinite. <sup><xref rid="fn14">14)</xref></sup> Similarly an attempt was made to facilitate the procedure of buying land in Palestine from non Jews. It was ruled that such a bill of sale might be drawn up even on the Sabbath. In the Talmud we find a query in this matter: &#x201C;How can one write such a contract on Saturday? How would that be possible?&#x201D; The answer given to this question was that it is permissible to have such a contract drawn up on the Sabbath by a non-Jew, while other activities may not be performed on the Sabbath even through the agency of a non-Jew. <sup><xref rid="fn15">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was also accepted as a rule that just as it is forbidden to declare the impure to be pure even so is forbidden to declare the pure to be impure. <sup><xref rid="fn16">15a)</xref></sup> Rabbi Nehunia b. Hakana therefore constantly prayed to be preserved from declaring the pure to be impure, and the impure to be pure <sup><xref rid="fn17">16)</xref></sup> and whenever the scholars prohibited certain actions to be performed or pleasures to be enjoyed, they carefully determined beforehand whether the people could abide by these restrictions. <sup><xref rid="fn18">17)</xref></sup> It is therefore interesting to note that they applied the rule of the &#x201C;greater power of leniency&#x201D; only in religious questions. Only in such questions did the school of Hillel decide in favor of leniency and the law remained according to the decisions of the school of Hillel. <sup><xref rid="fn19">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But their attitude was different whenever the law involved relations between people. In such a case our scholars studied the problem in all its implications and always considered it on its own merits in an attempt to avoid the severity of the rule which claimed that &#x201C;the law must penetrate mountains.&#x201D; They believed that Jerusalem was destroyed because its people insisted on enforcing the letter of the law and did not practice mercy outside of the law. <sup><xref rid="fn20">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The scholars therefore maintained that the aim of the Torah was not to impose stringent legislation but to encourage the practice of kindness among people. They said that whenever a man aids his neighbor with money or by means of other good deeds but he does so only out of a feeling of duty then such deeds are not acceptable to God because they lack love and generosity. <sup><xref rid="fn21">20)</xref></sup> Similarly they believed that even the study of the Torah is worthless when it is not accompanied by kindness to other people. <sup><xref rid="fn22">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Harmony between husband and wife they held to be the very foundation of family life and they said: &#x201C;Whoever loves his wife even as he loves himself and respects her more than he respects himself and leads his children in the proper ways and loves his neighbors and welcomes his relatives, such a man fulfills the wishes of God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn23">22)</xref></sup> The scholars also instructed that man should not be partial in his love for his children and should show no favoritism in the division of the inheritance even in order to compensate a good son at the expense of a wicked one. <sup><xref rid="fn24">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As an example of the fear of God the scholars extolled Job and they cited Abraham as an example of the love of God. Both of these were ready to overlook their own comfort and dignity in order to be of use to others. Therefore a man must permit himself to be insulted rather than to insult others; if a man is slandered he should not reply in kind; he must fulfill the commandments out of love and he should rejoice in his suffering. <sup><xref rid="fn25">24)</xref></sup> Similarly a man must permit himself to be persecuted without persecuting others. <sup><xref rid="fn26">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the above virtues the Talmud defined the ideal person as a scholar, &#x201C;Talmid Chochom,&#x201D; who strives only for the Torah and whose innermost wish is to attain a high degree of morality in his relations with God and man. But who is to be considered a &#x201C;Talmid Chochom&#x201D;? The Talmud says that a &#x201C;Talmid Chochom&#x201D; is a person who can answer a question of law whenever he is asked. Others maintain that a &#x201C;Talmid Chochom&#x201D; is one who disregards his own interests and devotes himself to godly matters solely. <sup><xref rid="fn27">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such &#x201C;Talmide Chachomim&#x201D; (scholars) must always endeavor to set an example for others with their behavior as well as by their exterior appearance. A scholar must not allow his clothes to be spotted and must keep himself as attractive as a girl. <sup><xref rid="fn28">27)</xref></sup> He must also maintain better manners than others while eating, sitting down, standing up and walking about the street. <sup><xref rid="fn29">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Various commandments of the Torah were observed by Jews even before the Torah was handed down. After they received the Torah it was only necessary to define and to strengthen these long since accepted commandments. When the Talmud states that Abraham observed all the commandments including &#x201C;Eruv Tavshilin, <sup><xref rid="fn30">29)</xref></sup> it expresses a profound idea that most of the laws which the scholars read into the Torah were operative among Jews for a long time preceding the giving of the Torah.</p>
<p>It is not necessary here to describe what &#x201C;Tefillin&#x201D; (phylacteries) are. But it is interesting to note that the Mishna makes no mention of the laws pertaining to phylacteries, nor of their appearance and how they should be made. Likewise it makes no mention of the benedictions that have to be pronounced over the phylacteries. It is therefore safe to assume that all of these laws were well known during the time that the Mishna was created. But later scholars feared that the laws and customs pertaining to phylacteries might be forgotten and they therefore had them written down.</p>
<p>The phylacteries contain four passages of the Bible which refer to the deliverance from Egypt and mention is also made of the injunction that &#x201C;these words shall be a sign upon your arm and a decoration between the eyes.&#x201D; For the concept of decoration the text employs the Hebrew word &#x201C;Totefeth.&#x201D; The scholars tried to explain this word to prove that phylacteries must contain four passages. Using the fact that the word &#x201C;Totafoth,&#x201D; which appears three times, is written once in abbreviated form without the letter &#x201C;vav&#x201D; and twice with the letters &#x201C;vav&#x201D; they tried to conclude from this that all four passages must be included in the phylacteries. At a later date Rabbi Akiba, who always forced the texts to prove his contentions, tried to deduce the same conclusion in a different manner. He explained the word &#x201C;Totefeth&#x201D; to mean four on the basis of two ancient tongues. <sup><xref rid="fn31">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word &#x201C;Totefeth&#x201D; is also mentioned once in the Mishnah and is meant to be a forehead piece. Interpreters declare it to be a decoration worn instead of phylacteries. In the Talmud the word &#x201C;Totefeth&#x201D; is used once and is synonymous with phylacteries. <sup><xref rid="fn32">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Long before the Torah was handed down it was the accepted custom among all nations that priests, as well as all other people who deal with religious matters, should wear religious emblems to distinguish them as men who are devoted to godly service. In later years, this custom of distinguishing between people according to their office, was also transferred to social and political life. Leaders of the army and officials thus carried special insignia to mark them as servants of the government. In a similar manner Jews adopted phylacteries to symbolize that their bearers are in the service of God.</p>
<p>It is therefore essential to know that even though the commandment to wear phylacteries is not expressly stated in the Torah and is only sanctioned by tradition and despite the fact that it is possible to interpret the word &#x201C;Totefeth&#x201D; differently, there is nevertheless not the slightest doubt that the law of wearing phylacteries was in effect among Jews at all times. As additional proof of this we may adduce the fact told by R. Azariah of the Adomim that when Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, sent messengers to Jerusalem to learn about the Jewish religion, the high priest Eleazar explained to them the custom of wearing phylacteries.</p>
<p>There is a dispute in the Talmud whether phylacteries should be worn on Saturday. Rabbi Akiba is of the opinion that since phylacteries are worn as a reminder of the deliverance from Egypt it is not necessary to wear them on those days which serve, in themselves, as reminders of this event such as the Sabbath and the feast days. The question as to whether they should be worn at night he answers in the affirmative. <sup><xref rid="fn33">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Women, slaves and children are not obliged to wear phylacteries. <sup><xref rid="fn34">33)</xref></sup> The Talmud derives this conclusion from the well known rule that women are exempt from all those positive commandments which depend on a definite time. <sup><xref rid="fn35">34)</xref></sup> It is characteristic that on another occasion the Talmud questions the authority of this rule and finds substantiation for it in the law of phylacteries. &#x201C;Since phylacteries are obligatory only during a definite time and women are exempt from this commandment, it follows that women are exempt from any commandment which is obligatory only during a definite time.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn36">35)</xref></sup> This logical conclusion regarding the exemption of women from the law of phylacteries thus proceeds in two directions. On the one hand it liberates women from this law and then it proceeds to liberate them from all laws which have the common time characteristic with it.</p>
<p>Phylacteries, as was explained before, are an emblem which indicates that those who wear them are devoted to God solely and do not recognize any other authority. But women, according to the concepts of that time, were the property of their husbands and a married woman was as obedient as a slave and was not the mistress of her actions. For this reason women could not wear phylacteries. It is told, however, that Michal the daughter of Kushi, (in the opinion of some she is identified with Michal the daughter of Saul) did wear phylacteries. <sup><xref rid="fn37">36)</xref></sup> This conclusion is derived from the fact that Michal the daughter of Saul once spoke sharply to king David. (Samuel II, Ch. 6.) There is also the case of one other woman, whose name remains unknown, who wrote the phylacteries for her husband. <sup><xref rid="fn38">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Slaves were considered in the same category as women in the matter of phylacteries. Since &#x201C;Tefillin&#x201D; contain the statement that God is the only lord of the world, it was impossible for a person who recognized the overlordship of a human being to wear them. Mention is made, however, of one Tabai, a slave of Rabbi Gamaliel, who wore phylacteries. <sup><xref rid="fn39">38)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The opinions of the scholars regarding God were highly original when compared to the prevailing concepts of that time. These opinions differed from those of the nations among whom the Jews lived. Greek culture had attained a high level of perfection but the Greeks still clung to polytheism. The same was true of the Romans, the Parthians and the Persians. In later years the Christians tried to prove that the trinity was a direct continuation of the Jewish faith. One is therefore astounded when he realizes the fortitude of our scholars and their success in their struggle against attempts to introduce competing deities.</p>
<p>The representation of God in a corporeal form, such as the sayings: the hand of God, the mouth of God, the foot of God, the back of God, the scholars explained by the need to describe Him in a manner that should be understandable according to human concepts. At the same time they expressly stated that under no circumstance must these concepts be understood literally that God possesses a hand, a foot or a mouth. <sup><xref rid="fn40">39)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The scholars then began to refer to God with names whose aim was to elevate the idea of God above human concepts. They referred to Him with the word &#x201C;Shechinah&#x201D; which means that grace which emanates from the godly majesty. At times they called Him &#x201C;Gevurah,&#x201D; in an attempt to convey the idea that he represents strength. Similarly they used the name &#x201C;Makom&#x201D; (place) because he is present everywhere, and &#x201C;Shomaim&#x201D; (Heaven) after the name of his residence. It is also characteristic that these names were not invented by the scholars but were current long before that.</p>
<p>The creation of the world they explained as creation ex nihilo. The central aim of creation was man, who was made in the image of God, whose face turns heavenward and who stands upright on his feet. Man possesses a soul and a free will to do as he chooses. Speaking of man, they considered the Jews to be the chosen people; within the Jewish people the pious and righteous man was the one elect. <sup><xref rid="fn41">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The idea of God&#x2019;s unity, our scholars held to be of the highest importance. They considered it to be a privilege for the Jews to recognize God as the only creator and to be recognized by Him as the chosen people. <sup><xref rid="fn42">41)</xref></sup> Jews also took an oath not to change their God. <sup><xref rid="fn43">42)</xref></sup> The reason why man was created on Friday before sunset, after all else was created, they explained as a lesson in modesty to man that he should not attempt to set himself up as a partner to God in the work of creation. <sup><xref rid="fn44">43)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus it was stated in the name of God: &#x201C;I am first and I have no father, I am also last and I have no brother, there is no God outside of me because I have no son.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn45">44)</xref></sup> Similarly they taught that God is one and eternal, without body and unchangeable. God said to Moses: &#x201C;I shall be where I shall be&#x201D; which was interpreted to mean: &#x201C;I have been long before, I am now and I shall be the same in all time to come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn46">45)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When studying the Torah one must aim to observe its commandments. Observation of the commandments is also conditioned by faith in Him who gave the commandments. The Jew was also enjoined to do all things for the sake of God and not merely out of feeling of duty or because he was persuaded that these things must be done.</p>
<p>Faith imposes the obligation to accept the authority of the &#x201C;kingdom of heaven&#x201D; and it includes the duty of thanking God on all occasions for the favors as well as for the hardships; one must also submit to the guidance of God and believe that whatever He does is ultimately for the best. It is necessary to serve Him out of love and to endeavor to make others love him. In doing so man&#x2019;s behavior will become akin to that of God; even as God practices compassion and mercy so also must man strive to attain these virtues.</p>
<p>Before the reciting of prayers was introduced it was customary to offer sacrifices. The offering of sacrifices was not a brutal murderous procedure but aimed at the purification of a man&#x2019;s thoughts. <sup><xref rid="fn47">46)</xref></sup> After the temple was destroyed it only remained possible to take a vow of abstinence (Nazarite), to refrain from drinking wine or cutting one&#x2019;s hair or to observe a fast day and thus inflict suffering on one&#x2019;s self through abstaining from all food and drink.</p>
<p>Most important of all is charity which one contributes with his money or by means of personal effort on behalf of another person. Charity is founded in love of one person for another which Hillel expressed as a rule of the Torah: &#x201C;Do not unto others what you would not have done unto yourself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When observing this rule one is led to the practice of true justice, mercy and compassion toward all living things including animals.</p>
<p>Another desirable trait is to preach moral truths to others. A Jew is under obligation to preach to others until the person being corrected becomes angry and shouts and is ready to curse and to beat the moralist. <sup><xref rid="fn48">47)</xref></sup> This trait acts as a safeguard against gossip, hatred and envy; it leads one to seek peace and friendship with others and eliminates the desire to cause damage to others.</p>
<p>One must also believe that God sees all the actions of man, that He knows the needs of the whole world and helps everyone; He particularly aids the Jews because of their justice and their faith in his mercy.</p>
<p>God&#x2019;s messengers are the angels, the prophets and the just men. The piety of a just man may lead him to the &#x201C;holy spirit&#x201D; and such a man can achieve great things for Jews through prayer. Repentance similarly safeguards people from evil. <sup><xref rid="fn49">48)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the most beautiful element of the faith is the belief in compensation and punishment. After his death, man is compensated for his good deeds and punished for his evil doing; children of good parents are credited with the deeds of their forefathers. And even as the individual meets with justice after death so also does the group. For the nation this assumes the form of the coming of Messiah and the coming to life of the dead. Of these matters the scholars spoke briefly when they referred to the &#x201C;wars of Gog and Magog,&#x201D; the &#x201C;pains of Messiah,&#x201D; the return of the &#x201C;kingdom of David,&#x201D; the &#x201C;future that is to come&#x201D; and others. All of these were to compensate the nation for the suffering which it has to endure in the present.</p>
<p>In the course of the generations there at times arose groups or individuals who questioned the validity of the &#x201C;oral law&#x201D; and asked: &#x201C;Of what use are these interpretations of the scholars? Have they ever permitted the eating of a raven or forbidden the eating of a dove?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn50">49)</xref></sup> But none of these opposed the moral views of the scholars for even the opponents of the &#x201C;oral law&#x201D; understood that it is possible to condemn certain interpretations of the Torah but that the moral teachings are so important and of such a humanitarian character that one can not oppose them.</p>
<p>The measures of God&#x2019;s justice are mercy and truth. This is also the meaning of the verse &#x201C;Your justice is like the mountains of God; your verdict like a deep abyss,&#x201D; for if His justice were not like the highest mountains, who would be able to withstand his verdicts? <sup><xref rid="fn51">50)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When God sits in judgment over man He does not consider man&#x2019;s previous deeds nor his possible future deeds but only the actions of the moment of trial. <sup><xref rid="fn52">51)</xref></sup> But God is strict with just men and punishes them for every little ransgression. <sup><xref rid="fn53">52)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From among all the nations&#x2014;the scholars believed&#x2014;God chose the Jews as his beloved children. <sup><xref rid="fn54">53)</xref></sup> The Jews are likened to oil; just as oil gives light even so are the Jews the light of the world. <sup><xref rid="fn55">54)</xref></sup> Because God loves the Jews he called them his first born children. <sup><xref rid="fn56">55)</xref></sup> It is therefore a great virtue to sanctify His name. The Torah was given in order that God&#x2019;s name be sanctified throughout the world. Whenever there exists the danger that God&#x2019;s name will be profaned, one must do all in his power to prevent it. <sup><xref rid="fn57">56)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the scholars were willing to grant that there is a possibility that the Torah is not the only means to vanquish passion in man for one must also possess piety. A man who knows the Torah but possesses no piety, they likened to a manager of a palace who was given only the inner but not the outer keys to the palace. <sup><xref rid="fn58">57)</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Three Main Parties of the Talmudic Period; The Pharisees, The Sadducees, The Essenes</title>
<h1><bold>THE PHARISEES</bold></h1>
<p>F<small>OLLOWING</small> closely upon the victory of the Hasmoneans over the Greek armies and their Jewish proteges, there began a dispute over the interpretation of the commandments of the Pentateuch concerning which many of the scholars held varying opinions. These disputes were frequently so serious that they constituted a threat to the existence of the nation.</p>
<p>Out of these disputes there emerged three main tendencies which eventually crystallized into three different parties: the Pharisees, the Saducees and the Essenes.</p>
<p>In general it is impossible to grasp the spirit of the Talmud and to understand clearly the teachings of its authors if one does not previously acquaint himself with the tendencies of these parties. It is also necessary to know that nearly all of the authors of the Talmud were Pharisees and that their spirit impressed its stamp on the Talmud, although it also contains numerous aphorisms by people who frequently joked at the expense of the Pharisees.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the Pharisees were active in establishing regulations over the conduct of Judaism that would serve as a defensive wall about the Torah. To this end many laws of the Torah were made more severe and others assumed a form which to the casual observer seemed to deviate from the original text. These interpretations were generally based on traditions which in turn had to be substantiated by the Torah. These different opinions were sharply disputed until the people were divided into the above mentioned three parties which afterward attacked each other.</p>
<p>Many of the Pharisees practiced such extreme piety that they renounced all earthly pleasures and by their actions and customs they set themselves apart from the rest of the population. On the other hand, there were many people who refused to recognize any interpretation of the law which, to them, seemed to be in disagreement with its literal meaning. These people particularly objected to the restrictions of the &#x201C;oral law&#x201D;. They allied themselves with those who fought against the laws that were based on tradition. The opponents of the Pharisees argued that the devotion of the Pharisees to the interpretations goes to such extremes of unreasoning belief that were their leaders to tell them that right is left and vice versa, they would unquestioningly obey the advice of their teachers.</p>
<p>The opponents of the Pharisees numbered in their midst the rich and politically influential Jews who felt that their attempts to attain closer spiritual relations with the neighboring peoples were hindered by the activities of the Pharisees. They particularly opposed the Pharisees because of the latter&#x2019;s devotion to faith and because of their lack of concern for the other problems of life. The Pharisees, on the other hand, held these views because of their conviction that man can achieve nothing without God&#x2019;s consent and that every attempt which runs counter to God&#x2019;s will is doomed to fail.</p>
<p>Separated from all other people by their manner of observing the Jewish customs, the Pharisees considered the other Jews as idol worshippers with whom no pious man should have any contact. Their very name indicated that they were a class apart in their behavior. (The Hebrew word <span dir="rtl">&#xFB44;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> means people separated or isolated.) They were especially severe in their observance of the laws pertaining to cleanliness and the paying of the tithe to the Priests and Levites. They believed that forbidden foods as well as grains from which no tithe was given to the priests were impure. The Pharisees were also careful to observe all the dietary rules of cleanliness even when they ate ordinary food and not that of sacrifices.</p>
<p>As a pious precaution, many Pharisees abstained from dealing with the so-called &#x201C;Ame Aratzim&#x201D; (people of the soil). A Pharisee would not eat at the same table with an &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz&#x201D; out of suspicion that the latter may not have contributed his share to the Priests and Levites. Neither would a Pharisee buy from or sell to an &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz&#x201D;, nor invite one to his house, nor go visiting into the house of an &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The name &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz&#x201D; was at that time applied primarily to tillers of the soil. Although agricultural work, as such, was highly regarded by the scholars, many of them openly confessed their dislike for the &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz&#x201D;, the man of the soil. Certain historians try to interpret this attitude as an indication that the tillers of the soil were not racially pure and freely inter-married with their gentile neighbors. In the Talmud there are widely diverging opinions as to which people should be classified as &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz&#x201D;. Some would have it that an &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz&#x201D; is a person who does not contribute the tithe from the fruit of his land. Rabbi Eliezer held that an &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz&#x201D; is one who does not recite the prayer &#x201C;Shema&#x201D; morning and evening. Rabbi Joshua said an &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz&#x201D; is one who does not wear Phylacteries. Ben Azai said it is one who does not wear fringes. Rabbi Nathan said it is one who has no Mezuzah on his door; Rabbi Nathan, the son of Joseph, said it is one who does not raise his children in the knowledge of the Torah. Others contended that even if a person studied much himself but did not serve other scholars, he deserves to be called an &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn59">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Pharisees disdained an &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz&#x201D;. From other sources in the Talmud we know that the &#x201C;Am Ha&#x2019;Aretz&#x201D; hated scholars.</p>
<p>Concerning the meaning of the word &#x201C;Pharisees&#x201D; it was noted above that it indicates people who separated themselves from all others by their behavior. Others would have it that the name derives from the fact that they devoted themselves to interpreting the law as they saw fit in order to adapt the religious commandments to the needs of the times. Since the Pharisees deeply understood the spirit of the Torah, they gave up the search for pleasure in life even as they avoided pride or any action which might seem immoral. They practiced brotherly love toward one another and each individual sought with all his might to avoid temptation.</p>
<p>The Pharisees were organized as a society and every member was addressed as &#x201C;Friend&#x201D;. This was not a closed organization and it did not limit its membership. Any person could join if he promised, in the presence of three members, to observe the rules of the organization which concentrated on cleanliness and ablutions. It is interesting to note that in accepting a new member no distinction was made between a scholar and an uneducated person. Both were considered of equal worth and any person who was willing to assume the burdens of Pharisaism could join the society.</p>
<p>As soon as a person became a member of the Pharisee society he undertook to serve God with his whole life. Such a person had to believe that God&#x2019;s eye is all-seeing and that He observes all man&#x2019;s acts in order to judge them for every injustice. Since man possesses a free will to do as he chooses he is held responsible for every act and he will have to account for his deeds before his Creator. The Pharisees also believed that God sometimes issues decrees governing nations or all of humanity and that such decrees may seem unreasonable to the victims. But such decrees are certainly just since God is just to the individual as well as to a group. If it appears that reward for good deeds or punishment for wrong doing is delayed, then one must remember that there is a reckoning after death, or later yet, when the dead will be resurrected, the deserving ones to eternal life and the evil ones to everlasting shame and suffering.</p>
<p>The Pharisees were very careful in their judgment of people and events. This is clearly seen from their verdicts involving physical punishment. They also treated everyone modestly; they received people kindly and tried to do good deeds to others, in so far as they could, at times even going beyond the limits of their strength. They were, therefore, deeply loved by the people and enjoyed their fullest confidence.</p>
<p>But what frequently happens to many high minded people also happened to the Pharisees. In spite of their good qualities, many people doubted the purity of their motives and they were suspected of doing many things in order to deceive their neighbors.</p>
<p>A specially strong hatred toward the Pharisees is evidenced by the New Testament. As a result of this the term &#x201C;Pharisee&#x201D; is today employed in world literature as a derogatory term and has become synonymous with a hypocrite. In other Christian writings the Pharisees are pictured as people who outwardly abstain from earthly pleasures but lead immoral lives. They are said to refuse to eat honey from impure bees, but do not abstain from pork. They are accused of fasting in order to atone for their sins against God even while they plan to deceive their neighbors.</p>
<p>It is probably true that among such a large group as the Pharisees were there must have been a number of individuals who were dishonest in their convictions. But it is also certain that the majority was honest, or they could not have maintained the leadership of the nation in those times.</p>
<p>It was remarked above that some of the scholars ridiculed the Pharisees. They portrayed seven different types, none of which was presented in a favorable light. The seven types are as follows: 1) One who is pious as Shechem, the son of Chamor, who was circumcised in order to obtain Dinah. 2) One who goes about with bowed head and hardly dares to raise his feet off the ground in order to display his modesty. 3) One who beats his head against a wall or goes about with closed eyes so as not to look at women. 4) One who goes about with twisted neck and head bowed like a hammer. 5) One who would persuade people that he has already done everything and challenges them to point out something he has not done yet. 6) One who does good deeds out of love for the reward which they bring. 7) One who obeys the law out of fear of the punishment which disobedience will bring. <sup><xref rid="fn60">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>_____</p>
<h1><bold>THE SADDUCEES</bold></h1>
<p>T<small>HE</small> S<small>ADDUCEES</small> were the second largest party among the Jews during the creation of the Talmud and they were separated from the Pharisees by a wide spiritual gulf. It is believed that the principles which were accepted among the Sadducees originated in the misconceptions of Zadok and Boetus (pupils of Antigonos of Socho). Other historians hold a different opinion. Those claim that the Sadducees were descendants or disciples of the Zadok family which was a part of the priestly aristocracy and produced numerous high priests in the course of several centuries. When, in later years, the Hasmoneans triumphed over the Greeks, they also took over the high priests&#x2019; office. Thus ousted from power, the descendants of Zadok were forced into a status of opposition to the majority of Jewish leadership.</p>
<p>The first source of friction between the Sadducees and Pharisees was thus purely political and only at a later date did it develop into an acute religious dispute. There is also no cause to doubt the Talmudic tradition that the Sadducees were the followers of Zadok and Boetus and at the same time to accept the theory of the historians that they were the descendants of the house of Zadok who allied themselves with these followers in undermining the foundations of Jewish traditions.</p>
<p>But it would be incorrect to maintain that the Sadducees completely rejected the traditional interpretations of the law. They too held to numerous traditions and many of their interpretations of the religious law were substantially the same as those of the Pharisees. They had their own &#x201C;Book of Decrees&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05E4;&#x05E8; &#x05D4;&#x05D2;&#x05D6;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span>) which expounded their explanations of the commandments of the Torah and, in spite of their desire to resemble the other nations in behavior, they also observed some customs which tended to set them apart from the Gentiles.</p>
<p>The customs of the Sadducees, at any rate, were better adapted to the religious beliefs of the rich and the aristocracy which governed the land. But the greater the number of rich men who joined the Sadducees, the stronger became the concentration of the masses about the Pharisees and the abyss between the two grew from day to day.</p>
<p>The primary difference between the Sadducees and the Pharisees consisted in that the Sadducees rejected the oral law which was accepted by the Pharisees. They maintained that only the written law of the Torah was binding upon men. In rejecting the traditions of the Pharisees, they refused to believe in the resurrection of the dead, which is not explicitly promised in the Torah. They ridiculed the Pharisees for the latter&#x2019;s belief in the immortality of the soul and in a life after death and made fun of the notion that the souls of the pious will rest under the throne of glory. Another subject of their humor was the Pharisees&#x2019; readiness to endure suffering in the hope of being rewarded in life to come.</p>
<p>The development of this party proceeded favorably because of the response which its ideas found among aristocratic and government circles which usually had the power to suppress opposition by force. There is also much justification for the view that the party of the Sadducees prospered due to the discomfiture of the Hellenists after the triumph of the Maccabees.</p>
<p>A major source of difference was the Pharisees&#x2019; belief that even though a man may possess a free will to do either good or evil, according to his inclination, nevertheless God controls him in everything and is the ruler of his thoughts. The Sadducees maintained that God does not interfere with man&#x2019;s behavior and that no reward or punishment awaits one after death. Reward or punishment, they argued, are inherent in the deed itself.</p>
<p>Twelve points involving disputed interpretation of ritual and law were contested by the Sadducees who claimed that: 1) The date of the Feast of Weeks should always fall upon a Sunday. 2) The daily sacrifice is to be provided by the individual and not by the community. 3) Frankincense burned on the Day of Atonement should be kindled by the High Priest before entering the Holy of Holies. 4) The ashes of the Red Heifer sacrifice should be gathered by a man who underwent purification the same day according to Numbers 19, 9. 5) The Sadducees burned only a small share of their meal offerings and ate the rest. 6) The commandment &#x201C;an eye for an eye&#x201D; they interpreted literally, so that if one crippled another, he himself should be crippled in like manner. 7) In the case of a false witness whose evidence causes the defendant to be punished, the false witness was to receive the same punishment. If the judgment brought about a death sentence, the false witness was not to receive his punishment until after the defendant was executed. 8) The law that only male offspring were to share the inheritance of their father was interpreted to mean that, if the heir was an only son and he died leaving only daughters, then his sisters as well as his daughters shared the inheritance. 9) The Sadducees held that a man was responsible for damage done by his slave just as he was liable for damage done by his live stock since the slave, possessing intelligence, might have caused the damage on orders of his owner. 10) They held a utensil to be unclean if from it a liquid was poured into an unclean utensil, thus making the liquid unclean. 11) They literally adhered to the procedure prescribed for a childless widow whose dead husband&#x2019;s brother refused to marry her, helding it necessary that she spit in his face while the Pharisees held that she only need spit on the ground before him. 12) They also held to the literal meaning of the injunction in Deut. 22, 17, regarding disputed virginity, while the Pharisees gave it a broader interpretation.</p>
<p>There were also six traditional customs, which had no sanction in the Pentateuch, which the Pharisees observed and the Sadducees rejected: 1) The pouring of water on the altar on the night following the first day of Succoth. All night water was drawn from the river Shiloah to the accompaniment of music and singing and was poured on the altar. The Sadducees ridiculed this custom as of Greek origin, but the Pharisees were devoted to it. Once, when a Sadducee priest poured the water on his feet instead of the altar, the angered populace showered him with their ethrogim and killed him. 2) The procession round the altar with willow branches was rejected by the Sadducees. When the seventh day of the Feast of Tabernacles occurred on Saturday, as was then possible due to the inaccuracies of the calendar, the Sadducees held that the custom of beating the willow branches did not supersede the Sabbath, contrary to the custom of the Pharisees. 3) They were opposed to the Phariseical custom of washing the hands after reading the Bible. 4) They opposed the inclusion of the phrase &#x201C;according to the law of Moses and Israel&#x201D; into the divorce certificates. Since these certificates bore the name and the year of the reign of the king, the Sadducees thought it would show disrespect for Moses to have his name appear alongside that of the king. 5) They denied the validity of Nehemiah&#x2019;s injunction against carrying objects from one household to another on the Sabbath. 6) They refused to recognize the new restrictions with which the Pharisees embellished the laws pertaining to purification of women.</p>
<p>But in spite of the oposition of the Sadducees to the teachings of the Pharisees and in spite of their having the support of the rich and the officials, they were not strong enough to withstand the pressure of the population which was mostly on the side of the Pharisees and was ready to defend its convictions with its very life.</p>
<p>Many customs were introduced by the Pharisees purely out of spite for the Sadducees. They endeavored to impress the people that under no circumstances must they act according to the dictates of the Sadducees even when these were nearly accurate. The Pharisees established the date of the Feast of Weeks on the sixth day of Sivan which, according to their calculations, was the date of the giving of the Torah. In the prayers to be recited on that day they included the words &#x201C;the time our Torah was given&#x201D; in order to strengthen the conviction that this feast was celebrated in commemoration of the giving of the Torah and not as a celebration of the bringing of the first fruits.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<h1><bold>THE ESSENES</bold></h1>
<p>T<small>HE THIRD</small> significant party in Jewish life of that time were the Essenes. This party left no permanent imprint on Jewish life and even when it was at its zenith it did not occupy a prominent place. From the Pharisees have evolved the Jews of the present day whose customs and beliefs are based on the Talmudic interpretations of the Torah. From the Sadducees in later times evolved the sect of the Karaites who represent the same mode of thinking. Of the Essenes we can only say that the early Christians conducted themselves along similar lines.</p>
<p>The development of the Essenes began in the early years of the Hasmoneans, and they are derived from the &#x201C;Chassidim&#x201D; of that time who fought against the Syrian Greeks under the banner of Judah Macabee and his brothers. They were those who would rather undergo martyrdom than do anything which might make them suspect of imitating the Greeks. However, many of them became dissatisfied with the situation even as it existed after the victory of the Maccabees. To them the behavior of the Hasmoneans was not sufficiently Jewish. They fled the cities and sought refuge in the mountains where they lived in an unusual manner apart from everyone else and awaited a change in the direction of Jewish ideas.</p>
<p>The meaning of the name Essenes is not entirely clear. Josephus called them Essenes; in Hebrew they are referred to as <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D0;&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;&#x05F4;</span>. Some historians claim it means modest, others say it means shy. Another version interprets the name as &#x201C;healers&#x201D; because the Essenes devoted themselves to healing the sick. The Talmud refers to them as &#x201C;morning baptists&#x201D; due to their habit of performing long morning ablutions. They were sometimes called pious fools and the Talmud defines a pious fool as a person who would not rescue a drowning woman for fear of touching her.</p>
<p>The conduct of the Essenes was not always the same and in the course of time it changed although the basic principles remained constant. Their main idea was to avoid impurity of the body because of their belief that an impure body harbors an impure soul. Because of this fear of an impure soul the Essenes refused to marry. They considered woman as the source of immorality and discord. However, they later realized that by not marrying their society constantly diminishes and some of their members decided to marry in order to bring children into the world. The rest stubbornly clung to the original principle and remained unmarried till their death.</p>
<p>The Essenes did not follow any employment at first since they believed that all work soils the body. When they suffered a shortage of food because no outsider would provide for their needs, they refused to steal and since there were not enough fruit trees and wild grasses to subsist on, they decided that work is permissible and they engaged in agriculture.</p>
<p>Some customs of the Essenes remained unchanged. When a person was sworn into their society he had to promise never to take an oath again, even if it was to tell the truth and his very life depended on taking the oath. They also believed that by means of their special customs they could become imbued with the holy spirit and be able to foresee the future. They had their special books which they successfully guarded from the eyes of strangers even as they avoided coming in contact with people holding other beliefs. Some of them devoted themselves to healing the sick with various grasses and herbs; others did their healing with the aid of incantations and prayers to the angels in charge of cures whose names they knew. Instead of bringing sacrifices, the Essenes offered prayers which generally began with praise to the Creator of light who &#x201C;daily repeats the miracles of Genesis.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Essenes never consumed food or drink which was not absolutely essential for the maintenance of life. They ate no meat and drank no wine and did not seek any pleasure in life. On the contrary, they hardened their bodies and gloried in suffering. Slavery they considered shameful because all men are brothers and as long as a man can serve himself he has no right to allow himself to be served by others. Every member of their society received what he needed free. They avoided anger and their word was sacred. They respected each other and even refrained from spitting in the presence of another person.</p>
<p>There were neither poor nor rich among the Essenes, for every person who joined them had to give all of his possessions to the society. Young and old, they all wore similar linen clothing which they guarded, just as carefully as they guarded their bodies, against dirt and the slightest spot, for they held cleanliness to be a decoration for a human being. Nevertheless they did not don any new garment as long as the old one could still be used.</p>
<p>They observed all the minutest regulations pertaining to Sabbath until it practically became a fast day for them. Since cooking was prohibited they ate nothing but dry bread, neither would they take any object into their hands and none of them even rose from their places on this day.</p>
<p>Many customs which the Pharisee scholars introduced into Jewish life were meant to be a protest against the Essenes. Since the Essenes did not eat meat nor drink wine and narrowly circumscribed their actions on the Sabbath, the Pharisee scholars expressly commanded that people should joyfully celebrate the Sabbath with meat and wine. Thus they also permitted the carrying of certain objects from one place to another (within the same household). When the Essenes became more strict and prohibited the lifting up of any object on the Sabbath, the scholars relented and permitted the touching of any vessel which is a bodily necessity or convenience, with the exception of tools which are used in every day labor. When the Essenes refused to marry, the Pharisees declared that any person who does not marry can be compared to a murderer who diminishes the stature of the Jewish people and drives the spirit of God out of its confines. Since the Essenes healed the sick with incantations, the Pharisees announced that whoever would attempt to perform a cure by means of an incantation would lose his share in life to come.</p>
<p>The Essenes customarily rose before dawn and bathed in cold water both summer and winter. They then put on newly washed clothes and, without anyone uttering a word, they began their collective praise to the Creator. When the sun rose each one went to his work which lasted five hours. After that they gathered again, removed their work clothes and bathed anew; they put on different clothes and entered their meeting house where no outsider was allowed. There they ate their bread and greens, each one maintaining silence, convinced that they were performing a necessary act in sustaining the body which God gave them and which must therefore be guarded. After the meal the oldest gave praise to God for His great mercy. They then removed the clothes which they donned when eating, put on their work garments and returned to work till nightfall. With sunset the previous procedure was repeated; they bathed and again changed clothes for the evening repast.</p>
<p>When a newcomer desired to join the Essenes, he was not so readily accepted. The candidate was put on probation for a year to test his self-control and his ability to observe all the regulations of the society. Then he was given a white shirt, cloak and a small ax and was put to work together with the rest. When, at the end of the year, the person proved that his conduct was consistent he was allowed to perform his ablutions together with the others. However, he still was not permitted to partake of food with the rest for an additional two years. Only if he was found worthy, at the end of that time, to join the society, was he allowed to eat with the rest and the secrets of the society were confided to him. Before the candidate had his first meal together with the other members he had to take an oath that he would love and fear God above all else and with his whole soul, that he would love other people more than himself, and that he would be kind to all creatures. He had to promise not to deceive anyone even if the greatest fortune were at stake; he promised to help the oppressed, not to be haughty toward other people, to love truth and hate falsehood with his whole heart, and above all, to divulge none of the secrets of the society to any person.</p>
<p>Only after he was thus sworn in did the candidate become a full-fledged member of the Essene society to whom all secrets were entrusted with the assurance that he would not desecrate his oath and reveal them to others.</p>

<chapter>
<title>The Samaritans</title>
<p>I<small>N DESCRIBING</small> the events in the lives of the authors of the Talmud, we will have numerous occasions to refer to the Samaritans and their various attitudes to political development in Palestine. We will therefore pause to explain who these people were.</p>
<p>It is stated on historical grounds that the Samaritans are a mixture of a small remnant of the Ten Tribes whose kingdom in Samaria was destroyed by King Sargon of Assyria (722 B. C.). This king exiled over 27 thousand inhabitants of the Samarian population to Habor, the river Gozan, Halach and the cities of Media and in their place he settled people from Babylonia, Kutha, Ava, Hamath and Sfarvaim. The remaining people of the Ten Tribes mixed with the newly settled peoples and as a result of this union there developed in time the so-called Samaritans.</p>
<p>The Samaritans constituted a considerable population during the existence of the second Temple and for some time after its destruction. Later they assimilated with other Jewish sects to some extent, and the majority of them disappeared entirely.</p>
<p>Whenever the Samaritans are referred to in the Talmud or in the Midrashim, they are called Kuthim. The probable reason for this was that the people of Kutha constituted the most important element among the settlers whom the king of Assyria colonized in Samaria in place of the exiled Israelites. According to the Bible, these people did not observe the Jewish laws and did not believe in God during their first years in Samaria. As a punishment their dwellings were attacked by lions who killed many of them. The king of Assyria was then informed that the people whom he settled in the cities of Samaria in the place of the exiled Israelites did not know the laws of the God who rules there and, in his anger, God set upon them many lions to devour them. The king of Assyria thereupon commanded to have one of the exiled priests sent there to teach the people the laws of the God of Samaria.</p>
<p>One of the priests came and settled in Beth El and he taught the inhabitants to fear the God of Israel. From that time on the inhabitants continued to worship their old idols but they also erected an altar for the offering of sacrifices to the Jewish God. Since these people were converted to belief in the Jewish God because of their fear of the lions, they were called &#x201C;Lions&#x2019; Converts&#x201D;.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to keep in mind that in so far as the people of the Ten Tribes were descendants of the tribe of Ephraim, they harbored a deep seated hatred for the tribe of Judah, which dated back to the time of the Judges, when the people of Ephraim were warlike, loved to rule and constantly quarrelled with the other tribes. From the tribe of Ephraim descended Jeroboam who rebelled against king Solomon and at a later date detached the kingdom of Israel from the kingdom of the House of David.</p>
<p>133 years passed from the time of the exile of the Ten Tribes till the destruction of the first Temple. The land of Samaria underwent many changes during these years. Assyria ceased to exist and its nations came under the rule of another people. Even before the destruction of Samaria, there was a spiritual kinship between Jerusalem and Samaria, as is indicated by some of the prophets. We may also assume that this relationship between Jerusalem and Samaria continued to exist and was strengthened when the Samarians saw that the God of Judah saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians, a feat which their idols failed to accomplish.</p>
<p>It is probable that many Samarians went to Judea at that time and joined the kingdom of Judah. There are also indications that the king of Judah had some control over Samaria at certain times. Thus we read in Kings 2, 23 that king Josia destroyed the high places in Beth El and in the cities of Samaria. There also exists the possibility that only a small part of the Samarians denied the sacredness of Jerusalem even before the destruction of the first Temple. Thus it is told that after the death of Gedalia ben Achikam there came eighty men from Shechem, from Shiloh and from Samaria with offerings and incense in their hands to sacrifice in the Temple, for they did not know that it had been destroyed.</p>
<p>It is not quite clear what took place among the Samaritans during the 133 years from the exile of Samaria until the destruction of the first Temple, nor later, in the time of the Babylonian captivity. One thing we do know that when the Jews returned to Palestine from Babylonia under the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia, and the Samaritans heard that they were planning to build a new temple, they approached Zerubabel and the other leaders of the people and said: &#x201C;We will gladly participate in your work, for we serve the same God that you do and to him we offer our sacrifices since the time of Esaradon, king of Assyria, who brought us here.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Samaritans are there called &#x201C;the enemies of Judah and Benjamin,&#x201D; which may serve as proof that the relations between the Samaritans and the Jews of that time were of a hostile nature. The Jews suspected evil intentions on the part of the Samaritans and refused their assistance. According to Josephus Flavius the Jews replied as follows: &#x201C;Why should you help us when you will be able to use our Temple anyway, for our Temple will be a house of prayer for all nations.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This refusal to accept the cooperation of the Samaritans revived the old feud between the tribe of Ephraim and the people of Judah. The Samaritans erected their own temple on Mount Gerizim. It is told that when Nehemia came to Jerusalem and found that the son of the High Priest Jojada ben Eliashiv was a son-in-law of Sanbalat the Horonite who hindered the building of the Temple through false reports to the Persian government, he expelled him from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Josephus offers a somewhat different account. He relates that Manashe, the brother of the High Priest Jojada, married the daughter of Sanbalat the Samaritan. Nehemia commanded him to send away his wife even as he had everyone send away their non-Jewish wives. When Manashe refused to do so, he was driven out from among the Jews. He thereupon went to his father-in-law Sanbalat who built for him a temple on Mount Gerizim, where an altar had already existed for some time, to offer sacrifices, and he appointed him priest of the temple. Josephus continues to relate that many other men of Judea flocked to Samaria because they refused to send away their foreign wives and there they abolished the regulations of Ezra the Scribe. They did other things in order to sanctify Mount Gerizim and even falsified the text of the Torah as suited their purposes.</p>
<p>Ezra the Scribe regulated the form of the Hebrew script at that time. Historians differ as to the reasons for this. However we may safely assume that prior to this the Jews employed the old Phoenician script, which is now used by the Samaritans only, and not the square Assyrian alphabet which we have today. The broad masses of the people were illiterate and the Phoenician letters were difficult to learn. Another motive of Ezra in selecting the Assyrian script was to establish a dividing wall between the Jews and the Samaritans. This choice of an alphabet was approved and carried through by the Great Synagogue.</p>
<p>According to Josephus, Sanbalat built the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim with the consent of Alexander the Great. This consent was granted as a reward for the assistance which the Samaritans extended to him in his war against Tyre.</p>
<p>But according to the Talmud the Samaritan temple no longer existed in the days of Alexander the Great. However, there is an obvious contradiction in the Talmud legend which confuses two events which transpired at widely separated periods, namely, the journey of Simon the Just, together with other Jewish leaders, to meet Alexander the Great who intended to destroy Jerusalem and the destruction of the Samaritan temple by the High Priest Jochanan.</p>
<p>The Talmud relates: The twenty-fifth day of Tebeth is the day of Mount Gerizim on which no eulogies must be delivered. On this day the Kuthim (Samaritans) tried to obtain permission from Alexander the Great to destroy God&#x2019;s house and he already granted this request. When the news was related to Simon the Just he put on his priestly vestments and taking the best men from among the Jews he put torches in their hands and thus they walked all night to meet the king.</p>
<p>They (the Jews) went on one side and the others (the Samaritans) on the other side until it began to dawn. When morning came and the king saw the Jews he asked his followers: &#x201C;Who are these?&#x201D; His people replied: &#x201C;These are the Jews who revolted against you.&#x201D; By this they meant to remind the king that the Jews refused to open the gates of Jerusalem for him before he conquered the Persians.</p>
<p>When they arrived in Antipatris the sun rose. As the king saw Simon the Just he descended from his carriage and bowed to him.</p>
<p>Then the king asked the Jews: &#x201C;What is the purpose of your coming?&#x201D;</p>
<p>To which they replied: &#x201C;Is it possible that idol worshippers can persuade you to destroy a house in which prayers are offered for you and your kingdom?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who would have that done?&#x201D; the king asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;These Kuthim who stand before you,&#x201D; the Jews replied.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I give them into your hands,&#x201D; the king answered to this.</p>
<p>The Jews seized the Kuthim and pierced the soles of their feet, they then tied them to their horses and dragged them over the thorns until they came to Mount Gerizim.</p>
<p>When they reached Mount Gerizim they plowed it and sowed it to lentils even as the Kuthim planned to do to the house of our God.</p>
<p>Later this day was set aside as a day of feasting. <sup><xref rid="fn61">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the construction of the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim near the city of Shechem, which is located in the very center of Palestine, Sanbalat hoped that it would soon become the religious center for all those for whom the road to Jerusalem was too long. In selecting Mount Gerizim he believed that he did the best thing possible because there God&#x2019;s blessing was pronounced on those who follow his commandments.</p>
<p>In later years the priests of the temple on Mount Gerizim attempted to persuade the people that the Torah was handed down from Mount Gerizim and not from Mount Sinai as the Jews claimed. To lend strength to this contention, the text of the Torah was falsified. But this attempt did not succeed and the claim was afterward dropped.</p>
<p>From that time the struggle between the Jews and Samaritans gained in intensity. Often it was a struggle of ideas, each side claiming that the truth was on its side. On other occasions it took the form of bloody wars which lasted for centuries. The mutual hatred between the contending sides was so strong that even in times of relative peace it was considered a good deed to kill a member of the opposing side. Every time the Jews were attacked by enemies the Samaritans made common cause with these enemies, with two notable exceptions, the destruction of the second Temple and the siege of Betar.</p>
<p>How deeply rooted was the hatred between the Jews and Samaritans we can see best from the writings of Josephus, although he might have been prejudiced against them because in his time they fought on the side of the Jews against the Romans. But this hatred of the two peoples is also mentioned earlier in the books of the Maccabees and Ben Sira says of them that he is &#x201C;disgusted with the shameful people who dwell in Shechem.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the Hasmoneans warred against the Greeks, Josephus relates, the Samaritans allied themselves with the enemies of the Jews and, at the time that religious Jews were tortured and persecuted by the Greeks, the Samaritans wrote to Antiochus Epiphanes: &#x201C;We are not Jews and we do not recognize the Jewish God. If to this day we observed the Jewish Sabbath and other Jewish feast days, we did so not out of our own choice but through compulsion. If the king disapproves of our going in the ways of the Jews and our worshipping their God, we will return to the Gods of our forefathers and we will dedicate our temple to Zeus.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After the victory of the Hasmoneans, the Samaritans joined with the nations about Palestine and sought to incite them to war against the Jews. Their hatred of the Jews was very great. It was for this reason that Jochanan Hyrcanos conducted against them a war of annihilation and destroyed their temple two hundred years after it was founded.</p>
<p>He was followed by his two sons who, although they fought amongst themselves, were united in their hatred of the Samaritans. When they conquered the city of Samaria, they leveled it with the ground and plowed up the site of the temple. The inhabitants fled the city to save their lives. Only much later, when Jerusalem was occupied by the Romans under Pompey, were the Samaritans returned to their dwellings.</p>
<p>The religious relations between the Jews and Samaritans varied with the times. Since the Samaritans resided among Jews for hundreds of years, legislation concerning them did not always follow the same system. At times they were considered as idol worshippers and it was told that their temple contained an image resembling a dove which they worshipped. On other occasions some of the Talmudic scholars maintained that the Samaritans should be considered Jews.</p>
<p>It was thus only natural that the Samaritans too should invent all kinds of stories about the Jews. Their main contention was that they were the real Jews and that only they observed all the commandments of the Torah. In order to prove that the Jews did not properly observe the laws of purity they did the following. On a certain Passover, when the Jews were gathered in Jerusalem, they placed the bones of a dead person among the wood which was kept near the altar in order to desecrate the Temple. But this action did not have the effect which the Samaritans anticipated. The scholars declared that after the bones were removed the Temple was pure again and argued that such dead bones do not have the power of profaning the Temple. Since no one knows where are the bones of the people that were drowned during the flood nor those of the victims of Nebuchadnezzar who destroyed the first Temple, it is entirely possible that some of those bones are interred near the Temple. Nevertheless, they said, no one would claim that the Temple is desecrated because of such bones.</p>
<p>At other times the Samaritans tried to spite the Jews. When the latter lit fires on the mountains to announce to far-away residents that a new month was beginning, the Samaritans sometimes put out these fires in order to cause erroneous celebration of the feast days.</p>
<p>At the time of the destruction of the second Temple, the Samaritans were the allies of the Jews in their struggle against the Romans. The Romans did not distinguish between Jews and Samaritans. The same was the case in the wars of Bar Kochba.</p>
<p>After the destruction of the second Temple the Samaritans remained in their city and their shrine continued to exist. Only about 150 years later they revolted against the Romans. The emperor Septimus Severus vanquished them, he destroyed the city of Samaria and killed its inhabitants. The same thing happened when the Romans warred against the Persians and the Samaritans helped the Persians.</p>
<p>The opinions of the Talmudic scholars concerning the Samaritans were not always the same. The great disputes occurred when both the Samaritan and the Jewish temples were in existence. Later the opinion prevailed that the Samaritans were true converts and according to Rabbi Simeon Ben Gamaliel a Samaritan was the equal of a Jew in every respect.</p>
<p>Sharply opposed to the Samaritans were the opinions of Rabbi Eliezer who said that &#x201C;one who eats the bread of a Samaritan is like one who eats pork.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn62">2)</xref></sup> Other scholars were milder in their attitude and permitted partaking of Samaritan food. <sup><xref rid="fn63">3)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Simon the Just</title>
<p>T<small>HE FEW DECADES</small> which the Jews spent in Babylonia, from the exile of Jehoyachin king of Judea till their return under Cyrus king of Persia, deeply influenced their spiritual development in so far as the outward manifestations of the Jewish religion were concerned. It was from the Babylonians that they learned to identify angels by name. In all the books of the Bible preceding the book of Daniel, angels are referred to without names. According to the story of the Torah and the Prophets, angels were created by God&#x2019;s wish to perform a definite mission. When that mission was completed, the angel would vanish without a name even as he appeared without a name.</p>
<p>Only after their return from the Babylonian captivity did the Jews begin to name the angels according to their function. Raphael became the angel of healing. Gabriel was the angel of strength and victory and Michael became the defender of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a clearer understanding of the political situation we must remember that from the time of the return of the exiles till the breakdown of the Persian empire there prevailed comparative political stability. The Jews gathered internal strength and fortified the foundations of their religious and national life. But we have not received the name of any person of that period who could be said to have been the leader of the people.</p>
<p>The leadership was concentrated in the hands of the High Priest and of the group of people known as &#x201C;Soferim&#x201D;, scribes, who copied the holy writings. No unusual activity went on. The people stayed within their modest boundaries and diligently devoted themselves to the rebuilding of their homes and lands, seemingly indifferent to whom they paid their taxes or who ruled the land.</p>
<p>Only much later, in the days of Artaxerxes III (362-338 B. C.) did trouble begin when the Egyptians tried to liberate themselves from the yoke of the Persians. The Persian armies marched into Palestine on their way to Egypt. The Egyptians too did not wait until their land was invaded and proceeded to meet them. Both armies met in Palestine and there the battle was fought.</p>
<p>The Jews were thus forced to provide for both armies. Each of the contending sides tried to gain their support but they remained neutral in this conflict. The war ended with the withdrawal of Persia from Egypt, and Palestine became the apple of discord between the two powers each of whom desired to possess it for strategic reasons.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there set in a spiritual decline within the Persian nation. When the Persians conquered Babylonia and other Asiatic lands they found the inhabitants worshipping various gods of fertility and indulging in immorality as a form of piety. The Persian king Artaxerxes III introduced this type of worship into all the lands of his domain. The new form of worship strained the loyalty of the Jews towards the Persians because it ran contrary to all their concepts of religion. As the king devoted himself to the new cult he refrained from active participation in matters of state and entrusted the conduct of the government to his officials. One of these officials was put in charge of Jerusalem; another official, named Bagases, assassinated the king and his whole household and assumed the throne.</p>
<p>It was to this ruler that Joshua, the son of the High Priest Joyada, appealed to have himself appointed High Priest after the death of his father instead of his older brother Jochanan, who was the legitimate heir. When Joyada died, he attempted to claim his office and was killed within the Temple by his older brother. Upon hearing this the governor hastened to Jerusalem to avenge his friend but, having arrived, he did nothing to the murderer and utilized the opportunity to plunder the Temple. In addition he imposed upon the Jews a fine of fifty golden Drachmas to be paid daily and he entered the Holy of Holies which he stripped of all valuables.</p>
<p>Seven years later saw the beginning of the wars of Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia, in which he conquered all the domains of the Persians. Some of these battles were also fought on Palestine soil. The prophet Daniel described those wars as he foresaw them in his dream: &#x201C;&#x2026; The four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts, different one from another, came up out of the sea. The first was like a lioness and had the wings of an eagle; I beheld till her wings were plucked off and she was lifted up from the earth, and stood upon her feet as a man, and the heart of a man was given to her. And behold another beast like a bear stood up on one side and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth&#x2026;. After this I beheld another like a tiger which had on its back four wings of a fowl and also four heads&#x2026;. After this I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and exceedingly strong and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped the residue with its feet.&#x201D; (Daniel, 7.)</p>
<p>The High Priest at that time was Simon the Just who was a direct descendant of the High Priest Joshua, the first after the return from the Babylonian captivity. The personality of Simon the Just is veiled in legend and it is difficult to establish the exact years of his life. The generally accepted date of his death is about 310 B. C. Some historians claim he lived at a later date. But it is certain that he was the last of the Great Synagogue and that this institution was abolished in his time.</p>
<p>Of all the teachings of Simon the Just there remained but one statement which he must have repeated on numerous occasions. &#x201C;Upon three things the world rests: upon the law, upon worship, and upon the showing of kindness.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn64">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Simon the Just was High Priest for forty years according to the Talmud. These were years when Palestine went through terrible difficulties. As in the days of the first Temple, the country became the battlefield for many nations. These events became so commonplace that they were not even properly recorded. But the Jews of the surrounding countries (Babylonia, Persia, Egypt) lived under more favorable circumstances and they refrained from coming to Jerusalem. With the weakening of the atachment to Jerusalem, they strove to establish spiritual centers within the countries of their residence. One competing Temple, the temple of the Samaritans, already existed on Mount Gerizim. It had for its High Priest Menashe, the son-in-law of Sanbalat the Horonite, whom Nehemiah expelled from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Many wonders are said to have occurred in the Temple in Jerusalem during the High Priesthood of Simon the Just. Some of these are described in the Talmud. <sup><xref rid="fn65">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the service of the Day of Atonement, two he goats were placed near the High Priest, one on his right and one on his left. Lots were cast to determine which one would be sacrificed as a sin offering and which one would be sent to Azazel in the desert, and each time the lot of being the sin offering fell to the goat on the right side of the priest.</p>
<p>The second wonder was the changing of the red string. A red string was tied around the neck of the goat being sent to Azazel. After the goat was thrown from the top of the precipice and it was cut to pieces in the fall, the red string which remained in the hands of the messenger turned white. This was a sign that the sins of the people were forgiven.</p>
<p>The third was the wonder of the burning western light. Since the Menorah in the Temple was situated between the North and South, its lamps were always lit from West to East. But in spite of the fact that the westernmost lamp was lit first it continued burning even when the oil in the other lamps was already consumed.</p>
<p>The fourth wonder was that of the altar fire. The fire on the altar increased of itself. Only two pieces of wood were added at sundown and the fire never went out.</p>
<p>Another wonder was that of the sheaf. A blessing rested on the sheaves which were given to the priests and on the holy loaves. Every priest received no more than the size of an olive and of that he ate his fill and left over.</p>
<p>Simon the Just did not approve of the Nazarites who vowed to abstain from wine and not to cut their hair for some time. As a protest against those Jews who indulged in extravagant living there appeared Nazarites who renounced all of these pleasures. Of these Simon the Just disapproved because he considered it a sin to renounce pleasures which God created for the benefit of people. He made only one exception to this rule and of this he tells himself:</p>
<p>There once came to me a man who had beautiful curly hair and he wanted to cut his hair because he ended the period of being a Nazarite. I asked him, &#x201C;My son, what made you decide to cut off your beautiful hair?&#x201D; And the man answered me, &#x201C;I am a shepherd for my father. Once, when I went to the spring to draw water for the cattle, I looked at my image in the water and I was tempted to be proud of my beautiful appearance and thus to lose my life through sin. So I said to myself, &#x2018;Wicked man, you are proud of something which is not yours, and you will, at any rate, turn to forms. I therefore swore to cut off this hair in honor of the Almighty.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>Simon the Just kissed the Nazarite on the head and said to him: &#x201C;May there be many like you in Israel.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Two Red Heifers were sacrificed in the days of Simon the Just. The Red Heifer offering was the sacrifice of a cow which did not even have two black hairs. The animal also had to be without fault and must never have been put to work. Such an animal was therefore very rare and it was considered a miracle that two such were found during the forty years of his priesthood. In spite of the fact that sometimes as high a price as sixty measures of gold were paid for such an animal, there were only nine such sacrificed during the existence of both Temples. Legend has it that the tenth one will not be found until the coming of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Tradition has it that Alexander the Great wanted to destroy Jerusalem. He was then conducting a war against Syria and Phoenicia and he wanted the Jews of Palestine to help him. The Jews informed him that they cannot do so because they swore loyalty to king Darius the Mede. Hearing this Alexander announced to his soldiers that he would take revenge. When the Jews heard that Alexander was marching on Jerusalem with a great army they were stricken with fear. The High Priest Simon the Just together with all the priests and elders went to greet him.</p>
<p>Simon the Just was dressed in the priestly vestments that he used to wear when going into the Holy of Holies during the service on the Day of Atonement. As soon as Alexander saw him he descended from his chariot and bowed to him.</p>
<p>The commanders of his troops asked him what happened to make the conqueror of so many lands, who placed his foot on the necks of so many kings, bow before a Jew whom he previously threatened to destroy. Alexander answered that every night preceding a victory he saw an old man in his dream who resembled the Jewish High Priest. He therefore refused to do him any harm and believed that being kind to him would bring him luck in the coming wars.<xref rid="fn66">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Simon the Just then led Alexander into the Temple. Alexander liked the Temple and asked that a stone image of himself be placed near the altar. Simon the Just answered that this was impossible because the Jewish faith does not allow images in the Temple. But he promised to immortalize the memory of Alexander&#x2019;s kindness in another manner. He had all the boys, who were born that year, named Alexander. The king liked this idea even better than having his statue near the altar.</p>
<p>The Samaritans then came before Alexander to complain against the Jews. They attempted to prove that their temple on Mount Gerizim was the true Jewish temple. Alexander asked them to debate the question with the Jews of Jerusalem in his presence. The spokesman of the Jews was one Gabiha ben Pasisa who, with his sensible arguments, destroyed the claims of the Samaritans. When Alexander acknowledged the Jews to be the victors of the debate, the Samaritans fled.</p>
<p>Numerous customs were introduced at that time which are still in force. Among them were the Kiddush and Havdalah, the blessings over wine on Friday eve and Saturday night and the regulation that even the poorest person must drink no less than four glasses of wine at the Seder on Passover eve. With the consent of the Great Court in Jerusalem the blessings over food were established. The reading of the Haftorah was introduced for Saturdays and feast days. Since the Samaritans did not acknowledge the sanctity of the Prophets an appropriate chapter from the Prophets was selected to be read each week.</p>
<p>The Temple in Jerusalem was already in existence about two hundred years and naturally the structure was becoming weakened. Simon the Just had the building repaired and had verandas built around it. Jerusalem suffered a shortage of water and much water was also required for the Temple service. The priests had to perform ablutions several times a day and even an ordinary person had to bathe before entering the precincts of the Temple. Simon the Just dug a well under the ground near the Temple from which an aqueduct was later built to bring sufficient water to the city through copper pipes.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Day of Atonement of the year in which he died, Simon the Just announced that he would die. When he was asked how he knew this, he said that on every Day of Atonement, when he entered the Holy of Holies to perform the service, he saw an old man dressed in white who used to leave the Holy of Holies together with him. That year the old man was dressed in black and did not leave the Holy of Holies with him. It happened just as he predicted. Seven days after Succoth he became ill and died.</p>
<p>Simon the Just was survived by two sons, Shimei and Onias, of whom Onias was the wiser and more capable. Simon the Just wanted Onias to succeed him to the High Priesthood. But Shimei intrigued among the people against the will of his father and caused them to believe that a man such as Simon the Just would not want his younger son to take precedence over the older. Disappointed, Onias left for Alexandria in Egypt where there existed a large Jewish community of over a million people. There he established a competing temple (the house of Onias) with an altar for the offering of sacrifices to the God of Israel even as the Samaritans had their Temple on Mount Gerizim.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Antigonos of Socho</title>
<p>Simon the Just was the last of the generation which considered that knowledge of the Torah and its interpretations was the exclusive privilege of the priests. He had numerous disciples among whom were many non-priests. Antigonos of Socho was one of the latter and he came to occupy the position of Simon the Just in the continuation of scholastic development.</p>
<p>There is even some doubt as to whether Antigonos was the direct successor of Simon the Just or whether he lived some generations later. But since history does not mention any intermediate personality between the two, we can rely on the Mishnah <sup><xref rid="fn67">1)</xref></sup> that Antigonos received his knowledge directly from Simon the Just.</p>
<p>The name Antigonos, which is Greek, is characteristic of the time. We already described how the name Alexander came to be accepted among Jews and it is possible that the name Antigonos was popularized in a similar manner. One of the Greek governors of Palestine, Antigonos by name, showed kindness to the Jews and out of gratitude to him they decided to immortalize his name. However, it is more logical to assume that the Hellenist movement which sought to bring the Jews closer to Greek customs was already in vogue at that time, for we find many Greek names in popular use such as Antigonos, Aristobul, Boetus and others. Even the &#x201C;Great Court&#x201D; in Jerusalem was known by the Greek name &#x201C;Synhedrion&#x201D; and this name was later sanctified through popular use. During the time of Antigonos there developed a crisis in Jewish thought; it is probable that the spirit of philosophic doubt became prevalent in the country and, against his will, Antigonos contributed to its spread.</p>
<p>He frequently used to say: When you serve God, be not like servants who serve the master with the expectation of receiving gifts but rather be like servants who serve the master without expecting gifts and the fear of Heaven will be upon you. Two of his pupils, Zadok and Boetus, who heard his words said: What can be the meaning of these words? Can a person expect that his servant work for him all day without receiving compensation? We must conclude that our teacher would not say so if he believed in a life to come and the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>Zadok and Boetus thereupon founded a new mode of living and organized a new party which came to be known as Sadducees or Boetusians. This party began to imitate the extravagant mode of living of the Greeks under the following pretext: Why should a person deny himself the pleasures of life if he can await nothing after death? In time this party evolved new forms of observing Judaism which were different from those of the majority of the people, they clung to the literal meaning of the commandments of the Torah as against the traditions of the scholars. For that reason they denied the resurrection of the dead and also the theory of compensation and punishment in a life to come. They ridiculed the belief of the masses that a new redemption would be brought by a Messiah since the conditions then prevailing could not be the culmination of the dreams of the prophets.</p>
<p>Jews very particularly observed all regulations pertaining to the &#x201C;uncleanliness of the dead.&#x201D; Upon dying a person ceased to exist for his family and friends and the body was given over to strangers for burial. The Sadducees considered this procedure disrespectful toward one&#x2019;s parents since one could not be sure what was done with the bodies. In rejecting the traditions they insisted that the commandment &#x201C;an eye for an eye&#x201D; should be interpreted literally and not, as the Talmudic scholars claimed, that monetary compensation was sufficient.</p>
<p>Antigonos lived in a time of constant wars between the kings of Egypt and Syria. Palestine was frequently the battle-ground of the warring armies and it was impossible to maintain order and to assure the security of life. Plunderers invaded the land from outside and when these left, the population was further impoverished by domestic banditry. Learning was on the decline. In a time of changes it was necessary to modify the Torah to adapt it to the needs of the day, but there was no one capable of doing this. As a result of this the people neglected their studies and Judaism was being forgotten. For nearly a hundred years the people lived in ignorance and spiritual poverty until the historical circumstances changed when the throne of Syria was occupied by a king who interfered with the religious life of the Jews and undertook to destroy the entire Jewish religion</p>
<p>Alexander the Great followed the principle of religious tolerance toward the peoples of his empire. This principle was adhered to by his followers. Any deviation from the religious observances on the part of the Jews occurred as a result of their own neglect. This condition lasted until Antiochus Epiphanes of Syria attempted to impose his religion on all the peoples of his kingdom. Among the Jews this attempt led to the revolt of the Hasmoneans which started a new epoch in Jewish history.</p>
<p>The belief that God protects the Jewish nation and will punish their enemies was deeply rooted among the people. They believed that the historical events chronicled in the Torah were not related just as historical events but that their aim was to teach the people to understand the rules according to which the world was being governed This was held to be the intention of Moses in describing the war with Amalek so that coming generations may know how to deal with the Amalekites who warred against the Jews in their wanderings in the desert after their first liberation.</p>
<p>Considerable attention was also given to the Hebrew language. Upon returning from Babylonia the people spoke a mixture of the neighboring languages together with Hebrew. Later the Syrian Greek language predominated. The court of the Hasmoneans then commanded that Hebrew should be employed as the spoken language. This ancient language had lost some of the power of its expression, but it developed again until it could be used to express all concepts.</p>
<p>In the development of the Hebrew language, both Aramaic and Greek were borrowed from extensively for certain new expressions.</p>

<title>Jose ben Joeser and Jose ben Jochanan</title>
<p>A<small>FTER</small> A<small>NTIGONOS OF</small> S<small>OCHO</small> there began a period in Jewish history which was characterised by dual leadership. This period lasted for about five generations and was called the time of the &#x201C;Pairs&#x201D; because two men simultaneously led and governed the people. One of the two was generally the Nasi (Chief) and the other was called, the &#x201C;Av Beth Din,&#x201D; the father of the court.</p>
<p>At first these &#x201C;Pairs&#x201D; were in complete agreement on all fundamental issues and differed only on minor religious questions. Later these disagreements increased and reached the point of severe disputes which engendered dangerous bitterness.</p>
<p>In all there were five such &#x201C;pairs&#x201D;: 1) Jose b. Joezer of Zereda and Jose b. Jochanan of Jerusalem; 2) Joshua b. Perachia and Nittai of Arbella; 3) Jehuda b. Tabai and Simeon b. Shetach; 4) Shemaia and Avtalion; 5) Hillel and Shammai. The reverence with which the teachings of these leaders were considered is illustrated by the statement of one of their followers, Nachum Halavlar (the Scribe): &#x201C;I received a tradition from Rabbi Miasha, who received it from his father, who heard it from the &#x201C;Pairs&#x201D; who received it from the Prophets as a law handed down to Moses from Mount Sinai.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn68">1)</xref></sup> This saying indicates the mood of the people who believed that every word of the &#x201C;Pairs&#x201D; was a law handed down to Moses from Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>The first &#x201C;pair&#x201D; lived in the days of the High Priest Alkimos who allied himself with the Greeks against the Jews under the reign of Demetrius Soter (about 300 B. C.). This High Priest met with considerable opposition from the pious elements who objected to his treacherous actions and attempted to lead the people along the true paths.</p>
<p>Jewish history has known such dual leadership even before the time of Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan. Thus we find Jehoshaphat the fourth king of Judea after Solomon, appointing two leaders to conduct the government. One, the priest Amariah, was the authority of the Word of God and the other, Zachariah b. Ishmael, was the lord of the commands of the king. After the return from the Babylonian captivity we find Zerubabel the secular leader and Jeshua b. Jozadak as High Priest. Still later the government was shared by Ezra and Nehemia. But in spite of this condition of dual leadership and the rarity of two leaders cooperating amicably, there arose no disputes among the first &#x201C;Pair&#x201D; except in the matter of one ritual question on which Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan could not agree. This question was also disputed by the later &#x201C;pairs.&#x201D; It involved the problem of placing one&#x2019;s hands on a sacrifice on a feast day.</p>
<p>The Bible enjoined a person to &#x201C;place his hand&#x201D; on the sacrifice which he brought and this was interpreted to mean that he was to assist in the slaughtering of the animal. Since this procedure involved a considerable effort it was held by some that a person should not do so on the Sabbath or on a feast day. Others maintained that the restrictions of the Sabbath are not operative in the Temple and the individual must therefore assist in the slaughtering of the sacrifice if it is to be offered according to the law.</p>
<p>The procedure of the &#x201C;placing of hands&#x201D; was as follows. The animal to be sacrificed was placed on the North side of the slaughter house and faced to the West. The person bringing the offering stood on the East facing the West. Then he placed his hands between the horns of the animal and confessed the sins for the atonement of which he brought the sacrifice. Those who prohibited this procedure of placing of hands on a feast day believed that it involved an effort and was therefore unnecessary; the others considered the whole procedure and the confession as sanctifying the sacrifice and permitted this effort in the Temple.</p>
<p>The problem of the Jews living outside of Palestine who sent their sacrifices to Jerusalem was of paramount importance in the discussion of this question. The decision involved the acceptance of the sacrifice without the presence of the penitent or a demand that the penitent must be present during the offering of the sacrifice. Those who permitted the offering of a sacrifice on a feast day without the presence of the owner feared that any undue severity might tend to encourage those Jews living outside of Palestine to erect altars wherever they live and thus to compete with the Temple in Jerusalem; they feared that it might even lead to idolatry. Those who opposed this leniency were motivated by opposition to the Sadducees who tried to make the regulations of conduct on the Sabbath or a feast day so severe as to be impossible of observance.</p>
<p>Two other decrees were introduced by Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan. They declared all countries surrounding Palestine as impure where no Jew may live. One who does live in any of these lands must perform numerous ablutions and rites of purification before he may enter Palestine. In issuing this decree it was apparently aimed to limit the dispersion of the Jews among the neighboring nations, which was assuming large proportions due to the persecutions of the Greek government. This decree caused great hardships to those who refused to submit to the laws of the Palestine administration which attempted to eradicate Judaism. The second decree promulgated by them declared all glass vessels which were made by non Jews to be impure even as earthen dishes were.</p>
<p>In passing it is worth mentioning that both of these decrees were done away with in time. Even observing Jews settled in Gentile lands in later years and glass vessels were considered pure after being rinsed in water. Jose b. Joezer also introduced three rules which lightened the burden of the laws. During years of famine, when the people could not identify the four types of locust which the Bible permits to be used as food, he gave his sanction to the use of a locust which invaded the country from Babylonia. He permitted the people to use the water and the blood from the sacrificial slaughter house for household purposes and as garden fertilizer. He also declared that only the person who comes in direct contact with a dead body or an impure object is impure but such a person does not convey the impurity to other people. This declaration was of special significance due to the preparations which were then going on for a rebellion against the Greeks who persecuted the Jewish faith. Many were reluctant to go to war out of fear of becoming contaminated through contact with people that touched dead bodies. It was for this reason that Jose b. Joezer announced that only the first person touching a dead body is impure.</p>
<p>Jose b. Joezer is credited with the following moral saying: &#x201C;Let thy house be a place of meeting for the wise and dust thyself with the dust of their feet and drink their words with thirst.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn69">2)</xref></sup> These words were directed against the government which aimed to separate the people from their teachers; anyone who converted his home into a place of instruction risked his very life if he was caught.</p>
<p>Of Jose b. Jochanan&#x2019;s life we know but little. Of his teachings there remained the following saying: &#x201C;Let thy house be opened wide and let the poor be like thy household and talk not much with a woman, not even with thy own wife.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn70">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>This statement too was aimed against the attempts of the government to introduce the morals of the Greeks and their lack of hospitality toward strangers and the poor. Since the Greeks worshipped goddesses Jose b. Jochanan feared that people might come to deify woman through sexual motives and he therefore sought to keep the sexes apart.</p>
<p>Jose b. Joezer was referred to as the &#x201C;zealot of the priesthood.&#x201D; The death of both Joses marked the end of the Encyclopedists who directed the nation in all spheres of life. The Talmud also states that from the death of Moses till the death of Jose b. Joezer the pursuit of study was at the same height as during the lifetime of Moses.</p>
<p>How Jose b. Jochanan died we know nothing but that Jose b. Joezer died at the hands of Greek soldiers. He was condemned to be crucified because of his anti government activities and his last words testify to his noble spirit and to the strength of his faith.</p>
<p>The High Priest Alkimos was related to Jose b. Joezer. In his endeavor to gain the favor of the rulers, Alkimos ordered the destruction of all pious Jews who refused to submit to the Greek religion. At his behest, sixty Jews were caught and sentenced to death; among them was Jose b. Joezer. As they were being led to execution, the High Priest Alkimos again tried to persuade his relative to submit to the government and save his life.</p>
<p>The following conversation between them was handed down through the generations.</p>
<p>Look, said the High Priest, at the wealth and great honor which I possess because I obey the orders of the government and also observe the misfortune which you have brought upon yourself that you have to die the death of a criminal.</p>
<p>To this Jose quietly replied; If those who anger God live as well as you do, you can readily imagine how good will be the share of those who do his will.</p>
<p>Alkimos further said: Can you show me another person who obeyed God&#x2019;s will more than you did?</p>
<p>To which Jose replied: If those who do God&#x2019;s will end as I do, what a terrible end must await those who anger him with their evil deeds.</p>
<p>These words made a deep impression on the High Priest and, according to the Midrash (Breshit Raba) he thereupon committed suicide. Others claim that he died from a stroke. (Josephus, Macabees).</p>
<p>Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan were designated as &#x201C;Ashkoloth,&#x201D; (literally: clusters) because they united many virtues within themselves. Great as their scholarship was, they also excelled in their moral behavior. When they passed away the people mourned that with their death all virtue departed. <sup><xref rid="fn71">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also related that Jose b. Joezer had a son who was not capable and did not follow in the footsteps of his father. Jose therefore gave all his possessions for communal purposes. <sup><xref rid="fn72">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was a time of unrest and wars between the kings of Egypt and Syria and Palestine was the battleground of the contending armies. In this turmoil little attention was paid by the people to learning and ignorance prevailed. The general tendency was to imitate the customs of the Gentiles, and the idea was current that Jews should assimilate with the ruling Greek nation. Among the first Greek customs to become popular were athletics and public tournaments. Many Jews were persuaded that their national welfare would be enhanced by training in the various sports and gladiatorial excercises. There might have been but little objection to these sports in themselves were it not for the Greek habit of engaging in these sports while altogether nude. It happened that when Jewish young men engaged in these exercises, they were ashamed of being circumcised and in various artificial manners tried to graft foreskins so as not to be recognized as Jews.</p>
<p>In time such manifestations of assimilation became secondary, and, as the party of the &#x201C;Friends of the Greeks&#x201D; expanded through the adherence of the richer elements of the population, they attempted to modify the service in the Temple to resemble more nearly the form of worship of the Greek temples.</p>
<p>Pious Jews considered such deeds as the peak of immorality and they rallied in a group which came to be known as &#x201C;Assembly of the pious&#x201D; or &#x201C;Congregation of the just&#x201D; in order to separate themselves still further from those friendly to the Greeks whom they considered to be Jews no longer.</p>
<p>There thus developed a great hatred between the two contending parties. The friends of the Greeks were denounced as &#x201C;traitors to the covenant&#x201D;, &#x201C;dregs of the people&#x201D; and &#x201C;profaners of the holy covenant.&#x201D; The assimilationist elements considered the pious people to be fools who observe strange ceremonies which hinder a closer understanding between Jews and Greeks, and before very long, the friends of the Greeks called on the government to come to their assistance in their struggle against the pious Jews.</p>

<title>Jochanan the High Priest</title>
<p>D<small>AYS OF TERROR AND TRIBULATION</small> beset the Jewish faith. Jerusalem was occupied by Syrian-Greek troops, in the Temple was installed the image of Zeus and swine were offered on the holy altar of the God of Israel. There was also no lack of Jewish traitors who assisted the enemy in his work and it seemed that the last hour had struck for the Jewish religion. Pious Jews sought safety in the mountains and caves of Judea, hidden from the eyes of strangers. There they observed the laws of Judaism and avoided desecrating the Sabbath; there too they inducted the new born children into the Jewish faith.</p>
<p>In the town Modiim, not far from Ludd, there gathered a group of the faithful. One of the priests, Mattathias ben Jochanan of the Hasmonean family, who could trace his descent from the priest Jojariv, erected an altar to the God of Israel. When the representative of the government heard of this he sent an officer with a detachment of soldiers to investigate the situation. The Greek officer called Mattathias and commanded him to sacrifice a pig on the altar. To this Mattathias replied: &#x201C;Were all the people of the king&#x2019;s domains to worship your god and were all the Jews to join them in this worship, I and my sons would still not deviate from the ways of my forefathers and I will not serve any other God but the only living God in Heaven.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then one of the Jews approached the altar to fulfill the command of the officer. Mattathias thereupon stabbed him with a knife and killed him. As the Greek officer tried to attack Mattathias, he and his soldiers were set upon by the surrounding people and were slaughtered.</p>
<p>Every one realized that this act of rebellion would be followed by the revenge of the government and that they were facing a choice between struggle and annihilation. This deed of Mattathias therefore acted as a call to battle and a long and bitter war ensued. The Greeks could bring onto the field of battle many more well equipped soldiers than the Jews could. The Jews therefore feared to face them in open battle and conducted a guerilla form of warfare. Judas Macabbee, the son of Mattathias, fell in one of these battles and he was succeeded by his brother Jochanan who led the Jewish forces to victory in several engagements. With the consent of the king, Jochanan assumed the high priesthood which he held for but a short time until he was betrayed to the enemy and killed. Simeon, the youngest son of Mattathias, then assumed the leadership of the people and also successfully completed the war of liberation.</p>
<p>The religious leadership of the nation then rested not in the hands of individuals or of a &#x201C;pair&#x201D; but was vested in a Beth Din (a court of at least five people and sometimes more). This body came to be known in the Talmud as &#x201C;The Court of the Hasmoneans&#x201D; but history does not record the names of any of the members of this court.</p>
<p>It is probable that this court did not come into existence before the rule of Jonathan, son of Mattathias. When Jonathan sent letters to the Lacedemonians to renew the alliance against the Syrians, we find these letters signed by men of the &#x201C;Great Council.&#x201D; When Simeon became Nasi, we read that this position was given to him by the &#x201C;Elders&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Heads of the people.&#x201D; These men apparently were the members of the &#x201C;Court of the Hasmoneans.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This court worked to erect an impenetrable wall between the Jews and the non Jews. All the previous laws of the Torah pertaining to relations with other peoples were interpreted in the severest possible manner. They also instituted difficult regulations in all matters pertaining to uncleanness; all of these decrees later came to be known as the laws of the Hasmonean court.</p>
<p>It was this court which established an annual feast of eight days to commemorate the miracles which transpired during the war with the Greeks. This feast came to be called &#x201C;Chanukah,&#x201D; dedication, because it was originally celebrated to rededicate the altar which the Greeks profaned with unclean sacrifices. Although many feast days to commemorate various triumphs of the Macabbees were in vogue at that time, only Chanukah with its lights and singing of praise continued to be celebrated throughout the years and was sanctioned by the Hasmonean court.</p>
<p>In addition to the new regulations, the ultra pious voluntarily assumed many other restrictions. Prayers which were introduced by the Great Synagogue were already in common use but before beginning to recite them it became customary to devote a few minutes to spiritual communion with &#x201C;the father in heaven.&#x201D; This spiritual communion they would not interrupt under any circumstances were even a king to drive by or were a snake to wind itself about the foot of the suppliant. Disregarding all perils, the ultra pious were ready to face any danger if only it would enable them to observe the laws of the Torah. The observance of the Sabbath was held in special esteem so that even the killing of a poisonous snake on that day was considered to be sinful. At first they even refused to fight their enemies on the Sabbath and history records one case during the lifetime of Mattathias when one thousand Jews were burned to death in a cave to which the Greek soldiers set fire because they did not want to desecrate the Sabbath by putting out the fire. After this occurrence Mattathias instructed all his followers to desecrate the Sabbath if necessary when fighting the enemy.</p>
<p>But the observance of the Sabbath was not the only law which they obeyed in its minutest details. They cleared the roads used by travelers of all thorns, glass and other hindrances lest some person stumble and be injured due to another&#x2019;s negligence. These they buried deep in the ground so that not even a ploughshare might turn them up.</p>
<p>After the triumph of the Hasmoneans the people felt free and joyous and on feast days they all gathered together, both those who previously sinned as well as those who never departed from the faith, and joined in a common chorus. The past sinners would begin their song with the words, &#x201C;Praised be he who never sinned&#x201D; and the chorus responded &#x201C;He who sinned shall be forgiven.&#x201D; Then those who felt free of wrong doing intoned, &#x201C;Praised be my youth which did not bring shame on my old age&#x201D; and the sinners of the past joined with, &#x201C;Praised be my old age which atones for the transgressions of my youth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The court of the Hasmoneans was systematically strict in the enforcement of those laws which did not cause any losses to the people but practiced leniency where the legislation was becoming intolerably severe as in the cases of the Nazarites and of the Passover offering. These lenient or strict interpretations were based on new studies of the text of the Bible to every letter of which great significance was being ascribed. The scholars of that time also began to ponder the events of Jewish history and attempted to explain the causes of the great suffering which Jews had to endure. They came to the conclusion that all injury inflicted on the Jews invariably is avenged on the evil doers. Thus Amalek tried to destroy them and he was wiped off the face of the earth. Pharaoh enslaved the Jews and caused their children to be cast into the river so the Egyptians were drowned in the sea. This, they reasoned, must be the fate of every nation which does harm to the Jews; to be repaid with the same measure.</p>
<p>Simeon, the son of Mattathias the Hasmonean, was assassinated in a treacherous fashion by his son in law Ptolemy ben Chabub who occupied the post of tax collector in the district of Shechem. Feeling secure after his triumph over the Greeks, Simeon frequently accepted the invitations of his son in law to visit him together with his family. It was on one of these visits that he was murdered by Ptolemy who was secretly negotiating with the Greek rulers to have himself appointed governor of the country after the death of Simeon. But Ptolemy&#x2019;s hopes proved to be vain. The king of Syria did not fulfill his promise and Simeon&#x2019;s son Jochanan succeeded his father. Jochanan united within himself both the religious and the secular authority over the people as prince and High Priest.</p>
<p>Historically Jochanan is known as John Hyrcanus or Hyrcanus the first to distinguish him from king Hyrcanus II who was the grandfather of queen Miriam the Hasmonean. In the Talmud he is called Jochanan the High Priest. The surname Hyrcanus he obtained from his conquest of the fortress Hyrcania.</p>
<p>After Ptolemy murdered Jochanan&#x2019;s father he held his mother as hostage for fear of reprisals from Jochanan. When Jochanan stormed Ptolemy&#x2019;s fortress and it seemed that it might fall, Ptolemy led his mother in law to the wall of the castle and there he tortured her in sight of her son. Jochanan was ready to withdraw in order to spare his mother any more suffering but she exhorted him in the name of his father not to be affected by her injuries and to exert every effort to take the fortress. But the stronghold was well fortified and he could not conquer it. Seeking for an excuse to retreat without shame, Jochanan declared that the new year, which was just then beginning, was a sabbatical year during which no wars might be waged. Ptolemy murdered his mother in law and fled after which he was never heard of again.</p>
<p>Shortly after this event Jochanan was again involved in war with the Greeks who, under their new king Antiochus Sedetis, attempted to regain control of the country. They advanced on Jerusalem with a great army but they could not take it. The power of the Greeks was broken and they feared the intervention of Rome which was bound by treaty to assist the Jews. After much fighting a new peace was declared according to which the Jews had to pay 500 measures of silver and to deliver a number of young men from the noble families as hostages. In time the relations with the Syrian Greek kingdom improved to such an extent that Jochanan even sent military assistance to their king in his wars against the Parthians.</p>
<p>Jochanan was engaged in many protracted wars until he finally succeeded in completely freeing his country. With the aid of gold treasures which he found in the tombs of the kings of Judea he hired a mercenary army and marched on the Idumeans. To them he offered the choice of accepting the Jewish faith or being exiled. The Idumeans preferred to accept the Jewish religion rather than be driven out of their homes. Jochanan then attacked Samaria which he destroyed together with the Samaritan temple which was the greatest hindrance to the existence of the Temple in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>As a result of these conquests it became necessary to introduce new regulations which should fit the newly created conditions. Among the conquered cities there were some which were previously a part of Syria and as such were considered unclean where no Jew might live. These cities were now considered a part of Palestine and were subject to all the laws pertaining to tithes, the sabbatical year, the bringing of the first fruits, the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the offering of sacrifices. The rule was established that if one buys a field in Syria it is as if he bought a field in a suburb of Jerusalem, and all the newly conquered cities which could be reached without passing through foreign territory were considered to be the equals of the holy Palestine towns. In this manner Jochanan extended the boundaries of Palestine to include Syria in the possession of the Jews even as he did with the cities of Idumea.</p>
<p>Some of the regulations relating to the bond of Syria with Palestine were changed at a later date; it also soon became evident that the Idumeans who were converted by force did not add to the well being of the Jewish people. But the sincerity of the intentions of Jochanan was appreciated by all and even though, in later years, he came in conflict with the scholars, the Talmud nevertheless credits him for his good intentions.</p>
<p>Other religious innovations were directed against the Samaritans (Kuthim) who mingled with the other Jews after the destruction of their temple but in their hearts still bore a great hatred toward them. This hatred caused uneasiness and the Samaritans were mistrusted; their adherence to the Jewish people was questioned even though they seemed to observe some customs even more strictly than did the Jews. It was then forbidden to partake of the food of a Samaritan and eating of the bread of a Samaritan was considered to be the same as eating pork.</p>
<p>Among his other innovations, the High Priest Jochanan also did away with reciting the dedication which was prescribed for all men who brought the tithe. He sent out messengers throughout the cities of Palestine to see whether the tithes were properly contributed. These messengers reported to him that the Palestine farmers gave only the &#x201C;Large tithe,&#x201D; the exact amount of which was never established; they therefore offered only between two and three percent. When Jochanan heard this he ordered that whoever bought grain or fruit from a farmer (Am Haaretz) should not ask whether the tithes were already given from that produce and he was obliged to offer the necessary amount even though the seller assured him that the tithes were already given. It was for this reason that he abolished the confession during the offering of tithes; out of fear that a falsehood might be uttered before God if a person should say that he gave the proper tithes.</p>
<p>The difficulties with the giving of tithes began during the days of Ezra. Since not all the Levites wanted to return to Palestine from Babylonia, Ezra fined those who refused to return by taking away their rights to the tithe. It thus became impossible to include the words &#x201C;and I gave it to the Levite&#x201D; which are contained in the Biblical text of the confession of the tithes. Others thought that since the tithes were frequently collected by force it would not be true to confess that the tithes were &#x201C;given.&#x201D; The High Priest Jochanan also realized that the conditions affecting the tithes changed radically. During the days of the first Temple, Palestine was divided among the tribes and the Levites did not possess any lands; they were thus entitled to the tithes. But in his time conditions were different and the tithes weighed heavily on the farmers who had to pay taxes in addition to the three different kinds of tithes (first tithe, second tithe, tithe for the poor). Realizing the injustice of this condition and being powerless to abolish the commandment of the Torah, he introduced a new system. He appointed overseers to watch that the farmers obey the law and to take the tithes by force if necessary. But when a person bought produce from a farmer he did not have to inquire whether tithes were given but had to consider his purchase as &#x201C;Dmai&#x201D;, doubtful produce, from which the buyer had to give the tithes.</p>
<p>Until the time of Jochanan it was customary to work in Jerusalem in the period intervening between the first and last day of a holiday and the pounding of hammers was heard throughout the city. Jochanan considered this a profanation of the holy city and he forbade it. When in later years it was altogether forbidden to work with hammers in Jerusalem the new regulation was based on Jochanan&#x2019;s ordinance.</p>
<p>He also did away with the singing of Psalm 48 by the Levites during the service. Verse 24 of this Psalm reads &#x201C;Awake, why do you slumber Lord.&#x201D; It came to be chanted at a time when the Jews were sorely pressed on all sides while the other nations lived in peace. But Jochanan held that it is disrespectful to ask God to awake from slumber. He also changed the procedure of offering sacrifices. Previously it was customary to make an incision between the horns of the animal to be slaughtered with a sharp knife in order that the blood might blind it and make it easier to bind. Jochanan said that this practice was equivalent to crippling the sacrifice as the cut might pierce the animal&#x2019;s brain and thus make it unfit for sacrifice. He ordered that a ring be made to be placed on the neck of the animal and thus facilitate its binding.</p>
<p>In the observance of the commandments of the Torah, Jochanan always sided with the Pharisees. But once, during the closing years of his life the Pharisees incurred his anger and he forsook them to take the part of the Sadducees. It happened during a feast which he gave after one of his victories, that, flushed with wine he challenged the assembled to mention any evil which they knew of him. One of the guests, Eleazar ben Poirah, whom the Talmud calls &#x201C;a wicked and hard hearted scoffer,&#x201D; said to Jochanan: &#x201C;The Pharisees are displeased with you.&#x201D; When Jochanan inquired for the cause of the displeasure, there rose an old man Jehudah ben Gadidiah and said: &#x201C;Enough that you have the crown of royalty; leave the crown of the priesthood for a pious descendant of Aaron for you are the son of a woman who was held in captivity.&#x201D; (He was referring to the fact that Jochanan&#x2019;s mother was held captive among the Gentiles which may have cast some doubt on his parentage.) Very much concerned, Jochanan had the whole matter investigated and when the statement was not substantiated Jehuda ben Gadidia was tried by the Sanhedrin and sentenced to be flogged.</p>
<p>But Jochanan was not satisfied with this punishment and the Sadducees further incited him to believe that all the Pharisees thought as Jehuda ben Gadidia did. As Jochanan tried to justify the verdict of the Sanhedrin on the ground that the Torah commands that a slanderer be flogged, the above mentioned Eleazar ben Poirah said: &#x201C;True this is the law for one who slanders an ordinary person, but in this case where a king and High Priest was slandered, the Sanhedrin should have acted differently.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jochanan allowed himself to be persuaded. He removed all the Pharisees from the Sanhedrin and filled their places with Sadducees. The new Sanhedrin immediately tried Jehuda ben Gadidia a second time and condemned him to death together with a number of other Pharisees. From that time Jochanan remained an adherent of the Sadducees. <xref rid="fn73">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<ftnote id="fn73">&#x002A;) This version of the manner in which Jochanan forsook the Pharisees to join the Sadducees is told by Josephus. In the Talmud it is stated that it happened during the reign of king Jannai. However, the reference could not be to Alexander Jannai, the son of Jochanan Hyrcanus, for on another occasion the Talmud states &#x201C;Jannai and Jochanan are the same person.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Joshua ben Perachia and Nittai of Arbela</title>
<p>The period of the spiritual activity of the High Priest Jochanan also marked the rise of another &#x201C;pair&#x201D; of spiritual leaders. Sympathizing then with the Pharisees, Jochanan recognized the necessity of bringing to the forefront of religious life the two most outstanding scholars, one of whom was to occupy the post of Nasi of the Sanhedrin and the other was to be head of the Supreme Court, even as in the days of Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan. He accordingly appointed Joshua ben Perachia Nasi and Nittai of Arbela head of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Whatever innovations were introduced by these scholars were credited to Jochanan because, as political and religious leader of the nation, he had sufficient authority to enforce them. But when Jochanan transferred his allegiance to the Sadducees after the Sanhedrin sentenced Jehuda b. Gadidia only to be flogged for slandering him, he removed all the Pharisees from the Sanhedrin and abolished all their legislation. Joshua b. Perachia feared to remain in the country and fled to Egypt where, it may be assumed, he was joined by Nittai of Arbela.</p>
<p>Out of Egypt Joshua b. Perachia wrote to the Jews of Palestine that the wheat shipped from Alexandria should be considered unclean because he believed it was being contaminated by unclean hands in the process of irrigation and fertilization which was being practiced in Egypt. This restriction was based on the text of the Torah (Leviticus, 11). Others explained his prohibition of the use of Alexandrian wheat on the grounds that by using irrigation and other artificial methods to encourage the plant growth, human beings interfere with the natural laws and attempt to improve the natural course of development as it was ordained by God.</p>
<p>But the leaders in Jerusalem refused to abide by this prohibition of Joshua b. Perachia and said that even though he might consider it unclean all other Jews might consider it fit for consumption. <sup><xref rid="fn74">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is regrettable that no mention is made of the relation of Joshua b. Perachia to the temple of Onias in Alexandria. It is possible that he did not openly condemn the temple of Onias because it was held in great reverence by the Jews of Egypt, but secretly he must have been opposed to it. He was too deeply attached to Jerusalem and to its temple to reconcile himself to the idea that Jews can have another temple outside of Jerusalem. He therefore tried to create the impression that whatever comes out of Egypt is impure, both the grain that was shipped out as well as the sacrifices that were offered there.</p>
<p>The manner in which Onias, the son of Simeon the Just, left Jerusalem and erected the &#x201C;temple of Onias&#x201D; to compete with the temple in Jerusalem was related in a previous chapter. It is characteristic that the scholars had no definit attitude toward this temple. They were convinced that it was built for sacred purposes and therefore stated that &#x201C;the temple of Onias is not a house of idolatry.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn75">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But in spite of the official sanction which they gave to this temple they never wholeheartedly approved of it. The priests of the temple of Onias they held on a level with priests of Bamoth (high places built for purposes of offering sacrifices) which were built for sacred and not for idolatrous purposes. This type of Bamah was also forbidden during the time that the temple existed, but a Bamah which was erected by an individual for sacred purposes was permitted. They therefore looked upon the temple of Onias as a private Bamah built for sacred purposes.</p>
<p>The Mishna established a rule that whoever vowed to bring a burnt offering in the temple of Onias must offer this sacrifice in the temple in Jerusalem, but if the person sacrificed the burnt offering in the temple of Onias he has fulfilled his vow. Josephus relates that during the civil war between the princes Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, when the Jews of the various cities of Palestine could not go to Jerusalem to sacrifice the Paschal lamb, they went to the temple of Onias to bring this offering.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the contradictions which characterize Josephus&#x2019; writings of the temple of Onias. On one occasion he states that when Onias built this temple he persuaded the king of Egypt that a temple located in Egypt would serve to keep alive the hatred of the Jews toward Antiochus and would arouse their revenge against Antiochus for having destroyed the temple in Jerusalem. Several pages further Josephus maintains that by building this temple Onias sought to avenge himself for the wrong which he considered was done by the Jews of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Of the teachings of Joshua b. Perachia there has come down to us one noble maxim: Make thee a teacher and win thee a friend and judge every man favorably. <sup><xref rid="fn76">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The political and social conditions in Palestine were such that if a person wanted to remain true to the traditions of his people he needed a teacher and a guide whom he might imitate; he needed a friend to correct any error in his ways. Joshua b. Perachia especially believed in judging people fairly. Even though he was forced to flee Jerusalem and to seek refuge in Alexandria, he never spoke evil of the high priest Jochanan who was responsible for his exile.</p>
<p>But Nittai of Arbela held a more pessimistic point of view. He stated: Keep far from an evil neighbor and do not consort with the wicked and do not despair in time of punishment. This pessimism of Nittai of Arbela, which ended on a hopeful note, was an outgrowth of his life experiences. It is probable that he was friendly to the Sadducees in his youth and realized later the dangers which are inherent in friendship with them. But he did not despair of the situation and never gave up hoping that the times would change for the better.</p>
<p>In time conditions did change in Jerusalem. The High Priest Jochanan died and in his will he appointed his wife queen and his son Aristobulus High Priest. But Aristobulus seized the royal crown and, when was chided by his mother for not adhering to his father&#x2019;s will, he imprisoned her together with three of his younger brothers. While in prison the queen was allowed to die of starvation. A disagreement between Aristobulus and his brother Antigonos, who was the leader of the army, led to the assassination of Antigonos. Aristobulus died a short time later and was succeeded by his widow Salome. She freed the third son of Jochanan, Alexander Jannai. Alexander married the childless widow of his brother, even though as High Priest he was forbidden to marry a widow, and together they reigned over the land.</p>
<p>Queen Salome was friendly to the Pharisees and she appointed her brother Simeon b. Shetach religious head. Simeon immediately invited Joshua b. Perachia to return from Egypt. Joshua hastened to Jerusalem but whether he resumed his previous position remains unknown.</p>
<p>It is related that Joshua b. Perachia once came in conflict with one of his disciples named Jeshu. (Some would have it that Jeshu was identical with Jesus, but this is altogether impossible since Jesus lived during the latter part of the reign of Herod. This would place the event in the 160th year of the life of Joshua b. Perachia.) Once, when Joshua lived in Egypt, he was kindly treated by the proprietress of his hostelry. Joshua praised her to his disciples and said: &#x201C;See what a beautiful woman she is.&#x201D; The disciple named Jeshu said to him: &#x201C;Rabbi, she is not beautiful for her eyes are almond shaped.&#x201D; Thereupon Joshua said to him: &#x201C;Wicked man, are you concerned with such trifles?&#x201D; and he drove him away. This disciple returned numerous times to attempt to reconcile his master but Joshua paid no attention to him. Once the disciple came while Joshua was in the midst of reciting the Shema and was ready to forgive him. Joshua motioned to him with his hand to wait until he would complete the prayer. The disciple misunderstood this motion and believed that he was being driven out. He thereupon left and began to devote himself to magic. Joshua went to the house of his disciple to tell him that he would be forgiven if he repented, but he was told that it was too late.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Judah ben Tabbai and Simeon ben Shetach</title>
<p>Judah b. Tabbai and Simeon b. Shetach were the third of the &#x201C;pairs&#x201D; in the series of dual leadership. It is not clear which one of them was Nasi of the Sanhedrin and which one was head of the court. The name of Judah b. Tabbai is listed first whenever they are mentioned together which may lead to the conclusion that he was the Nasi. However, there exists an opinion that Simeon b. Shetach was Nasi and Judah b. Tabbai was head of the Court. <sup><xref rid="fn77">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>They both lived in an unsettled period. The Sadducees were strongly entrenched in the government of Judea and the struggle with them was difficult and protracted. After the death of the High Priest Jochanan, the throne was assumed by his son Aristobulus and shortly after that it was ascended by his widow who married Alexander Jannai. This marked the beginning of a new epoch for the Pharisees. The new king, who is always referred to under the name of Jannai, was too preoccupied with matters of state to devote himself to the religious problems of the country during the first years of his reign. He therefore left these matters to the queen who referred them to her brother Simeon b. Shetach. Simeon could not free the country of the Sadducee leadership all at once and he therefore proceeded gradually. At first he was the only Pharisee in the Synhedrion. He made it a practice to challenge the decisions of the Synhedrion and to demand that such decisions be authenticated by the text of the Torah. Such proof had to be produced in the presence of the king and queen and he utilized these opportunities to point out that the Sadducees did not interpret the Torah correctly. One by one he managed to remove the Sadducees from the Synhedrion and to replace them with Pharisees.</p>
<p>The conflict between the Sadducees and the Pharisees thus reached a breaking point. The majority of the religious decisions which Simeon b. Shetach sponsored were largely a protest against the opinions of the Sadducees whose influence on Jewish life he tried to eradicate.</p>
<p>Alexander Jannai spent most of his time in extensive wars during which the freedom of the country was frequently threatened. When, upon his return from a victorious war, he realized that the Pharisees had gained the upper hand in the religious life of the land, he decided to humble them. During the festival of Succoth, as he was standing near the altar and preparing to pour water upon it (a custom much in favor with the Pharisees) he poured the water on his feet instead. Greatly enraged, the populace threw their ethrogim at the king and called him insulting names. The king evidently expected this reaction of the people for he previously stationed a number of mercenaries outside the temple. When the disturbance began the soldiers were called in and a terrible slaughter ensued. Later the king had eight hundred Pharisees, who escaped from the temple, also executed.</p>
<p>Many prominent Pharisees then fled from Jerusalem. Some of them sought refuge in Egypt where they were welcomed with open arms while others hid in the mountains and caves of Judea. Among those who hid in the country was also Simeon b. Shetach who realized that his sister, the queen, could defend him no longer.</p>
<p>Judah b. Tabbai sought shelter in Egypt. It is related that just as Simeon b. Shetach recalled Joshua b. Perachia during the first years of the reign of Alexander Jannai, he thus similarly recalled Judah b. Tabbai at a later date. In his letter recalling Joshua b. Perachia Simeon wrote: &#x201C;From me, the holy city Jerusalem to you, my sister Alexandria. My master resides within you while I am deserted.&#x201D; When Simeon invited Judah b. Tabbai he wrote: &#x201C;From the great city of Jerusalem to the small Alexandria&#x0021; How long will my bridegroom reside with you while I am sorrowing for him?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Of the manner in which Simeon b. Shetach returned to Jerusalem from his hiding place it is told that once Alexander Jannai entertained foreign guests. When the assembled were merry with food and drink one of them said: &#x201C;We remember that a few years ago you had here an old man who entertained us with his wise maxims. Where is he now? Will you call him here?&#x201D; Jannai looked toward the queen and after he promised her that no harm would befall him, Simeon appeared before the king.</p>
<p>For a short time the persecution of the Pharisees ceased. The king desired to reconcile the people and he sent messengers to inquire of them what he should do to regain their devotion. But the people would not hear of reconciliation and answered that only the death of the king would eradicate the memory of the bloodshed. Some of the Pharisees were not satisfied with this reply and allied themselves with a foreign ruler to oust Alexander Jannai. This still further enraged Jannai against the Pharisees and when he defeated the foreign invader, he had a great number of Pharisees executed.</p>
<p>This last act of revenge stilled the king&#x2019;s anger against the Pharisees and he persecuted them no more. On the contrary, he became convinced that in order to possess the throne securely, a Jewish sovereign could have no subjects more loyal than the Pharisees. On his death bed he admonished the queen to fear neither the Pharisees nor the Sadducees but only to beware of those who pretend to be Pharisees and commit the acts of Zimri while they demand the reward of Pinchas. <sup><xref rid="fn78">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jannai died at the age of 49 after a reign of twenty seven years. Before he died he appointed the queen to rule the country and asked her to keep his death a secret as long as possible. She fulfilled his wish and appointed their son Hyrcanus High Priest. Simeon b. Shetach resumed his post as head of the Synhedrion (or of the court) and directed all his energies to the struggles with the Sadducees whose teachings he was determined to eradicate. He introduced the law of the &#x201C;dissenting elder&#x201D; which prescribed the death sentence for any member of the Synhedrion who opposed a majority in interpreting the law even if the dissenter held to a more severe interpretation or attempted to add to the laws enjoined by the Torah.</p>
<p>Nothing is known of the activities of Judah b. Tabbai during this time. He is mentioned only once as having permitted the execution of a false witness whose testimony would have caused a death sentence to be passed on the defendant if it had been accepted. The Pharisees held that in such a case the false witness should be executd even though the defendant was not put to death. The Sadducees, on the other hand, maintained that as long as the defendant was not put to death the false witness too should not be executed. It was also accepted to pass the same sentence on both witnesses of the prosecution.</p>
<p>When Judah b. Tabbai thus sentenced a single perjured witness to death, Simeon b. Shetach told him that he had caused the blood of an innocent man to be shed because the testimony of two witnesses was required to condemn the defendant. One false witness could under no circumstance cause a death sentence to be passed. Judah b. Tabbai realized his error and thenceforth refused to pass sentence in the absence of Simeon b. Shetach. He frequently visited the grave of the executed witness where he wept bitterly. It was said that whoever heard Judah b. Tabbai weep thought that he heard the weeping of the slain man. <sup><xref rid="fn79">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following maxim of Judah b. Tabbai has come down to us: &#x201C;Do not make yourself as one of the advocates; when the suitors are before you let them be as wrongdoers in your sight and when they have departed let them be as innocent men in your estimation seeing they have accepted the sentence.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Simeon b. Shetach used to say: &#x201C;Examine thoroughly the witnesses and be careful in your words lest through them they may learn to lie.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Judah b. Tabbai was noted for his modesty. To illustrate the harm which success may bring to a person he used to tell the following: If someone would have told me before I attained greatness that I would succeed I would have become his enemy for life. Now that I have attained greatness, were someone to tell me that I will lose it, I would be ready to pour boiling water on him. <sup><xref rid="fn80">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a story related of the sojourn of Judah b. Tabbai in Egypt which is very similar to the one told about Joshua b. Perachia. Praising the generosity of the proprietress of his hostelry, he said to his disciples: Do you remember the proprietress who treated me so generously? To this one of his pupils remarked: Rabbi, she had diseased eyes. Judah b. Tabbai said to him: With one statement you have commited two wrongs. You suspected me of having considered the beauty of that woman and I also see that you carefully looked at her face while I only beheld her good deeds. <sup><xref rid="fn81">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Witchcraft was commonly believed in Palestine at that time and many people fell under the influence of so called witches who undermined their religious beliefs. Although Simeon b. Shetach did not himself place any faith in the power of the &#x201C;witches&#x201D; he nevertheless realized that they were a pernicious influence and lead many to immorality. He therefore had eighty &#x201C;witches&#x201D; captured and hanged on the same day. Ordinarily he would not have permitted so many women to be executed on the same day even though the Bible commands that witches be put to death. But he defended his action on this occasion on the ground that the condition of the country required that this plague which was devouring the people like a contagious disease had to be uprooted. <sup><xref rid="fn82">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among the executed &#x201C;witches&#x201D; there were many whose relatives sought to avenge their deaths. These bribed false witnesses to testify that the son of Simeon b. Shetach committed a crime that was punishable by death. The Synhedrion, after hearing the testimony, condemned the young man to be put to death. But as he was being led to execution, the witnesses confessed their perjury. Simeon wanted to accept their recantation but his son said to him: &#x201C;If you would have the teachings of the Pharisees accepted without question then you must not permit witnesses to repudiate their testimony. You must therefore accept this as my fate to become the means for the attainment of your ends.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn83">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Simeon&#x2019;s son was concerned lest it should become impossible to punish false witnesses if they were given the right to repudiate their previous testimony. Whether Simeon made other attempts to save his son and whether he was successful remains unknown.</p>
<p>Another time, it is told, Simeon saw a man with a knife in his hand pursuing another man into a ruin. Simeon followed him inside where he saw blood upon the knife and the other man wounded and expiring in agony. Simeon addressed the murderer: &#x201C;Wicked man, it is clear who murdered this man, but you are lucky that I can do nothing to you for the Torah says that two witnesses are required to condemn a criminal while I am the only one who witnessed the crime. <sup><xref rid="fn84">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>That the relations between Simeon b. Shetach and king Jannai were never cordial even when they were together is amply illustrated by numerous stories concerning the two men. Once, it is told, a man was killed by a slave of the king. (Probably one of the king&#x2019;s mercenaries.) The Synhedrion informed Jannai of the crime and the king sent his servant to face judgment by the court. But the court demanded that the king appear in person since in the eyes of the law a slave was like any other livestock for which its owner is responsible. When Jannai appeared before the Synhedrion he sat down and Simeon b. Shetach said to him: &#x201C;King Jannai, stand on your feet, not to honor us but in honor of the Creator of the universe.&#x201D; To this Jannai replied: I will stand only if your colleagues will also demand it. But all the members of the Synhedrion remained silent. Simeon turned to his right and he saw them lower their eyes; he turned to his left and he met the same sight. Simeon thereupon said: Let him who can read your thoughts punish you for your thoughts at this moment. <sup><xref rid="fn85">9)</xref></sup> Since that time the law was established that a king could not judge nor could he be judged; he was not to be called as a witness nor was anyone to bear testimony against him. <sup><xref rid="fn86">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the important regulations instituted by Simeon b. Shetach concerned the <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05DB;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D4;&#x05F4;</span> (marriage certificate) of a woman. Until that time women had no right over the property of their husbands. The husband gave to the father of the bride a sum mentioned in the Kethubah. When a man wanted to divorce his wife he said to her: Go and take the money of the Kethubah from your father. Simeon b. Shetach ruled that the husband should retain the sum specified in the Kethubah. In this manner the wife became a partner to all his possessions which served as her guarantee. Indirectly it also made it more difficult to obtain a divorce. <sup><xref rid="fn87">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Simeon b. Shetach also ruled that every father must engage a teacher for his children. Previously it was customary for a parent who wanted his son to acquire knowledge to send him to the academies of the great scholars; otherwise the children grew up in ignorance and came in contact with religious training only on the rare occasions when they visited Jerusalem. <sup><xref rid="fn88">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Simeon b. Shetach lived in poverty most of his life. During the time that he was in hiding to save his life from the wrath of his royal brother-in-law, he could not utilize his scholarship to gain a livelihood. He then became a flax merchant. Once he bought a donkey from an Ishmaelite. When he brought his donkey home, his disciples found a diamond in a little bag tied around the animal&#x2019;s neck. They said to their teacher: God&#x2019;s blessing has made you rich. But Simeon answered: I only bought the animal but not the diamond. When he returned the diamond to the Ishmaelite the latter exclaimed: Praised be the God of Simeon b. Shetach. <sup><xref rid="fn89">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After his death, Alexander Jannai was succeeded by his widow Salome, the sister of Simeon b. Shetach, who ruled for nine years until her death at the age of 73. The date of Simeon&#x2019;s death remains unknown.</p>

<title>Shemaiah and Abtalion</title>
<p>S<small>HEMAIAH AND</small> A<small>BTALION</small> succeeded Judah b. Tabbai and Simeon b. Shetach to leadership in Jewish life. Shemaiah became Nasi of the Sanhedrin and Abtalion occupied the post of head of the court.</p>
<p>Of their descent it is told that they were children or grandchildren of proselytes. But despite the fact that the position of the descendants of proselytes, even to the tenth generation, was not very favorable, they achieved the highest honors which Jews of that time could hope to attain. It is also necessary to remember that Shemaiah and Abtalion lived before the treason of the Idumeans and proselytes were therefore not viewed with suspicion.</p>
<p>We also do not know who chose these two scholars to their positions and whether their election was peacefully accomplished. It is possible that the king of Judea, who surrounded himself with mercenaries to protect himself from his subjects, purposely chose descendants of proselytes to head the Sanhedrin in the hope that they would side with the Sadducees. However, if that was his intention he was mistaken, for although Shemaiah and Abtalion were peaceful people who did not meddle in politics, they faithfully clung to the Pharisees and did not make the least change in the system of interpreting the commandments of the Torah as it was established by the previous scholars.</p>
<p>Shemaiah and Abtalion were influential during one of the unhappiest periods in Jewish history. Before her death, Salome, the widow of Alexander Jannai relinquished the throne to her son Jochanan Hyrcanus who was a peaceful retiring man. Jochanan&#x2019;s brother, Aristobulus, did not approve of the arrangement and started a war against his brother which ended with a compromise. Aristobulus became king and Jochanan Hyrcanus assumed the High Priesthood. This arrangement may have proved to be lasting were it not for a friend of Hyrcanus, Antipater by name, who was a descendant of the forced Idumean converts, who were brought into the Jewish fold by Hyrcanus&#x2019; grandfather. Antipater sought to create discord between the two rulers. He tried to persuade Aristobulus that his brother was planning to regain the throne. But Aristobulus paid no heed to his accusation although there was some justification in it since Hyrcanus was the older of the two brothers and thus the rightful heir to the throne. Failing in this attempt, Antipater told Hyrcanus that Aristobulus wanted to be rid of him in order to unite the throne and the High Priest&#x2019;s office in his person.<xref rid="fn90">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Antipater suggested that it would be easier to carry on a war against his brother from outside the city and advised that Hyrcanus leave Jerusalem. Hyrcanus accepted this advice and together with a host of followers he left the city. Hyrcanus established an alliance with a neighboring Arab king who was told that Aristobulus wished to annex his land and he was. promised considerable compensation for his aid in the forthcoming war against Aristobulus.</p>
<p>Reinforced by the Arab king, Hyrcanus besieged Jerusalem. This siege, however, was against the king only and not against the people and the besiegers decided to permit the daily sacrifice to be offered at the temple. Every day the priests within the city lowered a sum of money from the wall of the city and the besiegers hoisted up the animals required for the sacrifice.</p>
<p>One of the besiegers, a man who spoke Greek, told the soldiers to hoist up pigs instead of the usual animals because it would be impossible to take the city as long as the daily sacrifices were properly conducted. It is unknown where they obtained pigs in Palestine, but this act shocked the whole people who fantastically embellished the consequences of this horrible mockery. It was told that when the pigs stuck their nails (&#x0021;) into the walls of Jerusalem the whole countryside shook for four hundred miles. A tornado accompanied by an earthquake swept the land. Darkness covered the land during midday and in one moment all the grain on the fields surrounding Jerusalem wilted. When it was later necessary to bring the &#x201C;Omer,&#x201D; the first ripened sheaf, there was none found near Jerusalem and it was necessary to bring one from a long distance.</p>
<p>The Sadducees had lost most of their influence by that time and when the inhabitants of the countryside about Jerusalem had to bring the Paschal lamb but could not enter the city, they went to offer this sacrifice in the temple of Onias in Alexandria.</p>
<p>Jerusalem continued to withstand the siege. The besiegers could not take the fortress by storm and the besieged would not surrender. Both contending brothers then appealed to the Roman general Pompey, who happened to be near Palestine, to arbitrate between them. Pompey arrived in Jerusalem with a large army. He removed Aristobulus and executed many of his followers and he appointed Hyrcanus High Priest with the title of Ethnarch, ruler of the land as representative of Rome. To impress upon Hyrcanus still further that he was not an independent ruler, Pompey appointed Antipater as his assistant in the secular government of the land. Antipater thus became virtual ruler of the country and Hyrcanus had to be satisfied with the High Priesthood and the official title of Ethnarch.</p>
<p>After the death of Aristobulus, his two sons Alexander and Antigonos continued the struggle against Hyrcanus to regain the country. They formed an alliance with the Persians and with their aid Antigonos, the younger son of Aristobulus, succeeded in defeating Hyrcanus and he led him as a captive to Babylonia. Antigonos maintained himself in Jerusalem for three years. At the end of that time, Herod, the son of Antipater, appeared with a large Roman army. Antigonos was overthrown as a rebel against the Romans and the throne was occupied by Herod who recalled Hyrcanus to the High Priesthood.</p>
<p>These wars lasted for more than thirty years and caused endless suffering but scholarship and the learning of the Torah did not cease. For a short time the Sanhedrin were divided into five parts according to the division of Palestine under five governors. By means of this division the Romans wanted to weaken the power of the Sanhedrin; but as this attempt failed the Sanhedrin were again reunited in Jerusalem under the leadership of Shemaiah and Abtalion.</p>
<p>There is a legend that Shemaiah and Abtalion were descendants of Sancherib, king of Assyria. They did not interfere with the political affairs of the country and it is possible that as descendants of converts they did not feel very keenly the national humiliation which the Jews had to withstand in their own country. As long as they were permitted to observe the Torah according to the interpretations of the Pharisees and the temple was not disturbed, they interested themselves but little with the political storms which were agitating the land.</p>
<p>Two maxims of Shemaiah and Abtalion have come down to us. These sayings are not entirely clear and require some elucidation. Shemaiah said: Love work and hate mastery and do not mingle with the officials. Abtalion said: Wise men, take heed of your words lest you incur the guilt which is punished by exile and you shall be exiled to a place of evil water and the disciples that come after you will drink and die and the name of Heaven will be profaned.</p>
<p>It is evident that both of the sayings referred to the events of the time. All those who sought to rule met with misfortune and many of the scholars had to seek refuge in Egypt where their disciples absorbed many new ideas which were opposed to those current in Palestine.</p>
<p>Shemaiah and Abtalion sought to limit the number of students in their academy and instituted a fee of admission for some reason which has not been definitely established. Every one had to pay a half-penny to the gate keeper. This sum was considered quite large and at that time a person had to work half a day to earn it.</p>
<p>Since the downfall of Aristobulus, there remained small detachments of his army which roamed in the Galilee and conducted a guerilla warfare against the Syrians and Romans. Herod tracked them down with great cruelty until he finally captured their leader, Hezekiah, and killed him together with some of his men. The populace was enraged against Herod and, with the consent of Hyrcanus, he was summoned to appear for trial before the Sanhedrin. Herod appeared not as a defendant but as a great commander dressed in purple and armed with a sword. He was surrounded by a large number of warriors, all armed, who were ready to attack anyone that should attempt to touch Herod. The Sanhedrin was displeased but out of fear its members maintained silence. Shemaiah warned them not to spare the defendant, for if they showed fear Herod would convict them at some future time. Encouraged by Shemaiah&#x2019;s words they began to question Herod and the witnesses. However, when Hyrcanus saw that the Sanhedrin might convict Herod he suggested postponing the sentence till the following day. On that night Herod fled from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Later, when Herod became virtual ruler of the country, he remembered that the scholars dared to bring him to trial and he persecuted them. Many of them were killed but he spared Shemaiah and Abtalion. He was deeply impressed by Shemaiah&#x2019;s courageous stand at that trial and he also feared to touch the most prominent Elders of the nation. He therefore waited until they died a natural death.</p>
<p>All the wrongs which the Hasmoneans ever committed against their people, their persecution of the Pharisees, their civil wars, their immorality and imitation of the Greek code of morals, all of these were visited upon the Hasmonean family and upon the people during that terrible time when they suffered the yoke of Herod. For Herod the people had no other appelation than the &#x201C;Idumean slave.&#x201D; Secretly the people admitted that they deserved this punishment because they permitted the House of David to be exterminated and allowed the priests to become the rulers.</p>
<p>Shemaiah and Abtalion exhibited their courage on still another occasion. Once, when the High Priest was returning home after the service of the Day of Atonement accompanied by the whole people, he met Shemaiah and Abtalion. The people thereupon left the High Priest to follow Shemaiah and Abtalion. Although he was angered, the High Priest said nothing at the moment. When Shemaiah and Abtalion later came up to greet him he said to them: &#x201C;Let the children of the Gentiles go in peace.&#x201D; This hint at their non-Jewish origin evoked the following response from Shemaiah and Abtalion: &#x201C;Let the children of the Gentiles come in peace, for they do the deeds of Aaron who was a lover of peace, but let the son of Aaron not come in peace, for he does not follow in the ways of Aaron.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn91">1)</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn90">&#x002A;) The names of the princes of the Hasmonean family were constantly repeated. This must be borne in mind when one comes across similar names.</ftnote>

<title>The Men of Bathyra</title>
<p>H<small>EROD, THE SON OF</small> A<small>NTIPATER</small>, who was one of the Idumean proselytes, seized the government of the country. His every move was drowned in Jewish blood and he annihilated all the scholars of that time. He was especially vengeful toward those people who had any relation to the royal Hasmonean family. He spared the two representatives of the Sanhedrin Shemaiah and Abtalion. Because of their advanced age he considered it wise to wait until they died. Not many years passed before both of them died a natural death.</p>
<p>The years in which the two leaders died, and which of them passed away first we do not know. But we do know that for a considerable length of time after their death scholarship was on the decline. The people were preoccupied with the political situation which was desperate and whenever the Talmud refers to those days it hints that it was a period in which the Torah was being forgotten by the people. One virtue characterized the time that those who were ignorant revered those who possessed knowledge. In later years the situation changed to such an extent that people were ashamed of scholarship and the ignorant &#x201C;Am Haaretz&#x201D; was reckoned higher than a scholar.</p>
<p>In the place of Shemaiah and Abtalion there came two men who are unknown but for their city of origin. The Talmud calls them the men of Bathyra. No mention is made of their descent but they probably were not related or they could not both have been members of the Sanhedrin. The city Bathyra, from which they came, was located in north eastern Palestine near Mount Hermon. It was founded as a fortress against the attacks of roving robber bands who wandered near the boundary.</p>
<p>The Torah, as was stated above, was largely forgotten among the people but we may assume that here and there scholars were still to be found outside of Jerusalem. When Herod had to choose new leaders for the Sanhedrin he sought them among the scholars of the outlying districts in the conviction that men of the provinces would be loyal to him and would do his bidding.</p>
<p>The men of Bathyra&#x2014;it must be noted&#x2014;were pious, God fearing and modest and endeavored with all their might to preserve the Jewish faith. They did not deviate from any of the ways of the Pharisees. Only once were they in doubt about the observance of a religious law. It happened that Passover eve fell on a Saturday and they did not know whether the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb superseded the Sabbath and should be offered as on a week day or whether the sacrifice should not be offered at all.</p>
<p>They spent a long time seeking for a solution but they could not find it, neither was there anyone in Jerusalem who could inform them. They were ready to declare that since an ordinary feast day offering does not supersede the Sabbath, neither does the Paschal lamb offering. Then there came a man before them and said that in Jerusalem there lived a man named Hillel of Babylon who studied with Shemaiah and Abtalion and he would certainly know whether the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb supersedes the Sabbath. Hillel was summoned before them and he declared that the offering of the Paschal lamb does supersede the Sabbath. The men of Bathyra did not want to accept his opinion until he assured them that he received this law from Shemaiah and Abtalion. When they heard this they believed him and, being honestly ashamed of their ignorance, they publicly withdrew from their positions and declared that they were not worthy to retain them.</p>
<p>In later years numerous versions of this event developed. The great modesty of the men of Bathyra was frequently recalled and many a man remarked: I could do everything but not what the men of Bathyra did.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Herod continued his bloody rule of the land. In his war against Jerusalem he wiped out all male descendants of the Hasmoneans with the aid of the Romans. Later, attempting to gain the confidence of the people, he married the Hasmonean princess Miriam who was the daughter of Alexander, the son of Aristobulus and the grandson of king Alexander Jannai. On her mother&#x2019;s side Miriam was a grand daughter of king Hyrcanus. All this time, while Herod was becoming firmly entrenched in the country and was annihilating the Hasmonean dynasty, Hyrcanus stayed in Babylonia. The Babylonian Jews promised to defend him loyally all his life. But Herod was dissatisfied with this state of affairs and by various wiles he succeeded in bringing Hyrcanus back to Palestine. Afterward he had Hyrcanus crippled through cutting off one of his ears in order to make him unfit for the priesthood. But even a crippled Hasmonean seemed too dangerous to Herod and he accused him of allying himself with the enemies of the country. He allowed Hyrcanus, who once saved Herod from the Sanhedrin, to be sentenced to death in spite of his great age. Hyrcanus was then 81 years old.</p>
<p>Herod then chose Chanamel as High Priest. It was rumored that Chanamel was a descendant of Onias the son of Simeon the Just and Herod hoped to utilize this man for his political ambitions. But Herod was soon forced by circumstances to appoint as High Priest the only remaining Hasmonean, Aristobulus, the brother of his wife Miriam. He allowed Aristobulus to conduct the service in the temple once and then he invited him to visit Jericho with him. While they were bathing in the Jordan Aristobulus was drowned by one of Herod&#x2019;s servants. Chanamel was reinstated to the high priesthood for a short time.</p>
<p>Herod changed High Priests very frequently as his whim dictated. When some of the ambitious priests realized that the high priesthood was no longer an office to be inherited they outdid one another in the sums that they were ready to pay for the office. The people called these priests by various nick names because the office changed hands nearly every year and frequently the high priest did not maintain himself even for that length of time.</p>
<p>We must keep in mind, however, that no matter how barbarous the behavior of Herod, he never tried to undermine the Jewish religion. Whenever he acted against the laws of the faith he did so because he felt that the religious commandments interfered with his political ambitions.</p>
<p>No one, not even the nearest friends of the king, were certain of their lives. In previous years the Sadducees tried to do away with the Torah and some of the Hasmoneans aided them in this effort. But Herod did not try to interfere with the laws. He did not care whether Judaism developed along the lines laid out by the Pharisees nor would he have minded if the Sadducees had their way. But he annihilated everyone whom he suspected of opposition to himself, and in those days it was an easy matter to accomplish this. One command of Herod was sufficient to lead hundreds of men to execution. He thus did away with the Hasmoneans and later he executed his beloved wife, his mother in law and his own sons. Not in vain was it said in Rome that only a pig is safe in Herod&#x2019;s house, because being a Jew he would not kill it.</p>

<title>Choni the Circle Drawer</title>
<p>C<small>HONI THE CIRCLE DRAWER</small> was one of the saintliest of the Tannaim. Of all his ethical maxims there remains but one which states: if a man does not enjoy the society of his fellows it is as if he were dead. Of his interpretations of the commandments of the Torah none remain, although it is said of him that his penetrating reasoning solved all the doubts of the other scholars.</p>
<p>The name of Choni is surrounded with wonderful legends wherever it is mentioned in the Talmud. His every move was accompanied with miracles and he was described as one to whom God refused no request.</p>
<p>The name Choni was not rare in those days and probably was an abbreviated form of Chonio or Chunia. But the appellation of circle drawer is unique in history and does not appear again in connection with any other name that has come down through the ages. The exact meaning of this appellation (in Hebrew: &#x201C;Hamagel&#x201D;) has not been determined. According to the book of geneology he was called Hamagel because he hailed from a city named Megilo. Others maintain that he received this name because, according to legend, he once slept for seventy years and they interpret Hamagel to mean&#x2014;one who has rested on the way. But the most common explanation is based on the legend that he once drew a circle about himself and took an oath not to stir out of it until God would fulfill his wish.</p>
<p>Once&#x2014;so relates a Mishna in Taanith&#x2014;there was a protracted drought in the country. According to some there had been no rain for three years. It was already the twentieth day of Adar when everyone was expecting the late rains that mature the grain but still there appeared not the smallest cloud. Trees and grass were withered and the people feared the famine that was bound to come. They then came to Choni the circle drawer with a request that he pray to God for rain. Because of Choni&#x2019;s great piety every one felt convinced that his appeal for rain would not be denied by God and a request by him would be considered as a command.</p>
<p>Choni said to the people: Take the Passover ovens into your houses that they may not be moistened by the rain. (Ovens that were moistened were not considered fit for Passover use and Choni felt certain that his prayer for rain would be answered.)</p>
<p>Choni prayed for a long time but still there was no rain. He thereupon drew a circle about himself and said to God: Creator of the world&#x0021; Your children have turned to me that I should pray for rain because they think that I am acceptable in your sight. I swear by your great name that I will not stir from here until you will have mercy on your children.</p>
<p>Small drops of rain began to fall. Choni&#x2019;s disciples then said to him: God has permitted these few drops to fall so that you may not break your oath. Choni addressed God again: Not for these few drops have I prayed. I prayed for a rain that should fill the wells with water. As he finished speaking a heavy rain accompanied by a storm began to descend and every drop of water was large enough to fill a barrel. His disciples again appealed to Choni: God is sending down a rain which will flood the world. Choni again appealed to God: Not for this have I prayed. I prayed for rain that should bring blessing to the fields.</p>
<p>There then began to fall an ordinary rain until all wells were filled and the streets of Jerusalem were flooded. Some of the residents of those streets sought refuge on the temple mountain while others came to Choni with a new request, that just as he prayed for rain and it was granted even so he should now pray for the rain to cease. Choni asked them to see if the wanderer&#x2019;s stone was already covered with water for as long as that stone was not submerged he could not ask that the rain cease. (The wanderer&#x2019;s stone was a place where all lost articles were redeemed by their owners upon identification.)</p>
<p>Later they brought an ox to be sacrificed to God that the rain might cease. Choni placed both hands on the offering and said: &#x201C;Thy people Israel which you have redeemed from Egypt cannot bear too great a bounty even as they cannot bear too much punishment. When you were displeased with them they could not withstand your anger and besought me to intervene with you on their behalf. Now that you have bestowed upon them too much generosity they cannot bear this either. Therefore, Creator of the world, I beg of you to consider the rain that fell so far sufficient and to permit the world to breathe freely again.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Immediately a strong wind arose and dispersed the clouds. The sun shone warm and the people scattered over the fields to gather mushrooms.</p>
<p>This is said to have occurred during the lifetime of Simeon b. Shetach who was greatly angered that Choni almost forced God to change his will in order to please one pious man. Simeon b. Shetach sent a message to Choni saying: &#x201C;If you were not Choni I would have you excommunicated, but I can do nothing to you because you are to God as a petulant child and he fulfills your wishes even as a father fulfills the wishes of his favorite son.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn92">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Josephus relates that Choni was killed in the war between the brothers Hyrcanus and Aristobulus. Hyrcanus was then besieging Jerusalem while Aristobulus fortified himself in the temple on mount Moriah. One day Choni was captured by the soldiers of Hyrcanus and brought to their camp. They then asked him to pray to God to help them defeat Aristobulus. Choni thereupon recited the following prayer: &#x201C;Creator of the world&#x0021; Have mercy on both contending sides, for on one side are your priests and on the other side are your children. I pray that you shall not heed the curses of one on the other.&#x201D; This prayer so enraged the soldiers of Hyrcanus that they killed him.</p>
<p>But the Talmud has woven another legend about the last days of Choni. It was said that Choni grieved because he could not comprehend the meaning of the verse &#x201C;When God returned the captivity of Zion we were as dreamers.&#x201D; He constantly asked: Is it possible for a person to sleep for seventy years and have the same dream?</p>
<p>Once, as he was walking on his way, he saw a man planting a carob tree and asked him: &#x201C;How long does one wait until this tree will bear fruit?&#x201D; The man replied: &#x201C;It takes seventy years.&#x201D; Choni asked him: &#x201C;Are you certain that you will live another seventy years?&#x201D; But the man replied: &#x201C;The whole world is like a carob tree. My forefathers planted for me and I am planting the tree for my children.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Choni sat down to weave baskets and a deep sleep descended upon him. The crag of a mountain extended to cover him and to hide him from the eyes of passers-by. He slept there for seventy years.</p>
<p>When he awoke he saw a man picking the fruit of the tree that was planted when he fell asleep. Choni asked him: &#x201C;Are you the man who planted the tree?&#x201D; The man replied: &#x201C;I am not he. The man who planted the tree was my grandfather.&#x201D; Choni realized that he slept for seventy years and he went to his home to inquire for Choni. There he was told that both Choni as well as his son were no longer living.</p>
<p>He said to the people, &#x201C;I am Choni,&#x201D; but they would not believe him. He therefore went to the academy where he had the scholars repeat his interpretations of the Torah and he heard one of them say, &#x201C;I wish we had a man like Choni today who could elucidate all the hard questions.&#x201D; He said to them, &#x201C;I am Choni,&#x201D; but they would not believe him either, and did not accord him the proper respect. This pained Choni very much and he used to repeat: A man who does not enjoy the society of his fellows is as if he were dead.</p>
<p>According to another Talmudic version, Choni lived during the last days of the first temple and he slept all the years of the Babylonian captivity. He awoke from his sleep when the Jews began to return from Babylonia. Of the Choni who prayed for rain, the Jerusalem Talmud claims that he was the grandson of the first Choni.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem Talmud continues to relate of the Choni who slept for seventy years that when he awoke he asked what was going on in the world and his hearers wondered that he did not know that the temple was destroyed and was being rebuilt again. They would not believe him when he said that he was Choni. But as he kept on repeating this the people said to him: &#x201C;If you are Choni you have to prove it. We heard that when the real Choni entered the Temple the whole house became suffused with light. We want to see you do likewise.&#x201D; Choni entered the temple and immediately a light spread throughout the building. He then said: &#x201C;When God returned the captivity of Zion we were as dreamers.&#x201D;</p>

<chapter>
<title>Hillel</title>
<p>K<small>ING</small> H<small>EROD</small> inaugurated his reign with the slaughter of all the outstanding scholars in the country. He destroyed them, just as he annihilated the Hasmonean dynasty, out of conviction that they would challenge his right to the throne. He knew that the scholars secretly called him the &#x201C;Idumean slave&#x201D; and that because of the fact that he was married to a Hasmonean princess, in order to establish a Herodian-Hasmonean dynasty, they established a rule that whoever pretends to be of Hasmonean descent is a slave.</p>
<p>But since Herod could not under any circumstances abolish the Torah, he had to recognize the religious authority of the Sanhedrin. His first attempt was to appoint the men of Bathyra to head the Sanhedrin but these voluntarily resigned in favor of Hillel of Babylonia. Herod was thus forced by circumstances to recognize the significance of Hillel and to tolerate his control of the religious life even as he previously was forced to spare the aged Shemaiah and Abtalion.</p>
<p>The appelation Babylonian clearly indicates that Hillel was born in Babylonia; in order to differentiate him from other scholars who were named Hillel he was also called Hillel the Old.</p>
<p>When Hillel came to Palestine he was in his late thirties and already possessed much knowledge. He came to the country in order to clarify for himself three religious questions of which he was in doubt. These were: 1) Whether a man who underwent purification had to be declared pure by a priest or whether the procedure of purification was sufficient. 2) The disagreement between two texts of the Bible one of which says that the Paschal offering is to be made from sheep and cattle and the other states that the offering is to be selected from the sheep and the goats. 3) The contradiction between two texts one of which enjoins that Matzoth be eaten for six days and the other that they should be eaten for seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn93">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He sought clarification on these questions from Shemaiah and Abtalion and was ready to return to Babylonia, where he lived in favorable circumstances. He had one brother who was a merchant and his other relatives undoubtedly also aided him. But his great desire for learning delayed his return and as time went by it still seemed to him that he did not know enough. He thus became estranged from his native country where Jews lived in peace and he was not frightened by the discord and political revolutions which agitated Palestine.</p>
<p>The Babylonian Jews of that time were pious and God fearing people who observed all the regulations of Judaism in so far as that could be done outside of Palestine. They were especially strict in their observance of the Sabbath to its minutest details and they sent their &#x201C;Shkolim&#x201D; and sacrifices to Jerusalem. But there was a lack of colleges for the study of the Torah and the Babylonian Jews were therefore held in contempt by the Palestinian Jews for their ignorance. In addition both Babylonian and Palestinian Jews believed that only in Palestine could the religious regulations be correctly interpreted and any regulation which did not have the sanction of the Great Court of Jerusalem was not accepted by the people.</p>
<p>While studying with Shemaiah and Abtalion, Hillel lived in straitened circumstances and earned his livelihood from hard labor. Altogether he earned but a small coin a day, half of which he spent for himself and his household and the other half he gave to the gate keeper of the academy. But one day he did not earn any money. Neither he nor his family ate on that day but, being anxious to hear the discourse of Shemaiah and Abtalion and not having the money to pay the gate keeper, Hillel climbed onto the roof of the academy and lay near the chimney where he could hear the discussion inside. All night he thus lay on the roof. This was in the month of Tebeth in midwinter and all that night it snowed and the snow covered his whole body to a great height.</p>
<p>On the following morning the academy seemed darker than usual. The sky light was covered with snow, but when the people looked closer they saw the body of a man under the snow. They immediately went up and removed the snow and recognized the man as Hillel. They washed him and annointed his body with oil and warmed him before the fire. Although such work is prohibited on the Sabbath the scholars declared that a man like Hillel deserved that the Sabbath be desecrated for his sake.<sup><xref rid="fn94">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>All this time Hillel did not reveal his great knowledge. Besides Shemaiah and Abtalion no one knew him intimately, neither did he confide in anyone whether he and his household were in need.</p>
<p>After the death of Shemaiah and Abtalion he apparently returned to Babylonia but he frequently visited Jerusalem whenever any doubt arose in his mind. Mostly he came before the feast days in observance of the commandment to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but he always kept in the background. Once, on the eve of Passover, which occurred on a Saturday, the men of Bathyra, who were the religious authorities, were in doubt whether the Paschal lamb offering should supersede the Sabbath or whether it should not be offered at all because of it. One of their pupils rose and said to them: &#x201C;There is present a man from Babylonia who studied under Shemaiah and Abtalion; he will certainly know the law.&#x201D; But the men of Bathyra nodded their heads as if to say: &#x201C;What can one learn from a Babylonian?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Nevertheless they summoned Hillel and asked him what should be done. Hillel said: &#x201C;Are you concerned about the Paschal lamb only when there are many other sacrifices offered on the Sabbath?&#x201D; He expounded the rules of the Torah all day to prove that the Paschal lamb offering supersedes the Sabbath. Still they would not listen to him until he said that he received the law from Shemaiah and Abtalion.</p>
<p>They then asked him: &#x201C;What should be done if the people do not bring the slaughtering knives? For even if the offering of the sacrifice supersedes the Sabbath it still remains prohibited to carry any object on that day.&#x201D; Hillel then replied: &#x201C;I do not remember what Shemaiah and Abtalion taught in this matter but I am certain that the people will know the law, for whenever there is any doubt what to do one should observe the custom of the people and decide the law accordingly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On the following day, Passover eve, it happened just as Hillel predicted. The people brought their sacrifices and had the slaughtering knives hidden in the wool of the lambs and among the horns of the goats. When Hillel saw this he remembered that Shemaiah and Abtalion instructed that it should be done so.<sup><xref rid="fn95">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hillel was the first of the authors of the Mishnah who insisted that the object of religion is to enforce the fulfillment of the duties of one man toward another and that all practical commandments are but a means to this end. He therefore established the principle of brotherly love as the main condition for all the commandments of the Torah. Once, when a Gentile wanted to adopt Judaism on one condition, that he be taught the whole Torah in the time that he could stand on one foot, Hillel gave him but one rule: Do not unto thy neighbor what you would not have him do unto you. This is the whole Jewish law, he said. All else are but commentaries on their commandment which you will know when you study them.<sup><xref rid="fn96">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hillel was very gentle in his relations with other people and suffered their capricious behavior without anger. He particularly insisted on showing friendship to the poor. Not only did he provide them with necessities but also with such luxuries as they were previously unused to. Once he provided a poor man with a horse and a slave to run before him, as was the custom. However, when he could not obtain a slave, he ran before the man himself for three miles.<sup><xref rid="fn97">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hillel&#x2019;s modesty and unusual patience gained wide renown and many interesting stories were told of futile attempts to make him angry. After the person who wanted to learn the whole Jewish law while standing on one foot, there appeared before Hillel a heathen who was ready to embrace Judaism on condition that he be made high priest. Hillel answered both of them satisfactorily and converted them.</p>
<p>Probably the most interesting story concerns a man who wagered a large sum of money on angering Hillel. The man ran before Hillel&#x2019;s house on a Friday, just as the time that Hillel was bathing in preparation for the Sabbath. In a loud voice he shouted: &#x201C;Hillel, who is Hillel and where is he?&#x201D; Hillel wrapped himself in a cloak and came out saying: &#x201C;I am Hillel. What do you want, my son?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to ask you a question,&#x201D; the man said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ask,&#x201D; Hillel replied, &#x201C;and whatever I know I will tell you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to know,&#x201D; the man said, &#x201C;why the Babylonians have round heads.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You asked a correct question,&#x201D; Hillel answered. &#x201C;It is because the Babylonians do not have skilled midwives; the heads of the newborn children become rounded in their hands.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A moment later the man shouted again: &#x201C;Hillel, where is Hillel?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Again Hillel came out and said: &#x201C;I am Hillel. What do you want, my son?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Can you tell me,&#x201D; the man asked, &#x201C;why the eyes of the people of Tadmor are weak?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You have asked well,&#x201D; Hillel said; &#x201C;it is because Tadmor is located in a sandy region and dust gets into people&#x2019;s eyes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Once more the man shouted: &#x201C;Hillel, where is Hillel?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hillel wrapped himself and came out saying: &#x201C;Here I am, what do you want, my son?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to know,&#x201D; the man said, &#x201C;why the feet of the Africans are so wide.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is a good question,&#x201D; Hillel said, &#x201C;it is a result of their going barefoot in swampy land.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thereupon the man said: &#x201C;I wish to ask you other questions but I fear that you will be angry.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You may ask as many questions as you want and I shall answer them to the best of my knowledge,&#x201D; Hillel said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Are you Hillel, who is a Nasi among Jews?&#x201D; the man exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am he,&#x201D; Hillel replied.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then I wish the Jews that there should be no more like you among them,&#x201D; the man said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why do you wish them this?&#x201D; Hillel asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Because through you I have lost a large sum of money. I wagered that I will make you angry and now I do not know what to do to anger you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>To this Hillel replied, &#x201C;Even if you were to lose twice that sum, still you could not anger me.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn98">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hillel served as Nasi from 30 B.C. to 10 C.E. In the prevailing political situation of the country it was significant that Hillel was a descendant of king David. (His mother was descended from Shefatia, the son of David.) The people considered him a scion of the royal house of David and accorded him appropriate honors. While everyone looked upon Herod as a tyrant whose only aim was to collect taxes for the foreign rulers and to protect the boundaries of the land, they revered Hillel as a religious leader and obeyed his every word. It was then that the benediction of the House of David, ending with the words, &#x201C;He raises a ray of hope,&#x201D; was introduced into the daily prayers (Shmoneh Esrei) and it is possible that the people looked upon Hillel&#x2019;s exalted position as a beginning of the restoraion of the House of David. This was also the cause for the introduction of still another benediction, to be recited on Saturday after the reading of the prophets, which began with the words: &#x201C;Gladden us, oh Lord, with the prophet Elijah, your servant, and with the kingdom of David your anointed&#x201D; and ended with: &#x201C;On his throne a stranger shall not sit nor shall others inherit his honor.&#x201D;</p>
<p>From Hillel were descended three generations of N&#x2019;siim who governed religious life for one hundred years. For the outside world Herod and his successors were the sovereigns of the country but the internal life of the nation, which concentrated about the faith, was guided by Hillel&#x2019;s heirs.</p>
<p>Herod no doubt knew of the honor which was being accorded to Hillel and that he was looked upon as a successor of David, But in his political sagacity he realized that Hillel would constitute a real danger only if he claimed to be a descendant of the Hasmoneans.</p>
<p>In later generations Hillel&#x2019;s importance was compared to that of Ezra. It was said that Ezra renewed the Torah after it was forgotten by the people and similarly Hillel came out of Babylonia and taught the Torah which was neglected after the death of Shemaiah and Abtalion.</p>
<p>The Talmud relates: Eighty of the most important men of the generation were pupils of Hillel. Thirty of these were worthy enough to have the &#x201C;Shechinah&#x201D; rest upon them even as it rested upon Moses. Another thirty were deserving to have the sun stop in its course for their sake even as it did for Joshua b. Nun. The remaining twenty were intermediate men and among them were such as Jonathan b. Uziel of whom it was said that his enthusiasm in studying the Torah was so great that were a bird to fly by him when he was expounding the law it would have been burnt by the flames of his enthusiasm.<sup><xref rid="fn99">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aside from his humility and patience Hillel was also noted for being satisfied with his lot and he was in the habit of saying: &#x201C;Blessed be God for this day.&#x201D; He was never worried over what the following day might bring and taught the members of his household to feel likewise. Once, as he was approaching his house, he heard shouts coming from that direction and he said to his disciples who were accompanying him to his home: &#x201C;I am certain that these quarrel-some shouts do not come from my home.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn100">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his moral teachings he frequently used picturesque language and employed short epigrammatic maxims. It is therefore difficult at times to know his exact meaning, since these maxims can be interpreted in various ways. But this does not diminish their moral worth since, no matter how one interprets them, they still express elevated moral teachings which are an honor for the whole people which could produce a personality like Hillel in such difficult times as then prevailed.</p>
<p>One of his maxims stated: &#x201C;Wherever my heart loves, there my feet lead me; if you will come to me then will I also come to you, but if you do not come to me neither can I come to you.&#x201D; This maxim has been interpreted in many ways and many people found in it that which they sought.</p>
<p>Nearly every day, as he left his pupils, he was in the habit of saying that he was going to entertain a guest. Once they asked him: &#x201C;Do you have a guest at home every day?&#x201D; and he replied: &#x201C;Our soul is only a guest with us; today it is here and tomorrow it may leave us.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn101">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But when Hillel spoke of entertaining a guest, he did not have in mind only food and drink, although he never underestimated these and said that it is a great virtue to preserve God&#x2019;s image in man in the same purity as it was created. But he particularly insisted that man is obliged to perfect his spiritual self, for if a man does not do so himself no one will do it for him. To this he added that one man for himself counts for little and he must also have the assistance of others, and he stressed the importance of the present moment in one&#x2019;s life, for if not now, when?</p>
<p>Hillel firmly believed that there was no unjust suffering and even when it seemed that divine justice was wrong one must bear in mind that all one&#x2019;s deeds are reckoned and that one receives his punishment at the hands of another sinful creature. Once he saw a head floating upon the water. It was a time of many murders; Herod frequently allowed many people to be executed and had their bodies thrown into the water. Hillel believed that if those people had not deserved it, God would not have permitted their being killed but, at the same time, he was convinced that the murderers would also meet their punishment. He therefore addressed the floating head: &#x201C;You drowned others and therefore you were drowned; but in the end your assassins will also be drowned.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn102">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hillel placed learning in the very center of the scheme of life and he said that whoever refuses to study deserves to be condemned to death. Also, he insisted that one must not say &#x201C;I will study when I will have time, for it is possible that one will never find the time. Study, he maintained, also leads to fear of God and he who is ignorant cannot be pious. But a person who devotes himself to learning in order to gain a great name for himself is certain to lose his name.</p>
<p>With all the power at his command Hillel strove to popularize the Torah. He said: &#x201C;When others gather, you must spread; but when others spread, you must gather.&#x201D; Seeing that the people did not understand him he explained his words in this manner: &#x201C;When you see a generation which loves the Torah then you must spread your knowledge among them; but if you see a generation which does not love the Torah then you must hide your knowledge within yourself.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn103">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his exposition of the law Hillel was tolerant toward his opponents. This was contrary to the custom of the scholars of that generation who did not tolerate any divergence of opinion and sharply reacted to differing interpretations. Hillel expressed his opinions peacefully and when he tried to prove the truth of his statements he did so in a calm manner. He said that man must love peace and search for it. When one attains the state of love for his fellow man he brings other people closer to the Torah.</p>
<p>Although Hillel was devoted to the traditions of the &#x201C;oral law,&#x201D; he did not attack those who doubted them. He never drove the doubters from himself, as others did, but merely sought to convince them that it was impossible to observe the written law without recognizing the validity of the oral law. Once a heathen came to him saying that he wanted to embrace Judaism on condition that he learn the written law only. Hillel accepted him and then he showed him that it was impossible to study anything without accepting the opinions of one&#x2019;s teacher. The proselyte understood that since he had to believe Hillel he also had to accept Hillel&#x2019;s belief that the written law cannot be explained without the aid of the oral law.</p>
<p>The scholars preceding Hillel opposed the Sadducees violently but achieved little. Even Simeon b. Shetach, who opposed the Sadducees with the force of the government, could not prevail against them. But Hillel&#x2019;s method of peaceful argumentation served its purpose. He said of them: &#x201C;There were many sinners among the Jews who were brought close to the study of the Torah and in time they became pious and just men.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So far as we know, Hillel was the first of the Tanaim to establish a system of expounding the laws of the Torah that was based on rules of logic or &#x201C;measures according to which the Torah was expounded,&#x201D; as they were called in the Talmud. There were seven rules defined by Hillel.</p>
<p>We may assume that Hillel did not invent these seven rules (or measures) without a definite foundation. These rules were employed before him. But when Hillel analyzed the method of interpreting the texts of the Torah that was employed by his predecessors, he discovered that the interpretations and expositions of the previous scholars followed a definite system of logical rules.</p>
<p>Hillel established seven rules but his successors increased the number of these rules. Rabbi Ishmael defined thirteen; Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Jose Hagalili identified as many as thirty-two rules.</p>
<p>Hillel&#x2019;s seven rules of logic for interpreting the Torah are as follows: 1) <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05DC; &#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;</span> &#x2014; argument from minor to major and vice versa. 2) <span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D6;&#x05E8;&#x05D4; &#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05D4;</span> &#x2014; argument by analogy. 3) <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D0;&#x05D1;</span> &#x2014; a standard passage serving as a basis for interpretation. 4) <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05DC;&#x05DC; &#x05D5;&#xFB44;&#x05E8;&#x05D8;</span> &#x2014; general and particular limitation of the general by the particular and vice versa. 5) <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05E0;&#x05D9; &#x05DB;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> &#x2014; standard from two passages &#x2014; a decision involving two laws having a common characteristic is applied to other laws having the same characteristics. 6) <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05E6;&#x05D0; &#x05D1;&#x05D5; &#x05DE;&#x05DE;&#x05E7;&#x05D5;&#x05DD; &#x05D0;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;</span> &#x2014; like that in another place &#x2014; explanation of one passage according to another of similar content. 7) <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D1;&#x05E8; &#x05D4;&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D3; &#x05DE;&#x05E2;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;</span> &#x2014; definition from context.<xref rid="fn104">&#x002A;</xref>)</p>
<p>Hillel employed these rules of logic for the first time in his argumentation with the men of Bathyra. Later these rules continued to be used by other scholars in the same manner.</p>
<p>Hillel&#x2019;s first rule &#x2014; Kal vachomer &#x2014; argument from minor to major and vice versa&#x2014;implies that the accepted interpretation of a law of minor importance may be applied to a law of major importance when the latter is in doubt: This rule is generally applied in order to establish a more severe interpretation of a doubtful law. Sometimes, however, it may also be used to limit the restrictions of a doubtful commandment.</p>
<p>According to our scholars there exist ten examples of in the case of Joseph&#x2019;s brothers when they were accused of stealing the beaker from Joseph&#x2019;s house. They said: &#x201C;The silver which we found in our sacks we returned to you from the land of Canaan and how shall we steal from the house of your lord silver or gold.&#x201D; Their reasoning implied that if they took the greater trouble to return silver from the distant land of Canaan they would not stoop to steal. A statement of Moses serves as a second example of a &#x201C;Kal vachomer.&#x201D; Moses said: &#x201C;Even when I am with you today you disobey God, what will you do after my death?&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Hillel stood before the men of Bathyra discussing whether the offering of the Paschal lamb supersedes the Sabbath he argued as follows: &#x201C;If the daily sacrifice, the non-offering of which is not punishable by death, supersedes the Sabbath; the Paschal lamb, the non-offering of which is punishable by death, certainly supersedes the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Hillel&#x2019;s second rule&#x2014;argument by analogy&#x2014;employs the comparison of the text of one law to the text of another in order to apply the interpretation of the first to the latter. But the Talmud states that a person may use this rule only to substantiate an interpretation but not to abolish one.</p>
<p>An example of argument by analogy occurs when the Talmud tries to establish that the commandment &#x201C;an eye for an eye&#x201D; is not to be taken literally although the biblical text states &#x201C;If one shall cripple his neighbor, as he did so shall be done to him.&#x201D; The Talmud argues that in another case involving a man whose ox gored his neighbor&#x2019;s ox the Bible enjoins that the man shall &#x201C;pay an ox for an ox.&#x201D; From this the Talmud deduces that &#x201C;an eye for an eye&#x201D; also implies that monetary compensation shall be given to the victim.<sup><xref rid="fn105">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Jerusalem Talmud indicates how broadly the &#x201C;argument by analogy&#x201D; may be employed by stating: &#x201C;Whenever the text of the law is not clear that law may be substantiated from other texts.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hillel also employed this rule in his argumentation before the men of Bathyra. He said: &#x201C;The commandment to offer the daily sacrifice employs the word <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;</span> (in its appointed time), so does the commandment to offer the Paschal lamb. Since the daily sacrifice supersedes the Sabbath we must conclude that the Paschal lamb offering does so as well.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The rule <span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D6;&#x05E8;&#x05D4; &#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05D4;</span> could also be called the rule of comparison and the Talmud does say that it is possible to &#x201C;compare and to derive an argument by analogy.&#x201D; But the rule of comparison later became differentiated from argument by analogy.</p>
<p>The Gzerah Shavah was derived from the Torah which compares differing instances in order to cast light from one on the other. Thus in the case of the rape of an engaged girl which took place outside of the city the girl is not to be punished for it because it is assumed that she called for help but no one came to her assistance and the case is compared to that of a person being murdered.</p>
<p>The third rule of Hillel &#x2014; <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D0;&#x05D1;</span> &#x2014; concerns a subject whose text is expressed in a general manner, and from this text decisions are deduced concerning other subjects which are not mentioned in the Torah.</p>
<p>The name <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D0;&#x05D1;</span> means &#x201C;paternal structure&#x201D; because the expounder is like a father and the pupils are like children. This appellation also indicates that his rule is like a building in which one large stone is supported by numerous smaller ones.</p>
<p>Whenever we find subjects in the Torah, which are similar to one another in content or in some other characteristic which is clearly defined in one instance but is not definite in the other cases, we interpret all doubtful texts according to the clearly established one and we compare this one to a father whose influence extends over a wide range of texts and binds them into a family unit.</p>
<p>The fourth rule &#x2014; <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05DC;&#x05DC; &#x05D5;&#xFB44;&#x05E8;&#x05D8;</span> &#x2014; involves a general law whose specialized interpretations explain the doubtful phases of its generality.</p>
<p>We already mentioned that one of the causes of Hillel&#x2019;s coming to Palestine was his desire to ascertain whether a man who underwent purification required the statement of a priest to establish that fact or whether the purification procedure was sufficient in itself. Hillel came to the conclusion that since in the case of the cure of a &#x201C;Nethek&#x201D; the Bible states &#x201C;he is clean,&#x201D; which is a generalization, which statement is later followed by the words &#x201C;the priest shall purify him,&#x201D; which is a specification, it is impossible to understand the generalization without the specification. The specific therefore comes to elucidate the general that the man is not clean until he is declared so by the priest.</p>
<p>The fifth rule is <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05E0;&#x05D9; &#x05DB;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>.	This concerns two contradictory texts such as those affecting the offering of the Paschal lamb. One of them states &#x201C;and you shall slaughter the Pesach to your God, sheep and cattle&#x201D; while another text says &#x201C;from the sheep and from the goats you shall take it.&#x201D; Hillel therefore did not know what animal should be offered for the Passover sacrifice until he elucidated this matter by the aid of a third text which states &#x201C;take for yourself sheep for your families and slaughter the Pesach.&#x201D; He explained it to mean sheep for the special Passover sacrifice, and sheep and cattle for the general feast day offering.</p>
<p>Similar to the above was Hillel&#x2019;s explanation of another set of contradictory texts about which he was at first confused and came to Palestine to seek elucidation. One text which says &#x201C;six days you shall eat Matzoth&#x201D; is contradicted by another stating &#x201C;seven days you shall eat Matzoth.&#x201D; He interpreted it to mean that one must eat Matzoth made out of the new grain (garnered after the Omer) for six days and on the seventh day one should eat Matzoth made out of old grain.</p>
<p>The sixth rule &#x2014; <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05E6;&#x05D0; &#x05D1;&#x05D5; &#x05DE;&#x05DE;&#x05E7;&#x05D5;&#x05DD; &#x05D0;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;</span> &#x2014; involves the explanation of a word in the text of one law by another law which may be entirely unrelated.</p>
<p>The seventh rule &#x2014; <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D1;&#x05E8; &#x05D4;&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D3; &#x05DE;&#x05E2;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;</span> &#x2014; governs the interpretation of a doubtful part of one subject from the text of the same subject.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Shammai, Hillel's Colleague</title>
<p>A<small>FTER</small> H<small>ILLEL BECAME</small> N<small>ASI</small>, a man named Menachem was chosen to head the court. Very little is known about Menachem but the Talmud relates that he, together with eighty &#x201C;pairs&#x201D; of his disciples, left the temple after they received gifts from the king and, donning royal atire, they entered the king&#x2019;s service.<sup><xref rid="fn106">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>What impelled Menachem to take this step is also a mystery. Some scholars hold that he was forced to do so against his own will. Josephus tells that Menachem at first belonged to the Essenes and, when Herod was still young, he predicted that he would become king. When this prediction came true Herod remembered him and treated him graciously.</p>
<p>If this account is true, then it is possible that Herod persuaded Menachem that his life and career will be safer if he leaves the temple and engages in royal srvice. Menachem was convinced and he was succeeded by Shammai. It is also unknown how long Menachem collaborated with Hillel; but this relationship must have been of short duration since he left no impression and no words of his are mentioned anywhere.</p>
<p>The Talmud characterized Shammai as an angry man in contradistinction to Hillel who was noted for his modesty and patience.</p>
<p>Every non-Jew who wanted to embrace Judaism on certain conditions, and whom Hillel did convert, first visited Shammai. But Shammai was angered with them because of the conditions which they imposed, and in one case the dispute developed into a physical struggle. But this tendency to anger on the part of Shammai must not be interpreted as a sign of an evil nature, for whenever he realized that his opponent was right he gladly conceded it. Shammai once had a dispute with Jonathan b. Uziel, a disciple of Hillel, who did not spare Shammai in the course of the debate. When Shammai became convinced of the justice of Jonathan&#x2019;s arguments, he conceded his defeat and only complained of the insults which his opponent heaped upon him.</p>
<p>The best indication of Shammai&#x2019;s character is contained in his advice that every man should be received in a friendly manner. But some historians interpret this as an attempt to rid others of that weakness from which he could not rid himself.</p>
<p>Shammai studied under Shemaiah and Abtalion together with Hillel. But it appears that he headed an academy soon after the death of Shemaiah and Abtalion and before Hillel started an academy of his own. Whenever the two academies (the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel) are mentioned in the Talmud, the &#x201C;House of Shammai&#x201D; is usually listed first,</p>
<p>Shammai was very extreme in his piety. He held the Sabbath to be the most important day of the week in anticipation of which every Jew must prepare even as one would prepare for the reception of a prince. Beginning on Sunday, he would therefore search for the best things and reserve them for the Sabbath. He never permitted good food to be served at his table on a week day unless he had better food prepared for the Sabbath.</p>
<p>It was accepted at that time that children should not fast on the Day of Atonement. It was customary for fathers to wash one hand on that day in order to offer food for their children. But Shammai refused to do this because of the prohibition against washing on the Day of Atonement and permitted his small child to fast. When other scholars realized that the child&#x2019;s life was in danger they forced Shammai to feed the child with both hands. It also happened that Shammai&#x2019;s daughter-in-law gave birth to a son on Succoth. Shammai thereupon removed the roof of the house and covered the balcony overhanging the mother&#x2019;s bed with green branches so that the new-born son may not be outside of a succah.</p>
<p>It is apparent from Shammai&#x2019;s behavior that he was careful to observe all the minutae of the commandments. It is also evident that he did not interfere with the political situation in the country and devoted himself solely to the interpretation of the laws in which he was seldom in agreement with Hillel. Hillel sought broader vistas in his exposition while Shammai clung to the literal meaning of the text even in those cases where logic indicated that it should be interpreted otherwise. Hillel sought the causes underlying the laws and critically analyzed previous interpretations before he arrived at his own conclusions.</p>
<p>In time these differences between the disciples of Hillel and Shammai increased and it seemed as if there were two Torahs instead of one, for the claims of one school were invariably contradicted by the other. This opposition reached such a state that on one occasion all the people were prohibited from leaving the academy on pain of death until a decision would be made whether Hillel or Shammai was the correct exponent of the law. &#x201C;This day,&#x201D; the Talmud states &#x201C;was as difficult as the day on which the golden calf was made.&#x201D; The Talmud makes no mention of the results of that day but on another occasion it relates that after many years of dispute a &#x201C;voice&#x201D; announced that both contending sides are correct but the law is according to the teaching of Hillel. It is told that one of the later Tanaim (Rabbi Tarphon) repeated the Shema in the manner that Shammai prescribed and soon after that he was beset by robbers. The scholars thereupon told him that he deserved to be in that danger because he deviated from the law of Hillel.</p>
<p>Most of the differences of opinion between the two schools centered about the laws pertaining to sacrifices, tithes and the rules of purity. Some sharp clashes also arose in problems of marriage which one school permitted and the other school prohibited. It might have been expected that differences of opinion on this subject would lead to accusations of illegitimate birth. But this was not the case since both schools were tolerant toward each other and their disciples intermarried freely.</p>
<p>But in spite of the strictness of Shammai he nevertheless had the interests of the people at heart. Whenever he realized that it was impossible to enforce a certain stricture he overlooked it and advised waiting for a more favorable time to introduce it.</p>
<p>The laws pertaining to the Sabbatical year were frequently ignored at that time. While no one sowed his fields on that year, in accord with the literal meaning of the Torah, many people nevertheless permitted themselves to plow their fields in anticipation of next year&#x2019;s planting because the law does not explicitly prohibit plowing. This procedure was similar to that of preparing food on a holy day for consumption on a week day and many people expected Shammai to prohibit it. But Shammai said: &#x201C;If the times were to permit it I would decree against the sowing of fields which were plowed on the Sabbatical year.&#x201D;</p>
<p>From these words of Shammai it is evident that the reason why he refrained from issuing such a decree was the fact that Herod did not allow interference with the farmers because of the income which he derived from them. Were it in his power, Herod would have abolished the Sabbatical year but he feared to tamper with a law that was commanded by the Torah. He limited himself to forcing the scholars to issue such decrees regarding the cultivation of fields on the Sabbatical year as would least interfere with the work.</p>
<p>One of the main differences between Hillel and Shammai involved the question of &#x201C;Semichah,&#x201D; the placing of hands on a sacrifice. The Torah commands a man &#x201C;to rest his hand&#x201D; on the sacrifice which he offers, and this was interpreted to indicate that the penitent must participate in the slaughtering of the sacrifice. Since such a procedure involves a considerable effort a dispute arose as to whether one has to do so on feast days and on the Sabbath. One school absolved the penitent from this procedure while the other maintained that without it the sacrifice was not valid.</p>
<p>Shammai and Hillel founded two schools of interpreting the Torah according to which they decided all religious problems. While basing themselves on the same texts and on the same traditions which they inherited from Shemaiah and Abtalion they nevertheless arrived at contradictory conclusions in nearly every case.</p>
<p>Up to the time of Hillel and Shammai all disputes carried a party character. The opposing sides&#x2014;the Sadducees and the Pharisees&#x2014;held differing points of view and everyone could readily understand the origin of the disputes. With Hillel and Shammai the disputes assumed an inner party nature. This was a new phenomenon since both of them belonged to the Pharisees in whose ranks peace prevailed until that time. Only in the matter of &#x201C;Semichah&#x201D; was there any difference of opinion; complete unity was the rule in all other questions. It is therefore surprising that the disputes between Hillel and Shammai developed in intensity until the abyss between them became ever greater and more ominous.</p>
<p>Hillel, as was related previously, had eighty disciples. Thirty of these were deserving to have the &#x201C;Schechinah&#x201D; rest upon them even as it rested on Moses. Thirty deserved to have the sun stop in its course for their sake just as it did for Joshua. Twenty were intermediate men. The least of Hillel&#x2019;s disciples was Rabbi Jochanan b. Zakkai of whom it was said that &#x201C;he was familiar with all the nooks of the Torah, the Mishna, the Gemara, the Halachot and Agadot and the minutest interpretations of the Torah and of the Soferim. He understood all the mysteries of &#x201C;Gematrio&#x201D; (numerical evaluation), the language of the angels and of the evil spirits, the language of the palm trees as well as many fables of apes and foxes.&#x201D; When the Talmud lists the praises of the disciples of Hillel it is with the intention of showing what a learned man the greatest of them must have been if the least of them, Rabbi Jochanan b. Zakkai, was so well versed.</p>
<p>The names of two of Shammai&#x2019;s outstanding disciples have come down through history, and of them it is told that in spite of their training in the school of Shammai they believed that all laws should be observed according to Hillel&#x2019;s interpretation. One of these was Rabbi Jochanan of Hauran and the other was Baba b. Buta.</p>
<p>Baba b. Buta was blinded by Herod during the latter&#x2019;s extermination of the sages. Later Herod repented and asked Baba b. Buta, what he could do to atone for his misdeed. Baba b. Buta is described as being a pious man who daily offered a sacrifice to atone for any possible sin that he may have committed.</p>
<p>In connection with the name of Baba b. Buta a story is told of a man from Babylon who settled in Jerusalem and married there. But the language of the Jews of Babylon was different from that of the Jews of Palestine, despite the fact that they all spoke an Aramaic dialect, and the wife of this man could therefore not understand what he was saying. Once he commanded her to bring him &#x201C;two butsinis&#x201D;, when he meant to ask for two water melons, and she brought two candles instead. (The word <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E6;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05F4;</span> meant water melons in Babylonian and candles in the Palestinian dialects.) Angered at her misunderstanding, the man commanded his wife to &#x201C;go break them on the doorstep.&#x201D; <xref rid="fn107">&#x002A;)</xref> This was a customary remark in Babylonia, when one was brought something he did not want. The woman believed she was told to break the candles on Baba&#x2019;s head and did so. (&#x201C;Resha d&#x2019;baba&#x201D; means the head of the door and also the head of Baba.) Baba was not angered and merely asked her why she did that. The woman told him that she was commanded to do so by her husband, whereupon Baba said to her: &#x201C;Because you obeyed the will of your husband God will give you two sons who will be like Baba b. Buta.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The differences of opinion between the &#x201C;House of Shammai&#x201D; and the &#x201C;House of Hillel&#x201D; lasted until the destruction of the temple. After its destruction the name of the &#x201C;House of Shammai&#x201D; practically disappeared. According to the Talmud <sup><xref rid="fn108">2)</xref></sup> this dispute continued till the days of Rabbi Gamaliel of Jabneh who was five generations removed from Hillel. He convoked all the scholars of his time to Jabneh and there they decided by vote whether the opinions of the school of Shammai or those of the school of Hillel should be enforced. The debate lasted three years until a &#x201C;Bath-kol&#x201D; (a divine voice) announced, that the opinions of both schools are from God but that the law is according to Hillel.</p>
<p>The disciples of the school of Hillel endeavored to lighten the burden of the law in imitation of the ways of Hillel who was the personification of modesty and kindliness. In many instances they sought to find better ways for man to follow. It was customary at that time to dance before the bride during the wedding and to praise her virtues in order that the bridegroom may appreciate her qualities. Hillel insisted that a bride should be praised for her beauty even when she was not beautiful in the same manner that one praises an article which another bought even when one realizes that it was not a good buy.</p>
<p>The school of Hillel paid particular attention to the moral and spiritual consequences of every law. The law of that time said that a girl who was married before she was of age could not reject her husband after she became of age. But the school of Hillel maintained that if the girl was an orphan and was married off by her mother or brother, she could reject the husband that was chosen for her before she was old enough to choose for herself.</p>
<p>Similarly in the matter of &#x201C;Yibum,&#x201D; in the case of a man who dies childless, the man&#x2019;s brother has to marry the widow. If he refuses to do so he has to grant her &#x201C;chalitzah.&#x201D; In such a case the widow had no choice. The school of Hillel tried to modify this law to allow for cases where the widow refuses to marry her deceased husband&#x2019;s brother. They ruled that if the woman claims to have taken a vow during her husband&#x2019;s lifetime never to have any dealings with her husband&#x2019;s brother, then the court must force him to release her from his claim although legally her argument remains that he refuses to marry her. If the widow took such a vow after her husband&#x2019;s death, then the court should request the brother of the dead man to forego his right and to grant &#x201C;chalitzah&#x201D; to the woman.</p>
<p>The school of Hillel modified the law permitting divorce in a similar fashion. The school of Shammai allowed the granting of a divorce only on the grounds of the wife&#x2019;s infidelity. Any other complaint of the husband about the physical or spiritual unfitness of the wife was considered insufficient ground for divorce. The school of Shammai held the bond of matrimony to be sanctified by divine powers and no human agency could release it except by express command of the Torah. But the school of Hillel maintained that the morals of society and the happiness of humanity would be improved if man were allowed to divorce his wife for any undesirable traits which he may find in her.</p>
<p>The school of Shammai never deviated from the literal meaning of the text of a commandment while the school of Hillel always studied the possible intentions of the text first and only later did they issue their edict according to reason and for the betterment of humanity. For these reasons the school of Shammai always decreed the law in its severest interpretation while the school of Hillel tended to lighten the burden whenever possible.</p>
<p>The political situation of the Jews of Palestine was a very difficult one. The country was in constant turmoil due to the foreign and civil wars. But the greatest calamity occurred when the country lost its independence and became a Roman province under the rule of a governor who could dictate the material as well as the spiritual life of the country. There then developed a party of patriots which openly or secretly opposed Rome. This party inscribed in its program that God is the sole ruler of the Jews and they said: &#x201C;Woe to the nation which chooses a man to rule over it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Historians claim that this party consisted primarily of the followers of the school of Shammai. The followers of Hillel were also dissatisfied with the political situation but they did not believe in revolutionary propaganda and they attacked the enemy by means of laws against those people who aided the Romans in collecting taxes from the Jews. They held that it is difficult for &#x201C;Gabaim&#x201D; (treasurers) and &#x201C;Mochesim&#x201D; (tax collectors) to repent their sins because they are like robbers and it was forbidden to receive from them any contribution for charitable purposes. Despite all this, the followers of Hillel accepted their fate realizing that there was no force which could avail against Rome.</p>
<p>The attitude of the followers of Shammai was entirely different. These openly opposed the Romans. At a gathering held in the house of Chananiah b. Ezekiah eighteen political questions were debated and the opinions of the followers of Shammai prevailed. But these decisions were not written down and in later years it became impossible to determine what they were.</p>
<p>We must bear in mind that the followers of Shammai were revolutionaries and this meeting probably took place during the days of Agrippa the first when the patriots were preparing for a struggle with Rome. Fearing that the Romans may attack this meeting they arranged it so that it should be possible to claim, in case of attack, that it was not a political meeting but merely a gathering to discuss religious questions.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Akabia ben Mahalalel</title>
<p>N<small>UMEROUS INDICATIONS</small> in the Talmud suggest that during the life time of Hillel and Shammai there lived other spiritual leaders who followed an individual method in interpreting the Torah and who did not identify themselves with either of the above. Some of these are mentioned by name on a number of unimportant occasions. Others did not even attain this recognition.</p>
<p>Akabia ben Mahalalel was one of the scholars who developed an individual method of exposition. We possess but vague knowledge of his life and activities. One report states that he was excommunicated without naming the sin for which he was thus punished. But this report is immediately contradicted and it is said that whoever invented such a slanderous rumor about a saintly man such as Akabia was, deserves severe punishment.<sup><xref rid="fn109">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Considering all references to Akabia ben Mahalalel in the Talmud one must conclude that he was an unusual man who was gifted by nature with great perseverance. The nation was then engaged in a great struggle to preserve its independence against outside enemies and was rent by an internal conflict over the observance of the Torah. In such a time Akabia ben Mahalalel succeeded in remaining above the inner and outer struggles and in maintaining his neutrality toward the contending sides.</p>
<p>So far as we know, Akabia ben Mahalalel did not hold any official position. In religious questions he contributed his opinion on only four subjects which are of such rare occurrence that a century may pass before such problems present themselves again. Since his point of view differed from that of the other scholars and he expressed his opinions with a certain disrespect for the leaders of a previous generation he was therefore excommunicated.</p>
<p>The original source of the four laws on which Akabia ben Mahalalel held dissenting views we find in the above mentioned Mishna. One dealt with special cases of leprosy, the other law concerned a woman who has an issue of blood, the third dealt with the wool shed by a clean first-born animal that was crippled, and the fourth concerned a woman suspected of infidelity who was a proselyte or a freed woman.</p>
<p>The first two laws come under the category of legislation pertaining to cleanliness and impurity and their interpretation involves medical considerations. We will, however, devote a few words to the third and fourth laws.</p>
<p>The first born of a clean animal had to be sacrificed in Jerusalem according to the prescribed custom for minor holy offerings (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D3;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05DD; &#x05E7;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>).	As long as such animal lived, one was not allowed to put it to work nor to shear its wool. In case such an animal became crippled it had to be slaughtered and given to a priest. As stated above, it was prohibited to shear the wool of such a first born animal, nor could the wool be utilized after it was slaughtered. But Akabia ruled that the priest was entitled to the use of that wool which the animal shed while it was still alive, while the other scholars disagreed with him.</p>
<p>The fourth law about which Akabia held a dissenting opinion concerned a &#x201C;Sotah&#x201D;. (Sotah is a woman who is suspected by her husband of infidelity.) The prescribed procedure in such a case was for the husband to bring the wife together with an offering of barley meal to the priest. The priest took a clay vessel filled with pure water and placed in it some earth from the temple; he then wrote the verses of the Torah pertaining to a Sotah on a paper and read them to the woman after which he washed the ink from the paper with the water which he gave to the woman to drink. If the water caused the woman no harm it was held as proof that she was innocent.</p>
<p>Akabia held that this procedure need not be applied to a Sotah who was a proselyte or a freed servant. In attempting to dissuade him, the scholars cited the case of Shemaiah and Abtalion who gave the water to a Sotah who was a freed servant. Akabia retorted that &#x201C;they gave it to one like themselves.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The exact meaning of the words of Akabia is not clear. (The Hebrew word &#x201C;dugma&#x201D; means similar.) They are interpreted to indicate that Akabia was of the opinion that Shemaiah and Abtalion did not give the woman the prescribed water to drink nor did they write the prescribed passage. They merely attempted to influence her psychologically in order to obtain the truth. But some scholars thought these words to be a slurring reference to the origin of Shemaiah and Abtalion and they placed him under the ban. When Akabia died the people stoned his casket.<xref rid="fn110">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>But the statement of one, Rabbi Jehudah, elsewhere referred to as Rabbi Jehudah of Bathyra, is immediately quoted to the effect that one must not believe that a just man like Akabia could have been put under the ban, nor could he have slandered the names of Shemaiah and Abtalion in the case of the freed servant. Whoever assumes that Akabia was excommunicated is deserving of punishment. Rabbi Jehudah maintains that the matter of the excommunication crept in through an error and involved another person named Elazar ben Chanoch who was put under the ban because he ignored the commandment of &#x201C;washing hands&#x201D; in the belief that this commandment was not implied in the Torah.</p>
<p>The respect in which Akabia was held by the Jews can be seen from the fact that he was offered the position of the head of the Court if he would recall his decisions in the matter of the four above mentioned laws. But Akabia answered: &#x201C;I would rather be called a fool all the days of my life than be wicked in the eyes of God for one hour or that people should point at me and say that I betrayed my convictions in order to obtain an office.&#x201D;</p>
<p>These four laws concerned subjects so rare that a court may have had no occasion to pass on them throughout its existence. We also find that later scholars held the same opinions as Akabia held.</p>
<p>We must also bear in mind that immorality was very widespread in the Judea of that day and the whole procedure of trial of a woman suspected of infidelity was done away with. The Biblical text, &#x201C;the woman shall be a curse within her people,&#x201D; was interpreted to apply only in case the people lead moral lives.<sup><xref rid="fn111">2)</xref></sup> There is therefore some doubt whether Akabia passed on these questions or whether his decisions caused any serious opposition.</p>
<p>Before Akabia died he instructed his son not to observe these four laws according to his interpretation.</p>
<p>His son asked him: &#x201C;Why then did you not recall your decisions?&#x201D; Akabia answered: &#x201C;I have heard them adopted by a majority and my opponents heard their views adopted by a majority. For this reason I clung to the law as I heard it and they observed it as they received it. But you heard the decisions from me, who am but one, and from my opponents who are many. It is therefore better that you give up the opinions of the individual and abide by the opinions of the majority.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On this occasion Akabia&#x2019;s son also asked his father to instruct his colleagues that they should treat him better, but Akabia answered that he would not speak to them about this matter. His son then asked him: &#x201C;Have you found any evil in me?&#x201D; The father answered: &#x201C;I have seen no evil in you but I believe that intercession will not help you. Your own deeds will make you beloved among people and your own deeds will make them stay away from you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The editor of the Mishna in &#x201C;Pirke Aboth&#x201D; cites the following maxim in the name of Akabia ben Mahalalel: &#x201C;Keep in view three things and you will not come to sin.&#x201D; Expounders interpreted these to be that a man should refrain from pride and sinful desires. Akabia stated further, &#x201C;Know whence you came, whither you go and before whom you have to give strict account. Consider how you came into the world, remember that you are bound for a place of dust and worms and that you will have to give account before the king of kings, the Holy one blest be He.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In a somewhat different form we find this passage quoted in &#x201C;Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan&#x201D;: &#x201C;Akabia ben Mahalalel said: &#x2018;He who ponders the following four subjects will sin no more. Think of whence you come, whither you are going, what will become of you, and who will be your judge. Whence you come? From a place of darkness. Whither you are going? To a place of darkness. What will become of you? Dust and worms. Who will be your judge? The king of kings, the Holy one blest be He.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>Some people claim that the request to Akabia to recall his four opinions did not refer to the above described decisions concerning cleanliness and impurity, the wool of a first born crippled animal and a Sotah who was a proselyte but rather to those four maxims which he held that a man must take to heart in order to be saved from sin. These teachings placed Akabia in the category of one who spreads ideas that are dangerous for the world. By having people think constantly of death and of the sufferings in their grave, their desire to live is undermined.</p>
<p>It was then that he was called upon to revoke the four maxims which deprive people of the desire to live and he would be appointed head of the court. However, it is difficult to explain how it could happen that a man who was under the ban for following an original system of interpreting the law should be considered a desirable candidate to head the Court.</p>
<p>But this explanation is not based in fact, for it seems evident that Akabia was excommunicated, despite the denial of Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra. In the Talmud we find a passage of a later date which seriously poses the question why Akabia was not executed, as was the law regarding a &#x201C;dissenting elder,&#x201D; if he really ridiculed Shemaiah and Abtalion. The answer given to this question was that Akabia&#x2019;s words regarding a Sotah who was also a freed woman had only a theoretical implication and were not meant to be taken as a law to be practiced.<sup><xref rid="fn112">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The time of Akabia&#x2019;s life has not been definitely established. It is certain that he lived after the death of Shammai in whose stead he was to be appointed as head of the court. When Akabia refused this office, it was thenceforth abolished.</p>

<ftnote id="fn110">&#x002A;) This story of the Sotah who was a freed woman is also related in Berachoth, 19.

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Gamliel the Elder</title>
<p>H<small>ILLEL WAS SUCCEEDED AS</small> N<small>ASI</small> of the Sanhedrin by his son Simeon. The office of Nasi assumed added importance after the office of &#x201C;Head of the Court&#x201D; was abolished and the Nasi became the sole ruler in all religious questions.</p>
<p>But it seems that Simeon did not live very long. He is only mentioned in the Talmud as Hillel&#x2019;s successor and no teaching of his has been recorded. When Simeon died his son Gamliel was elected Nasi. Gamliel came to be known as Rabban Gamliel the Elder and he was the first one to be titled &#x201C;Rabban.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The title &#x201C;Elder&#x201D; was conferred upon Gamliel because he was the first scholar of that name. The title Rabban (our teacher) was conferred on him because he was the only Head of the Sanhedrin. At that time there was introduced the custom of &#x201C;Smichat Z&#x2019;kenim,&#x201D; ordination of the elders, during which the Nasi or his representative ordained one of the disciples by placing his hand on his head. This procedure conferred upon the disciple the title Rabbi and the right to judge in all disputes except those involving life and death which were then the prerogative of the Roman government.</p>
<p>Most of the time that Rabban Gamliel served as Nasi was unfavorable for the Jews, only one short period of improvement intervened. These were the last years preceding the destruction of the temple and the country was in a state of constant crisis. Officially the land was a province of the Roman empire and was ruled by the iron hand of a Roman governor. Even the slightest disobedience to the governor&#x2019;s will was punishable by death.</p>
<p>In those days Christianity began to spread in the country. The Apostle Paul (Saul of Tarsus) claims to have been a disciple of Rabban Gamliel. If this claim is justified, then the trial of Jesus must have taken place during those years.</p>
<p>During that time too the Sanhedrin left the stone chamber in the temple and moved to &#x201C;Chanuth,&#x201D; a place in Jerusalem outside of the temple. The cause of this transfer of the Sanhedrin probably lay in the realization that the political situation of the country was rapidly approaching a crisis. If the temple could not withstand the enemy, it was aimed to save the Sanhedrin at least.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time the throne of Rome was ascended by the mad Ceasar Caligula who demanded that all the nations of the empire accord him divine worship. He also commanded the Jews of Palestine to place his image in the temple.</p>
<p>This command was received on the eve of the festival of Succoth when Jews from the whole country were gathered in Jerusalem for the festivities. Their joy immediately turned to mourning and every one felt certain that the royal decree would not be fulfilled for the whole nation would rise against the attempt to desecrate their sanctuary. Under the prevailing political situation it was obvious that such a rebellion against the emperor&#x2019;s command would cost the lives of tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>One of the scholars then present in Jerusalem addressed the people and said: &#x201C;Let not the festivities of this day be disturbed. God in Heaven will save us from Caligula&#x2019;s decree even as he delivered us from other such decrees in the past.&#x201D;</p>
<p>His prediction came true and before this decree was executed Caligula was slain. With the death of the emperor this decree was abolished. Another political factor was influential in this case although its influence was exerted secretly.</p>
<p>The Jewish prince Agrippa, the son of the executed prince Aristobulus who was the son of Miriam the Hasmonean, was educated in Rome where he was very friendly with Caligula. He once exclaimed that he wished emperor Tiberius was dead so that Caligula could ascend the throne. When this remark was reported to Tiberius he had Agrippa put in prison. A short time later Tiberius died and Caligula freed Agrippa from his imprisonment. In spite of the intrigues of his sister, who was also a grandchild of Miriam the Hasmonean, Agrippa was made ruler over several districts of the old Jewish kingdom. In addition to this Caligula offered to fulfill any wish of Agrippa which lay in his power. Agrippa asked that the decree to have an image of the emperor installed in the temple be revoked. Although Caligula was displeased by this request, he agreed to postpone the execution of his decree; meantime he was assassinated.</p>
<p>After Caligula&#x2019;s death, Agrippa utilized his influence with the Roman senate to have Claudius named emperor and Claudius showed his gratitude by naming Agrippa king over the whole land of Judea. Agrippa ruled for seven years which marked a bright period in the life of the Jews of Palestine.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to his predecessors, Agrippa strove to observe all the laws of the Torah in the same manner as they were observed by the common people without requesting any royal privileges. But despite this there were many who were dissatisfied with the king. The behavior of previous kings was fresh in the memory of the people and many Jews felt that it would be better if there were no king.</p>
<p>One of the scholars said to the king that he was not worthy to cross the threshold of the temple because he built a &#x201C;theater&#x201D; in Cesarea according to Roman custom. Agrippa did not punish the man but had him taken to a performance in Cesarea to convince him that the performances were not against the Jewish faith. Another time the king was accused of not being a full blooded Jew, since his grandfather (Herod) was an Idumean convert, and also of not being raised in the Jewish faith.</p>
<p>Once when king Agrippa was standing on the platform in the temple during the festival of Succoth and was reading the king&#x2019;s portion of the Torah (Deut. 17) he reached the verse &#x201C;you shall not make a stranger who is not your brother king over you.&#x201D; He then remembered the accusation that was levelled against him that he was not a pure Jew and he began to weep. The scholars felt a great pity for their weeping king and they said to him: &#x201C;Fear not king Agrippa, you are our brother.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn113">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>King Agrippa was very much attached to Rabban Gamliel. He obeyed his advice in all religious matters and Rabban Gamliel was his guest on all festive occasions.</p>
<p>Many of the king&#x2019;s regulations aimed to make peace between the Jews and non-Jews. The Roman administration attracted many non-Jews to Palestine and these considered themselves privileged citizens because they enjoyed the direct protection of Rome. The Jews, on the other hand, believed themselves to be the more privileged because of their being natives of the land. Agrippa endeavored to establish friendly relations between the two and in this Rabban Gamliel aided him. It was then that they permitted the non-Jewish poor to come to glean the fields together with the Jewish poor, and they ruled that it was obligatory to give charity to Gentile and Jewish poor alike. Similar rites were prescribed for the dead of both peoples. <sup><xref rid="fn114">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Agrippa reigned for seven years. In spite of his attempt to gain the favor of Rome he secretly sympathized with all those who dreamed of freedom from the Roman yoke. During the last days of his life he tried to ascertain the number of men that the Jews could raise into an army. He convoked all the Jews of the country to Jerusalem for a census. The census was made by means of the Paschal offerings which they brought. The High Priest hid a part of every offering and the number was found to be six hundred thousand. This was proof that there were six hundred thousand families in Palestine aside from those who could not come to Jerusalem because they were impure or because of the distance. Since every family consisted of an average of ten people it was accounted that the Jewish population of the country numbered over six million people.<sup><xref rid="fn115">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At that time king Agrippa went to Caesarea to witness a theater performance and while in the theater he began to suffer great pain. He was immediately removed to his palace where he soon died at the age of fifty-four years.</p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel died soon after. With his death, the scholars said, there departed the glory of the Torah and all justice and purity passed away.</p>
<p>Of the innovations of Rabban Gamliel there were some of great importance for his time. He introduced a new procedure in taking testimony regarding the beginning of a new month. When it was necessary to hear such testimony on a Sabbath, the witnesses were kept in a place called &#x201C;Beth Yazek&#x201D; and they were not permitted to leave the place all day because of the Biblical prohibition that &#x201C;no man shall leave his place.&#x201D; Rabban Gamliel amended this law to permit one to walk two thousand ells in every direction from the point at which one found himself. He permitted a similar liberty for midwives on their way to women in labor, in case of fire, attack by a foreign army and flood.<sup><xref rid="fn116">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Up to that time two witnesses were required to testify to the death of a man before the widow was permitted to remarry. But as the cases of violent death increased as a result of executions by the Romans as well as through murder on the highways Rabban Gamliel ruled that just as only one witness was required to validate a marriage even so only the testimony of one witness to the death of a man should be sufficient to permit the widow to remarry.<sup><xref rid="fn117">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aside from these innovations Rabban Gamliel introduced other rules pertaining to divorces and other important occasions in the lives of the people. In all of these regulations he aimed to lighten the burden of the laws. Only in those laws which pertained to cleanliness was he more severe than his predecessors. He also introduced various customs which placed the Nasi in a privileged position as compared to that of the common people.<sup><xref rid="fn118">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel was a person of delicate health. He was not strong enough to stand during his studies, as was then customary, and he permitted sitting down during study for teacher as well as for pupils.<sup><xref rid="fn119">7)</xref></sup> Although he was rich, he commanded his followers that he be buried in a plain linen shroud; this was contrary to the custom of the rich of that time. Since that time the custom of luxurious burial for important people was given up.<sup><xref rid="fn120">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following saying of Rabban Gamliel characterizes his opinion of his disciples: &#x201C;There are as many types of disciples as there are varieties of fish; there are unclean fish, clean fish, fish from the Jordan and fish from the great sea. A disciple who comes from poor parents and who, although he has studied Torah, Mishnah, Halacha and Hagada, has no native intelligence is like an unclean fish. A disciple who comes from wealthy parents, has studied Torah, Mishna, Halacha and Hagada, and also has native intelligence is like a clean fish. One who has studied Torah and Mishna and can also expound Halacha and Hagada but is not intelligent enough to solve problems that are put before him is like a fish from the Jordan. Like a fish from the great sea is a disciple who has studied Torah and Mishna and can also expound Halacha and Hagada and can solve all problems put up to him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>From Rabban Gamliel we discover for the first time why the Sanhedrin declared some years to contain thirteen months. In a letter which he sent to the Jews of Palestine and the neighboring countries he said: &#x201C;The time of Pesach is drawing nigh but there is no sign of spring and we will not have lambs for the Passover offering nor young pigeons to be sacrificed by women who have given birth nor will there be new barley for the offering of the sheaf.<sup><xref rid="fn121">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It also seems certain that the great academy of Jerusalem was transferred to Jabneh during the time of Rabban Gamliel. In Jabneh it remained for many years after the destruction of the temple with the permission of the Roman government.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel</title>
<p>W<small>ITH THE DEATH OF</small> K<small>ING</small> A<small>GRIPPA</small> the political situation in Palestine took a turn for the worse. The Roman governors oppressed the people until life became unbearable. Meantime Rabban Gamliel the Elder died and he was succeeded by his son Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel who found himself in a very difficult position throughout his stay in the office of Nasi. He would have liked to continue the tradition of his forefather Hillel as a seeker after peace but it became impossible to witness the barbarities of the Roman rulers and to maintain one&#x2019;s peace and even less so to attempt to pacify the people.</p>
<p>The party of the zealots grew from day to day and a life and death struggle against the Romans developed. The Nasi could no longer maintain a position of a neutral bystander. The political situation demanded that he declare himself in sympathy with one or the other of the contending sides. At first Simeon came out against the zealots and their bloody struggle but realizing later the justice of their cause he joined the patriots and personally participated in many of their warlike endeavors.</p>
<p>Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel became Nasi seventeen or eighteen years before the destruction of the temple. The great gathering of scholars which took place in the home of Hanania ben Hezekia, which was mentioned before, took place in his time. Fearing that the Romans would attack the gathering they prepared a number of religious questions which had to be clarified in order to be able to say that this was not a political meeting but only a religious disputation.</p>
<p>In his religious conduct Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel observed his family tradition of making the laws of the Torah as easy to observe as possible. He evinced a certain tolerance toward the Sadducees who, since the days of Simeon ben Shetach, were looked upon as non-Jews by the Pharisees. He also believed that the religious burden imposed upon the people should not be greater than that which they were willing to accept.</p>
<p>Had Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel lived in another period his spiritual development might have followed a different line. Raised in luxury and reverence he was certain to have become an enthusiast of beauty and it is hard to evaluate how much of the &#x201C;beauty of Japheth&#x201D; he might have introduced into the &#x201C;tents of Shem.&#x201D; Thus it is told that he once saw a beautiful Gentile woman and, although it was the accepted custom among Jews not to express admiration for the beauty of a gentile woman he could not restrain his wonder and exclaimed: &#x201C;God, how wonderful is your creation.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn122">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He sometimes performed gymnastic feats which no one could imitate. During the &#x201C;Simchat Beth Hashoeva,&#x201D; the festive ceremony of the pouring of water, he threw into the air and cought again eight burning torches without their touching one another in the air or in his hands. When he bowed during prayer he elaned on two fingers and kissed the ground and rose again without any assistance.</p>
<p>A characteristic expression of his beliefs we find in Pirke Aboth where he says: &#x201C;All my days I have spent among the scholars and I have not found anything better than silence and not study is the chief thing but action and whoever speaks much causes sin.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn123">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>To gain a better understanding of his words we must bear in mind that among the Jews outside of Palestine, as in Alexandria, the opinion was current that the study of the Torah had only a theoretical value since it deals with the theories and not with the practical observance of the laws. But it is probable that he aimed to make the people understand that the struggle against the Romans must be carried on in a more practical manner, less discussion and more actual struggle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the struggle against Rome became more intense. The Romans brought blood and fire into the land and the Jews adopted the same means. The peace loving elements of the population were annihilated. Some were killed by the Romans and others lost their lives at the hands of the patriots. There also occurred bloody clashes with the non-Jews living in the country and the Idumeans, who largely gave up the Jewish faith which they embraced five generations earlier, and joined forces with the enemy. The Samaritans (Kuthim) also evinced their violent hatred of the Jews.</p>
<p>The one time converts and friends of the Jews sought to benefit from the Roman-Jewish struggle and their attempts still further increased Jewish suffering. The struggle was bitter and each of these enemies sought the total annihilation of the Jewish people to which the latter responded in kind.</p>
<p>The wealthier Jews sided with the Romans. They had no occasion to feel the slavery, and the anger of the governors but seldom descended upon them. The Roman administration treated them gently and granted them numerous privileges as collectors of the taxes to induce them to get the maximum out of the impoverished population. But these wealthy elements had no understanding for the privileges of their class. Many of them devoted themselves to the study of the Torah, observed all the laws and honestly contributed their tithes. But they were characterized by a love for money which led to violent mutual hatreds among them.<sup><xref rid="fn124">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Sanhedrin lost most of its authority. Since it lost the power to pass sentence in matters affecting life and death. The people had no fear of it and felt free to disregard its commands. Immorality and excesses became prevalent even in Jerusalem. People from low social strata were elevated to high positions and previous notables lost their influence. The wealthy spent their money on excess food and drink and immoral practices saying: &#x201C;Why save for the morrow? Man should afford himself all possible pleasures, for if he will not spend his wealth the Romans will take it away from him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Robber bands spread throughout the land and it meant certain death to travel the highways without military escort. In these bands there were both Jews and non-Jews and they attacked travelers irrespective of their nationality. Only armed caravans and large Roman detachments could offer them any resistance.</p>
<p>There also came into being an organized band of people who employed small daggers which they conveniently hid under their robes. This band called itself Sicarii. They mingled among the people of Jerusalem and listened to the conversations and whenever one expressed an opinion favorable to the Romans, he would be stabbed while the assailant easily made his escape.</p>
<p>The most difficult task was to preserve peace during the Passover. Jews came to the city from all over the country to celebrate the feast day and among the pilgrims there also came many of the thieves and robbers. The crowds congregated in the streets in an attempt to see and to be seen. The Roman governor of the city was empowered to maintain order and he stationed soldiers about the temple. On one occasion one of the soldiers committed a nuisance against the wall of the temple and the enraged crowd fell upon him and killed him. When the other soldiers attempted to save him the crowd attacked them and the governor had to call the whole army to subdue the disorders. The narrow streets of Jerusalem, which were crowded with one and a half million pilgrims, became a field of slaughter in which about ten thousand Jews lost their lives in one day.</p>
<p>On another occasion Jews attacked the slaves of the governor while those carried gold and food for the soldiers; they killed the slaves and robbed them of all their possessions. The governor thereupon ordered the destruction of all villages about Jerusalem. This command was carried out and everyone whom the soldiers met on their way was killed. During one of these clashes a Roman soldier seized a scroll of the Torah and trampled it in the dust after which he burnt it exclaiming that he trampled and burnt the Jewish God. For this act he paid with his life to the enraged mob but as a result of it hundreds of other Jews lost their lives.</p>
<p>The Samaritans also rose against the Jews. Their temple on mount Gerizim had been destroyed a long time before and the majority of them observed Judaism very scrupulously. But the age-old hatred against the Jews continued to burn within them. When the people of Galilee wanted to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem they had to pass through the Samaritan villages. On their way they were attacked and slaughtered. This act was followed by a reprisal on the part of the inhabitants of Jerusalem who killed every Samaritan they could find and burned their villages. Then the Roman governor stepped in to punish the avengers and he executed several thousand Jews.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Claudius died and was succeeded by Nero. He granted some powers to the Jewish prince Agrippa, the son of the benevolent Agrippa who lived in the time of Rabban Gamliel the Elder. But the rule of Agrippa II was limited to part of the Galilee including the city of Tiberias and to twenty-four villages on the eastern bank of the Jordan. Agrippa had the power to appoint the High Priest as he chose and he utilized this right extensively. The office of the high priesthood could be bought for money and whenever a new candidate offered more for the position he was immediately appointed and the previous high priest was deposed. Money was the only consideration and the candidate for the office did not even have to be a descendant of Aaron.</p>
<p>Only one High Priest of that time is mentioned by name, Ishmael ben Phabi, but even he was not held in esteem. The broad masses of the people had no reverence for any high priest of that time, and of Ishmael ben Phabi it was told that he cruelly oppressed the people through his servants.</p>
<p>The people commonly believed that the high priests employed magic to rid themselves of one another. A poet of that time composed a verse with a list of the injustices which the people had to suffer from their high priests. It reads: &#x201C;Woe is me from the house of Boetus and woe from their course; woe is me from the house of Kathros and woe from their pen; woe is me from the house of Ishmael and woe from their fist. All of them are high priests, their sons are tax collectors, their sons in law are overseers of the temple, and their slaves beat the people with rods.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn125">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel came to the conclusion that the struggle against the Romans was justified and that as Nasi of the Sanhedrin he had to stand in the forefront of the revolt, he sharply condemned the activities of Josephus (Joseph ben Gurion Hacohen) who was entrusted with the leadership of the revolt in Galilee. From the first moment Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel believed that Josephus was not a capable military leader and he also suspected that Josephus would surrender to the Romans on the first occasion. Josephus himself relates of this distrust but says nothing against his opponent.</p>
<p>It is entirely reasonable to suppose that a man such as Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel was, did not die a natural death during a revolutionary period and many are of the opinion that he was killed. But some historians claim that he was not killed by the Romans but that he fell at the hand of the &#x201C;patriots&#x201D; who doubted his devotion to the revolutionary cause. &#x201C;Megilat Taanith&#x201D; only mentions the day of his death, 25th day of Sivan, and that he was killed together with rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, High Priest.</p>

<title>Rabbi Chanina, Deputy of the High Priest, and His Contemporaries</title>
<p>D<small>ESPITE THE FACT THAT</small> J<small>UDEA WAS CONVULSED</small> by the last agonies of political death throughout the fifty years preceding the destruction of the temple and in spite of the brutal yoke of the Roman empire which did not allow the Jews to breathe freely, the study of the Torah nevertheless did not decrease during these years of crisis. Outside the enemy spread terror and thousands of patriots gave up their lives in the attempt to destroy him, but within their homes the people devoted themselves to study and ignored the dangers which beset them.</p>
<p>The Romans did not yet realize then how the study of the Torah might influence and encourage the patriotism of the nation. It therefore did not occur to them to hinder the pursuit of learning. Only after the destruction of the temple did it dawn upon them that the Jews find strength and consolation in the Torah. Before the destruction, the Roman political leaders were convinced that the temple was the only stimulus to Jewish rebellion and the same belief was held by the Jewish sympathizers of Rome. The Roman empire therefore concentrated all its efforts against the temple and not against learning.</p>
<p>Aside from the Nasi and his followers there were tens of other scholars who delved into the Torah and they exerted a great influence on the life of the people. Among the most important of these scholars was Rabbi Chanina, deputy of the High Priest.</p>
<p>A &#x201C;deputy of the priests&#x201D; was a person whose duty it was to stand beside the High Priest during the service on the Day of Atonement. Deputies were appointed for a long period of time and they maintained their office even while High Priests were being changed. There were usually several deputies at the same time but only one of them prepared to act as Assistant to the High Priest. If for any reason something happened to the High Priest, which prevented him from continuing the service, the deputy stood ready to take his place. But so long as the High Priest could perform his duty, the deputy merely stood beside him and was not allowed to do any of his work.<sup><xref rid="fn126">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The title &#x201C;Sgan&#x201D; (deputy) is the equivalent of overseer. The deputies were assistants of the High Priest and overseers and superintendents of the temple who were ready to help the High Priest whenever necessary.</p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina (sometimes referred to as Chananiah) was one of the outstanding scholars during the last days of the second temple. When the patriotic movement at first became active, Chanina identified himself with the peaceful elements of the nation who openly condemned the patriots. He then said that people should pray for the welfare of the government, for were it not for the fear of government people would swallow each other alive.<sup><xref rid="fn127">2)</xref></sup> On another occasion he highly praised peace and compared it in importance to the work of creation.<sup><xref rid="fn128">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But later, when the conduct of the Romans became more murderous, Chanina joined the party of the patriots together with the Nasi, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. He then openly criticized the wealthy Jews who abandoned the rule of God for the rule of man, for &#x201C;whosoever considers the words of the Torah is absolved from the fear of the sword, from hunger, from evil desires and from the rule of man as the Torah says: &#x2018;Because you have not served God joyfully and wholeheartedly when you had enough of everything you will have to serve the enemies, which God will send upon you, in hunger and in thirst, naked and abandoned by everyone.&#x2019; Such a man will want to eat a piece of barley bread and he will not find it but at the same time he will have to give his enemy good bread and fat meats; he will thirst for a drop of vinegar or beer and will not find it but his enemies will demand the best of wines and he will have to supply it to them; he will want to wear a cloak of wool or flax and will have none but his enemies will demand from him the best of silks and he will have to give it to them. Thus he will remain forsaken by all without a candle, without a knife and a table and even without a pinch of salt.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn129">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is told that Rabbi Chanina inaugurated special privileges for his office even as Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel did. As long as the temple was in existence he was the highest authority in all matters pertaining to sacrifices. Frequently he supported his opinions by citing the customary procedure of his father and the customs of his father were based on family traditions.</p>
<p>He was particularly interested in preserving the detailed memory of all the customs of the service in the temple. Believing that the temple would soon be rebuilt he wanted to be sure that the customs in the new temple should not differ from those in the old one.<sup><xref rid="fn130">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chanina, deputy of the priests, influenced Jewish life in other ways aside from temple service procedure. In his time there lived in a village near Jerusalem a man who loaned money. This man was in the habit of writing the note of loan himself and the borrower merely signed the note or attested to his signature by a witness. Rabbi Chanina declared these notes to be valid although the accepted law of the time stated that the borrower must write the note himself. Chanina believed that as long as the signatures of the witnesses to the transaction were authentic it mattered not by whose hand the note was written.</p>
<p>The life and influence of Chanina occurred during the last years of the second temple. He also stated that during his performance of the service various miracles took place. One of them concerned the Menorah that was lit but once a year on Rosh Hashana but continued to burn throughout the year.<sup><xref rid="fn131">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of the mourning for the temple Chanina held that as long as it was in ruins no one should bathe on Tisha B&#x2019;Av, not even a person who has to perform an ablution, but in this he was contradicted by other scholars.<sup><xref rid="fn132">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The name of Chanina is not mentioned among the martyrs but the opinion prevails that he was executed and the date of his death is said to be 25 Sivan, the same as that of Simeon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. This does not mean, however, that he was killed before the destruction of the temple, for it is known that he survived it. It merely indicates that the date of his death coincides with that of the two martyrs.</p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>At about the same time there lived two Tanaim whom the Jerusalem Talmud refers to as the &#x201C;judges of robberies&#x201D; and the Babylonian Talmud calls the &#x201C;judges of decrees.&#x201D; This contradiction, however, is easily explained by the difference in pronounciation in the two countries.</p>
<p>It was the duty of these judges to settle various disputes and to punish those whom they found guilty of robbery. They also considered cases of damages and the infliction of minor wounds. These judges were generally elected by the community which also paid their fees in order to avoid their being bribed by one or another of the contending parties. Their verdict was final and they had the authority to enforce it.</p>
<p>There were many such judges, for Jerusalem alone counted 394 courts, each of which had 25 judges, according to the Talmud. But the Mishna names only two judges whose decisions served as a basis for future verdicts. These two were Admon ben Gadai and Chanan ben Avi Shalom.</p>
<p>The rule which these judges followed in arriving at a decision was to consider the specific circumstances of the place and time. We must also remember that of all the sentences passed by these judges not one involved actual robbery. They concerned financial disputes and the judges gave their verdict according to the dictates of reason. Scholars of later date used these decisions as a basis for passing sentence.</p>
<p>Admon ben Gadai issued seven sentences, four of which became a basis for future law although they were based on reason and not on texts of the Torah. Chanan ben Avi Shalom contributed two decisions in the same spirit.<sup><xref rid="fn133">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>Mention should also be made of Joshua ben Gamala who was elected High Priest several years before the destruction of the temple. This office he obtained through bribe in spite of the fact that he was not even descended from priests and that he married a widow. Martha, the daughter of Boetus, married Joshua and in order to obtain the office of High Priest for him she sent a bag full of gold to king Agrippa the second.<sup><xref rid="fn134">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the last rebellion Joshua ben Gamala opposed the patriots and was against the war with Rome. Agrippa soon removed him from office, as was his custom with High Priests, and Joshua remained a member of the Sanhedrin. When large numbers of Idumeans came from Galilee to Jerusalem to seek refuge from the Romans, Joshua ben Gamala together with the High Priest Anan strongly opposed their admission into the city. But the majority of the inhabitants of the city opposed their will and when the Idumeans were finally admitted they attacked Joshua ben Gamala and the High Priest Anan and killed them.</p>
<p>Joshua ben Gamala was very rich and he spent much money to beautify the temple and to increase its vessels. It is told that he had a golden vessel made for the purpose of casting the lot to determine which of the two sacrifices was to be offered in the temple and which was to be sent to Azazel.<sup><xref rid="fn135">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the fact that Joshua ben Gamala bought the office of High Priest, the Talmud mentions his name favorably, because he ruled that there must be teachers in every city in Judea to instruct the children so that the Torah might not be forgotten.<xref rid="fn136">&#x002A;)</xref></p>

<ftnote id="fn136">&#x002A;) The story of the manner in which Joshua ben Gamala became High Priest is related by Josephus and is verified on two occasions by the Talmud. But the Talmud states that Martha gave the bribe to Jannai instead of to Agrippa. This is due to the fact that aside from Agrippa I all the kings who ruled during the second temple are referred to in the Talmud as Jannai. Tosephoth remarks that it could not have been Alexander Jannai, the brother in law of Simeon ben Shetach, because the latter was High Priest himself and would never consent to give this office to another. There still remains some doubt as to the identity of Joshua ben Gamala because of the inconsistency that the man who &#x201C;saved the Torah from being forgotten among Jews&#x201D; should stoop to buy the high priesthood for money. It is for this reason that many historians claim that we are dealing with two different personalities. Rashi and Tosephoth (Baba Bathra, 21) maintain that it is one and the same person.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>The Time of the Destruction of the Temple</title>
<p>F<small>ROM THE PREVIOUS CHAPTERS</small> we get a clear picture of the political situation of the country and of its inhabitants as well as of the means that were employed by the enemy to oppress the people. But the internal life of the Jewish home was not greatly affected by the war which raged outside its walls. All those laws and customs which governed the life of the people were already strongly established to the smallest detail; the regulations concerning the daily prayers and the observance of the Sabbath and the holy days were definitely formed. The same was true regarding the family organization, the permissible and prohibited marriages, financial disputes among Jews as well the punishment of offenses against the public order. There were also well established dietary regulations and rules of cleanliness. All customs regarding offerings to the priests and the obligations toward the poor were defined. Even questions pertaining to the offering of sacrifices, which many scholars no longer considered as the most important foundation of the Jewish faith, and the laws affecting life and death, which were taken out of the jurisdiction of the Jewish courts, were codified in great detail together with their traditions and forms. But all of this legislation was not yet written down and the people had to guard it in their memory for use in future interpretations of the law.</p>
<p>We may therefore definitely say that the whole &#x201C;oral law&#x201D; as we have it today was already completed by that time. Such disputes as arose over the interpretation of a text came about as a result of the fact that the law was not set down in writing and was contained in the memory of the students.</p>
<p>In the observance of every day customs each one had his own traditions and these varied only slightly. But the regulations regarding cleanliness and the laws pertaining to the offering of sacrifices, which was no longer practiced, were increasingly disputed as time went on. Many of the regulations pertaining to sacrifices were forgotten soon after their offering was discontinued and it frequently occurred that a later scholar who never witnessed the service in the temple had to correct an older scholar who did witness the service but whose recollections were indistinct.</p>
<p>A rule was therefore adopted that whenever one expressed an opinion about a practice which was no longer observed, such an opinion had only a theoretical significance as to the desirable form of the observance but it did not serve as proof that this had actually been the form in which the practice was observed in the past.</p>
<p>Laws affecting civil disputes which involved monetary matters attained a high level of development. This was especially the case in the matter of offering proof which assumed numerous forms depending on the nature of the case; at times it was necessary to bring witnesses, at other times an oath, a written document or other proof of possession was required.</p>
<p>Usually two witnesses were required in such law suits. Their testimony had to coincide and they had to be known as men of high moral standards. For this reason no &#x201C;Am Haaretz&#x201D; was eligible to be a witness nor a person who might be suspected of falsifying his testimony out of fear of one of the litigants or through irresponsible levity. Women, children, cripples (blind and deaf) and fools who cannot judge what they see were also ruled out as witnesses. Similarly relatives of the litigants were rejected and in case both witnesses were related only one of them was allowed to testify. Persons known as &#x201C;wicked,&#x201D; gamblers, pigeon thieves and usurers were ruled out because they were considered as robbers who deprive people of their money. The same was true of persons who dealt in fruit of the sabbatical year or who were suspected of robbery. Among those not qualified to testify were also included tax collectors for the Roman government, shepherds who graze their herds in strangers&#x2019; fields and people suspected of being personally interested in the case.</p>
<p>There were cases when the court had to be satisfied with the testimony of only one witness. Thus the testimony of one witness to the death of a person was sufficient to free the widow to remarry. In other cases where the plaintiff could produce only one witness, the defendant could swear to his innocence and thus invalidate the testimony. Similar was the case of a woman who came before the court in times of peace and declared that her husband was dead. If she was known to have lived happily with him her testimony was accepted as valid in spite of the fact that women were not allowed to testify and despite the rule that no one might testify on his own behalf.</p>
<p>When hearing a witness the court had to impress upon him the possible significance of his words and to cross question him minutely. If the witnesses contradicted each other the testimony of both was ruled out. If they recanted their testimony, they were considered as false witnesses and the punishment that was to be meted out to the defendant was imposed upon them. In some cases it was possible to convict a defendant on the basis of testimony of witnesses who did not see the crime themselves but who heard of it from the defendant. But there were also limitations such as that a man might not be convicted on the basis of his own confession even though such a confession was worth the testimony of a hundred witnesses, for no man could make himself out to be wicked.</p>
<p>An oath was exacted when there were no witnesses or when only one witness appeared against the defendant. Similarly watchmen who disclaimed responsibility for damages to property while in their charge had to take an oath. This was also the case when a defendant admitted part of his guilt or one who denied guilt and was confronted by one witness. There were also cases when the plaintiff had to take an oath. These included workmen who claimed that they were not paid, the victim of a robbery in a case where the defendant pleaded not guilty, and the case of a man who was suspected of falsehood but against whom there were no witnesses.</p>
<p>The best proof in a law suit was a written document atesting to a loan, an engagement, a marriage or a divorce. Other documents recognized were contracts of sale or purchase, wills affecting inheritance, certificates of gift, receipts, mortgages, evaluation of property during the division of an inheritance, certificates of alimony to a deserted wife or children, written declaration of a married minor rejecting her husband, statements of arbitration and numerous others. Sometimes an oath was required in addition to the written documents whenever the signatures on the latter were doubtful.</p>
<p>Circumstantial evidence was highly regarded. Property in possession of a person was considered to be his own and any claim to it had to be proved by the claimant.</p>
<p>[The people were at that time imbued with a strong desire to fortify and define their faith and it is remarkable that, in spite of the unfavorable political position of the Jews, Judaism nevertheless gained adherents and many neighboring peoples came closer to it. It may be assumed that the period was one of spiritual crisis among the heathen nations. Tiring of the idols many people confusedly speculated that the forces of nature are not gods but that they are part of an invisible power which governs the forces of nature. When they heard that Jews worship such an invisible God, many came to Judea to acquaint themselves with the worshippers of this God.</p>
<p>It was characteristic that the seekers after a new truth mainly belonged to the upper educated strata of their nations. Adiabene, a small buffer state on the banks of the Tigris, was then ruled by a queen Helene. This queen was married to her brother Izates, and after his death she once visited Jerusalem. Deeply impressed by what she saw and especially by the religious ceremonials of the temple she was converted and adopted Judaism. Later her son, Izates II, also joined the faith.</p>
<p>It is probable that some of the Jewish scholars of that time were not too happy over the new converts. It seems certain that the strict regulations against proselytes and the sharp expressions against them in the Talmud such as that &#x201C;proselytes are as difficult for Jews as a swelling&#x201D; all date from this period. The troubles which Jews had to withstand from the Samaritans and the Idumeans taught them to be careful in admitting new converts.</p>
<p>Most of the proselytes of that time were women. Conversion was more difficult for men and fewer of them adopted Judaism. When king Izates II decided to become a Jew one of the scholars taught him the precepts of Judaism and told him that he must not undergo circumcision in order not to arouse the anger of his countrymen; it would be sufficient if he recognized the principles of the Jewish religion and the overlordship of an invisible God. But Izates was later circumcised when he realized that without this rite he was deprived of the rights of a Jew.</p>
<p>Many highly placed persons strove toward the Jewish faith. They were intrigued by the high moral teachings of the Jewish religion although they did not highly regard the Jew as a person. It therefore seems certain that were the political situation of the Jewish nation more favorable all the surrounding nations would have embraced Judaism.</p>
<p>It is also remarkable that some of the scholars of that time were but little concerned with the continued existence of the temple. Many events which then transpired were not written down and those that history did note express a definite tendency of thought. But it seems certain that some scholars considered the development of the Torah as more important than the maintenance of the temple. They probably reasoned that were the temple to be destroyed it could be rebuilt in more auspicious times but if the Torah were to be neglected it might spell the doom of the Jewish nation.</p>
<p>It is also evident that some scholars did not attach much importance to the offering of sacrifices while others carefully pondered the minutest details of the temple service. This, however, took place after the temple was destroyed. Only after the temple was razed did the realization of its significance as a central national force dawn upon people. Only then did even those who considered the temple to be of minor importance in the Jewish religion grasp its importance. Revolutionary sentiment died down after the rebels were slaughtered or led captive to Rome to fight with wild beasts in its arenas. A new concept of the significance of sacrifices was then gained. It was now understood that when the text says that sacrifices are offered as &#x201C;pleasing odors&#x201D; it was not meant that God enjoys the odor of burnt flesh but rather that he is satisfied to see men do his will. When it was no longer possible to offer sacrifices, some scholars held that fasts and self-inflicted suffering are considered by God to be worthier than burnt offerings while others maintained that prayer was of greater importance than sacrifices.</p>
<p>While the revolution was raging throughout the land the temple service was conducted as usual. At the same time, many scholars sought to escape from the revolution-torn city and they established a new sanctuary for the study of the Torah in Jabneh.</p>
<p>The Romans did not yet persecute the study of the Torah, for in those days they did not see in the Torah any danger to the unity of the Roman empire. They therefore paid no attention to the scholarly pursuits as long as the Jews regularly paid their taxes to the government. It also seems certain that the Romans would have saved the temple from destruction were it not for their allies among the Jews who constantly called their attention to the fact that as long as the temple remained in existence Jews would never submit to Roman rule and no matter how much they were persecuted they would continue to revolt.</p>
<p>Among the friends of the Romans who constantly insisted that the temple must be destroyed and that its continued existence gave encouragement to the embattled Jews, the foremost were the Jewish king Agrippa II and his sister Berenice. Berenice was not noted for modesty in her personal life and she became the mistress of Titus, the commander of the Roman army in Judea.</p>
<p>The relations between Titus and Berenice are described in the Talmud in the following words: &#x201C;He held a harlot by the hand and entered the Holy of Holies.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn137">1)</xref></sup> Just as the Talmud never referred to Herod except as &#x201C;the Idumean slave&#x201D; so also they referred to Berenice as a &#x201C;harlot.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Historical legend relates that Titus commanded his soldiers not to harm the temple. But Agrippa and Berenice refused to obey him in this matter and hinted to the soldiers that they would never subdue the revolt as long as the temple remained intact. Berenice is said to have climbed on the shoulder of a Roman soldier and with her own hand to have thrown into the temple the burning torch which set fire to the building. When Titus heard that the temple was burning he ran to help put out the fire, but he came too late, for the flames had already enveloped the whole temple.</p>
<p>It is obvious that one would not sin against historical truth if he disbelieved this legend. It was originated by Josephus who is not entirely trustworthy when chronicling the role of Titus and king Agrippa during the destruction of the temple.</p>
<p>The revolt lasted many years. It was not concentrated in one locality but flared up in different sections of the country until it assumed a general nature and on a certain day the priests refused to offer the daily sacrifice for the welfare of the Roman emperor and also rejected sacrifices offered by non-Jews who lived in Judea.</p>
<p>Friends of the Romans immediately informed the representatives of the government of the new turn in the tactics of the rebels. When Roman soldiers were dispatched to enforce the offering of the sacrifice for the welfare of the emperor and to force the acceptance of the sacrificial offerings of the non-Jews, the patriots occupied the temple and killed many of the soldiers who were stationed in Jerusalem and its vicinity.</p>
<p>This action caused great confusion among the Jews because it was unauthorized and many prominent persons in Jerusalem publicly expressed their displeasure. For this expression of loyalty to the Romans the zealots executed many of them as well as numerous others whom they suspected of secret sympathy with the Romans.</p>
<p>Later others declared that since the deed could not be undone it was necessary to wait for the reaction of Rome, meanwhile fortifying the cities in anticipation of the coming of the enemy.</p>
<p>At that time there lived in Jerusalem three wealthy men who belonged to aristocratic families which could trace their descent as far back as king Saul and Moses. Their names were Nakdimon ben Gurion, Ben Kalba Savua and Ben Tzizith Hakeseth. These three undertook to supply the city with wheat and barley, wine and oil as well as salt and wood for the duration of the siege of Jerusalem even if that were to last many years.</p>
<p>But the zealots were eager to come out in open struggle against the Romans and they felt sure that they were strong enough for the contest. They feared that the presence of large supplies of food during the forthcoming siege might induce the people to stay within the walls and discourage them from attacking the enemy outside the gates. They were therefore dissatisfied with the offer of the wealthy men and in the dark of night they burned the store rooms filled with grain. A great famine then followed the like of which the city never experienced before.</p>
<p>The Roman governor meanwhile incited the Greek population of Caesarea against their Jewish neighbors. When the news of the clash became known, the Jewish inhabitants of Jerusalem attacked the Greeks as well as other non-Jews within the city. This mutual enmity quickly enveloped the whole country and whenever Jew and non-Jew met a battle ensued in which the weaker side was given no mercy.</p>
<p>These clashes spread to Acco, Haifa, Ascalon and other cities and also affected the Jews of Alexandria in Egypt who till this time lived peacefully. When the news reached Alexandria the Greek population began to attack the Jews and, meeting with resistance, they started a war of annihilation against them. The leader of the Greeks was a Jewish apostate Tiberius Alexander.</p>
<p>The chronicles of these violent events speak of tens of thousands of people being killed. While it is possible that some of these figures are exaggerated there remains no doubt that large numbers perished and the horrors of the situation were not exaggerated.</p>
<p>When the Romans finally decided to suppress the Jewish insurrection their army was put under the command of Galus. With him was the Jewish king Agrippa who acted as his guide and who instructed the soldiery to execute all those they met.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the disturbances within Jerusalem gained in intensity from day to day. Outside the cities the Jewish warriors showed feats of prodigious valor which terrified the Romans to such an extent that many of them deserted their camp and joined the Jews in the struggle for liberation. But within Jerusalem there raged a violent struggle between those who wanted peace and the militants who demanded war.</p>
<p>The story in the Talmud about the disputes between the school of Shammai (who wanted war) and the school of Hillel (who wanted peace) of which it is said that &#x201C;a sword was placed within the temple and it was announced that one might enter but he might not leave until a decision was arrived at&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn138">2)</xref></sup> is interpreted by some historians to refer to the above mentioned conflicts. On another occasion it is told that &#x201C;the disciples of Shammai stood at the foot of the wall armed with swords and spears and they beat the disciples of Hillel.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn139">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Still others campaigned for war by means of the written word. There was then written the &#x201C;Megillat Taanith&#x201D; which cites all the afflictions which Jews had to withstand throughout their existence in order to arouse the people against the insufferable troubles. Others wrote &#x201C;Megillat Beth Chashmonai,&#x201D; the story of the Hasmonean family, which told of the causes of the Hasmonean revolt in order to remind the people of the great miracles which then transpired when a small handful of valiant Jews undertook the struggle against the mighty Greeks. All of this was aimed to encourage the rebels in the belief that God would certainly aid them against the Romans even though their military forces be small.</p>
<p>The greatest error of the leaders of the war against Rome was committed when they appointed Josephus to head the war in Galilee. In his history of the war Josephus relates the tricks and intrigues to which he resorted in his fight against the insurrection up to the destruction of the temple. After the destruction he received an appointment from the Roman emperor and out of gratitude to Rome he assumed the surname Flavius which was also the name of the emperor Vespasian and his son Titus.</p>
<p>To save the situation the Romans dispatched a horde of six hundred thousand armed men under the leadership of Vespasian against the Jewish rebels. Vespasian, who was noted for his victories over the Germans, proceeded to storm the fortresses outside of Jerusalem in an attempt to cut off that city from all avenues of escape. He was always successful in utilizing the aid of traitors who informed him of the weaknesses of the various cities and how they might best be taken. His conduct of the war lacked all ethics of combat and whenever he occupied a city after promising to spare its inhabitants, he invariably broke his promise and brutally slaughtered its residents.</p>
<p>The Jews fought with indescribable heroism but they were everywhere betrayed and the Romans took one city after another. Jerusalem alone remained steadfast and would not surrender but it was afflicted by another difficulty. Tens of thousands of refugees from the surrounding towns fled into the city and attempted to dictate the activities of its inhabitants. A large portion of the Jerusalem population would have been glad to end the insurrection in any manner possible, but the zealots considered them as traitors and once a man was stamped by the suspicion of treason he could be killed without punishment.</p>
<p>The mutual conflicts of the Jerusalem Jews as well as the famine which broke out after the food supplies were burned were a great encouragement to Vespasian who saw in them a sign that the gods were favoring him. Secure in the belief that Rome would triumph in the end, he was satisfied to watch the Jews aid him in his work.</p>
<p>Vespasian meanwhile entrusted the conduct of the war to his son Titus who maintained friendly relations with king Agrippa II and with Josephus and was also on intimate terms with princess Berenice. These instructed him what means to employ and, knowing that the city was without food, they pointed out to him how he could also cut off its water supply. When these attempts brought no results, Titus announced to the besieged that he would provide food and drink to all those who would come out to him and that he would also permit them to return to the city.</p>
<p>Many of the besieged were deceived by these promises and, as could be expected, Titus did not keep his promise. Some of the deserters were given salty food but no water; others were crucified in front of the fortress in full view of the besieged; still others had their arms cut off after which they were sent back into the city.</p>
<p>But in spite of the siege the temple service continued until the 17th day of Tamuz. Throughout long months the inhabitants of the city had nothing to eat but the daily sacrifice was offered until the last lamb was gone and not even a handful of flour was left in the city. Then the sacrifice was discontinued and the fire on the altar expired.</p>
<p>With the aid of famine and plagues, mutual conflict and other suffering which reached such a stage that the people were forced to become cannibalistic, the Romans conquered Jerusalem. But even when the Romans were already within the gates of the city the Jews continued to fight valiantly until they saw the temple in flames; only then did they lose their courage.</p>
<p>No one believed that God would permit His temple to be destroyed and, when this finally did happen, everyone within the city, men and women, young and old, went about crazed with despair. Thousands cast themselves into the fire while others fell on their own swords.</p>
<p>The burning of the temple marked a spiritual crisis in Jewish life. Their life became centered about the Torah and now Jerusalem was superseded by Jabneh.</p>
<p>After four years of bloody warfare Jerusalem lay devastated, the temple destroyed, the best people of the nation were killed or dragged into captivity where they were sold as slaves into the copper and lead mines. The young men of the aristocratic families were forced to run after the triumphal chariot of Titus while carrying in their hands the vessels of the temple which became the booty of the Romans and after the celebration of the triumph they had to face each other as well as wild animals in battles staged in the arenas of Rome for the pleasure of the populace.</p>
<p>These spectacles were visited among others by the ex-king Agrippa, his sister Berenice and Josephus who later described those wars in a tone of praise to Vespasian.</p>
<p>Jabneh developed into an important city during the revolt preceding the destruction of the temple. Its population was so large that the city provided forty thousand men for the war; it may therefore be reckoned that its population was about two hundred thousand. When the Romans spared the city they hardly knew the strength which was inherent in the Torah and how dangerous for them it might become.</p>
<p>It seems certain that many of the scholars left Jerusalem before the destruction of the temple because of their refusal to participate in the revolt. These settled in Jabneh which was apparently not affected by the tumult of war. When Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai visited the emperor Vespasian in his camp, he found favor in his eyes and Vespasian asked him to make a request. Rabban Jochanan did not ask that Jerusalem or the temple be spared but he requested that Jabneh and its scholars be saved. This clearly indicates that Jabneh was already then the home of a large number of scholars.</p>
<p>Jabneh then became the center of Judaism &#x2014; a new Jerusalem without a temple or sacrifices. A new Sanhedrin was organized which assumed the rights of the previous Sanhedrin of Jerusalem to regulate Jewish life according to the interpretations of the Torah. The scholars of Jabneh were of no less stature than those of Jerusalem. They would not have been chosen had they not been men of great religious and secular learning as well as masters of the languages of the neighboring peoples, so as to be able to try cases between Jews and non-Jews without having to resort to outside experts and interpreters.</p>
<p>The scholars of Jabneh gathered in a place which was called &#x201C;the vineyard of Jabneh.&#x201D; The meaning of this name is not entirely clear and some claim that it refers to their manner of being seated in rows just as vines are planted in a vineyard.<sup><xref rid="fn140">4)</xref></sup> In Jabneh the decision was finally made that in all disputes between the school of Shammai and the school of Hillel the law should be practiced according to the school of Hillel. This decision was arrived at as a result of a &#x201C;Bath Kol&#x201D; <xref rid="fn141">&#x002A;)</xref> which announced that the opinions of the school of Shammai are also from God but that only the opinions of the school of Hillel should be put into practice.<sup><xref rid="fn142">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the people saw that sacrifices were no longer offered they fell into a great despair. Many of them could not understand the value of the prayers that were substituted for the sacrifices and the weaker ones joined the various religious sects that sought a new god outside of the Jewish faith. It was then that the Tana Shmuel Hakatan established the prayer against the disbelievers (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05DB;&#x05EA; &#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) which curses all those who depart from the Jewish faith to be taken from among the living.</p>
<p>Many laws were codified in Jabneh and special attention was paid to determining the first of the month and the feast days. This calendar was also valid for the Jews of Rome, Greece, Egypt and Babylon.</p>
<p>Jabneh thus became a place of refuge for fugitives from the strife in Jerusalem. While the tumult of war was still resounded and the hearts of the people contracted in pain at sight of the dead and wounded and at the sound of the Roman cheers, this group of scholars forged the essence of the Jewish nation. It was not difficult for them to find that which they sought. They realized that the Torah was the only hope for continued national existence and their work could not be hindered by strangers nor by all the legions of the Romans. While the enemy could kill people, destroy the temple and lay waste the land he could not annihilate the spirit of the nation.</p>
<p>After a short time there was also founded in Jabneh a court having the same powers as the court in Jerusalem. The text of the Bible that &#x201C;if a thing shall be hidden from you in a judgment between blood and blood or between one claim and another or between one damage and another in a dispute within your gates, you shall arise and go to the place which the Lord God will choose&#x201D; (Deut. 17:8) they interpreted to mean that the court gives authority to the place where it is located and not the place to the court; it was therefore concluded that Jabneh might also be such a place.</p>
<p>Jabneh came to be considered the equal of Jerusalem in the matter of some customs such as the blowing of the Shofar (ram&#x2019;s horn) on Rosh Hashanah when the first day of the year happens on a Sabbath. In such a case it was previously prohibited to blow the Shofar on Sabbath outside of Jerusalem where no sacrifices were offered.</p>
<p>It is related that the introduction of this custom in Jabneh met with some difficulties. Prominent opponents of this measure, such as the men of Bathyra whose ancestors once headed the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem, could not compromise with the idea that Jabneh should be considered the equal of Jerusalem in sanctity and that the blowing of the Shofar on a Sabbath should be permitted within it. They wanted to debate the matter with Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai but he said: &#x201C;Let us first blow the Shofar and then we shall debate the issue.&#x201D; When they wanted to debate the question after this was done he said to them: &#x201C;Now that the sound of the Shofar has been heard in Jabneh it is useless to debate the matter.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Until this time it was the custom that the head of the Court had to announce the beginning of the new month but in Jabneh it was ruled that any member of the court might announce the beginning of the new month even in the absence of the head of the court.</p>
<p>The basis for these new innovations was that with the destruction of the temple the needs of the people changed in accordance with the new political situation. The great changes which the events of that time brought about eliminated the original purpose of many of the customs and they had to be changed according to the new state of affairs. It is characteristic of the people that they adapted themselves rapidly to the changed circumstances and looked at the present and toward the near future instead of to the past.</p>
<p>As the people devoted themselves to the observance of the commandments according to the traditions of the oral law, they gained the necessary strength to rise above the gloom of the present and to concentrate their thoughts on spiritual matters. Their first activity was to gather all the traditions and to put them down in writing. Seeing that many old customs were being forgotten and that even some of the scholars, who were active in the academy, sometimes forgot that which they had seen, they began to collect in book form all the traditional customs and laws including those that were no longer practiced after the destruction of the temple.</p>

<title>Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai</title>
<p>R<small>ABBAN</small> J<small>OCHANAN BEN</small> Z<small>AKKAI</small> played the most important role in the great spiritual crisis which took place during the time of the destruction of the temple. Since he was known to favor peace with the Romans, the zealots kept him under constant surveilance but, employing a trick, he succeeded in escaping the city together with two of his best disciples (Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua) and in persuading the Romans to spare the city of Jabneh together with the scholars that lived in it in order to permit the perpetuation of the customs of Judaism according to the regulations of the Torah.</p>
<p>This event is described in the Talmud in the following manner:</p>
<p>Abba Sikra, a nephew of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai, was a leader among the zealots. One day Rabban Jochanan summoned him to appear before him secretly. When Abba Sikra arrived, Rabban Jochanan asked him: &#x201C;How much longer will you permit the people to die of hunger before you surrender to the Romans?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Abba Sikra replied: &#x201C;What can I do? Were I to mention peace to my comrades I would be killed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then advise me how I can leave the city. Perhaps I shall be able to bring some salvation for myself and for others,&#x201D; Rabban Jochanan said.</p>
<p>To this Abba Sikra answered: &#x201C;Pretend that you are sick and have people come to visit you. Afterward have it announced that you died but permit only your disciples to attend to the funeral and to carry your body out of the city, for strangers may become aware that they are carrying a living body.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The advice of Abba Sikra was followed to the letter and when the pall bearers approached the gate of the city the guards wanted to pierce the body in order to make sure that it was really dead. But Abba Sikra said to them: &#x201C;Do not so, for if the Romans hear of it they will say &#x2018;The Jews have stabbed their Rabbi.&#x2019; &#x201D; The guards then wanted to throw the body from the litter and Abba Sikra again intervened saying, &#x201C;Do not so, for if the Romans hear of it they will say &#x2018;The Jews have thrown the body of their Rabbi on the ground.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>Upon finding himself outside the city, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai at once repaired to the Roman camp to see Vespasian, who was then conducting the siege of Jerusalem. After he gained his confidence with his wise words, and especially because Vespasian knew of his favorable attitude toward peace with the Romans, Vespasian asked him to request whatever he liked. Rabban Jochanan asked for three things: his first request was to spare Jabneh and its scholars; the second request was to spare the family of Rabban Gamliel the Elder; the third request was to provide a doctor for Rabbi Zadok who spent forty years in fasting and prayer to God to spare the temple.</p>
<p>On this occasion the Talmud remarks that sometimes God deprives the wise of their intelligence, for Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai should have asked that the Romans give up the siege. But the same paragraph which criticizes Rabban Jochanan also defends him by saying that he refrained from speaking about the siege for fear of gaining nothing if he asked for too much.<sup><xref rid="fn143">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The manner in which Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai came before Vespasian is related in a somewhat different manner in the Midrash.<sup><xref rid="fn144">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to this version the name of Rabban Jochanan&#x2019;s nephew was Ben Batiach and it further states that when the zealots of Jerusalem burned the food stores which the three wealthiest men of the city gave to the inhabitants to tide them over the period of the siege, Rabban Jochanan Ben Zakkai cried in anguish. It was immediately reported to Ben Batiach that his uncle cried out &#x201C;Woe&#x201D; (Vai). Ben Batiach summoned his uncle and asked him: &#x201C;Why did you cry out &#x2018;Woe&#x2019;?&#x201D; But Rabban Jochanan replied: &#x201C;I did not cry out &#x2018;Woe&#x2019; but &#x2018;Wah.&#x2019; &#x201D; (Wah, was an exclamation of joy.)</p>
<p>Ben Batiach further queried, &#x201C;Why were you so glad?&#x201D; To this Rabban Jochanan replied, &#x201C;I was glad that you burned all the food supplies, for so long as there is food within the city you will not succeed in getting the people to participate in the war.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Three days later Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was walking in the street and he saw people boiling straw and drinking the broth. He then remarked that if people who boil straw to drink the broth attempt an insurrection against Vespasian and his army, it was best to leave the place.</p>
<p>He then sent to Ben Batiach a message saying: &#x201C;Allow me to leave the city.&#x201D; But Ben Batiach answered, &#x201C;We have an agreement to permit no living person to leave the city.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to the Midrash Eichah, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai did request Vespasian to give up the siege but Vespasian is said to have answered: &#x201C;The Romans have made me emperor that I should destroy this land, but you may take out of the city all the friends that you wish to save from death.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to another legend, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai once saw the daughter of Nakdimon ben Gurion, who was one of the three wealthiest men who undertook to provide the city with food before the zealots burned their food stores, picking barley from beneath the horses&#x2019; hooves. He then exclaimed: &#x201C;When Jews do the will of God, no nation on earth can rule over them; but when they ignore the will of God, He hands them over to a lower nation, not only that, He even hands them over to its horses.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan&#x201D; relates the manner of Jochanan&#x2019;s leaving Jerusalem in a much simpler form. According to this source Rabban Jochanan simulated death and succeeded in escaping with the aid of his disciples only without his nephew being involved in it.</p>
<p>The origin and descent of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai remains unknown. For three generations the house of Hillel ruled the religious life of the Jews, and the people obeyed it because they considered it to be an offshoot of the royal house of David. Suddenly there appeared an outsider, who was held to be the least of Hillel&#x2019;s disciples, and the whole people followed him. Many years before the destruction of the temple, people flocked from near and far to hear him expound the Torah. It was for this reason that Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai considered himself a representative of the nation and it was as such that he spoke to Vespasian.</p>
<p>In those days he was in the habit of sitting in the shadow of the temple and expounding the Torah, all day long, before an audience which was too numerous to be accommodated by the temple. The wall of the temple was one hundred ells high and it cast a broad shadow where many could find protection from the sun. Rabban Jochanan concerned himself but little with the brutal oppression of the Romans or with the terrible disputes which rent the Jewish parties. This was also his attitude years later when he taught in Jabneh after the destruction of the temple and he refrained from commenting on the political situation. The content of his teachings was devoted to peace and even during the days of the sharpest struggle he was not afraid to speak of the necessity for peace with Rome.</p>
<p>Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was a pupil of Hillel. Since he survived the destruction of Jerusalem and was later active in Jabneh, there seems to be no exaggeration in the tradition which claims that he lived to be 120 years of age. It may also be said of him what was said of Moses that &#x201C;his eyes were not dimmed nor did his freshness leave him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hillel himself recognized the worth of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. When Hillel became sick, before his death his disciples came to visit him, but Rabban Jochanan remained standing outside the door. &#x201C;Where is the small Jochanan?&#x201D; Hillel asked, and he then predicted that when Jochanan would grow up he would be &#x201C;a father in wisdom and a father for future generations.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is told that even long before the destruction Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai understood that the Jews would not be able to withstand the Romans and that the temple would be destroyed in the end. A legend relates that forty years before, its destruction, the gates of the temple began to open by themselves as if ready to receive the enemy. Rabban Jochanan is said to have scolded them for their fear saying: &#x201C;Everyone knows that you will be destroyed, but you do not have to open your gates to make the entrance of the enemy easier.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Even before the temple was destroyed, Rabban Jochanan found himself a place named Arav (near Sepphoris) where he spent eighteen years, but in all this time he reached only two verdicts. He therefore concluded that the place was not adapted to the study of the Torah and he said that since Galilee hates the Torah it would in the ent revert to being a region of robbers.<sup><xref rid="fn145">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>With his great intelligence Rabban Jochanan grasped the whole Torah including all its interpretations, laws and legends; his every word was carefully weighed and he did not engage in idle conversation	.(<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05D7;&#x05EA; &#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>) He never walked four ells without speaking of the Torah or without phylacteries. While on the street he had a friendly greeting for Jew and non-Jew alike. He was the first to come to the academy and the last to leave it, nor was he ever seen sitting idly or asleep, but he always was engaged in study. He allowed no one to open the door of the academy for his disciples but he opened the door himself for every one and led each one to his place. He never said that it was time to go home except on the eve of Passover in order to slaughter the Paschal offering and on the eve of the Day of Atonement in order to prepare for the fast.</p>
<p>Of his master, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai said: &#x201C;If all the heavens were parchments and all the trees were quills and all the seas were ink it would still be impossible to write down even a part of what I learned from my teacher. And all this,&#x201D; he would add, &#x201C;is only as much as a fly might absorb when plunging into the great sea.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But Rabban Jochanan did not consider his great learning to be a virtue deserving of praise. He was in the habit of saying: &#x201C;If you have learned much, do not be proud of it. It was for this purpose that you were born.&#x201D; He also said: &#x201C;Whoever possesses wisdom without fear (of God) is like a craftsman without tools.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He believed that the Torah protects from death, and when all the male offspring of a certain priestly family of his day died at the age of eighteen years, he declared that they must be descendants of Eli, upon whom there rested the curse of early death for all men. If, however, they would have devoted themselves to the Torah then its virtue would have protected them from the curse.</p>
<p>It is charactristic of Rabban Jochanan that he was not deeply influenced by the destruction of the temple. A legend relates that when he learned of its destruction he tore his clothes but when he heard his disciple Rabbi Joshua mourn: &#x201C;Woe to us, the place that has brought forgiveness for the transgressions of the Jews has been destroyed,&#x201D; Rabban Jochanan replied: &#x201C;Do not be grieved for we have another means to attain forgiveness of our sins and that is through charity.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn146">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The great crisis, which the destruction of the temple marked in Jewish life, met with a different response among the two diametrically opposed elements within the nation. One group could not reconcile itself to the destruction; the essence of their faith was centered in the temple, and when that was burned they became obsessed with the idea that the whole nation was destroyed along with it. Unable to adapt themselves to the new circumstances, these renounced their lives or joined some of the outlandish religious growths which then cropped up profusely.</p>
<p>But there was another group which secretly nurtured its sorrow. These even felt certain that God would not allow the temple to remain desolate for long and they drew encouragement from the historical fact that the &#x201C;Babylonian captivity&#x201D; lasted only seventy years. They fervently believed that the predictions of the prophets regarding the future of Jerusalem and the renewal of the temple would certainly be fulfilled. But until a new temple should be erected they meanwhile introduced customs to take the place of the sacrifices; they devoted themselves to pondering the sanctity of the Jewish nation and delved deeply into the Torah and its interpretations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile death and destruction stalked the land. Not satisfied with the desolation of the land and the blood which they shed, the Romans daily introduced new laws to humiliate the Jews. Knowing that the Jews had taxed themselves a half &#x201C;shekel&#x201D; per person for the maintenance of the temple, the Romans levied a tax of fifteen shkolim (thirty times as much) on every person for the expenses of their temple of Jupiter who &#x201C;helped them triumph over their enemies.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the reports of the valor of the Jews in the war became known and the world realized that without the aid of Jewish traitors mighty Rome with its iron legions could not have conquered the small land of Judea, the Roman rulers hired scribes to belittle the bravery of the Jewish warriors and to make them appear as ordinary robber bands which could have been annihilated by a single Roman battalion were it not that the &#x201C;kind&#x201D; Titus sought to spare the land but, his patience becoming exhausted, he decided to show the rebels the might of Rome.</p>
<p>Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai wanted to establish the custom of pilgrimages to Jabneh to take the place of the previous pilgrimages to Jerusalem. In this he but partly succeeded. Many people did come from far and near to celebrate the feast days in Jabneh and especially those Jews who lived outside of Judea who came to find out the law regarding matters of which they were in doubt. But the majority of the people continued to observe their feast days in the desolate Jerusalem on the site of the burned temple, which lost none of its sanctity in their eyes.</p>
<p>Rabban Jochanan did succeed in concentrating the priests about himself in Jabneh that they might wait there until called to the rebuilding of a new temple. In the meantime he instructed the people to observe the commandments of offering the tithes and the priests had to observe all the laws of cleanliness and to eat their tithes in purity even as they did when the temple was in existence.</p>
<p>Even as he previously did in Jerusalem, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai now continued to search for the basic explanation of all the laws and in this he was highly successful. Every commandment of the Torah he explained in wise and convincing words. Only in the matter of the prohibition of the use of the flesh of pigs and of wearing &#x201C;Shatnes&#x201D; (cloth woven out of wool and flax), the commandments of &#x201C;Halitza&#x201D; and &#x201C;Yibum&#x201D; (the marriage of a childless widow to her husband&#x2019;s brother), the laws of the purification of lepers, the scapegoat sent to Azazel on the Day of Atonement and the sacrifice of the red heifer, these he did not attempt to rationalize. These were all laws of such a fundamental nature, he was wont to say, that they should not be debated.</p>
<p>A &#x201C;Hebrew slave&#x201D; who refused his freedom at the end of six years of servitude had the lobe of his ear pierced, Rabban Jochanan explained, because the ear heard the words of God uttered from mount Sinai that &#x201C;all Jews are my servants.&#x201D; He who has exchanged the rule of God for the rule of man is deserving that his ear be pierced as a sign of eternal shame.</p>
<p>Once his disciples asked Rabban Jochanan why no iron might be used in the construction of an altar. To this he replied that since swords, which are a symbol of punishment, are made out of iron while the altar is a symbol of forgiveness, it is necessary to keep these two opposing symbols apart. And if the inanimate stones of the altar, which cannot speak or think, must not be cut with iron because they cause peace to be made between Jews and their Father in Heaven, one must therefore consider how much more honor is due to a person who makes peace between man and wife, between one city and another, between one nation and another or between one family and another.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that the temple was burned and Jerusalem was destroyed, the Jews did not consider themselves as exiles so long as they remained on their own soil. But all those Jews who lived in Babylonia and other lands were considered to be in captivity since Nebuchadnezzar exiled them. Rabban Jochanan was once asked by his disciples why God caused most of the Jews to be exiled to Babylonia and he answered that they were like a woman who sins against her husband and is sent by him to her father&#x2019;s home. God exiled the Jews to Babylonia when they sinned against him because that is the land that Abraham came from.</p>
<p>There is an opinion that Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was a priest and that he officiated in the service in the temple together with the other priests. Thus it is told that his disciples asked him about some custom pertaining to sacrifices, but when he answered they were dissatisfied with his reply and proved to him that he did not remember the procedure in the temple on certain occasions. Rabban Jochanan said: &#x201C;You are right. I have forgotten what I did myself.&#x201D; When he was still in Jerusalem he came into conflict with the High Priest, whom he threatened with revenge, but this High Priest died before his plan of vengeance was carried out.</p>
<p>Rabban Jochanan also objected, while still in Jerusalem, to the procedure of stunning the animals brought as sacrifices in order to facilitate their slaughter. He claimed that such a procedure crippled the animal and caused unclean flesh to be offered on the altar.</p>
<p>It is obvious that while the Romans ruled over the lives and the possessions of the Jews in a barbaric fashion the morals of the Jewish women could not remain in their former purity. The royal house of Agrippa II as well as his sister Berenice and some of the priests of that time could hardly serve as an example of morality for Jewish women. Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai realized that Jewish family life was being wrecked by this immorality. He then abolished the procedure of taking a <span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05D8;&#x05D4;</span> before a priest and the administering of the water since it would have to be applied to the majority of the women of Judea if it remained in force.</p>
<p>Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai frequently debated the commandments of the Torah with non-Jews. Despite the fact that the Jews lost the war and that the Romans hired scribes to slander them, this was a time when numerous Gentile scholars were deeply interested in the Torah and were anxious to discuss its commandments with Jews. They were amazed at the stubborness with which this small people clung to its faith.</p>
<p>Rabban Jochanan engaged in similar disputations with the Sadducees. Although these no longer existed as a separate party, there were still men in prominent positions who conducted themselves according to the teachings of the Sadducees. Rabban Jochanan was wont to debate with them and attempted to prove that they were not Jews.</p>
<p>But his attitude was entirely different when disputing with a Gentile. When one of these asked him whether there would ever come a day when Jews and Gentiles would be happy, Rabban Jochanan answered that it would have to be a rainy day.</p>
<p>Later his disciples asked him whether God approved of charitable deeds of Gentiles because the verse &#x201C;the kindness of nations is a sin&#x201D; was then commonly interpreted to mean that even good deeds of Gentiles are sinful. Rabban Jochanan said that the real meaning of the verse is different from the accepted one and that it intends to convey the idea that just as a sin offering brings forgiveness for Jews even so do charitable deeds compensate for the sins of Gentiles.</p>
<p>Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai devoted himself a great deal to the mysteries of the creation of the world and to the &#x201C;Divine Chariot&#x201D; of Ezekiel&#x2019;s prophecy. A legend relates that he was once riding on a donkey while his best pupil, Rabbi Elazar ben Arach, was walking after him. Rabbi Elazar said: &#x201C;Let us now study a chapter on the construction of the Chariot.&#x201D; But Rabban Jochanan said that one must not discuss this subject with only one pupil unless he is one who understands everything himself without explanation from his teacher. To this Rabbi Elazar answered: &#x201C;Then let me expound the construction of the Chariot and you will see whether I understand it without an explanation of my teacher.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai descended from his donkey and, wrapping himself in his robe, they sat down on a rock under an olive tree. After he heard the exposition of his pupil he kissed him on the head and said: &#x201C;Blessed be the God of Israel who granted to Father Abraham a son who understands so much and who expounds so nicely for the glory of his Father in Heaven.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Out of the great number of his pupils five were particularly noteworthy and Rabban Jochanan praised each of them for his virtues. The names of the five were: R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, R. Joshua ben Chananiah, R. Jose Hacohen, R. Simeon ben Nathanel and R. Elazar ben Arach. Of these Rabban Jochanan said that R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus was like a lime pit which does not lose a single drop of water; of R. Joshua ben Chananiah he said, happy is the mother who gave birth to such a son; of R. Jose Hacohen he said that he was pious; R. Simeon ben Nathanel avoided sin and R. Elazar ben Arach was like a spring which wells up ever stronger.</p>
<p>Of them Rabban Jochanan said further: &#x201C;If the wisdom of all Jewish scholars were to be placed on one side of the scale and the wisdom of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus on the other side than his wisdom would outweigh that of all the others.&#x201D; At a later date he was said to have declared: &#x201C;If the wisdom of all the Jewish scholars together with that of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus were to be placed on one side of the scale and the wisdom of R. Elazar ben Arach were to be placed on the other side, then his would outweigh that of all the others.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There seems to have been no limit to the reverence which the disciples of Rabban Jochanan accorded him. They referred to him in no other terms than &#x201C;the light of Israel,&#x201D; &#x201C;the right pillar&#x201D; and &#x201C;the strong hammer.&#x201D; They said of him that he was the only teacher of kindness and peace who realized the worth of human freedom for he sharply opposed slavishness in man. Rabban Jochanan also admired all good qualities in man irrespective of what nation that man belonged to. When he taught the necessity of loving God, he instructed that He should be loved as a child loves its father and not as a slave loves his lord.</p>
<p>When Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai left Jerusalem he established his academy in Jabneh but his private residence was in a place called &#x201C;Barur Chail&#x201D; and there he was followed by his disciples. It seems that when Rabban Gamliel II (the son of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel who was killed before the destruction of the temple) grew of age and Rabban Jochanan realized that he was fit to occupy the position of his father in the leadership of Jewish life, he resigned his position of &#x201C;Nasi.&#x201D; He gave this office to Rabban Gamliel and he settled in &#x201C;Barur Chail.&#x201D; But even there he was followed by many people who did not leave him till the day of his death.</p>
<p>As the days of Rabban Jochanan neared their end, he regretted the oncoming death. When his disciples came to visit him, he wept in their presence. They asked him: &#x201C;Rabbi, why do you weep?&#x201D; and he replied, &#x201C;When a man has to appear for trial before a king whose rule is only temporary, whose kindness is passing and whose anger does not last, he is seized by terror; how much more understandable is the terror which seizes one who has to be tried by the King of kings whose rule is eternal, whose anger is everlasting and whose kindness endures forever.&#x201D;</p>

<chapter>
<title>The Colleagues of R. Jochanan ben Zakkai</title>
<p>N<small>UMEROUS PROMINENT SCHOLARS</small> survived the suffering of the destruction in Jerusalem together with Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. Some of them escaped the city at an earlier or later date and together they settled in Jabneh.</p>
<p>One of these scholars, the closest to R. Jochanan, was Rabbi Zadok ben Elazar. This was the same Rabbi Zadok for the healing of whom Rabban Jochanan asked for the services of a doctor. Just as Rabban Jochanan visualized the destruction of the temple forty years before it occurred even so did Rabbi Zadok fast every day for forty years that the temple might not be destroyed.</p>
<p>It is told that when Rabban Jochanan presented Rabbi Zadok before Vespasian in the Roman camp outside of Jerusalem he showed more reverence to Rabbi Zadok than he did to Vespasian. When Vespasian noted this he asked, &#x201C;What distinction has this man?&#x201D; and Rabban Jochanan replied: &#x201C;I can assure you that had there been another one like him you could not have triumphed over our people even if you had brought twice as many soldiers as you did.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Vespasian further asked, &#x201C;Wherein lies his strength?&#x201D; and Rabban Jochanan answered, &#x201C;For forty years he neither ate nor drank anything more than the juice of one fig which he consumed every night and after this he taught a host of disciples all day. You can therefore realize that had there been another like him, God would have had to spare our city for the sake of two such holy men.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is further told that once, when Rabbi Zadok was a priest in the temple, he saw two young priests hurrying to the service. In their haste they tried to overtake each other and when the nimbler one gained the lead he was stabbed by the one that trailed behind. Rabbi Zadok then called out in this wise: &#x201C;Hear me oh, Jews. Here you see the body of a slain man and you all learned that when a murdered man is found and it is not known by whom he was killed it is necessary to behead a calf and over it the elders of the city must declare that they are innocent of the blood that was shed, that their hand was not in the crime, nor have they seen it committed. Now there arises the question arises whether the city or the temple has to bring this case, for I alone saw the crime and the law states that one witness is insufficient to condemn a man to death. According to the law it would therefore seem that the identity of the murderer has not been established and it is necessary for the elders to declare their innocence. Now the question whether the city or the temple has to bring this offering, for neither one of the two can conscientiously say &#x201C;our hands did not shed this blood&#x201D;; both the city and the people are guilty and the blood of the murdered man is a blot on both.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Speaking in this vein he aroused all those gathered until they shed tears. When the father of the murdered man later declared that the victim was not killed outright and the dagger with which he was stabbed was therefore not unclean from coming in contact with a dead body, and he thus established that it was unnecessary to bring a sacrifice, because the victim atoned with his blood for the sins of the city, all those gathered rushed at the murderer and in an instant he was annihilated so that nothing remained of him.</p>
<p>It was also told of Rabbi Zadok that R. Gamliel ben R. Simeon (commonly referred to as Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh, he was also Nasi after the death of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai) once gave a feast in his house for the scholars. Rabban Gamliel waited on his guests himself and with his own hand he filled their beakers. He handed the first beaker of wine to Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus but Rabbi Eliezer refused it, not wishing to be waited on by Rabban Gamliel. Rabban Gamliel then handed the same beaker to Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania and he accepted it.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer then exclaimed: &#x201C;How can one tolerate that Rabban Gamliel should stand and wait on us while we are sitting down?&#x201D; but Rabbi Joshua answered: &#x201C;One greater than Rabban Gamliel did the same. Our father Abraham was the greatest man of his generation, nevertheless he waited on his guests and served them. Even though his guests were angels, Abraham did not at first know it but thought that they were Arabs. I therefore see no wrong in that Rabban Gamliel serves the students of the Torah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Zadok then arose from his place and said: &#x201C;How much longer will you remain indifferent to the honor of God while you devote yourself to the honor due to man? God causes the winds to blow and the rain to fall, he fructifies the earth and provides for every creature according to its needs. All this he does not only for the just but also for the wicked and the idolaters. Is it not more than right that scholars like you should be served by Rabban Gamliel himself?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sometime later Rabbi Zadok saw the ruins of the temple and, turning his eyes heavenward, he said: &#x201C;Creator of the world, You have done well. You have destroyed Your city, You burned Your temple and You remain calm as if You were not concerned.&#x201D; That same night Rabbi Zadok had a dream. In his dream he saw God mourning over the ruins of the temple while the angels were weeping bitterly. He then became convinced that God mourned the destruction just as the people did.</p>
<p>When the leaders of the people realized that the laws and customs of Judaism were becoming forgotten they called all the scholars together on a certain day, and each of them recounted the laws and traditions as he remembered them. Rabbi Zadok testified in every case that a law was doubtful and his words were accepted as law.<sup><xref rid="fn147">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Talmud quotes the opinions of Rabbi Zadok a number of times in substantiation of laws. A maxim of his regarding the worth of the Torah, which later became popular among scholars, is also quoted. Rabbi Zadok used to say: You must not make the Torah as a crown to magnify yourself nor as a spade wherewith to dig.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zadok had a son, Rabbi Elazar, who was prominent during the decade preceding the destruction of the temple. His son devoted himself to commerce mostly and he obtained the title of Rabbi although he did not found an academy. When Rabbi Zadok was cured after his long fast through the intercession of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai with Vespasian, his son said to him: &#x201C;Give your healers their reward in this world that they may make no demands upon you in the world to come.&#x201D; Instead of paying them with gold, Rabbi Zadok taught them to calculate on their fingers and also the rules of the calculation of weights.<sup><xref rid="fn148">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar also quoted his father as saying: &#x201C;To what may one compare a just man in this world? One may compare him to a tree which grows in a clean place but whose branches extend over an unclean place. If those branches are cut off the tree and its roots continue to remain clean. Even so does God bring affliction on just men that they may be worthy of the pleasures of the world to come.</p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>Rabbi Zechariah ben HaKatzav was another colleague of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. His name is mentioned in connection with a situation which throws some light on the moral and social relationships of that time.</p>
<p>A woman who is held captive by the Gentiles in order to obtain a ransom may continue to live with her husband after she is released. A woman who is captured with the intention of being killed is forbidden to live with her husband after she is released, for we are justified in assuming that she submitted to the Gentiles in order to save her life. If a city has been occupied by an army, the wives of all the priests may not continue to live with their husbands unless they bring witnesses that testify to their purity; even if the witnesses are slaves or women servants their testimony is trustworthy. Untrustworthy is one&#x2019;s own testimony, for one may not testify on his own behalf. Then Rabbi Zechariah said: &#x201C;I swear by the sanctity of the temple that as long as the soldiers were in Jerusalem I did not let my wife out of my sight.&#x201D; But the other scholars told him that no one might be trusted when testifying on his own behalf.<sup><xref rid="fn149">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He was thus given a theoretical answer without being told what to do and the outcome of the case remains unknown. From other instances in the Talmud we learn that Rabbi Zechariah always sought to be lenient in such circumstances. Thus we find another case <sup><xref rid="fn150">4)</xref></sup> of a young girl who was held as hostage among the Gentiles of Ascalon. When she returned from her captivity her family disowned her. There then appeared witnesses who testified that the girl was not violated while in captivity, but the members of her family refused to believe their testimony. Then the scholars said to them: If you believe that the girl was held captive then you must accept the testimony of the witnesses; if you refuse to believe them, then you have no grounds to believe that she was captive.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zechariah&#x2019;s name also appears on other occasions. Once the scholars were trying to determine a case of the inheritance of a daughter who had no brothers. In relation to this case the Talmud states that the law was established according to the opinion of Rabbi Zechariah.</p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>Among the colleagues of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai there was also Rabbi Nechunia (or Jochanan) ben Gudgada. He was a Levite in the temple and was in charge of the gates. He was a very pious man, and even after the temple no longer existed he continued to observe scrupulously all the regulations pertaining to purity. In the performance of his office he was very severe and while still gate keeper of the temple he said that any Levite who becomes confused during the singing at the service deserves to be punished by death. When Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania once wanted to aid him in closing the temple gates he refused the assistance for the same reasons.</p>
<p>The opinions of Rabbi Nechunia ben Gudgada, which he expressed at the time that all the scholars were questioned regarding the traditions of the laws, are interesting and characteristic of the times. He declared that a deaf girl who was given in marriage by her father might be divorced by her husband. Until that time it was accepted that a deaf woman might be divorced, but the case was not clear if the woman was given in marriage by her father. Until then it was also the accepted rule that if a man stole wood and used it in the construction of a building that the building be destroyed and the wood returned to its owner.<sup><xref rid="fn151">5)</xref></sup> But Rabbi Nechunia ruled that it was only necessary to pay the value of the article that was stolen. Similarly he ruled that a person who sacrifices a stolen animal as a sin offering has discharged his duty so long as it remains unknown that the animal was stolen.</p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>One of the most outstanding contemporaries of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was Rabbi Nechunia ben Hakanah. Long before the destruction of the temple he was recognized as the leader of his own academy which remained a separate school and was not under the jurisdiction of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai.</p>
<p>It is told that whenever Rabbi Nechunia went to his academy and returned home from it he would repeat a prayer whose contents have become immortalized and which serves as an example for later generations. When asked about his prayer he said: &#x201C;When I go to the academy I pray to God to save me from error; that I should have no occasion to be angered at my comrades, nor that they should have to be angered with me. I pray that in my teachings I should not declare the clean to be unclean and the unclean to be clean, and that I should not be put to shame either in this world or in the world to come. When I leave the academy I thank the Creator for all that happened to me during the day; especially do I thank Him for this that it is my share to sit in a house of learning and not among the sinful, the idle and the scornful, for my way leads to eternal life and their way leads to hell.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Nechunia ben Hakanah was already an old man during the time of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. When his disciples asked him what he had done to deserve to be rewarded with long life he answered them: &#x201C;I never sought to gain honor through the shame of another; I also never went to sleep until I knew that there was no person harboring ill will against me and I was never stingy with my money.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Although Rabbi Nechunia headed an academy of his own there always existed the most friendly relations between him and Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. This was clearly illustrated at the time when Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai expounded to his disciples the meaning of the Biblical verse &#x201C;Justice exalteth a people but the disgrace of nations is a sin.&#x201D; (Proverbs, 14:34.) Everyone was asked to express his opinion of the meaning of the verse. At the request of Rabban Jochanan, Rabbi Nechunia also stated his interpretation whereupon Rabban Jochanan said to his pupils: &#x201C;I favor the opinion of Rabbi Nechunia more than my own and more than the opinions which you rendered.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A maxim of Rabbi Nechunia which he frequently repeated was characteristic of the man. He was wont to say: &#x201C;Whoever assumes the yoke of the Torah is relieved of the yoke of government and of the yoke of worldly occupations.&#x201D; From this saying we may conclude that he was wealthy and was not worried with finding the means of livelihood; however, there is no documentary substantiation for such an opinion.</p>
<p>Of all his numerous decisions in matters pertaining to law there remained only one rule about the laws affecting the Day of Atonement. &#x201C;Just as one who desecrates the Sabbath has forfeited his life but is free from payment, even so does one who desecrates the Day of Atonement forfeit his life but is free from payment.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn152">6)</xref></sup> This statement is interpreted by some to mean, that a person who has done work on the Sabbath is to be condemned to death but such a person no longer has to observe the Sabbath and is not to be punished for any further violations of the Sabbath, similarly one is to be punished for the desecration of the Day of Atonement, but until such punishment is meted out the offender is no longer bound by the regulations of the day. Another interpretation of his statement is that a person who has forfeited his life for desecrating the Sabbath does not in addition have to offer a sacrifice for the atonement of his sin; similarly, one who desecrated the Day of Atonement does not have to offer such a sacrifice even though the punishment for his transgression is in the hands of God.</p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, the pupil of Rabbi Nechunia, learned much from his teacher. Pondering the mysteries of life, he cited numerous sayings of his master especially in respect to the interpretation of various texts. He thus proved the power of repentance by the example of Pharaoh. Pharaoh asked Moses, &#x201C;Who is God that I should listen to his voice?&#x201D; but later, when he was being engulfed by the waters of the sea he realized that the God of Moses was the true God and in order to gain favor in His eyes he cried out, &#x201C;Who is like you among the gods oh Lord&#x0021;&#x201D; God therefore saved him from the sea and he later became king of Nineveh. When the prophet Jonah came to Nineveh to announce the word of God, Pharaoh already understood that he spoke in the name of the God of Moses, who may not be resisted. He therefore arose from his throne and rent his clothes; he put on sack cloth and ashes and commanded his people to fast in order to appease the anger of God.</p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas was another contemporary of Rabban Jochanan. The mention that is made of him in both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud indicates that he played an important role in codifying the Halacha. Ordinarily he was inclined to lenience where other scholars advocated severity. He frequently argued against the opinions of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai, Akabia ben Mahalalel and Rabbi Chanina, deputy of the High Priest, and his opinions touched on all matters of Jewish life.</p>
<p>The respect in which he was held by the other scholars is seen from the fact that in his later years, when old age and failing eyesight made it impossible for him to come to the academy, the scholars came to his home to discuss the various laws. Being a rich man, the Talmud relates that he seated his guests on couches of gold. The attitude of that time toward learning is portrayed in the story of Rabbi Dosa who told that the mother of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania was in the habit of bringing her infant son to the Synagogue in his crib in order that he might absorb the words of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn153">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A maxim of Rabbi Dosa concerning the proper conduct for men has been immortalized by the people. It said: Morning sleep and midday wine and children&#x2019;s talk and spending time with the vulgar drive a man from the world.</p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>The most interesting of the scholars of that time was undoubtedly Rabbi Nachum of Gimso. He was a native of the town Gimso which was located east of Lud. This town is mentioned in Chronicles II as having been conquered by Philistines from the Jews during the reign of king Ahaz. Since Nachum was in the habit of saying &#x201C;All is for the best&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05DD; &#x05D6;&#x05D5; &#x05DC;&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D4;</span>) on every occasion, the name of his native town assumed a double significance, and the appelation &#x201C;the man of Gimso&#x201D; may have referred to his native town or to his oft used maxim.</p>
<p>None of his teachings have come down to us although it is proudly mentioned that he was the teacher of Rabbi Akiba.<sup><xref rid="fn154">8)</xref></sup> But his whole life is described as a continuous series of miracles which occurred to him, and because of his worth these also affected the whole people.</p>
<p>It is told that even when the worst befell him he would say &#x201C;It is for the best.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn155">9)</xref></sup> Once, when the emperor was angry and threatened new decrees, the Jews decided to appease his anger with a gift. But there was no one whom they could send, for the messenger was in danger of losing his life in case the emperor refused the gift. They therefore decided to send it with Nachum of Gimso, feeling certain that if he would be the bearer of the gift it would be accepted and he would succeed in obtaining the desired concessions.</p>
<p>The Jews of his city thereupon filled a box with diamonds and pearls to send to the emperor. While on his way, Nachum stopped overnight in a hostelry which harbored thieves. The thieves removed the diamonds and the pearls and filled the box with sand. But when Nachum saw this he was not afraid but said, &#x201C;It is for the best,&#x201D; for he felt certain that God would so order it that the king would accept the sand instead of the diamonds.</p>
<p>Thus he proceeded on his way until he arrived in the royal city and when it was discovered that the gift which he brought was ordinary sand there was great anger against the Jews, for it seemed as if they were mocking the emperor.</p>
<p>But then there appeared the prophet Elijah in the guise of a courier and he calmed the assembly by saying: &#x201C;I think that the Jews have sent a very valuable gift to the emperor, for the sand in this box is the same sand that was used by Abraham who shot it from his bow at the four kings of the host of Kedarlaomer when they captured Lot.&#x201D; It so happened that the emperor was then engaged in a war with a neighboring country which he could not conquer. The sand which Nachum brought in the box was therefore tried on the enemy and its effects were so marvelous that the enemy was immediately subdued. When the emperor realized the value of the sand which the Jews sent him he decided to do kind deeds to Jews. The box was filled with diamonds and pearls from the emperor&#x2019;s treasury and Nachum was sent back in great honor.</p>
<p>On his return trip he again lodged in the same hostelry and everyone marvelled that he was still alive. When they asked him what happened he told them everything and also of the marvellous nature of the sand.</p>
<p>The people immediately filled large boxes with the same sand and took these to the emperor. They told the emperor that Nachum was carrying diamonds and pearls as a gift for him but that these were stolen and sand from their house was substituted instead. As proof they brought the boxes filled with the same sand.</p>
<p>Then the emperor commanded that this be investigated and when it was proved that the sand which they brought did not possess the same virtues as the sand which Nachum brought they were accused of trying to deceive the king and were sentenced to death.</p>
<p>It is also told that in his old age Nachum became blind and lost the use of his arms and legs. He lay in an old shack which was ready to tumble any minute. The shack was also infested with vermin and the bed posts were placed in bowls of water to prevent the vermin from climbing up. Once his pupils wanted to remove his bed from the house but he commanded them to remove the furnishings first, for they could feel certain that as long as he remained within the house it would not collapse. They did as he commanded them and the minute that they carried him out on his bed the house collapsed.</p>
<p>His disciples thereupon said to him: &#x201C;Is it possible that a just man like you should suffer such a bitter end?&#x201D;</p>
<p>To this Nachum replied: &#x201C;Children, I have well deserved it. Once, as I was going to the house of my father-in-law, leading three donkeys loaded with food and drink, a poor man came to me and asked, that I should give him food. But I said to him: Wait until I unload the donkey. But before I had time to unload the donkey, the poor man fell down dead from hunger. It was then that I cursed myself that my eyes which had no pity on his eyes should become blind and that all my limbs which did not hasten to feed the poor should become crippled.&#x201D;</p>

<title>Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa</title>
<p>F<small>ROM WHAT WE KNOW</small> of the material circumstances of Rabban Jochanan and his contemporaries we may assume that the poorest of them all was Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa. But he was also the most pious and the miracles which are said to have occurred to him transcend even the wondrous adventures of Nachum of Gimso. It was commonly believed that the whole generation of which Chanina was a contemporary lived only through his grace.</p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina knew poverty long before the destruction of the temple. He lived in the town of Arab in Galilee and engaged in stone cutting. This was hard work but did not suffice to feed Rabbi Chanina with bread and he had to content himself with a measure of carobs from one Sabbath till the next. <sup><xref rid="fn156">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina was a disciple of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai who lived in Arab for some time. He did not head any academy and no legal decisions are quoted in his name, but he was held by everyone to be a great saint and whenever people became involved in trouble they came to Rabbi Chanina that he should pray for them, for every one believed that his word carried great weight with the Lord.</p>
<p>He was also exemplary in his conduct before God and man and he frequently said: &#x201C;Everyone whose fear of sin comes before his wisdom, his wisdom endures; everyone whose deeds are more than his wisdom, his wisdom endures; everyone who pleases mankind with his deeds also pleases God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn157">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his town Rabbi Chanina saw many people going on their pilgrimage to Jerusalem carrying in their hands gifts for the temple and he was grieved that whenever he went to Jerusalem he went empty handed, for he had nothing to bring. But once, while at his work, he saw a beautiful large stone which was fit to lie before the temple so that the pilgrims who come there for the feast days may sit on it and rest. He took out this stone and polished it smooth, then he vowed to bring it as a gift to the temple.</p>
<p>But he could not carry the stone from Arab to Jerusalem alone. He decided to hire laborers and he called five men, which was the number needed to carry it to the city. But these men asked for one hundred &#x201C;Selaim.&#x201D; He would gladly have paid this sum and even more, but since he did not possess even a single coin he said to them: &#x201C;Where shall I take one hundred &#x2018;Selaim&#x2019; when I do not possess even half that sum? But if you will help me carry the stone without compensation you may have whatever reward is due to me for this good deed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The men thereupon went away and left the stone on the ground. But God could no longer look at the sorrow of Rabbi Chanina and he sent him five other men who asked for only five &#x201C;Selaim&#x201D; for the labor of transporting the stone; they agreed to do so on condition that Rabbi Chanina should help them carry the stone. Rabbi Chanina believed that he would be able to borrow the five &#x201C;Selaim&#x201D; wherewith to pay the laborers as soon as he arrived in Jerusalem and he therefore agreed to the price. But the work did not last long, for as soon as Rabbi Chanina touched the stone they all found themselves in Jerusalem. When he began looking for the men in order to pay them, they had vanished and he could find them no longer. <sup><xref rid="fn158">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina&#x2019;s wife was said never to have complained about their poverty and bore all the suffering quietly. Only once did she depart from her patience and said to her husband: &#x201C;How long must we suffer in poverty? Ask the Heavenly One that He should give you something on account of what is coming to you in the world to come.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina heeded her words and prayed to God. There then appeared a hand which gave him the golden leg of a table. That night he saw in his dream how all the just men sit in Paradise about golden tables each of which has three legs, only he and his wife sit by a table which only has two legs. He awoke very much disturbed and said to his wife: &#x201C;Would you rather see all other just men in the world to come sit about whole tables while we sit by a broken one?&#x201D;</p>
<p>He therefore prayed to God that the gift be taken back and the same hand appeared and took it. The friends of Rabbi Chanina considered the second marvel to be even greater than the first.</p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina&#x2019;s wife had a neighbor who derided her for her poverty and because of her she was in the habit of lighting a fire in the oven every Friday. Although she had nothing to cook or bake, she wanted that neighbor to see the smoke rising from the chimney and to believe that nothing was lacking for the Sabbath. But this neighbor understood the trick and she once came to Rabbi Chanina&#x2019;s house to show his wife that she was not fooled. As she knocked on the door, Rabbi Chanina&#x2019;s wife opened it, but before the neighbor could enter she ran and hid in the attic in order not to meet her. When the neighbor came in she saw the oven full of bread and the barrel filled with dough and she called the wife of Rabbi Chanina to come and take the bread out of the oven before it was burned.</p>
<p>Still another story is related of the wife of Rabbi Chanina. It is said that Rabbi Jochanan once traveled on a ship and he saw floating upon the water a basket decorated with pearls and diamonds and surrounded by all kinds of rare fish. One man jumped into the water to retrieve the basket, but a fish came up and tried to bite off his legs. The people on the boat poured vinegar on the fish until it swam away and then a voice from heaven was heard saying: &#x201C;What do you want with this basket? It belongs to the wife of Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa and in the world to come she will weave from it the decorations for the praying shawls of the just men.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn159">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We already told that in time of calamity everyone turned to Rabbi Chanina. Thus it happened that the daughter of Nechunia the well digger once fell into a well which her father dug. People at once ran to Rabbi Chanina that he should advise how to raise the girl from the well.</p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina at once declared that this event will have a happy ending, then he said: &#x201C;Go home. She is out of the well.&#x201D; The people asked him: &#x201C;How do you know? Are you a seer?&#x201D; But Rabbi Chanina said: &#x201C;I am not a seer but I feel certain that since the just man Nechunia occupied himself with digging wells so that the pilgrims to Jerusalem may have water to drink, God will not permit a child of so just a man to be drowned in one of her father&#x2019;s wells.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn160">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was because of such events that the faith of the people in the efficacy of the prayers of Rabbi Chanina increased. In case of sickness they came to him that he should pray for the sick and when he was engaged in prayer everyone could see that he was so deeply immersed in it that had a snake wound itself about his feet he would not have been aware of it. He also immediately foretold the success of his prayer whether the sick will get well again. When he was asked how he could tell the outcome of his prayer, he said: When I utter the prayer smoothly then I know that it was accepted, but if I have difficulty in praying then I know that it was rejected.</p>
<p>The son of the Nasi, Rabban Gamliel, once fell sick and the Nasi sent two of his outstanding disciples to Rabbi Chanina to ask him that he pray for the cure of the sick person. Rabbi Chanina ascended the roof of his house to be nearer to God while praying. When he descended he told the messengers: &#x201C;You may now go home for the patient is no longer in fever.&#x201D; The messengers noted down the words of Rabbi Chanina and the exact moment at which they were uttered. When they informed Rabban Gamliel he told them that everything happened exactly as Rabbi Chanina said.</p>
<p>Another time the son of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was sick and Rabban Jochanan sent a message to Rabbi Chanina saying: &#x201C;Chanina, my son, pray to God that my son shall remain alive.&#x201D; Rabbi Chanina bowed with his head between his knees and prayed a long time until he suddenly declared that Rabban Jochanan&#x2019;s son will certainly survive. When Rabban Jochanan thanked him for his effort, he also explained to his wife that had he prayed to God himself, even if he had stood with his head between his knees all day, he would have achieved nothing. Rabban Jochanan&#x2019;s wife then asked him: &#x201C;Is Chanina more acceptable to God then you are?&#x201D; But Rabban Jochanan answered: &#x201C;He may not be more acceptable in the eyes of God but he is as a servant in the palace of a king who is closer to the king than all others. I am as a minister of the king who sometimes has to withstand the king&#x2019;s anger and to whom the king may refuse to grant favors.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn161">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among the wondrous legends about Rabbi Chanina it is also told that he was once travelling on his way when a sudden rain began to descend and he was hindered in his journey. He turned his face heavenward and said: &#x201C;Creator of the world&#x0021; The whole world is enjoying the rain, only I am suffering from it.&#x201D; The rain immediately ceased and when Rabbi Chanina arrived at home there was a drought. His conscience plagued him that the rain, which the earth needed so much, had ceased and he further addressed God: &#x201C;The whole world is now suffering only I am glad,&#x201D; and the rain began to descend again. <sup><xref rid="fn162">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of Rabbi Chanina&#x2019;s unusual honesty it is told that a man once passed and left a few hens on his doorstep. Rabbi Chanina then said to his wife: &#x201C;Since the hens are not your own you may not use their eggs.&#x201D; His wife then sold the eggs and with the money she accumulated she bought some goats. When the owner of the hens came to claim them Rabbi Chanina also gave him the goats.</p>
<p>Both before and after the temple was destroyed Rabbi Chanina scrupulously set aside the tithes from all food which came on his table. As he was once eating at the table, all the food suddenly vanished. His wife explained to him that she had borrowed that day&#x2019;s food from a neighbor who probably had not set aside the tithes. Rabbi Chanina decided in his mind to set aside the tithes and the food reappeared on the table. <sup><xref rid="fn163">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>His observance of the tithes was so extreme that even his donkey could tell whether the hay placed before it had been tithed. Once the donkey was stolen and, when the thieves placed hay before it, it refused to eat. Realizing that if they kept the donkey it would starve to death they let it loose and it ran back to Rabbi Chanina. <sup><xref rid="fn164">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is further related that in a certain place there was a poisonous scorpion which bit people and the stricken ones died from its venom. This was told to Rabbi Chanina and he said: &#x201C;Come, show me where this scorpion hides.&#x201D; He was taken to the place and he put his foot over the hole. The scorpion came up to bite him and while doing so it died. Rabbi Chanina then carried the scorpion around in the academy and he said: &#x201C;Now you can see that not the scorpion kills a person but his sins.&#x201D; Seeing this the people said: &#x201C;Woe to the man who meets a scorpion and woe to the scorpion which meets Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Similarly it is told that Rabbi Chanina once met the queen of the evil spirits, Igereth bath Machlath, who goes about accompanied by 180 thousand destroying angels to harm people. Igereth said to Rabbi Chanina, &#x201C;If I had not been warned from heaven not to touch you because of your knowledge of the Torah, I would now do you harm.&#x201D; Rabbi Chanina said to her: &#x201C;If it is true that I am so important in Heaven then I command you never to go again where people live.&#x201D; But she entreated him that he should not entirely drive her out of human habitation and he allowed her two nights every week when she may have power over people (Wednesday and Saturday nights).</p>
<p>Once on a Friday Rabbi Chanina noticed that his daughter was sitting sorrowful and depressed. He asked her, &#x201C;What happened, my daughter, that you are so sorrowful?&#x201D; and she replied, &#x201C;By mistake I filled the Sabbath lamp with vinegar instead of oil.&#x201D; But Rabbi Chanina comforted her and said, &#x201C;Why do you worry? God who commanded that oil should burn can also cause vinegar to give light.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is related that the vinegar burned all day Saturday and lasted until the Havdalah was lit from it.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Chanina was about to die he raised his hands to God and said: &#x201C;Dear God, you know that all my life I never made the least use of your beautiful world.&#x201D;&#x2026; After his death it was said in his praise that he never uttered a falsehood. He was also the last of the people who despised words and preferred deeds, and with his death there broke the chain of piety.</p>
<p>Of the importance of charity it was later told that he held an opinion differing from that of the other scholars of his generation and he said: &#x201C;There is no better charity which can save people from Gehenna than the Torah itself.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn165">10)</xref></sup></p>

<title>Rabban Gamliel II of Jabneh</title>
<p>W<small>HEN&#x2014;ACCORDING TO TRADITION</small>&#x2014;Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai died at the age of 120 years he was succeeded as Nasi of the Sanhedrin by Rabban Gamliel, the son of Rabban Simeon who was killed during the rebellion against Rome, and grandson of Rabban Gamliel the Elder. Rabban Gamliel the Elder was a grandson of Hillel. Rabban Gamliel II was thus the fifth descendant in line to Hillel.</p>
<p>Being a descendant of Hillel, Rabban Gamliel was looked up to as a scion of the Royal House of David, and as long as one such remained, no one doubted his rights to the office of Nasi. But his assumption of this office was probably delayed because at the time that his father was killed, Rabban Gamliel was a young and sickly child and he could not be entrusted with such a responsible office. Assumption of the position of Nasi was also subject to the approval of the government and therefore some time elapsed before the Roman authorities were ready to consent to the appointment of a Nasi whose father lost his life in a revolution.</p>
<p>Throughout the time that Rabban Gamliel was Nasi the Sanhedrin was maintained in Jabneh with a membership of seventy-two, <sup><xref rid="fn166">1)</xref></sup> and although Rabban Gamliel traelled extensively and issued his decisions in many places he always stressed that Jabneh must remain the local point of Jewish life. Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai previously strived to attain the same end. But it is interesting to know that the relations between Rabban Gamliel and some of the outstanding disciples of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai were frequently strained. One of these disciples, Rabbi Elazar ben Arach, was persuaded by his wife to leave Jabneh. He expected that a great number of scholars would follow him because of his prominence. It is told of him that when he once expounded before his master the mysteries of the &#x201C;Divine Chariot,&#x201D; a fiery cloud descended from heaven and hid both of them from the eyes of the passers-by and a host of angels descended to hear his exposition. But in spite of all the reverence, which these legends seem to indicate was accorded to him, Elazar ben Arach was later forgotten and no one was concerned with him.</p>
<p>While other scholars of that time attempted to set up academies in various cities of Palestine in an endeavor to spread the knowledge of the Torah throughout the land, Rabban Gamliel sought to concentrate all of these efforts in Jabneh. He met considerable difficulties in attaining this aim and he was compelled to resort to forceful methods and a stubborn insistence on his decisions; these in turn frequently served to alienate from him the sympathies of the followers of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. He then would go on protracted trips to places far and near to investigate the life of the Jews, their economic welfare and their religious life. He was thus frequently to be seen in Jericho, in Acco or in Kezib and wherever he went he spoke his word in all matters of Jewish life.</p>
<p>Of his relations with other people it is told that he was very careful not to cause the slightest suffering to anyone. When he discovered how many rules one must observe and that it was almost impossible to avoid conflict with friends and neighbors, he wept. In general he was a very kind person and prone to tears. When a neighboring woman lost her only son and her weeping was heard for many nights, Rabban Gamliel could not restrain his commiseration and wept until his eye lashes were soft. <sup><xref rid="fn167">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But in his execution of his duties as Nasi he showed not the least weakness. Here he ruled with a strong hand and was ready to crush all opposition by excommunicating or driving out the opponent without considering the position or his relationship to the antagonist. Rabban Gamliel wanted his decisions to be final and he did not permit any decisions to be made without his consent. He therefore ordered an investigation of the opinions of all his pupils and whenever it was discovered that one secretly dissented, he was not permitted to enter the academy.</p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel owned much land and other property but he did not have time to devote to its management and he therefore rented these out to tenants. If a tenant lacked the money to buy seed, Rabban Gamliel loaned him the money or the seed which was to be repaid after the harvest. But when harvest came he always reckoned the debt according to the lower price. Thus if the price of the seed was lower at harvest time than it was at the time that the seed was loaned, he asked to be repaid the harvest season price; similarly if the price went up, he asked for the lower price at the time that the seed was loaned. Although the law did not require such treatment of tenants, he did this in order to prevent suspicion that he was profiting from his tenants.</p>
<p>Being a wealthy man, Rabban Gamliel also owned numerous slaves whom he treated kindly according to the regulations of the Torah. He was particularly attached with a strong bond of friendship to his slave Tobi who, he boasted, was a scholar of no mean ability. When Tobi died, Rabban Gamliel mourned for him as for a member of his family.</p>
<p>Of his relationship to Tobi it is told that Rabban Gamliel wanted to free him but could find no cause for doing so. When once he accidentally blinded Tobi in one eye, Rabban Gamliel was overjoyed, for this would give him an opportunity to free the slave according to the rule of the Torah. But when he told this to Rabbi Joshua he was informed that he could not do so because the slave had no witnesses. <sup><xref rid="fn168">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel was also versed in the knowledge of mathematics and astronomy. To derive practical benefits from this knowledge he had a type of telescope made with which he could discern objects at a distance of two thousand ells both on land and on sea. In his house he had numerous drawings of the moon and when ignorant witnesses came to announce the new moon, they could point to the picture most nearly resembling what they saw.</p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel served the people as Nasi for over thirty years and although he was strict in the conduct of his office he was wont to say that his position was not that of a ruler but of a servant. He served faithfully and with devotion. In addition to his labors for the preservation of Judaism while travelling about, his period in office coincided with a difficult time for Jews. New decrees against the Jews were daily issued by the Romans and Rabban Gamliel constantly had to intercede to ameliorate the effects of these decrees.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, Rabban Gamliel spared no opponent in his capacity of Nasi. When Rabbi Eliezer tried to establish a law according to the school of Shammai, he was excommunicated by Rabban Gamliel despite the fact that he was his brother-in-law. The scholars of the academy thereupon sharply criticized Rabban Gamliel for banning so brilliant a man as Rabbi Eliezer. Some time later Rabban Gamliel was travelling on a ship to visit distant Jewish settlements. The ship encountered tremendous waves which threatened to capsize it and Rabban Gamliel understood that this was a punishment for the ban which he imposed on Rabbi Eliezer. He then raised his hands to heaven and said: &#x201C;God knows that I have done so not for the sake of my honor nor for the honor of my household but solely for the honor of God and in order to prevent disputes among Jews.&#x201D; When he finished speaking the sea at once became calm and he safely arrived at his destination.</p>
<p>One of the chief opponents of Rabban Gamliel was Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. Rabbi Joshua was known as a gentle peace loving man. He was always dissatisfied with the innovations of Rabban Gamliel but he was powerless to contradict them because of his great poverty. Rabbi Joshua gained his livelihood from making needles.</p>
<p>At that time there did not yet exist a definitely established calendar. Every month messengers were sent out to observe the appearance of the new moon and even though the scholars could calculate the exact moment of the appearance of the moon, it was prohibited to decide on the day of the new month without the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon. On the basis of such testimony Rabban Gamliel once determined the day of the new year and of all the other holidays of the month of Tishri. But even as the witnesses were testifying to having observed the new moon, Rabbi Joshua felt convinced that their testimony was false for according to all possible calculations it was impossible for the new moon to have appeared. Gathering courage Rabbi Joshua told the Nasi that he was wrong in setting the date of the holidays on the basis of such testimony. This opinion was also supported by other scholars but Rabban Gamliel was adamant and refused to alter his decision. He turned to Rabbi Joshua and said: &#x201C;If you have another calculation of the holidays, then I command you to appear before me carrying your cane and wallet in your hand and your bag on your shoulders on the day which you consider to be the right Day of Atonement.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua was greatly grieved when he heard this, for he was convinced that he was right, and that it was only because of his poverty that the Nasi imposed upon him. Those of the scholars who agreed with him felt likewise. Nevertheless they advised him to do as he was bid for &#x201C;everyone must obey the Nasi and whatever he says must be considered the law.&#x201D; The text of the Torah enjoining the observance of the holidays they interpreted in such a manner as to prove that the court may decide on the exact day. They argued furthermore that no one must allow himself the decision of the Nasi he would also criticize the decisions of all the courts since the times of Moses.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua was thus persuaded by his comrades and on the day which according to his calculation was the Day of Atonement, he came to Jabneh carrying his cane, his wallet and his bag. When Rabban Gamliel saw him coming he was overjoyed, he kissed him on the head and said to him: &#x201C;Come in peace, my teacher and my pupil&#x2014;my teacher in learnedness and my pupil in obedience.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But in spite of the apparent reconciliation, a feeling of bitterness rankled in the heart of Rabbi Joshua since this event. He believed that he was humiliated because of his poverty. This occurrence also engendered an unspoken bitterness among other members of the Sanhedrin who resented the arbitrary behavior of their Nasi. But they stifled their opposition until another dispute arose between Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Joshua.</p>
<p>One of the pupils came to ask whether the reciting of the evening prayer (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;</span>) was obligatory or voluntary. Rabbi Joshua told him that it was voluntary and one could do as he chose. The same pupil then asked this question of Rabban Gamliel who decided that the reciting of the &#x201C;Maariv&#x201D; was obligatory. The pupil then asked: &#x201C;How is it that Rabbi Joshua declared it to be voluntary?&#x201D; and Rabban Gamliel answered: &#x201C;Wait until all the scholars come to the academy and we will discuss this matter.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When all the scholars gathered Rabban Gamliel declared, &#x201C;I have ordained that the reciting of the evening prayer is obligatory&#x201D;; saying this he turned to the assembled, &#x201C;is anyone opposed to this decision?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No one is opposed,&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua answered. Upon hearing this Rabban Gamliel said, &#x201C;Joshua, stand up and a witness will testify that you have ordered otherwise before.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua obeyed and arose; he stood for a long time before Rabban Gamliel told him to return to his place. The other scholars could no longer tolerate the overbearing attitude of the Nasi; there was an uproar of protest against his conduct and the impeachment of Rabban Gamliel from his office was taken to a vote. <sup><xref rid="fn169">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When this became known, there appeared hundreds of others whom Rabban Gamliel previously expelled from the academy, and it was necessary to add 300 benches in the academy. Afterward they began to choose another Nasi instead of Rabban Gamliel. When the qualifications of all the candidates were considered it became apparent that Rabbi Joshua could not succeed Rabban Gamliel because the whole commotion arose on his account. Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus would have been a likely candidate but he was an angry person and a follower of the school of Shammai. Rabbi Akiba could not be considered because he was not descended from aristocracy; no one knew his origin and it was rumored that he was descended from proselytes. All eyes therefore turned to Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, who was the equal of Rabban Gamliel in scholarship; he was also a descendant of an aristocratic priestly family, he possessed great wealth and was recognized by the Roman rulers.</p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel remained impeached for only a short time. It seems that only a few days passed before he was reinstated. The sudden outburst of the scholars against his severe conduct produced such a change in him that everyone was moved to pity. When the scholars saw that the aristocratically reared Rabban Gamliel bowed without complaint before the will of the people and that he did not break with the academy, from the presidency of which he was removed, but immediately adapted himself to his new status and took his place among the other pupils as an equal, they realized that they were overhasty and immediately considered a reconciliation.</p>
<p>Only then was it realized what noble traits Rabban Gamliel possessed. He was terribly humiliated; no one even thought of sparing the honor of the Nasi&#x2019;s family which derived, through Hillel, from king David; only a day before everyone bowed before him, and suddenly the same people turned against him. Nevertheless he accepted the verdict of the people and did not absent himself from the academy for even one hour, although he fully realized that his situation was a very difficult one, for all his previous decisions would be reconsidered and all of his disciples of the past would attempt to prove them to be wrong.</p>
<p>But instead of dwelling on what happened to him he considered his behavior toward others and realized that he conducted himself too severely. He then went to Rabbi Joshua to ask his forgiveness. When he saw the darkened walls of the low narrow house in which Rabbi Joshua lived, he said, &#x201C;from the walls of your house one can tell your occupation.&#x201D; Believing that this was said with the intent to slight him, Rabbi Joshua answered, &#x201C;Woe to the generation which has a leader like you, for you have no understanding for the suffering of the scholars and you do not know how they gain their livelihood.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel said to him, &#x201C;Now that I came to you, forgive me&#x0021; Do so for the sake of the honor of my family.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua was deeply touched at these words and readily became reconciled. Then Rabbi Akiba said to Rabbi Joshua: &#x201C;We did all this for your sake; tomorrow let us both go to visit Rabban Gamliel.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the newly elected Nasi, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, heard this, he declared that he wanted to accompany them to inform Rabban Gamliel of his readiness to resign.</p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel was thus returned to his office and Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was made head of the court. They divided their duties among themselves. Rabban Gamliel expounded the law on two Sabbaths in succession and Rabbi Elazar expounded on the third Sabbath. It seems that since that time Rabban Gamliel interested himself more with the occupations of his pupils. When Rabbi Joshua told him that two of his disciples, Rabbi Elazar Chisma and Rabbi Jochanan ben Gudgada, could calculate the number of drops of water in the sea but could not afford bread to eat or a garment to wear, Rabban Gamliel wanted to give them positions in the academy from which they could earn their livelihood. For some reason they refused these positions.</p>
<p>Peace was thus re-established in the academy of Jabneh and Rabban Gamliel remained Nasi until his death. His later conduct also indicates that he relented some of his severity and if he treated someone more harshly than the occasion deserved, it evoked no protest. Meantime the decrees of Rome became more severe and Rabban Gamliel was frequently compelled to journey to Rome to intercede for the Jews and to effect the revocation of some decree or, at least, to ameliorate its effects. He was often accompanied by some of his comrades on these trips and he was invariably successful in the accomplishment of his mission. His aristocratic bearing and his fluent Greek speech gained for him the confidence of the court and of the highest officials of the empire. <sup><xref rid="fn170">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his travels he often visited Jerusalem and when he once saw a fox on the site of the Holy of Holies he wept bitterly. This was reported to the Roman authorities who considered it a sign of disloyalty and wanted to have him killed. But a Roman friend of Rabban Gamliel came to the gate of the academy and announced: &#x201C;The man with the prominent nose is sought.&#x201D; Rabban Gamliel understood the hint and remained in hiding for some time until a new government came to power.</p>
<p>While Rabban Gamliel was impeached from his office as Nasi, there began a special investigation of all the innovations which he introduced into Jewish life. The scholars gathered testimony from all people who saw or heard of the customs of previous generations. On that day there were adopted many rules on matters that were previously in dispute. In some matters the followers of the school of Hillel decided according to the opinion of the school of Shammai; other laws were given an entirely new interpretation. But no law that was previously disputed was left in doubt on that day.</p>
<p>Two of the laws that were discussed that day throw light on the opinions of the scholars and on their ability to adapt themselves to changed conditions. There is a text in the Torah which says that &#x201C;an Ammonite or a Moabite may not come in the congregation of the Lord.&#x201D; But these two nations were no longer in existence at that time and those who were still called by these names were derived from other nations who settled in these lands during the wars and the migration of nations.</p>
<p>On the day that Rabban Gamliel was impeached there arose one of the pupils, Jehudah the Ammonite proselyte, and asked: &#x201C;What about me? May I mingle with the Jews?&#x201D; Rabban Gamliel said that he must not, but Rabbi Joshua ruled to the contrary. When Rabban Gamliel insisted on the literal meaning of the text, Rabbi Joshua said to him: &#x201C;Have the Ammonites and Moabites of old remained in their lands? Has not Sanherib confused the nations of the earth a long time ago?&#x201D;</p>
<p>The explanation of Rabbi Joshua was accepted by all scholars and they permitted Jehudah, the Ammonite proselyte, to consider himself a Jew.</p>
<p>Another question concerned the inclusion of the Song of Songs and of Ecclesiastes in the Scriptures. The followers of the school of Shammai particularly objected to Ecclesiastes on the ground that the reader may misunderstand its words and may think that it has no religious message. Later Rabbi Akiba declared that there were no differences of opinion regarding the Song of Songs, for &#x201C;all eternity is worth less than the day on which the Song of Songs was given to the Jews,&#x201D; but the argument centered solely on Ecclesiastes.<xref rid="fn171">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>An important regulation of Rabban Gamliel was that relating to the Sabbatical year. According to a previous rule it was prohibited to cultivate the fields even on the sixth year immediately after &#x201C;Shavuoth.&#x201D; Rabban Gamliel removed this restriction and permitted cultivation until the New Year. He also stabilized the prayers at three times a day. The exact order of the prayers, which were then accepted as taking the place of sacrifices, was determined in his academy. With the aid of two disciples, Simeon of Pakula and Samuel the Small, the order of &#x201C;Shemone Esrei&#x201D; was determined and it was ruled to be the duty of every Jew to recite these three times daily.</p>
<p>The benediction of God as the &#x201C;builder of Jerusalem&#x201D; was introduced into the blessings pronounced after eating. Rabban Gamliel also tried to determine the blessings to be pronounced over various kinds of food and, although his comrades did not agree with all of his definitions, he nevertheless consistently clung to his opinions.</p>
<p>The Roman government seems to have realized at that time that it would not subdue the Jewish people unless it could control its spirit. The government then sent two educated Gentiles, who were to pretend conversion, to study the Torah from Rabban Gamliel. The two arrived in Jabneh and studied everything. After they learned what they needed they declared that they were satisfied with the whole Torah except the rule that it is permissible to derive benefit from robbing a Gentile. Rabban Gamliel then ruled to prohibit this, for in doing so one dishonors the Jewish name. <sup><xref rid="fn172">6)</xref></sup> Worthy of mention is also the regulation of Rabban Gamliel that every Jew must explain to his household the significance of Pesach, Matzo and the bitter herbs, else he has not fulfilled the duties of the day.</p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel also introduced a regulation regarding the Samaritans (referred to as Kuthim in the Talmud) whom the scholars tried to isolate from the Jews. After he assumed office Rabban Gamliel sought to amend the laws against the Kuthim out of a belief that it would be possible to bring them closer to other Jews. In the war against Rome the Kuthim sided with the Jews and fought side by side with them unlike the Idumeans who betrayed the Jews and frequently allied themselves with the enemy. The Kuthim were therefore looked upon more favorably, and although it was previously said that &#x201C;whoever eats the bread of a Kuthi is like one who eats the flesh of a pig,&#x201D; Rabban Gamliel declared that a divorce that was obtained through the testimony of a Kuthi was valid. He also considered grains bought from Kuthim to be &#x201C;Demai&#x201D; in the same manner as were grains bought from an &#x201C;Am Haaretz.&#x201D; <xref rid="fn173">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Later Rabban Gamliel visited the cities of the Kuthim and he realized that they were not true proselytes and were far from Judaism. He then declared that their produce is &#x201C;Vadai&#x201D; (certainly untithed) from which tithes must be offered. He also prohibited Jews to eat meat of their slaughtering.</p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel strongly praised people who have an occupation. Seeing that many Jews will have to leave the soil and turn to trades because of the political situation, he said: &#x201C;Whoever possesses a trade is certain of his existence, even as one is certain of a vineyard which is surrounded by a fence.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Joshua became reconciled but nothing is known of the outcome of his dispute with his brother-in-law, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus. We know of the excommunication but no mention is made of a reconciliation. The stories of the journeys of Rabban Gamliel frequently mention Rabbi Eliezer as a companion. While this may indicate a reconciliation, there is also another legend which says that the wife of Rabbi Eliezer, the sister of Rabban Gamliel, prohibited her husband from bowing at &#x201C;Tachnun.&#x201D; She feared that in doing so he would avenge himself on her brother. But once she forgot to observe him at prayer and he bowed at &#x201C;Tachnun.&#x201D; When she saw this she cried out that he had killed her brother. In the same instant Rabban Gamliel died. He was mourned by the whole people who called him &#x201C;father&#x201D; and his wife &#x201C;mother.&#x201D;</p>

<ftnote id="fn171">&#x002A;) Our scholars held varying opinions relative to the significance of some of the books of the Scriptures. Particular doubt was expressed regarding the books of Ezekiel, Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes and these were almost excluded from the Scriptures. The cause of these disputes are mentioned in numerous places in the Talmud but nowhere are they described in detail. From these it seems that the book of Ezekiel was objected to because of the description of the Divine Chariot whose mysteries must not be discussed before the uninitiated. The Talmud relates that a child (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05E7;&#x05D0;</span>) once pondered the subject of the light of the Divine Chariot and a fire descended from heaven and consumed the child. When the scholars discovered in Ezekiel contradictions to the Torah, one of them, Chanania ben Hiskia, pondered these contradictions so long that he used up three hundred jars of oil before he succeeded in explaining them. Of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes it was said, that they contradicted themselves and several verses in Eccleciastes were held to be deviations in the direction of heresy.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus</title>
<p>F<small>ROM WHAT WAS RELATED</small> in the previous chapter it is to be seen that Rabbi Eliezer was a man of firm convictions from which he would not deviate in the least. This tenacity caused him much trouble and brought him into conflict with the Nasi in spite of the family relationship which existed between them. He also came into disagreement with his comrades of the academy in Jabneh from which he was removed. Later he left Jabneh for Lud where he led an academy of his own founding and he could no longer return to the meetings of the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer was a follower of the school of Shammai in his convictions. He was therefore called &#x201C;Shamuti.&#x201D; Since all the other scholars including the Nasi were adherents of the school of Hillel, Rabbi Eliezer was practically ostracized socially. When the question whether it is permissible to use a &#x201C;winding oven&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05E8; &#x05E9;&#x05DC; &#x05E2;&#x05DB;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;</span>) was discussed, Rabbi Eliezer declared in the affirmative while all the others rendered a negative decision. On that day no decision of Rabbi Eliezer was adopted but he refused to reconsider his opinion and it is told that many miraculous events then took place upholding Rabbi Eliezer&#x2019;s views. A carob tree became uprooted and was flung for a distance of one hundred ells from the place where it grew; a brook suddenly changed the direction of its current; the walls of the academy began to lean and a &#x201C;Bath Kol&#x201D; was heard from heaven declaring the correctness of Rabbi Eliezer&#x2019;s views.<xref rid="fn174">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>But Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania firmly opposed Rabbi Eliezer and he said that no attention need be paid to the wondrous events. Regarding the &#x201C;Bath Kol&#x201D; he declared that the Torah was given for observance on earth and Heaven therefore had no right to interfere in disputes which take place on earth.</p>
<p>Then the scholars burned all those articles which Rabbi Eliezer declared to be clean and they voted on a punishment to be inflicted on Rabbi Eliezer for his stubborness. It was decided that all the scholars should have no dealings with him and Rabbi Akiba was chosen to inform him of the sentence. Rabbi Akiba donned a black garment and sat at a distance of four ells from Rabbi Eliezer. When Rabbi Eliezer asked him: &#x201C;Why is this day different from all other days?&#x201D; Rabbi Akiba answered: &#x201C;Rabbi, I think that your comrades have abandoned you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Rabbi Eliezer tore his garments, he sat down on the ground and wept bitterly. It was said that the sorrow of Rabbi Eliezer was so great that all objects upon which his gaze fell immediately wilted. <sup><xref rid="fn175">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among the disciples of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai, Rabbi Eliezer ranked highest and his master said of him that he was like a well lined with lime which does not lose a single drop of water and that if all the scholars were placed on one side of the scale and Rabbi Eliezer on the other side he would outweigh them all in wisdom. He also adopted the good qualities of his master of whom it was said that he never indulged in idle talk, he never walked even a distance of four ells without phylacteries and without studying the Torah, and he was the first to arrive at the academy and the last to leave. Although R. Eliezer conducted his own academy even before the destruction of Jerusalem, he never proclaimed opinions which he had not heard from his master. When such questions arose he commonly replied that he did not know the answer although he knew the accepted regulations very well. <sup><xref rid="fn176">2)</xref></sup> In this relation he frequently said that whoever debates the decisions of his master or pronounces opinions which he has not heard from his master causes the &#x201C;Shechina&#x201D; to depart from the Jewish people. <sup><xref rid="fn177">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer was a brother-in-law to Rabban Gamliel. He married the Nasi&#x2019;s sister, the learned Ima Salim, of whom it is told that with her wisdom she confounded the injustice of a Gentile judge. But despite this family relationship Rabbi Eliezer frequently conflicted with the Nasi and with his colleagues. All of them became opposed to him and the harmony of the academy was disrupted.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer was sometimes referred to as Rabbi Eliezer the Great, but wherever reference is made to R. Eliezer, without any other title, he was the person referred to. Among his disciples there was also Rabbi Akiba who, even after he attained the greatest position of leadership, never refrained from mentioning that he was a pupil of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Eliezer was also versed in the languages of the neighboring peoples and several times he accompanied Rabban Gamliel on the latter&#x2019;s trips to Rome to plead the cause of the Jews.</p>
<p>Of the manner in which Rabbi Eliezer turned to learning it is told that his father was a wealthy man who owned many fields. The father together with the sons devoted themselves to the cultivation of the land and all of them were rude people, &#x201C;Ame Arotzim,&#x201D; who could not even recite the &#x201C;Shema.&#x201D; When he was over twenty years old, Rabbi Eliezer suddenly decided to leave the fields and to turn to study. He told his plan to his father and old Hyrcanus laughed at him and said: &#x201C;Now you wish to study? Now it is time for you to take a wife and to beget children, then you can raise your children in the knowledge of the Torah.&#x201D; But Rabbi Eliezer would not hear of this and decided to leave his father&#x2019;s house at the earliest opportunity. When a cow, with which he was plowing, broke a leg he was afraid of his father&#x2019;s punishment and fled to Jerusalem to Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Jerusalem he declared his wish to study, but to all the questions that were put to him he could give no answer. Out of pity Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai permitted him to come to his academy even though he was so ignorant. But great was the astonishment of all when they saw his rapid progress. Having fled from his father&#x2019;s house bare handed, Rabbi Eliezer had no money with which to buy food. In great hunger he began to chew earth and this caused his breath to become spoiled. Rabban Jochanan then questioned him regarding his origin and why he fled from his father&#x2019;s house. When Rabbi Eliezer told him all, Rabban Jochanan provided him with food and seeing his great desire to learn he befriended him. Within three years Rabbi Eliezer became the outstanding pupil of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer&#x2019;s father meanwhile met with difficulties and lost all his possessions. When he regained them after some time he learned that Rabbi Eliezer was engaged in studies in Jerusalem. Hyrcanus was then an old man and his sons said to him: &#x201C;See what your son Eliezer did for you. When you were in difficulty he left you and went to Jerusalem to live in luxury, but when the inheritance will be divided he will take his share together with the rest of us. Even if you will write a will disowning him, it will not be heeded, for his master, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai, will rule in his favor.&#x201D;</p>
<p>To this Hyrcanus replied: &#x201C;Do not be afraid, my children, for I will go to Jerusalem and on a Sabbath I will publicly announce that my son Eliezer has no share in my possessions.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Hyrcanus arrived in Jerusalem and Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai heard of it, he commanded that he be honored for the sake of his son and that he be seated among the greatest of the nation; he also commanded Rabbi Eliezer to expound the Torah on that Sabbath.</p>
<p>Old Hyrcanus was surprised to see his son, who till then had been an &#x201C;Am Haaretz,&#x201D; expound before the Nasi and all the scholars. His face glowed with pleasure and he was astonished when he saw Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai kiss Rabbi Eliezer on the head and heard him say: &#x201C;Happy are the holy fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that one such as this was descended from them.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn178">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the lecture Rabbi Eliezer looked at the audience and he saw his father standing among the assembled. He ran up to him and said: &#x201C;How could I expound the Torah while my father was standing up.&#x201D; Hyrcanus then mounted a bench and declared: &#x201C;Be it known that I came to Jerusalem with the special intention of disowning my son Eliezer and of disinheriting him after my death. But now that I see how all the scholars revere him I will assign to him in my will a portion double that of his brothers.&#x201D; To this Rabbi Eliezer replied that he never prayed for fields or for silver and gold but only for the knowledge of the Torah and he therefore refused to take a greater share of the inheritance than his brothers would receive. <sup><xref rid="fn179">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer was by nature of a stubborn and harsh disposition as befits a person who would be a follower of Shammai. He did not allow his pupils to express their opinions of the law in his presence. When one of them once did so, Rabbi Eliezer remarked to his wife: &#x201C;I will not be surprised if this person does not survive a year.&#x201D; Later it so happened and that person died within the year. Rabbi Eliezer&#x2019;s wife then asked him: &#x201C;Are you a prophet that you could foretell his death?&#x201D; but he replied, &#x201C;I am not a prophet nor am I the son of a prophet, but I have received it from my teacher that one who pronounces sentence in the presence of his master has forfeited his life.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn180">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Eliezer became sick he was visited by Rabbi Akiba and his colleagues. Rabbi Eliezer sat in his garden bower and his visitors sat down at a distance of four ells. He turned to them and asked: &#x201C;Why have you come?&#x201D; and they replied: &#x201C;We have come to learn from you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then why did you never come to me before?&#x201D; he asked them, and they said, &#x201C;We never had the time.&#x201D; &#x201C;Seeing that you never found the time to visit me till now,&#x201D; he continued, &#x201C;I would not be surprised if you meet with violent deaths.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba then asked him, &#x201C;I too?&#x201D; and Rabbi Eliezer answered: &#x201C;Your death will be more cruel than theirs.&#x201D;</p>
<p>From this one can see that he never forgave any slight to his self-respect and it was also known that he never went out of his way to show kindness.</p>
<p>It is told that once Rabbi Eliezer approached the &#x201C;Amud&#x201D; (the pulpit of the cantor) to pray for rain and although he pronounced 24 blessings there was no rain. Later Rabbi Akiba rose and merely said: &#x201C;Our Father, our king. We have no other king but You. Our Father, our king, do for Your own sake and have mercy on us.&#x201D; A rain immediately began to fall. The scholars were displeased at this and a &#x201C;Bath Kol&#x201D; from heaven was heard saying: &#x201C;Rabbi Akiba is not greater than Rabbi Eliezer, but Rabbi Akiba practices forgiveness and Rabbi Eliezer does not.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn181">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of Rabbi Eliezer&#x2019;s moral maxims there remain the following sentences: &#x201C;Let the honor of your friend be dear to you as your own; be not quick to anger and repent a day before your death; warm yourself at the fire of the wise and beware of their glowing coal lest you be scorched, for their bite is the bite of a fox and their sting is the sting of a scorpion, their hiss is the hiss of a serpent and all their words are like coals of fire.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn182">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the disciples of Rabbi Eliezer visited him during his sickness they begged him to tell them what to do in order to deserve the life of the world to come. He instructed them to &#x201C;be careful of the honor of your associates and do not allow your children to ponder the logic of events,<xref rid="fn183">&#x002A;)</xref> but you should raise them in the presence of scholars. When you pray, remember before whom you stand. By virtue of all these deeds you will gain eternal life.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn184">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Later he raised his hands to heaven and said: &#x201C;I have learned much from my masters and also from others, but with all my learning, I have received from my masters&#x2019; knowledge no more than a dog who licks water from the sea and my pupils have taken from me as much as a pen absorbs when it is dipped in ink.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As soon as he died Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania arose and declared: &#x201C;Now the vow is rescinded.&#x201D; Since the scholars vowed during the dispute with Rabbi Eliezer not to approach him within a distance of four ells, they considered this vow no longer valid after his death.</p>
<p>From this statement one may conclude that Rabbi Eliezer was not excommunicated but was merely isolated by a vow of the scholars, else he would not have been allowed to conduct a separate academy and the pupils of that academy would not have ranked with those of Jabneh, and when Rabban Gamliel died, Rabbi Eliezer sent all the pupils of his academy from Lud to Jabneh to participate in the funeral and the mourning.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Akiba heard of the death of Rabbi Eliezer he came all the way from Caesarea to Lud to attend the funeral; on his way he was flogging himself and when he arrived his whole body was bleeding. Later Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania came to the academy of Rabbi Eliezer and there he found a stone on which Rabbi Eliezer was in the habit of sitting while he taught. Seeing this stone Rabbi Joshua kissed it and said: &#x201C;This stone is like mount Sinai and he who sat on it can be compared to the Ark of the Covenant.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn185">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Idolatry presented a very serious problem at that time. Since the temple was destroyed and the sacrifices were done away with, there were many Jews who felt that God had abandoned his people and they therefore turned to other gods. Rabbi Eliezer furiously fought against these deserters and he believed that it was necessary to uproot this evil. If a book of the Torah is found in a house of idol worshipping, he ruled that such a book must be burned since it is against the law to throw it away and because it became contaminated it could no longer be used.</p>
<p>Although Rabbi Eliezer was away from Jabneh for many years, there are many decisions of law quoted in his name as well as many legends about him. He was also praised as possessing the same qualities which were ascribed to his teacher Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. During the sickness that preceded his death he was visited by four of the elders of the people: Rabbi Tarphon, Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah and Rabbi Akiba.</p>
<p>Rabbi Tarphon said: &#x201C;You were better for the Jews than rain.&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua said: &#x201C;You were better for the Jews than sun.&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said: &#x201C;You were better for the Jews than parents are for their children.&#x201D; When Rabbi Akiba was ready to speak Rabbi Eliezer cupped his ear and said to those present: &#x201C;Let us hear what Rabbi Akiba has to say of me.&#x201D; But Rabbi Akiba said: &#x201C;The dearest thing on earth is suffering.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then there came Rabbi Eliezer&#x2019;s disciples and he said: &#x201C;A great wrath has descended upon the world.&#x201D; All the disciples began to weep, only Rabbi Akiba smiled. The disciples said: &#x201C;Is it possible to refrain from weeping when one sees the Torah in suffering?&#x201D; But Rabbi Akiba answered: &#x201C;That is the reason why I laugh. Were my master not to suffer, it would seem that he has received the reward for his good deeds in this world. But since he suffers I am convinced that the reward for his good deeds is awaiting him and that he will receive it in the other world.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer was especially famous for the exactness of his knowledge which he received from his teacher. He often said that a person must study every subject with his pupil four times even as was done by the Jews when they were in the desert, for all the Jews learned from the Elders and the Elders learned from Aaron and Aaron learned from Moses and Moses learned the Torah from God. Study of the Torah is of such importance that one must not abstain from it at any time. Even the holidays must be devoted to this end, for only an &#x201C;Am Haaretz&#x201D; devotes his holidays to earthly pleasures, but a scholar must continue his studies; when one indulges in food and drink on a feast day it is only to the end that he may have more strength to devote to the Torah.</p>
<p>Of the significance of Rabbi Eliezer&#x2019;s learning, Elisha ben Avuya once told that on the day of his <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05EA; &#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span> his father prepared a feast and invited all the outstanding people of that time including Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua. After the food and drink, those gathered sang various songs and played a game of Alphabet. One would recite a verse of the Bible beginning with an Aleph and another immediately answered with a verse beginning with a Beth. Rabbi Eliezer then said to Rabbi Joshua: &#x201C;While these people devote themselves to their affairs let us devote ourselves to ours.&#x201D; They began to discuss various interpretations of the Torah and they derived as much joy from it as if the Torah had only then been handed down from Mount Sinai. A cloud of fire then descended from heaven and surrounded them. Elisha&#x2019;s father said to them: &#x201C;What are you doing? Would you burn my house?&#x201D;, but they replied, &#x201C;We devoted ourselves to finding new interpretations to the Torah which was given in fire.&#x201D; Then said Avuya: &#x201C;If the power of the Torah is so great I shall devote my son to it when he grows to be of age.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer held original ideas regarding the value of prayer. &#x201C;Whoever prays at well defined times and according to a determined form,&#x201D; he used to say, &#x201C;his prayer is only a habit and does not derive from his heart.&#x201D; Contrary to the opinion of Rabban Gamliel, he did not recognize the necessity of reciting the &#x201C;Shmone Esrei&#x201D; and he composed a shorter prayer. When one of the pupils once prayed before the pulpit and said the shorter prayers, his colleagues laughed at him but Rabbi Eliezer said: &#x201C;Abbreviated as his prayer is, it is not as short as the prayer which Moses uttered for the cure of his sister which consisted of only five words.&#x201D; Another time a pupil recited a long version of the prayers and he was ridiculed for their length, but Rabbia Eliezer said: &#x201C;His prayers are no longer than those of Moses who prayed for forty days.&#x201D; Then he continued: &#x201C;There is a time for abbreviating one&#x2019;s prayers and a time for extending them. The important thing is to recite the prayer according to the need of the time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Speaking of the same subject on another occasion he gave his interpretation of the words of God who said to Moses: &#x201C;Why do you pray to me? Tell the Jews that they should advance.&#x201D; According to Rabbi Eliezer God meant to say: &#x201C;My children are in trouble. The sea has cut off their escape and the enemy is overtaking them. At such a time one must think of a means of salvation and not devote himself to prayer. Therefore tell the Jews to advance in spite of all obstacles.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Like all his contemporaries, Rabbi Eliezer deeply mourned the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple which he witnessed. He said: &#x201C;Our forefathers permitted the roof of our sanctuary to be taken away while we allowed the walls to be razed. Every generation which does not see the temple rebuilt is like a generation which participates in its destruction.&#x201D; He also said that three times every night God sits in mourning and roars like a lion over the ruins of the temple exclaiming: &#x201C;Woe is me that I have destroyed my house and have exiled my children.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At that time there prevailed a strong proselyting mood among the nations surrounding Palestine. Despite the fact that the Jews had lost all political significance, many Gentiles felt drawn toward the Jewish faith, intrigued by the stubbornness with which the Jews clung to it. Not a ray of light illuminated Jewish life and proselytes were being discouraged. Before one was admitted to the fold he would be asked: &#x201C;Do you not know that Jews are persecuted everywhere? It is also very difficult to observe Judaism, especially for one who is not used to its rigors.&#x201D; But there were many Gentiles who were not discouraged and even among the highest classes of Rome there were some who embraced Judaism. It therefore became necessary to devise new regulations for the new Jews. Before the temple was destroyed, Gentiles who undertook to observe the &#x201C;seven commandments of the sons of Noah&#x201D; were allowed to live in Judea and they were called &#x201C;permanent proselytes&#x201D; <span dir="rtl">(&#x05D2;&#x05E8; &#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05E9;&#x05D1;).</span> But after the destruction only those were accepted as proselytes who undertook to observe Judaism in all its details. The Roman historian Tacitus ridiculed the proselytes and said: &#x201C;It is impossible to comprehend what happened to many prominent Romans that they suddenly became filled with Jewish thoughts and agreed to have their flesh cut and to deny the gods of their forefathers.&#x201D; The emperor Domitian then issued severe laws against those Gentiles who embraced Judaism and the Roman satirist Juvenal used his sharp wit against those who teach their children the belief in a God who is all spirit, whom no one has seen and who is not strong enough to protect his people and who is therefore concerned only that people should observe the Sabbath and should not eat pork.</p>
<p>One of these proselytes was a rich Roman matron named Bloria, who was well versed in the Scriptures and frequently addressed questions to Rabban Gamliel and to his disciples. Another proselyte was Aquilas (Onkelos), a scion of the imperial family who translated the Torah into Greek because the Septuagint version was by then imperfect because of falsification of its contents. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua approved this translation and an Aramaic version of it we possess to this day under the name of &#x201C;Targum Onkelos.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But despite such outstanding examples, Rabbi Eliezer did not approve of all proselytes and he maintained that there always existed a possibility that a proselyte would return to the Gentiles. When Rabbi Eliezer saw the suffering which the proselytes had to withstand at the hands of the Roman law he said: &#x201C;Why is it that proselytes of this day are persecuted and have to suffer so much? This is probably because they do not show love for Judaism but only possess an unexplained fear.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Rabbi Eliezer declared that a man must repent a day before his death, his disciples asked him: &#x201C;How can one know what day he will die on?&#x201D; &#x201C;That was exactly my intention,&#x201D; Rabbi Eliezer answered, &#x201C;that one should repent every day for fear that he will die on the morrow.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer considered a sword, a lance and a bow as decorations which a man may keep when going about on the Sabbath. He opposed teaching the Torah to girls and declared that whoever teaches the Torah to his daughter is like one who teaches his daughter foolish things. Wild beasts, he said, should be killed wherever met as against the opinion of the other scholars who believed that a wild beast should be killed only if it has done some harm. He also said that whoever eats the bread of a Gentile is like one who eats the flesh of a pig.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer always elaborated on the events related in the Torah and, with poetic imagination, he embellished these events with wonders even greater than those which are described in the Torah. Of the ten plagues which, according to the Torah, were visited on Egypt before the deliverance of the Jews, Rabbi Jose of Galilee said that they prove that the Egyptians were afflicted with fifty plagues when pursuing the Jews to the sea. He bases it on the verse of the Torah which says that the ten plagues were a &#x201C;finger of God&#x201D; but when by the sea &#x201C;the Jews saw the great hand of God&#x201D;; consequently, if one finger caused ten plagues, the hand of God must have caused fifty. But Rabbi Eliezer was still unsatisfied and he discovered a text which proved that every plague consisted of four; he therefore concluded that the Egyptians were afflicted with forty plagues in Egypt and with as many as two hundred plagues by the sea.</p>
<p>He also said that the miraculous events which transpired by the sea were so great that even women slaves saw more than Ezekiel and all the other prophets. Moses&#x2019; song of praise which said, &#x201C;this is my God and I shall glorify Him,&#x201D; he considered as proof that every one saw God in person.</p>
<p>Concerning the Manna Rabbi Eliezer said that when it fell it remained suspended two ells above the ground and the Jews picked it from the air and not from the ground. Before it fell, Rabbi Eliezer said, a North wind would arise and cleanse the desert of sand; then a rain would descend to wash the earth; after the rain a dew would fall and spread like a cloth and on it the Manna descended.</p>
<p>Regarding the events at Mount Sinai the text of the Torah says that &#x201C;all Jews saw.&#x201D; Rabbi Eliezer declared this to indicate that there was not a blind man among all the people. When it is said later that everyone answered in unison, he interpreted it to signify that there was not a mute person in all the people; from the declaration of the Jews that they will do and hear as they are told, he concluded that there was not a deaf person among them and the verse which says that all the people stood at the foot of the mountain he interpreted to indicate that there was not a lame one among them.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer greatly esteemed the worth of the Sabbath. He declared that whoever observes the Sabbath according to all the regulations will be spared three types of punishment&#x2014;such a person will be spared the sufferings of the coming of the Messiah, the wars of Gog and Magog and the great &#x201C;Day of Judgment.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Concerning the duty to honor one&#x2019;s father, Rabbi Eliezer related a story of a Gentile named Dama ben Nathina who possessed a diamond worth 600,000 shkolim which he wanted to sell for the &#x201C;Ephod&#x201D; of the High Priest. But when the priests came to buy it, Dama&#x2019;s father was asleep and the key to the box which contained the diamond was under his pillow. Dama refused to waken his father even though this caused him a great loss. On another occasion Rabbi Eliezer said that the honor due to one&#x2019;s father must be so unbounded that even were one to see his father throw a bag of gold into the sea, he must not question his action.</p>
<ftnote id="fn174">&#x002A;) I have previously commented on the &#x201C;Bath Kol.&#x201D; Regarding the leaning of the walls of the academy in support of Rabbi Eliezer&#x2019;s view, it is held by some that this was but an imaginative description of what took place. When, in desparation, Rabbi Eliezer turned to the pupils of the academy for support of his views, Rabbi Joshua scolded them saying that it was not for them to interfere in the dispute.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania</title>
<p>W<small>HENEVER THE OUTSTANDING DISCIPLES</small> of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai were enumerated, Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania was accorded second place. Rabban Jochanan himself referred to him as &#x201C;the triple thread&#x201D; because he combined within himself the virtues of Torah, wisdom and fear of God; on another occasion Rabban Jochanan is said to have exclaimed: &#x201C;Happy is the mother who gives birth to such a son.&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua&#x2019;s mother well deserved this praise, for even before his birth she frequented the academies in order to influence the future of the child which she bore within herself with the spirit of the Torah. When Rabbi Joshua was still an infant, she was in the habit of bringing him in his cradle to the academy that he might absorb the words of the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn186">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua began his activities while the temple was still in existence and he served as a Levite among the &#x201C;singers.&#x201D; Years later he described the festival of the drawing of water which was then celebrated on the night following the first day of Succoth, and during which no one had any sleep because of the numerous ceremonies practiced. On the morning of the first day of Succoth everybody arose early to offer the daily morning sacrifice, then the Levites sang a hymn after which it was time to offer the special holiday sacrifice. Following this all went to the academy and then home to partake of the holiday repast, but before that could be consumed it was time again for the &#x201C;Mincha&#x201D; offering and then began the festivities of the drawing of water which passed in rejoicing and dancing until the early hours of the morning when it was time again for the morning sacrifice. Those who became exceedingly tired would lean on someone&#x2019;s shoulder and nap while standing up. <sup><xref rid="fn187">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua was not favored with an attractive appearance <sup><xref rid="fn188">3)</xref></sup> but he was gifted with great talent for studies and his teacher found him worthy enough to confide to him the greatest mysteries of the Torah. Legend relates that Rabbi Joshua was going on a journey with his comrade Rabbi Jose Hacohen on a hot summer day. On the way Rabbi Joshua began to expound the mysteries of the Divine Chariot and the sky suddenly became overcast with clouds, a rainbow appeared and angels gathered to hear his lecture even as people gather to a wedding.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Jose related this to Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai the latter exclaimed: &#x201C;Happy are you and happy are the mothers that bore you. My eyes rejoice to see this. In my dreams I see us all sitting on Mount Sinai and a voice is calling to us to go farther where we will find great palaces and magnificent rugs will be spread before our feet and we shall take our place in the front rows among those who sit before the Shechina.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn189">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Together with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, Rabbi Joshua aided his master Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai to flee from Jerusalem before its destruction and he then followed him wherever he went. He is always mentioned as second to Rabbi Eliezer, although he was a pupil of Rabban Jochanan before Rabbi Eliezer arrived, for when Rabban Jochanan invited Rabbi Eliezer to eat, he said that he had eaten with Rabbi Joshua.</p>
<p>Like his master Rabbi Joshua too did not greatly mourn the destruction of Jerusalem. Thus the Talmud relates <sup><xref rid="fn190">5)</xref></sup> that many Jews renounced the eating of flesh and the drinking of wine after the destruction. Rabbi Eliezer asked them: &#x201C;My children, why do you abstain from flesh and wine?&#x201D; and the people answered: &#x201C;How can we eat when flesh is no longer offered on the altar and how can we drink wine when wine is no more poured on the altar.&#x201D;</p>
<p>To this Rabbi Joshua replied: &#x201C;You are quite right, my children. But if we should do as you say then we must also give up eating bread which is made out of flour, for flour is no longer offered on the altar; and if you will say that one can do without flour by eating fruit then must we also give up eating fruit, for the offering of the first fruit to the priest has been done away with; we should also give up drinking water because it is no longer poured over the altar.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The people then remained silent not knowing what to answer and Rabbi Joshua continued: &#x201C;If I were to say that we should not mourn at all that would be impossible, but one must also not surrender himself entirely to sorrow. It is necessary to mourn in such a manner that everyone should be able to bear it and that the mourning should not interfere with people&#x2019;s lives.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Very few legal decisions are quoted in the name of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania and whenever he did pronounce a legal opinion he credited it to Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai or to some other teacher. Most of the time he was in opposition to Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, but despite these differences of opinion they were close friends for many years until the great dispute regarding the &#x201C;winding oven&#x201D; when they became separated.</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua visited Rome and Alexandria several times together with Rabban Gamliel and other scholars on behalf of the Jewish people. It seems that he was favored by the Gentile scholars and rulers who disputed with him regarding Judaism. His wisdom was also appreciated and the emperor once asked him to tell him the dream which he saw that night. Knowing that the emperor was planning a war with the Persians Rabbi Joshua said: &#x201C;In your dream you saw the Persians dragging you into captivity; they forced you to do hard labor and they beat you with a golden rod.&#x201D; The emperor may not have had such a dream the previous night but after he brooded over this all day he saw this dream the following night. <sup><xref rid="fn191">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time the emperor asked him why the Sabbath foods have such a pleasing aroma. Rabbi Joshua said to him: &#x201C;We have a herb the name of which is Sabbath; this herb we mix with food and it improves its flavor.&#x201D; &#x201C;Will you not give me some of these herbs,&#x201D; the emperor asked him, but Rabbi Joshua replied: &#x201C;Whoever does not observe the Sabbath will get no benefit out of these herbs.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn192">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like Rabban Gamliel and other scholars, Rabbi Joshua also knew the languages of the neighboring peoples, and for this reason he was frequently chosen to represent the Jews before the rulers. Once it became necessary to gain the intercession of a matron who was influential among the Roman rulers. The scholars then asked: &#x201C;Who will go to that matron?&#x201D; and Rabbi Joshua volunteered.</p>
<p>He went accompanied by several of his disciples and when they approached within a distance of four ells of the house, Rabbi Joshua removed his phylacteries and, entering the house, he closed the door behind himself and his disciples remained outside. When he emerged he bathed and then he went to finish the studies for that day.</p>
<p>Thinking that his disciples might suspect him of some evil he asked them: &#x201C;When you saw me remove the phylacteries before entering the house, what did you think of it?&#x201D; and they replied: &#x201C;We thought, that you did not want to bring a holy object into an unclean place.&#x201D; &#x201C;And what did you think when you saw me close the door and leave you outside?&#x201D; he further asked. His disciples replied: &#x201C;We thought that you wished to discuss some political question.&#x201D; &#x201C;And when you saw me bathe after I left the house, what did you think?&#x201D; he asked, and they answered him: &#x201C;We thought you bathed because of the possibility that while speaking to her a particle of her saliva may have fallen on your clothes.&#x201D; Then Rabbi Joshua said to them: &#x201C;I swear to you that I did all these things even for the same reasons that you thought.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn193">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The emperor once said to Rabbi Joshua: &#x201C;It is written in the Torah that God is just and that he rewards each one according to his deeds, then why are there so many blind, deaf and lame people who suffer without cause because they were born crippled before they had an opportunity to sin?&#x201D; And Rabbi Joshua answered him: &#x201C;God knows what he does and if he creates a person with some disability it is a sign that such a man is wicked and he is therefore punished in advance for his sins.&#x201D; &#x201C;But how can this be proved?&#x201D; the emperor asked. &#x201C;Give me,&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua said to him, &#x201C;two of your men as witnesses and a thousand golden coins and I will prove to you that what I say is true.&#x201D; The emperor then gave him what he asked and Rabbi Joshua went together with the two men to a person who was born blind and he said to him: &#x201C;The emperor commanded that I be put to death and I have a thousand golden coins which I want you to keep for me. If I will be killed the money will be yours, but if my life will be spared then you will return it to me.&#x201D; The blind man answered: &#x201C;It shall be even as you say.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then Rabbi Joshua gave the money to the man and three months later he returned together with the witnesses and said to him: &#x201C;The emperor has spared my life and now I want you to return to me the money which I gave you to guard for me.&#x201D; But the blind man answered: &#x201C;What money have you given me? I know of none.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua appeared to be angry and he brought the man before the emperor for trial, but even there the blind man denied that he had received money and when the witnesses testified against him he claimed that they were false witnesses. Then Rabbi Joshua said to him: &#x201C;Woe to you, blind man, that you will in no way have any use of the money, for I have seen your wife entertaining another man and saying to him that as soon as the emperor will put you to death she will spend the money together with him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Upon hearing this the blind man immediately ran home and brought the money which he placed before the emperor. Rabbi Joshua then said to him: &#x201C;Now you can see that our God was just when he made this man blind, for even in his blindness he is a criminal; how much more so would he have been if he could see.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn194">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We remarked before that Rabbi Joshua did not possess a pleasing appearance but he was very wise, and the king&#x2019;s daughter, who admitted knowledge, enjoyed discussing matters with him. Unable to restrain herself she once said to him: &#x201C;Is it possible that such wisdom should be contained in such an ungainly vessel?&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua said to her: &#x201C;Why is it that your father, who is an emperor, keeps his wine in a clay vessel the same as all other people? Why does he not keep it in a silver or golden vessel?&#x201D; The princess inquired of her father and he explained to her that good wine would soon spoil in a silver or golden vessel. She then understood what Rabbi Joshua meant to tell her.</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua&#x2019;s debates with the emperor are frequently mentioned in various Midrashim and the name of the emperor is given as Hadrian, who later permitted the rebuilding of the temple. According to the Midrash, this permission was obtained by Rabbi Joshua.</p>
<p>It is told that the emperor once said to Rabbi Joshua: &#x201C;I am greater than your master Moses, for he is dead but I am alive.&#x201D; To this Rabbi Joshua responded: &#x201C;Can you decree that people should not light fires in their houses for three consecutive days?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes, I can do so,&#x201D; the emperor answered and he immediately issued such a decree. That same evening the emperor and Rabbi Joshua went out of the gates of the palace for a stroll and they saw smoke issuing out of a chimney. Rabbi Joshua said to him: &#x201C;Look, even while you live, your commandments are ignored while our teacher Moses commanded many centuries ago that no fire be lit on the Sabbath and to this day no Jew will make a fire on Sabbath.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn195">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At that time disputes frequently occurred in a place called &#x201C;Bei Avidan.&#x201D; <xref rid="fn196">&#x002A;)</xref> The aim of these was to dissuade Jews from their faith. Rabbi Joshua attended these a number of times but later he stopped going. When the emperor once came to the disputing ground and did not find Rabbi Joshua there he later asked him why he was absent. In his usual allegorical fashion Rabbi Joshua answered him: &#x201C;My mountain is already covered with snow and the foot of the mountain is bedecked with ice. My dogs no longer bark, nor do my grindstones turn, and when I walk it seems as if I search for that which I have not lost.&#x201D; With these words Rabbi Joshua implied that he feels his age; his head is white as snow and his beard and moustache are grey as ice; his voice is hoarse and he has difficulty in speaking; his teeth can no longer chew and when he walks he is bent as if in search of something.</p>
<p>Hadrian, who later became relentless in his persecution of the Jews, once wanted to permit the Jews to restore the temple. This permission is said to have been obtained by Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. But the emperor later changed his mind and rescinded his permission. Some historians maintain that the intervention of the Samaritans was responsible for this but others advance different reasons. The rescinding of this permission almost caused a new uprising but Rabbi Joshua calmed the enraged mob with an allegoric tale.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The lion,&#x201D; he related, &#x201C;once choked with a bone which became lodged in his throat. He therefore announced throughout the land that whoever will remove the bone will be richly rewarded. The stork came and with its long bill it extracted the bone. When the stork demanded its reward the lion said to it: &#x2018;You want reward? Is it not enough for you that you have been within the mouth of the lion and you have come out alive?&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>Hearing this story the people understood its moral and their rebellious mood was calmed.</p>
<p>From what we know of the activities of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania we may conclude that he made friends easily; he reserved his decisions and based them on a desire for peace; he was ready to arrive at compromises with the other scholars in order to avoid disputes. Speaking of the disputes between the opposing schools of Hillel and Shammai he said that these were being carried too far and were like &#x201C;filling a barrel full of oil and then pouring water into it to spoil the oil.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Following the death of Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Joshua apparently became the spiritual leader of the people. It is possible that because of his poverty he was not chosen Nasi, but since he headed his own academy in Pekiin and the Nasi of Jabneh was dead we may conclude that his importance was then of the highest.</p>
<p>Politically the period was one of commotion. This was the time of Trajan (Trachinus in the Talmud and Midrash) and Hadrian (Adrianus in the Talmud and Midrash) to whose name there was always added the curse <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E9;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05E7; &#x05D8;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05D0;&#x05F4;</span> (may his dead bones be ground). This period was therefore marked by constant decrees against the Jews and it was necessary to intercede continually in order to counteract their effects and also to keep a vigilant eye on what was going on among the Jews among whom rebellious moods began to rise as a result of these decrees.</p>
<p>As long as Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus lived his superiority was recognized by Rabbi Joshua as well as by the other scholars. But differences of opinion existed regarding the interpretation of various texts which deal with metaphysical matters or with the explanation of certain events in the history of the people as well as regarding future events during the advent of the Messiah and concerning the creation of the world, whether that took place in the month of Nisan or Tishri.</p>
<p>The belief was then accepted that every Jew is entitled to a share in the world to come and in the resurrection after he will pass the great Day of Judgment which will occur during the next redemption of the Jewish people. This belief grew out of observation that the fulfillment of some commandments, which is to be rewarded with long life, often entailed the immediate death of the observant.</p>
<p>Thus the Torah commands that &#x201C;if you find on your way a nest of birds on a tree or on the ground containing birds or eggs you shall not take the mother with her offspring but you shall send the mother away and the offspring you may take for yourself in order that you may live long years. (Deut. 27:6, 7.) The same reward is also held out for the fulfillment of the commandment of honoring one&#x2019;s father and mother: &#x201C;Your years will be long and your portion will be good.&#x201D; (Deut. 8:16.)</p>
<p>But it once occurred that a father said to his son: &#x201C;Go to the pigeon roost and bring me some young doves.&#x201D; The son did as his father commanded him and he also sent away the mother bird but on his way back he slipped and was killed. Then many people asked: &#x201C;How could God do this since he promised in the Torah that these two commandments were to be rewarded with long life?&#x201D; It was then explained that the reward was to be given in the future life and the text was interpreted to mean, &#x201C;you shall enjoy this world which is perfect without pain and you shall live long years in the world which is eternal.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn197">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The belief that all Jews have a share in the world to come or in the resurrection, Rabbi Eliezer interpreted to exclude non-Jews. Non-Jews, he said, were not even to be called for the Day of Judgment; but Rabbi Joshua maintained that the just men among the Gentiles would have a share in the world to come. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the people of Sodom, the generation of desert wanderers and the congregation of Korah were to be excluded from the resurrection and from the Day of Judgment but Rabbi Joshua was more generous to these sinners and although he conceded that they were ruled out from the world to come he claimed that they would be called to the Judgment Day.</p>
<p>A saying of Rabbi Joshua which he frequently repeated stated that an evil eye, an evil thought and hatred of mankind drive a man out of the world. He particularly believed in the importance of peaceful relations between people and he also said that &#x201C;a pious fool, a clever wicked man, an abstaining woman and the plague of Pharisaism&#x2014;these four types spoil the world.&#x201D; It was asked, what is a pious fool? The answer was given that a pious fool is one who sees a woman drowning and would not save her for fear of touching her body. A pious fool was also one who sees a child drowning and does not save it because he has not yet removed his phylacteries. An abstaining woman was defined as one who renounces her husband and the joys of the world; the plague of Pharisaism was explained to mean such Pharisees who strike their heads against a wall to show their piety.</p>
<p>When Hadrian permitted the restoration of the temple there were found human bones in the place where the wood chamber of the temple used to stand and some scholars wanted to declare all Jerusalem to be unclean. But Rabbi Joshua said: &#x201C;It would be a shame for us to declare our sanctuary unclean. What if dead bones were found? Can anyone tell where the victims of the flood came to rest? Or those slaughtered by Nebuchadnezzar? Or the bodies of those killed in all the wars that took place to this day? The sanctity of the Land of Israel has been declared for all times and even when Jews are in exile, it cannot be profaned by dead bones.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn198">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The frequent debates of Rabbi Joshua with the emperor and the philosophers (one group of these philosophers is referred to in the Talmud as the Elders of Athens) are embellished by all sorts of legends. Nevertheless they contain an important religious significance. The Elders of Athens, it is told, once asked Rabbi Joshua: &#x201C;Where is the middle of the world?&#x201D; Pointing to the place where he stood, Rabbi Joshua declared it to be the middle of the world, and when they asked him how he knew this, he told them to take a line and measure the distance to convince themselves. Attempting to confuse him the Elders said to him: &#x201C;We have a well in the desert and we want you to bring it into the city.&#x201D; But Rabbi Joshua said: &#x201C;For that I need a rope of bran, for only such a rope can be used for moving wells.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Again they said to him: &#x201C;We have a torn mill and we want you to patch it,&#x201D; but he answered that for this a thread of sand was needed. The Elders then asked him: &#x201C;What should one use to cut a labyrinth of knives?&#x201D; and he replied: &#x201C;With the horn of a donkey.&#x201D; Once two eggs were brought to Rabbi Joshua and he was asked which egg was laid by a white hen and which by a black one. Another time the Elders of Athens said to him: &#x201C;When a bird dies, where does its soul leave it?&#x201D; and Rabbi Joshua replied: &#x201C;The soul leaves through the same place that it enters at birth.&#x201D; And when they asked: &#x201C;Is there a case of something being brought into a house with great effort and the effort should cause damage?&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;When you bring a rug into the house and in doing so you break the door.&#x201D;</p>
<p>To the debates between Rabbi Joshua and Hadrian the following may be added. Hadrian said: &#x201C;You say that God creates new angels every day to praise him and after they finish their praise they go away; I would like to know whither they go.&#x201D; And Rabbi Joshua answered, &#x201C;They go to the place where they were created. They go to the River of Fire which flows day and night even as the Jordan flows day and night, and this River of Fire comes from the perspiration of the sacred animals which carry the throne of Glory.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then Hadrian said: &#x201C;I have noticed that God&#x2019;s name is mentioned in the first five of the Ten Commandments but it does not occur in the other five. How can you explain that?&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua retorted: &#x201C;Why is it, that wherever one looks he sees your statue, but in those places where a person goes to relieve himself he does not find your statue?&#x201D; The emperor answered, &#x201C;It is not fitting to place my image in unclean places.&#x201D; &#x201C;Neither is it fitting to mention God&#x2019;s name together with murderers, adulterers, thieves, false witnesses and other sinners who are the refuse of humanity,&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua replied.</p>
<p>Once Hadrian said to Rabbi Joshua: &#x201C;I would believe in your God if you would only show him to me that I might know Him better.&#x201D; &#x201C;I can do that easily,&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua said, &#x201C;If you would see my God I will show him to you.&#x201D; He then led the emperor outside on a hot summer day and told him to look at the sun, but the latter declared that he could not do so, for the sun blinds his eyes. Then Rabbi Joshua said, &#x201C;If you cannot look at the face of the least servant of God, how can you expect to see Him?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn199">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Brilliant as were the retorts of Rabbi Joshua to the emperor and to the philosophers of Athens, he admitted that he was confounded&#x2014;not by the emperor or a Gentile philosopher&#x2014;but by a woman, a small boy and a girl.</p>
<p>Of how he was confounded by a woman Rabbi Joshua related in the following words: &#x201C;Once I was lodging in a hostelry and the proprietress gave me beans to eat. I ate them all the first day and likewise on the second day. On the third day she put so much salt into the beans that I could not eat them. When she saw that I do not eat she asked why I don&#x2019;t. I answered that I already ate. But the woman said to me: &#x2018;If it is true, that you already ate, you would not have eaten the bread. There must be another reason for your not eating. You probably remembered that yesterday and the day before you left no &#x201C;Peah&#x201D; <xref rid="fn200">&#x002A;)</xref> from your food and you undoubtedly know that the scholars ruled that it is not necessary to offer Peah from the pot but from the plate.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;A little girl confounded me,&#x201D; Joshua continued to relate, &#x201C;when I was once going on my way and I had to cross a field. The little girl asked me: &#x2018;Rabbi, is not this a field that you allow yourself to walk on it?&#x2019; But I said, it is a worn road. She said to me, &#x201C;If this be a worn road then wicked people like you have made it so.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;A small boy confounded me,&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua told, &#x201C;when I was going on my way and I came to a place where the road separated. I asked the boy which way I should go to arrive at the city and he replied, &#x2018;One way is shorter but longer, the other way is longer but shorter.&#x2019; I followed the road which the boy said was shorter but longer. When I approached the city I came to a place of gardens which I could not cross and I had to retrace my steps to follow the other road which the boy said was longer but shorter.&#x201D;</p>
<p>With the death of Rabbi Joshua there ceased &#x201C;wise counsel and good thoughts.&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua was always victorious in his disputes with the opponents of the Jewish faith, and as he was dying the scholars said to each other: &#x201C;Who will lead our disputes now that Rabbi Joshua is leaving us?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn201">14)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin</title>
<p>D<small>URING THE DECADE FOLLOWING</small> the destruction of the Temple and until the uprising of Bar Kochba there lived in Palestine the Tana Rabbi Eliezer who exerted a considerable influence. His name is extensively associated with the legends of that time. <sup><xref rid="fn202">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer was a native of the town of Modiin, which was also the birthplace of Mattathias the Hasmonean. According to a legend he died as a result of being booted by Bar Kochba, when the latter was told that Rabbi Eliezer sided with the Romans. The period was marked by revolutionary unrest not only among the Jews, but also among all the Asiatic nations which were dominated by Rome and moves toward national liberation were afoot everywhere. In an attempt to gain the confidence of the Jews and their assistance against the other nations, Hadrian permitted the restoration of the temple. The historical occurrences of that time are not entirely clear. One thing is certain, since it appears in all historical records, that after a revolutionary clash with the Romans, Hadrian came to new terms with the Jews and that the outstanding condition of this peace was the permission to rebuild the temple.</p>
<p>But this permission he later rescinded when he abandoned his friendly attitude toward the Jews. By means of various legal amendments, the previous edict allowing the restoration of the temple was made to naught. The first move was to order the selection of a new site for the temple, later an alteration of the dimensions, to differ from those of the old temple, was ordered and the least possible number of Jews were to be employed in the work of reconstruction. When all the imperial caprices were finally complied with and work began, flames appeared from under ground and frightened the laborers away. This phenomenon, which was caused by an accumulation of gases in the ruins since the time of destruction, was interpreted as a sign of God against the work.</p>
<p>The conduct of the emperor enraged the populace and the rebellious sentiments which were seething beneath the surface broke out in the form of open revolt. Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania at first restrained the revolutionary outburst for a time, but when Rabbi Akiba became the spokesman for the revolt, it burst out in full force under the leadership of Simeon ben Kochab of Kezib.</p>
<p>It remains uncertain whether any other scholar besides Rabbi Akiba joined Bar Kochba, but we do know that Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin, who was an uncle of Bar Kochba, opposed the rebellion of the Jews. As long as the war of rebellion lasted, Rabbi Eliezer fasted and prayed that God should save the remnant of the Jews from extermination. Since everyone was convinced of the invincibility of the Romans, Rabbi Eliezer refused to sanction the warlike efforts of his nephew. This was interpreted as indicating sympathy with the Romans and in an outburst of anger Bar Kochba once booted Rabbi Eliezer who instantly died from the blow.</p>
<p>The story of the details of this occurrence relates that Rabbi Eliezer was standing deeply immersed in prayer, when a Samaritan came up to him and whispered something in his ear, but Rabbi Eliezer did not even notice his presence. This was reported to Bar Kochba who questioned Rabbi Eliezer regarding the subject of his conversation with the Samaritan, but Rabbi Eliezer did not know what to answer. <sup><xref rid="fn203">2)</xref></sup> When the Samaritan was caught and questioned he admitted that he spoke regarding the surrender of the city to the Romans.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin was a pupil and a friend of Rabban Gamliel II. It seems probable that he also conducted an academy of his own, but since he was an authority on the Hagadah, he was frequently invited to Jabneh to offer his interpretations. Rabban Gamliel was in the habit of hearing the opinions of all the other scholars and then he would remark: &#x201C;We still must hear from the man of Modiin.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn204">3)</xref></sup> The others were displeased at this and once remarked to Rabbi Eliezer: &#x201C;How long will you continue to heap words on us?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin devoted himself largely to preaching; he also said that the meaning of the word &#x201C;Hagadah&#x201D; was the same as &#x201C;flowing,&#x201D; for the legendary interpretations of the historical events and of the texts of the Scriptures flow into one&#x2019;s consciousness like water. When he preached, his words caressed the ears of the listeners with a gentle grace which aroused the noblest feelings and he stimulated the fantasy of his listeners with poetic imagery.</p>
<p>A maxim of Rabbi Eliezer which he often repeated said: &#x201C;He who profanes the Sabbath and desecrates the festivals and shames his associate in public and breaks the covenant of our father Abraham and misinterprets the Torah, even though he possess Torah and good deeds, he has no share in the world to come.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This maxim characterizes his trend of thoughts and was probably also meant as a condemnation of the various sects which appeared at that time and which profaned the Sabbath, desecrated the festivals, broke the covenant of Abraham and falsely interpreted the Torah. Like most of his contemporaries, Rabbi Eliezer also considered the observance of the Sabbath as the most important element of the Jewish faith. &#x201C;He who does not observe the Sabbath has no portion in the world to come,&#x201D; Rabbi Eliezer said, but if the Jews were to observe the Sabbath as it should be observed, God would bestow upon them the following six gifts: the land of Israel, the world to come, a new world order, the re-establishment of the kingdom of David, the priesthood and the Levites.</p>
<p>The developing sects among the Jews at that time began to criticize the Hebrew script. We already described before, that the Jews had two types of script, the square Assyrian and the Phoenician which was used by the Samaritans. In the attempt to isolate the Samaritans from the Jews, Ezra the Scribe selected the Assyrian script to be used exclusively by the Jews. The opponents of the Torah then began to criticize this script saying that it is derived from a foreign nation. Rabbi Eliezer declared that the square Assyrian script was the original script of the Torah and he based his statement on texts from the Torah and from Megillath Esther. <sup><xref rid="fn205">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer was opposed to the uprising of Bar Kochba. The wars of Bar Kochba seemed to him to be altogether too natural. He awaited a redemption which should be characterized by miracles and he held that one must hope for it but must not attempt to hasten such a redemption violently. When he was asked regarding the prophecy that Jerusalem shall become the gathering place of all the nations, how it would be possible for one city to contain all the nations, he explained that God would command the city to extend its boundaries to include all people.</p>
<p>The trend of thoughts of Rabbi Eliezer was illustrated by his saying that the book and the sword were handed down from heaven at the same time. God said: &#x201C;If you observe the Torah, you will be spared from the sword, but if you will not observe its commandments you shall be destroyed by the sword.&#x201D; Rabbi Eliezer frequently debated the meaning of various texts of the Torah with Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania and he loved to find hidden meaning whenever the wording of a text was unusual, or there was a superfluous word or some word was lacking. Rabbi Joshua, on the contrary, sought the simple meaning of texts and attempted to find a rational explanation.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer thus sought for secrets and mysteries in order to create fantastic embellishments for historical events. Even the miracles that were related he found insufficient and attempted to magnify them as, for example, in the case of the Manna which he declared heaped up to a height of sixty ells. <sup><xref rid="fn206">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other events he saw in a poetic light. When God gave the Torah to the Jews, he said, all the kings shuddered in their palaces. The thunder and the lightning on Mount Sinai confused them and the blast from the Shofar, which the angels sounded, nearly deafened them. They then gathered to Balaam and asked him: &#x201C;Is this not a repetition of the flood?&#x201D; But Balaam answered: &#x201C;Foolish people. God swore to Noah long ago never again to bring a flood.&#x201D; &#x201C;Possibly He meant that He would never cause a flood of water to devastate the earth, but He may bring a flood of fire,&#x201D; they continued asking. Balaam reassured them, &#x201C;He will bring no flood either of fire or water. The commotion which you witness today is due to the fact that God is this day giving the Torah to Israel.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn207">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He also said that whenever Jews depend on the intercession of the merits of their forefathers, which are beloved of God, they will be aided and will be victorious over their enemies. This idea he employed in explaining the events of the wars with Amalek as well as the feeding of the Jews in the desert with meat. By means of these additions to the miraculous events he sought to encourage people and to strengthen them in the face of the vicissitudes of the dispersion. This policy he continued even when his colleagues disagreed with him.</p>

<title>Onkelos (Aquilas) the Proselyte</title>
<p>I<small>T HAS BEEN POINTED OUT</small> numerous times that even while the Jews were in a state of political subjection, while their land was devastated and the enemy triumphed and there reigned the belief that their God has forsaken them, even at that time there were many people of high estate who gave up their careers and entered the Jewish people as proselytes. One of these was Onkelos the son of Kalonymos, or Aquilas, as he is referred to in some places, who was closely related to the emperor Hadrian.<xref rid="fn208">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>The story of how Onkelos (Aquilas) turned to Judaism is related in the following manner:</p>
<p>Aquilas (or Onkelos) was the nephew of emperor Hadrian and wanted to become a proselyte. He greatly approved of the Jewish faith. (Others say that he was brought to this conviction by a Jewish girl.) But he feared his uncle and once he said to him: &#x201C;I would gladly engage in commerce.&#x201D; Hadrian replied, &#x201C;If you lack money, my treasury is always at your disposal.&#x201D; But Aquilas continued, &#x201C;I want to journey throughout the world and to meet many men, I therefore want your advice as to what merchandise I shall take.&#x201D; To this Hadrian replied: &#x201C;If you see merchandise which is fallen in price, deal in it, for it will surely rise again and you will gain thereby.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Aquilas then went to Palestine and began to study with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. Sometime later he returned to Hadrian and his uncle asked him: &#x201C;Why is your face so changed? It is obvious that you have suffered losses; or has someone done you harm?&#x201D; But Aquilas-Onkelos answered, &#x201C;Neither.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then Hadrian said, &#x201C;You are my kin and I am pained at your poor appearance,&#x201D; and Aquilas-Onkelos declared, &#x201C;I have learned the Jewish Torah and I have become a Jew.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Greatly shocked Hadrian exclaimed, &#x201C;Who permitted you to do so?&#x201D; Aquilas-Onkelos answered, &#x201C;You told me to do so. When I asked your advice what merchandise I should trade in, you told me to get all merchandise which is depreciated, for it would surely rise in value again. I searched among all nations for a people which had fallen lower than the Jews but I found none. I therefore bethought myself that they are sure to rise to heights again.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This conversation was witnessed by one of the emperor&#x2019;s ministers who praised Aquilas&#x2019; step. The emperor was angered at this and struck his minister. Out of shame that minister leaped from the roof of his house and killed himself.</p>
<p>Hadrian persisted in trying to find out the cause of Aquilas-Onkelos&#x2019; conversion until the latter told him, &#x201C;I wanted to know the Jewish Torah.&#x201D; &#x201C;But you could have learned it without embracing Judaism,&#x201D; the emperor wondered, but Aquilas-Onkelos replied that a non-Jew can never comprehend the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn209">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are several versions regarding the conversion and one of them relates that when the emperor heard of it he sent a few soldiers to bring Aquilas back to Rome, but he explained to them a number of verses of the Torah and they too were converted. The emperor then sent other soldiers to bring him back and commanded them not to engage in any discussion with him. When the soldiers took Aquilas-Onkelos and were ready to leave, he said to them: &#x201C;Let me tell you one thing; among people it customary that the one of lesser rank lights the way for those of higher rank, but my God is the greatest and still he lights the way that people may see where to go.&#x201D; Upon hearing this, these soldiers too became converted. The emperor then sent soldiers for the third time and commanded them neither to speak nor to listen to what Onkelos may tell them. As they were emerging from the house with him, he placed his hand upon the Mezuzah and said to them: &#x201C;See the difference between a human ruler and the great God of Israel. A human ruler stays within his house and his guards stay at the gate, but here the people stay inside the house while the king stays at the door to guard them.&#x201D; Hearing this these soldiers also became converted and the emperor sent no more soldiers to bring Onkelos back. <sup><xref rid="fn210">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Onkelos spoke to the Roman soldiers, or on other occasions compared the ways of God to the deeds of human rules, it was entirely in accord with the concepts of that time. The emperor was then looked up to as divine. Instead of drawing a parallel between an idol, which the king worshipped, and God, as the author of the Psalms did, it became customary at that time to compare the conduct of a human ruler with that of God.</p>
<p>Still another version of the story of Onkelos&#x2019; conversion relates that Onkelos bar Kalonymos was a nephew of Titus (or of Hadrian as the Gaon of Vilna claims) and wanted to embrace Judaism. With the aid of witchcraft he had Titus aroused from his grave and he asked him: &#x201C;Which is the worthiest people on earth?&#x201D;, Titus replied, &#x201C;The Jews are.&#x201D; Onkelos then asked, &#x201C;What would happen if I were to join them?&#x201D; and Titus said, &#x201C;Their teachings are too great and it is impossible to observe them. If you want to gain greatness there is no better way than by oppressing the Jews.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn211">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Midrash relates <sup><xref rid="fn212">4)</xref></sup> that before Onkelos became converted he came before Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and asked him: &#x201C;Do you think it is worth while for a person to embrace Judaism if God only offers the proselyte divine love and bread to eat and a garment to wear?&#x201D; Rabbi Eliezer was greatly angered by this question and answered: &#x201C;Is it not enough for a proselyte that he receives that for which our father Jacob prayed. To him God offers it as a gift, is not that enough?&#x201D; But this answer did not satisfy Onkelos and he asked the same question of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. Rabbi Joshua responded kindly and said: &#x201C;The bread which God offers to the proselyte is not ordinary bread but the Torah. And when it is said that God will give the proselyte a garment to wear, no ordinary garment is meant but the Talith of wisdom. If the proselyte is worthy enough to learn the Torah he deserves the Talith of a scholar and he may marry his daughter to a priest and her sons may become High Priests.&#x201D; Later the scholars said that if Rabbi Joshua had not spoken so kindly to Onkelos he would probably have returned to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>In later years it was told of Onkelos that when he praised the virtues of God he said that even at the creation of the world God showed that his way was different from that of human rulers. A human ruler generally allows his goodness to be praised before he has achieved anything and before he has established courts or built public baths. His name is mentioned before his deeds. But of God the deeds are mentioned first and only then follows the praise.</p>
<p>According to the Christian Church-fathers, Onkelos was an adherent of Christianity first and Hadrian sent him as the representative of the government to Jerusalem where new decrees were then issued almost daily. At first the Jews were permitted to restore the temple, later it was commanded to convert the city to pagan purposes and its name was changed to &#x201C;Aelia Capitolina&#x201D; in honor of the Roman god Jupiter. But since Onkelos devoted himself to astrology, which the Christians considered as sinful, he was disowned by them and he turned to Judaism.</p>
<p>For those Jews who lived in the Greek speaking countries and did not know Hebrew but who wanted to acquaint themselves with the content of the Torah, there then existed a Greek translation of the Bible which was known as the &#x201C;Septuaginta&#x201D; or the translation of the seventy. But by that time this translation was considerably falsified and it included incorrect interpretations of various Biblical texts. Onkelos-Aquilas undertook to make a new translation which he accomplished with the consent of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. They later characterized it as an introduction of the beauty of Japheth (Greece) into the tents of Shem.</p>
<p>According to the Jerusalem Talmud, Aquilas was a colleague or a pupil of Rabbi Akiba, and he is said to have sanctioned the new translation of the Bible into Greek. Onkelos&#x2019; translation of the Bible became accepted among all the scholars and the Jerusalem Talmud quotes tens of words as Onkelos translated them in order to establish the meaning of various verses. It is also told that as a recognition of his authority in explaining the Bible, Hadrian consulted Onkelos in elucidating a certain text. <sup><xref rid="fn213">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Today we possess an Aramaic version of Onkelos&#x2019; Greek translation (Targum Onkelos) which has become sanctified almost to the same degree as the Hebrew Bible text. When the Christian Church-father Hieronymus later translated the Bible into Latin he extensively used Onkelos&#x2019; Greek translation. Commenting on it he said that it was a poor translation because &#x201C;the translator slavishly followed the Hebrew text and translated literally without taking into consideration the Greek language and its syntax.&#x201D; The Jews adopted the translation of Onkelos, Hieronymus said, and some Jewish communities which employed Greek as the spoken language read Onkelos&#x2019; translation on the Sabbath instead of the Hebrew text of the Torah or they read both versions.</p>
<p>Onkelos&#x2019; conversion apparently occurred after the destruction of Jerusalem during the time that Rabban Gamliel II was Nasi, for Onkelos is frequently mentioned together with Rabban Gamliel. Thus it is told that they were both in Ascalon and Rabban Gamliel performed his ablutions in an ordinary bath house. But since Ascalon was considered to be outside the boundaries of the Land of Israel, Onkelos considered an ordinary bath house there to be unclean and he bathed in the sea instead. <sup><xref rid="fn214">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabban Gamliel died the Talmud relates that Onkelos burned sixty pounds of incense at the funeral, as was customary during the funeral of a king. When he was asked by the scholars why he did so, he replied, &#x201C;In my eyes Rabban Gamliel was more important than a hundred Roman kings.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Aquilas-Onkelos was very pious and although the temple no longer existed he observed all the regulations of cleanliness which pious Jews observed when the temple was still in existence. When Aquilas-Onkelos inherited the wealth of his father he refused to derive any benefit from the golden and silver idols and cast them into the Dead Sea. <sup><xref rid="fn215">7)</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn208">&#x002A;) The name Aquilas closely resembles Onkelos in the Palestinian pronounciation. The &#x201C;Ain&#x201D; is pronounced as a nasal sound and resembles a &#x201C;Nun.&#x201D; The stories related in the Talmud and Midrashim regarding Onkelos are substantially the same as those told in other places regarding Aquilas. The main difference is in that the Babylonian Talmud relates Onkelos to Titus and Rabban Gamliel the elder, which would indicate that he lived at the time of the destruction of the temple, while Aquilas is connected with Hadrian and Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh which would indicate that he lived after the destruction. Some historians are therefore of the opinion that Onkelos and Aquilas are two different persons. But the Gaon of Vilna believed that they were the same person and he corrected (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D8;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05E0;&#x05F4;&#x05D5;</span>) to read: &#x201C;the son of the sister of Hadrian&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;the son of the sister of Titus.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah</title>
<p>F<small>ROM WHAT WAS SAID</small> in the previous chapters it is to be seen that the material position of the Jews continually deteriorated due to the political circumstances. The Roman officials oppressed and persecuted the population to the limit of their ability. Property was stolen and any opposition was considered as treason against the state and was punishable by death. There was no authority from which to seek redress. The way to Rome was long and difficult and by the time one decree was rescinded another one was issued and negotiations had to start from the beginning to have its effects ameliorated, or a new governor would be appointed who would start his reign with a wave of persecution.</p>
<p>The country then sank into deep poverty. For this reason so much was spoken of the wealth of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah and it was said that only the tithe of the newborn cattle which he offered amounted to twelve thousand calves a year. Others said that whoever sees Rabbi Elazar in his dream is to take it as a sign of coming wealth, and when Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah died it was said that wealth departed from the learned.</p>
<p>The primary source of Rabbi Elazar&#x2019;s wealth was the inheritance which he received at his father&#x2019;s death, but he also engaged in commercial enterprises and traded in wine and oil despite the prohibition of the scholars against trading with the necessities of life in Palestine. It was said of Rabbi Elazar that he was charitable and whenever he found a person who was willing to study but did not possess the means for his sustenance, he supported him. But in spite of his charities Rabbi Elazar said that no person should give away more than one-fifth of his possessions for charity.</p>
<p>During the dispute with Rabban Gamliel II, which was described before, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was chosen Nasi. The reason why he was chosen from among other candidates who may have been better qualified for the office was because it was believed that he would easily relinquish the office in case of a reconciliation with Rabban Gamliel. In addition he was also respected because of his great wealth and his aristocratic origin. Rabban Gamliel was a descendant of Hillel the Old, five generations removed, who was a scion of the House of David. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was a tenth generation direct descendant of Ezra the Scribe.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was chosen Nasi he was still a very young man&#x2014;according to tradition he was only 17 or 18 years old. Feeling grieved because of his youth and afraid that the people would not respect him because of it, he arose one morning to find that eighteen rows of gray hair had appeared overnight. (According to the Jerusalem Talmud Rabbi Elazar was really seventy years old when he exclaimed &#x201C;I am like a man of seventy.&#x201D;) But it is certain that despite his youth Rabbi Elazar was well versed in Halacha. His learning he probably gained from his father who was a scholar of such renown that even his brother was always referred to as Simeon the brother of Azariah.</p>
<p>In praise of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah he was likened to a &#x201C;basket full of incense&#x201D; and to a dealer in perfumes who comes to a city and everybody gathers around him asking: &#x201C;Have you good oils? Have you essence of roses?&#x201D; and they find that he has all of these. Even thus the scholars came to Rabbi Elazar and whatever they sought they found with him. If they asked a question about the Torah he answered from the Torah; if he was asked about the Mishna he answered from the Mishna; the same with exposition, law or legend. He knew them all and possessed all knowledge.</p>
<p>In later years Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was often found in the company of Rabban Gamliel. They travelled together with other scholars in the interests of the people. Although he was no longer Nasi, he accompanied the leaders of Jabneh whenever he was asked to do so, and for this reason it was said that a generation which can boast of a Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah should not be considered an orphaned generation.</p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah especially excelled in exposition. He was careful not to break up the text into its component words and letters but clung to the realistic interpretation of the verses. He compared the Torah to a plant: just as a plant grows even so do the words of the Torah. When he noticed that the people were losing their confidence and respect for the scholars because of the differences of opinion which prevailed and that whenever one of them declared a thing to be clean some one else would declare it to be unclean, he said: Whenever scholars differ in the interpretation of the Torah and seemingly contradict each other, for one says clean and the other unclean, one prohibits while the other permits, it must not be concluded that there is any doubt about these questions, for all these opinions are derived from the same Torah. It is necessary to listen closely and with open heart to try to understand all that is said by those who declare a thing to be clean as well as by those who declare it to be unclean, by those who permit as well as by those who prohibit. <sup><xref rid="fn216">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is told that Rabbi Akiba often tried to draw Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah to his own method of exposition, but Rabbi Elazar said: &#x201C;Akiba, what have you to do with Hagadah? Finish your speech and return to pondering the laws pertaining to plagues.&#x201D; On another occasion Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi Akiba: &#x201C;Even if you were to speak to me all day I would not be persuaded.&#x201D; Altogether different were the relations between Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah and Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin who exerted a great influence on his method of exposition. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah even adopted some of the latter&#x2019;s sayings such as, &#x201C;Whoever profanes the festivals is like one who worships idols.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Of the teachings of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah particular significance should be attached to those of his maxims which lay down a practical foundation for man&#x2019;s moral and religious obligations. He said, &#x201C;All those sins which a man commits against God are forgiven on the Day of Atonement, but sins which are committed by man against man are not forgiven on the Day of Atonement until the man who was sinned against forgives his malefactor.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He who listens to gossip or gossips about others,&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar said, &#x201C;may be compared to a person who bears false witness against his neighbor and should be severely condemned.&#x201D; And commenting on the Biblical injunction to reprimand a person who had committed some wrong, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said: &#x201C;I doubt if there exists a man today who knows how to reprimand his neighbor properly.&#x201D; Regarding God&#x2019;s prohibition of the eating of the flesh of a pig Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said, &#x201C;One must not say, &#x2018;I am disgusted with it and therefore I cannot eat it&#x2019;, but one should rather say, &#x2018;I would gladly eat of it but my Father in heaven has forbidden me.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>God rewards every good deed even when the doer had his personal benefit in mind. Thus the Egyptians kept the Jews in Egypt for their own benefit, nevertheless God commanded that no Egyptian be put to shame, for we were permitted to live in their land. We must therefore forget the hard labor with which the Egyptians oppressed the Jews and must only remember their generosity in allowing us to live in their country.</p>
<p>It was natural for Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah to value highly the observance of the Sabbath, nevertheless he said that whenever human life is at stake the Sabbath may be disregarded. Speaking of the significance of the commandments he concluded that the commandments were like the roots of a tree while the study of the Torah could be compared to its branches. He said: &#x201C;One whose wisdom is greater than his deeds, what is he like? He is like a tree whose branches are many and whose roots are few and the wind comes and uproots it and turns it on its face. But one whose deeds exceed his wisdom, what is he like? He is like a tree whose branches are few and its roots are many and even though all the winds that are in the world come and blow upon it they stir it not from its place.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There are few statements of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah regarding the Jews as a nation, but one expression is characteristic of his outlook. Pertaining to this subject he said: &#x201C;It is written in the Torah, &#x2018;You have this day chosen me as your God and I have chosen you as my people.&#x2019; By this God meant to say, &#x2018;You have given me one title and I have granted you one title. Even as you believe that I am the only God in the world so do I believe that you are one people in the world. God is one for his people Israel and Israel is the only people of God.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>An important question under discussion at that time was the commandment of &#x201C;Yibum&#x201D; and &#x201C;Halitza.&#x201D; The Torah commanded that if a man dies childless it shall be the duty of his brother to marry the widow. If the brother refuses to do so he must grant the widow &#x201C;Halitza.&#x201D; At that time there arose the question what to do in case the widow refuses to marry her deceased husband&#x2019;s brother. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah ruled that if the brother has some defect which would make him socially undesirable he may be forced to grant &#x201C;Halitza&#x201D; to the widow instead of marrying her.</p>
<p>When it was once remarked that a Sanhedrin which issues a death sentence once in seven years should be designated as a &#x201C;bloody&#x201D; Sanhedrin, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah added that even if a death sentence is issued once in seventy years it is a murderous deed.</p>
<p>The last days of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah marked the beginning of the great rebellion. The scholars then left Jabneh and the academy was disbanded. Rabbi Elazar went to Sephoris and the Sanhedrin moved to Usha. The Talmud relates <sup><xref rid="fn217">2)</xref></sup> how the Sanhedrin wandered from Jabneh to Usha and then back to Jabneh. Later it left Jabneh a second time for Usha and thence to Shfarom and other places. Rashi attempts to explain these wanderings by saying that the Sanhedrin followed wherever the Nasi or his son settled. When other historians accepted this explanation they became confused in the sequence of events. What is more likely is that the Sanhedrin left Jabneh due to the persecution of the Roman government and not in order to follow the Nasi. At that time the Jews had no Nasi. Rabban Gamliel II was dead and the people feared to elect a new Nasi because the Romans disapproved of this office whose holders were looked up to as scions of the royal House of David and were therefore accorded royal honors. The people looked upon the Nasi as a Jewish king who was being interferred with by the Gentile rulers. At the time that the Sanhedrin moved to Usha, it may be assumed that the Roman government already came to the conclusion that they would never subdue the Jews as long as they observed the Torah. This also seems to be the reason why the Romans allowed every people to cling to its god as long as they paid their taxes to the government while at the same time they undertook to annihilate the Jewish people through the annihilation of the Torah.</p>
<p>As was remarked above, we cannot now determine the exact years of the wanderings of the Sanhedrin and whether it visited Usha twice or the repetition was merely an error of the copyists. It is also unknown whether the sessions of the Sanhedrin in Usha were officially sanctioned or they took place secretly. Usha was a city in Galilee situated between Acco and Safed. During the constant revolutionary struggles of that time it is possible that the Roman government had no control over this city or that the military governor overlooked the actions of the Jews. This supposition may explain the transfer of the Sanhedrin from Jabneh to Usha.</p>
<p>It is certain that no cases affecting life were discussed there. But it was necessary to introduce various new rules which were necessitated by the times. Life continued in its development and the moral and material circumstances of the time required new regulations. It therefore became imperative to meet in order to determine various innovations.</p>
<p>Regarding the convocation at Usha it is told that a call was sent out to all the elders of Galilee that &#x201C;whoever is learned shall come to teach others and whoever is not learned should come to learn.&#x201D; Great numbers of people, responded to this call and when the time came for them to depart they said: &#x201C;This place received us in such a friendly manner, should we leave it empty?&#x201D; They therefore honored Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai who was a native of the city with an office although he was not the greatest of the scholars but because &#x201C;the place adds to the honor of the man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The people who gathered in Usha are referred to in the Talmud as the &#x201C;wanderers to Usha&#x201D; because they were men who lived elsewhere. In bidding farewell to the scholars who returned to their homes Rabbi Jehudah ben Elai said, &#x201C;May God reward you for your effort in coming here, for one had to come ten miles, another twenty; one came a distance of thirty miles and another forty in order to hear the words of the Torah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn218">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We bring some of the most important regulations which were adopted by the Sanhedrin in Usha as characterising those times.</p>
<p>1) Since every man must provide for his children when they are small and cannot earn their own bread, it was decided that every father must provide for his son until the age of thirteen and for his daughter until the age of twelve. Because of the persecutions of the government, many men were forced to flee their homes. This regulation&#x2014;the responsibility of the father toward his children&#x2014;was a hint that one may not leave his family, and if one is forced to save his life by flight he must first provide for his wife and children.</p>
<p>2) If a man wills his property to his children, the heirs must support the father and mother as long as they live, and also the small children which were not included in the will. Until that time, any person who distributed his property to his heirs during his life time lost all rights to it and had to depend on the generosity of his heirs for his support.</p>
<p>3) Due to the great need which prevailed among the people there were some individuals who denied themselves all worldly pleasures and distributed all their possessions to the poor. The assembly at Usha ruled that even one who is used to giving much for charity must not give more than one-fifth of his possessions and after that not more than one-fifth of his annual income.</p>
<p>4) It was ruled that a father should deal kindly with his son until the age of twelve. If, after the age of twelve, the son refuses to obey his father, the latter was entitled to chastise him with a whip or to refuse him food.</p>
<p>5) If a woman brought to her husband <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05E0;&#x05DB;&#x05E1;&#x05D9; &#x05DE;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05D2;&#x05F4;</span> (property which belonged to the wife exclusively but the fruits of which the husband could enjoy) and then she sold this property during the lifetime of her husband, the husband was entitled to claim the property after his wife&#x2019;s death.</p>
<p>6) The law of possession was also defined at this gathering (Chazakah). Just as an ox who gored three times was to be legally considered as a dangerous beast and its owner was to be punished according to the law, thus also, if a man held an article for three years, he gained the right of possession to it.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha</title>
<p>O<small>N THE HISTORIC DAY</small> that the scholars of Jabneh revolted against Rabban Gamliel and elected Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah as Nasi, there was present among those gathered one, Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, who participated in the discussions and the decisions of that day.</p>
<p>While still a child he was arrested by the Romans. It is unknown for what transgression he was thus punished. Also unknown are the circumstances of his death. His name is therefore frequently confused with that of his grandfather who was known as Ishmael the High Priest and who was killed before the destruction of the Temple together with Rabban Gamliel the Elder.</p>
<p>The story of how Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania ransomed Rabbi Ishmael from captivity is told in the following manner. Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania was visiting a certain large Roman city in the cause of his people and he was told that within the prison there was a beautiful black eyed, curly headed Jewish boy who was held captive and was to be sold to some degenerate lascivious Roman. Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania approached the prison to speak with the boy and he began with a verse from Isaiah (42:24): Who gave Jacob to the looters and Israel to robbers? The boy responded with the second half of the verse, It is God, against whom we have sinned refusing to follow in his ways and to obey his teachings.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Joshua heard this he remarked: &#x201C;I feel certain that this boy will grow to be a teacher in Israel. I therefore swear that I will not move from here until I have ransomed this boy for whatever money may be asked.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua ransomed the boy from captivity and before long he became a teacher among the Jews. This was Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. <sup><xref rid="fn219">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In later years Rabbi Ishmael was a pupil of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakana. All the scholars came to call him &#x201C;brother&#x201D; and when he debated the interpretation of some text with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, the latter said to him: &#x201C;Brother Ishmael, you can uproot mountains with your wisdom.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael showed the greatest reverence for his teachers. Only with Rabbi Akiba did he differ on occasions in the interpretation of Biblical texts. Rabbi Ishmael followed his own system in expounding the Scriptures and he often said: &#x201C;The Torah used the language of ordinary people.&#x201D; He therefore maintained that no particular significance need be ascribed to seemingly superfluous words which occur in the Scriptures. Rabbi Akiba, on the other hand, counted the letters of every word and sought hidden meaning in the slightest dot.</p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael held to a definite system in his studies, and like Hillel the Old, he also established thirteen rules according to which the Torah is to be explained.</p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha was descended from a priestly family and the legends refer to him as &#x201C;High Priest&#x201D; although he lived after the destruction of the Temple when there could be no high priests. When Rabbi Ishmael said: &#x201C;I swear by the vestments of my father and by the golden headpiece between his eyes&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn220">2)</xref></sup> he probably referred to his grandfather, for we find numerous occasions where grandfathers are called &#x201C;father.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The permanent residence of Rabbi Ishmael was in the village Aziz in southern Palestine. From there he frequently came to Jabneh to participate in the deliberations of the Sanhedrin. This custom he also followed after the Sanhedrin moved to Usha. When he was asked about his ancestral home he said that it was desolate, for the people of his town settled monetary disputes before one judge only and they also tended sheep in the Land of Israel which was then prohibited. <sup><xref rid="fn221">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the occasion of the death of his sons, the greatest scholars of the time (R. Tarphon, R. Jose of Galilee, R. Elazar ben Azaria and R. Akiba) came to console him. Before entering the house, Rabbi Tarphon warned them to be careful of every word they said, for Rabbi Ishmael was renowned for his scholarship and it was necessary to speak carefully to him. As they came in, Rabbi Ishmael greeted them with the following words: &#x201C;When a man sins, he is overcome with sorrow and must disturb his superiors.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Data regarding the death of Rabbi Ishmael is extremely confused. There is a legend that (Rabbi) Ishmael the High Priest was one of the Ten Martyrs. He is considered to be identical with Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. But one must bear in mind that none of the High Priests were ever entitled Rabbi. It seems that the grandson&#x2019;s title of Rabbi was ascribed to his grandfather and the martyrdom of the grandfather was ascribed to the grandson.</p>
<p>The Talmud relates that once, when R. Ishmael the High Priest was performing the service in the Temple on the Day of Atonement, he went into the Holy of Holies and there he beheld the face of God. <sup><xref rid="fn222">4)</xref></sup> On another occasion he is said to have been revealed mysteries by Suriel, the Angel before the face of God. <sup><xref rid="fn223">5)</xref></sup> It therefore seems certain that these legends deal with the grandfather of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. We have previously related that during the reign of Agrippa II there officiated a pious High Priest named Ishmael ben Phabi who later complained to the Roman authorities about the king. Some historians maintain that Ishmael ben Phabi was the grandfather of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. This, however, is hardly plausible since Ishmael ben Phabi died a natural death and did not suffer martyrdom.<xref rid="fn224">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>The High Priesthood, which some legends ascribe to Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, may be explained by the fact that he was considered worthy of occupying the office of his grandfather. Since everybody then looked forward to a speedy restoration of the temple, it was probably said that Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha was the outstanding claimant to the office and thus came to call him &#x201C;High Priest.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is told that when Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Simeon (not designated more clearly) were led to execution, Rabbi Simeon said to Rabbi Ishmael: &#x201C;Rabbi, my heart quivers with fear, for I do not know for what sins I am being executed.&#x201D; Rabbi Ishmael answered him: &#x201C;Did never a man come to you to ask a question or to settle a dispute and you made him wait until you finished drinking your water, or lacing your shoe or wrapping your shawl about yourself? By doing so you have transgressed against the commandment of the Torah not to cause suffering to a widow or an orphan which is punishable by death irrespective of whether the suffering caused was great or small.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn225">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The same story is related in a similar form but with a clearer designation of the names of the participants: <sup><xref rid="fn226">7)</xref></sup> When Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel was being led to execution he thought of his past deeds and exclaimed: &#x201C;Woe to us, that we are led to execution as if we were the greatest criminals who deserve death.&#x201D; Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha answered him, &#x201C;Possibly it is so because poor men waited at your door and were not admitted while you ate?&#x201D;, but Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel replied, &#x201C;I swear by Heaven that I never acted so. On the contrary, whenever I ate I had guards posted outside to bring in all the poor people who should happen to pass that they too may eat with me and praise God.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As they approached the place of execution, each one of them begged of the guard to be executed first. Rabbi Ishmael said: &#x201C;I am a Priest, the son of High Priests and I must not see my comrade killed.&#x201D; Rabban Simeon said, &#x201C;I am a Nasi, the son of a Nasi. Do not let me see the death of my friend.&#x201D;</p>
<p>If Rabbi Ishmael was executed together with Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, then this could have happened only before the destruction and he could have been no other than the grandfather of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. But in other places it is said that Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha also suffered martyrdom and it is told that when Rabbi Akiba heard of his death, he rent his garments and exclaimed to his disciples: &#x201C;We must now prepare for calamity.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn227">8)</xref></sup> It is also said in the Talmud, <sup><xref rid="fn228">9)</xref></sup> that whoever sees Rabbi Ishmael in his dream must expect some calamity to befall him.</p>
<p>A maxim of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha was the following: &#x201C;Be submissive to the ruler, patient under oppression and receive everyone with cheerfulness. <sup><xref rid="fn229">10)</xref></sup> It is also known that in any dispute between man and wife Rabbi Ishmael took the part of the wife. He used to say: &#x201C;Jewish daughters are beautiful but poverty destroys their beauty.&#x201D; At his death it was therefore said that Jewish women should bewail his passing away even as king David exclaimed when mourning the death of Saul.</p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael always heeded the simple meaning of the Biblical texts. When he debated this question with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus he exclaimed: &#x201C;As I see it, you would have the simple meaning of each verse preceded by your exposition of it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael also established the rule that there is no prior and no latter in the Torah. The chapters of the Torah were not written according to the chronological order of the events, and when some statement is repeated, this repetition must be considered a sign that a new meaning is intended. The legal regulations, he believed, must be in accord with the text and in case of contradiction between the accepted law and the text of the Torah, the law must be made to conform with the Torah. Only in three instances did he recognize the validity of laws which were at variance with the Bible.</p>
<p>In Deuteronomy (12:3) God says to Moses and Aaron to tell the Jews that each should take a lamb for the Paschal offering. Rabbi Ishmael asked: &#x201C;Is it possible that both heard the words of God and that both spoke to the Jewish people?&#x201D; But he explained it to mean that when Moses spoke, Aaron listened attentively to what he had to say, and it was considered as if both heard the words of God.</p>
<p>In case an ox gores a man and kills him, it is possible that the animal is known to be dangerous and that its owner has been warned and would therefore have to forfeit his life together with the beast. Nevertheless the Bible offers the owner of the animal an opportunity to redeem himself by the payment of a sum of money. (Exodus, 21:30.) Of such a case Rabbi Ishmael said: &#x201C;Here we may see the great mercy of the Creator who permits a man to redeem himself with money from a well-earned punishment.&#x201D;</p>
<p>If a man owned a Jewish slave and freed him at the end of six years, the Torah commanded that the slave should not be sent away empty handed but that he should be given gifts from the herd, the threshing floor and the wine cellar. (Deut. 15:14.) Rabbi Ishmael said, &#x201C;Come and see how great is the mercy of the Creator who says to a man, &#x2018;If a Jewish slave has worked for you and you send him away empty handed, he will have to beg from door to door or he will be forced to sell himself into slavery again. It is better that you give him some of that with which God has blessed you that he should not have to beg or to sell himself to another master.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>Mourning for the destroyed Temple occupied a central place in the thoughts of Rabbi Ishmael even as it did with all his colleagues. He said: &#x201C;Since the Temple is destroyed, it were better not to eat flesh nor to drink wine, but such a decree could not be complied with. It is the same with marriage. So long as Rome rules the Jews with severe decrees and does not allow us to observe all the commandments of the Torah, it were better that no Jew should marry and bring children into the world. But in doing so the seed of Abraham would be annihilated.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As was mentioned above, there exists no certain information concerning the death of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha and there is also no substantiation for the legend which relates that a son and a daughter of Rabbi Ishmael the High Priest were sold into slavery to two Roman nobles who attempted to marry them to each other. <sup><xref rid="fn230">11)</xref></sup> Whether this event happened to Ishmael the High Priest and contemporary of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the Elder or it occurred to the children of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha who was the pupil of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania and the friend of Rabbi Akiba remains unknown.</p>
<p>Worthy of mention is the Talmudic legend <sup><xref rid="fn231">12)</xref></sup> concerning the death of Rabbi Ishmael the High Priest. Because of his great beauty Rabbi Ishmael was loved by the emperor&#x2019;s daughter and at his execution she begged that his head be given to her. She later removed the skin from the head and she had it preserved. It was also said that once every seventy years a man of Rome was chosen and the head of Rabbi Ishmael was placed on him, sometimes the king himself tried on the skin of Rabbi Ishmael&#x2019;s face or placed his head upon himself.</p>
<p>From all these legends we can gather that the political situation during the lifetime of Rabbi Ishmael was a sad one and became worse as time went on. The Sanhedrin could no longer meet even in Usha and the academy of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha became the center of Jewish spiritual life. Whatever was discussed in that academy later became immortalized in many sayings and decisions of the pupils of Rabbi Ishmael who repeated his moral and legal teachings during his lifetime and after his death.</p>
<p>The location of the academy has not been determined but it apparently was situated in a region over which the Roman government had no control. The Roman rulers had, by that time, discovered the secret that in order to rule Palestine they must suppress the Jewish religion. It was then prohibited to observe the Jewish faith and the maintenance of an academy was punishable by death. A law was also promulgated that if any scholar ordains (Semicha) a pupil, both the teacher and the pupil were to be executed.</p>
<p>Of the legal and moral teachings of the school of Rabbi Ishmael, some possess permanent ethical value and may be used as examples for all times. Other decisions of the school mirror the political and social conditions of the land. The following are instances of the latter: &#x201C;Whoever lives for forty years without suffering should take it as a sign that he has received his share of peace and should be satisfied,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn232">13)</xref></sup> or: &#x201C;One may add a measure of ground salt to a basket of grain without being guilty of deception, if together they are sold for the price of grain because the grain is thereby saved from worms.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn233">14)</xref></sup> The same may be said of the opinion which was rendered that in time of danger it is permissible to write a bill of divorce and to hand it to the woman even though the writer does not know the man. <sup><xref rid="fn234">15)</xref></sup> Commenting in this sentence Rashi says that it refers to such cases as that of a man who fell into a well and he shouted that whoever hears his voice should write a bill of divorce. In such a case one may believe the man that he is the person that he claims to be, for if he disbelieved the opportunity may be lost and his wife may remain an &#x201C;Agunah&#x201D; for life.</p>
<p>It may well be imagined that the Jews suffered at that time from spies and false reports which were carried by people against each other. The school of Rabbi Ishmael therefore ruled that spreading slanderous reports is a sin of the same magnitude as worshipping idols, immorality or blood shed. <sup><xref rid="fn235">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other significant teachings of Rabbi Ishmael&#x2019;s school were the following:</p>
<p>If you see a scholar committing a sin at night, you should not think of it the following day, for he has probably repented. Nor must you doubt it, for he has certainly repented. This rule, however, applied only to corporeal sins. Where money was involved it was necessary to ascertain that the money had been returned. <sup><xref rid="fn236">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He who wishes to be unclean, is permitted to do so; he who wishes to become clean must be aided. One who sells kerosene and spices may be taken as an example. If a customer desires kerosene, he tells him, &#x201C;Go, please, and fill the container yourself.&#x201D; But when a customer comes to buy spices, he says to him, &#x201C;Let us measure it together that we may both enjoy its fragrance.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn237">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When God was angry at the sin of the spies, he relented after Moses&#x2019; prayer and said &#x201C;I have forgiven according to your words&#x201D;. (Numbers, 14:20.) The meaning of this is that when the Gentiles will hear of it they will say: &#x201C;Happy is the pupil whose teacher agrees with his words.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn238">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>God&#x2019;s words are like fire and like a hammer which crushes rocks. (Jer. 23:19.) Just as a hammer crushes a rock into many pieces even so can God&#x2019;s word be explained in seventy languages. <sup><xref rid="fn239">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to use clean language the Scriptures employed six words instead of one as in the case of Sam. I, 20:26. Man must learn from it to form his language in the same manner. <sup><xref rid="fn240">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Four times a year God sits in judgment over the world: On Passover He judges the fate of the harvest of grain; on Shavuoth He judges the fate of the fruit of the trees; on Succoth the amount of rain during the coming year is determined. Man is judged on Rosh Hashana and his sentence is signed on the Day of Atonement. <sup><xref rid="fn241">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the conduct of the world, it is a law that the innocent may atone for the guilty, but the guilty may not atone for the guilty. <sup><xref rid="fn242">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>If two people engage in a fight, the Bible says that he who beats his friend shall heal the victim (Ex. 21:20). This indicates that it is permissible to engage in healing the sick. <sup><xref rid="fn243">24)</xref></sup></p>

<p>How do we know that the &#x201C;Schechinah&#x201D; is omnipresent? It is said, &#x201C;When the angel that spoke to you went out another angel came to meet him.&#x201D; (Zechar. 2:7) Since it does not say that the other angel left after the first one, but that he came to meet him, we may conclude from this that the &#x201C;Schechinah&#x201D; is present everywhere. <sup><xref rid="fn245">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>God commanded that during the offering of the burnt sacrifice the priest must wear one garment while burning it and another when carrying out the ashes. (Lev. 7:4) This verse means to teach us proper conduct. The garments which one wears while preparing food for his master must not be worn while filling his beaker. <sup><xref rid="fn246">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the Bible commands man to be generous to the poor in order to gain the blessing of God, it employs the word &#x201C;Biglal&#x201D;. (Deut. 15:10) The use of this word shows us that fortune is like a wheel which constantly turns. One day fortune smiles on one, the next on another. <sup><xref rid="fn247">28)</xref></sup> (A play in words is here engaged in. <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D1;&#x05D2;&#x05DC;&#x05DC;&#x05F4;</span> means in order that; <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D2;&#x05DC;&#x05D2;&#x05DC;&#x05F4;</span> means a wheel.)</p>
<p>Why is the lobe of one&#x2019;s ear soft while the rest of the ear is hard? So that he may stuff his ear with the lobe when he hears something unworthy. <sup><xref rid="fn248">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whoever gives from his possessions for charitable purposes is saved from Gehenna. It is like the case of two sheep that have to cross a stream, one of which is shorn while the other is not. The shorn sheep wades through the water while the unshorn one remains behind. <sup><xref rid="fn249">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the case of a day laborer the Bible says: &#x201C;You shall give him his wage the same day before the sun sets for he is a poor man&#x201D;. (Deut. 24:15) But there is no difference whether the wage of a man, an animal or the rent for borrowed vessels is concerned. All must be paid for on the same day and their wage must not be held overnight. <sup><xref rid="fn250">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the Bible says, &#x201C;a man or a woman who commit a sin&#x201D; (Numbers 5:7) it intends to show that in the eyes of the Torah a woman is punishable for her sins the same as a man. <sup><xref rid="fn251">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Friday noon the Shofar was blown six times as a sign that the Sabbath was beginning. At the first blast of the Shofar, all men who were in the fields ceased working. Then all men came from near and far and gathered before the gates of the city so that they may enter it together. The stores were meanwhile still open but the bolts for the doors were held in readiness. After the second blast of the Shofar it was necessary to lock the stores but the pots still remained in the ovens. The Shofar was blown a third time after which all pots were removed from the ovens and candles were lit. After that the people waited a period of time which it takes to bake a small fish, or to place the bread in the oven and then three blasts of the Shofar were blown at once and the Sabbath began. <sup><xref rid="fn252">33)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Tarphon</title>
<p>A <small>REMARKABLE</small> and unusual personality of that time was Rabbi Tarphon. The name Tarphon is derived from the Greek, Tryphon. He is mentioned once by that name in the Jerusalem Talmud. The period of his influence and activity extended from the destruction of the Temple until the destruction of Betar.</p>
<p>Rabbi Tarphon was descended from a priestly family and he told that once, while pronouncing the benediction together with the other Priests, he bent close to the High Priest in order to hear him pronounce the express name of God and he was seized by a great terror.<xref rid="fn253">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>On another occasion, when the question was discussed whether the singers in the Temple must be without fault even as the Priests were required to be, Rabbi Tarphon swore that he remembered his uncle, his mother&#x2019;s brother, who was lame and nevertheless blew a trumpet in the temple while the Levites sang. Rabbi Akiba asked him whether it was not a special festive occasion when such a thing would be permitted. Rabbi Tarphon replied: &#x201C;It is as you say. It is remarkable that I witnessed it but forgot the nature of the occasion while you were not there yet you know what happened.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn254">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>What happened to Rabbi Tarphon at the time of the destruction and how he escaped the city is unknown. Later he settled in Lud and often came to Jabneh to participate in the sessions of the Sanhedrin. He was also present on the memorable day when Rabbi Gamliel was impeached. But he did not figure as a candidate for the office of Nasi despite his wealth and his great scholarship that was so extensive that whenever he sat with other scholars and someone came to ask a question he was the first to express an opinion.</p>
<p>As a scholar he was named &#x201C;the father of Israel,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn255">2)</xref></sup> and every time that a dispute arose regarding some law he was very severe in his expressions. He frequently invoked old traditions with an oath that &#x201C;if it is not as he says then may he lose his children.&#x201D; When, after such an oath, Rabbi Akiba said to him: &#x201C;I think that you have heard wrong,&#x201D; Rabbi Tarphon conceded his mistake and said: &#x201C;Akiba, whoever departs from you is like one who departs from life.&#x201D; Whenever Rabbi Akiba saw a person who did not show proper respect for Rabbi Tarphon, he was ready to punish him severely. Thus it is told that one of the pupils, Jehudah ben Nehemia, once asked Rabbi Tarphon a difficult question which he could not answer. Rabbi Akiba said to that pupil, &#x201C;Your face is joyous that you have asked the old man something which he could not answer. I shall therefore not be surprised if you will not live long.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The legend further relates that this occurred sometime before Passover, and when the scholars gathered again on Shavuoth, Jehudah ben Nehemiah, no longer lived.</p>
<p>But we must not conclude that such occurrences of Rabbi Tarphon&#x2019;s inability to answer questions happened frequently, for his learnedness was likened to a heap of nuts. <sup><xref rid="fn256">3)</xref></sup> The meaning of this simile is explained <sup><xref rid="fn257">4)</xref></sup> in this manner&#x2014;just as several other nuts roll from the heap which is disturbed when one nut is taken away, so also Rabbi Tarphon responded to questions; he immediately adduced proof from the Scriptures, the Midrash, the Mishna as well as from Halachah and Hagadah.</p>
<p>Although the Temple was no longer in existence, Rabbi Tarphon continued to gather tithes from all those who would offer them. Rabban Gamliel once met him in the morning and asked why he was absent from the academy on the previous day and Rabbi Tarphon replied that he was occupied with the &#x201C;service&#x201D;. Greatly surprised, Rabban Gamliel said: &#x201C;Your words make me wonder for you say that you were engaged in service, but I do not know of any service that had to be performed on that day.&#x201D; To this Rabbi Tarphon answered, &#x201C;The eating of the tithes by a Priest in a city in the Land of Israel is like performing the service in the temple.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Rabbi Tarphon accepted tithes, he did so not out of poverty, for he was a wealthy man. He evidently followed the custom in order to give the people an opportunity to fulfill the commandment of offering tithes; he also never distinguished between the givers and accepted tithes from all. Nevertheless he was not gredy and although he was not a spendthrift he generally returned the sums which he received for &#x201C;Pidyon Haben&#x201D; in his capacity of a &#x201C;Cohen&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn258">5)</xref></sup> To aid the people during a time of famine, he exercised his priestly prerogative and married three hundred wives (&#x0021;) in order that as wives of a Priest they might partake of the tithes. <sup><xref rid="fn259">6)</xref></sup> In telling this story the Jerusalem Talmud employs the word <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D4;&#x05E2;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;&#x05F4;</span> to indicate that he tricked the law.</p>
<p>In public Rabbi Tarphon always conducted himself modestly, so that no one should recognize him outside of the academy and that he should derive no benefits because of his knowledge of the Torah. Only once did he reveal his identity in order to escape a beating. As he was trying to take some fruit from his own vineyard, the watchman caught him and was going to beat him. Rabbi Tarphon exclaimed: &#x201C;Woe to Tarphon that he is caught as a thief.&#x201D; The watchman recognized him and released him and since then Rabbi Tarphon was wont to say, &#x201C;Woe is me that I have made use of the crown of the Torah&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Constant differences of opinion regarding interpretations of the commandments existed between Rabbi Tarphon and Rabbi Akiba, but this did not mar the great friendship by which they were bound. Rabbi Tarphon once gave to Rabbi Akiba a sum of money with which to buy a field in order that they should have a permanent income and should be able to devote themselves to the Torah exclusively. Rabbi Akiba took the money and distributed it to the poor scholars.</p>
<p>This story is related in two versions. According to one version <sup><xref rid="fn260">7)</xref></sup> Rabbi Akiba said to Rabbi Tarphon: &#x201C;If you wish, I will buy for you a village or two.&#x201D; Rabbi Akiba took this money and distributed it to the poor. Sometime later Rabbi Tarphon met Rabbi Akiba and said to him: &#x201C;Where are the villages that you were to buy for me?&#x201D; Rabbi Akiba took him by the hand and led him to the academy where he distributed the money.</p>
<p>The other version relates <sup><xref rid="fn261">8)</xref></sup> that Rabbi Tarphon gave to Rabbi Akiba six hundred measures of silver and asked him to buy a field that they may both derive an income and be able to devote themselves to study. Rabbi Akiba distributed the whole sum to the scribes and the students of the academy. Some time later Rabbi Tarphon asked, &#x201C;Have you bought the field of which I told you?&#x201D; When Rabbi Akiba said that he had bought the field, Rabbi Tarphon asked if he could see it and Rabbi Akiba showed him the scribes and students to whom he gave the money.</p>
<p>Characteristic of Rabbi Tarphon&#x2019;s outlook was the occasion when he sat together with other Elders in Lud and they discussed the question of what is of greater importance, study or the fulfillment of the commandments. Rabbi Tarphon said that observance of the commandments was of greater importance. Rabbi Akiba maintained that study is more important and the other scholars concurred with the opinion of Rabbi Akiba, for &#x201C;learning leads one to the observance of the commandments.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This opinion, that observance of the commandments is of the highest importance, is also expressed in other statements of Rabbi Tarphon who compared the relationship of man to his Creator to the relationship existing between a laborer and his employer. There exists one of his maxims, for instance, in which he says: &#x201C;The day is short and the work is great and the laborers are sluggish, the wages are high and the master is urgent.&#x201D; He also said, &#x201C;It is not incumbent upon you to finish the work, nor are you free to avoid it. If you have learned much Torah you will be well rewarded and your master is trustworthy that he will pay you your wages.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn262">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking of the observance of the commandments, Rabbi Tarphon was led to speak of work in general. He then said that God did not permit the &#x201C;Schechinah&#x201D; to rest among the Jews until they completed the work of building the tabernacle. He also said that a man may die from idleness.</p>
<p>Rabbi Tarphon generally embellished his speech with expressions from the Torah which in his mouth assumed a new significance. Wishing to express approval, he exclaimed <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05DB;&#x05E4;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05E8; &#x05D5;&#x05E4;&#x05E8;&#x05D7;&#x05F4;</span> (a buttan and a bloom); to show disapproval he said, &#x201C;my son shall not go with you&#x201D; as an indication that he does not care to indulge in dispute and to express openly his disagreement.</p>
<p>A bitter struggle was then being waged against the early Christians who were Jews and Rabbi Tarphon was their severest opponent. He engaged in disputes with them in an attempt to dissuade them from their beliefs. This fact is also mentioned in the writings of the Christian Patriarch, the martyr Justinus. Rabbi Tarphon then said: &#x201C;May I lose my children if I would not burn their books, together with the mention of God that is made in them, if only I could obtain them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It has been remarked that Rabbi Tarphon frequently exclaimed, &#x201C;May I lose my children if this is not thus and so.&#x201D; He did lose some of his children and his wife also died. Remaining a widower and the father of children, he chose the sister of his wife for a bride, and after the funeral of his wife he said to her: &#x201C;Go feed the children of your deceased sister.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is also necessary to note the great respect in which Rabbi Tarphon held his mother. It is said that she once lost a shoe and descended barefoot to search for it and Rabbi Tarphon placed his hand under her foot that she may not hurt her foot while stepping on the bare ground.</p>
<p>It is to be assumed that Rabbi Tarphon lived more than seventy years. Traditions vary regarding his death. Some maintain that he was one of the Ten Martyrs while others deny it. <sup><xref rid="fn263">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>To the nature of Rabbi Tarphon&#x2019;s character it should be added that despite his angry disposition he nevertheless said, that if he were a member of the Sanhedrin at the time that it had a right to condemn people to death there would not have been a single death sentence passed.</p>
<ftnote id="fn253">&#x002A;) The &#x201C;Shem Hamforash,&#x201D; the express name of God, is the name JHVH, which was forbidden to be pronounced. Only the High Priest could pronounce it on the Day of Atonement, and even then he melodiously whispered it so that others might not hear it. In later years the Mishna ruled that whoever pronounces the name of God according to the manner in which it is written loses his share in the world to come. Before that time the scholars taught the Name to their pupils only once in seven years. (Kidushin, 71.) Later it was entirely forbidden. The Talmud says that Rabbi Chananiah ben Teradion was punished because he taught his pupils the &#x201C;Shem Hamforash.&#x201D; (Avoda Zara, 17.) In passing it is worth mentioning that the form in which Gentile Bible critics read the &#x201C;Shem Hamforash&#x201D; is certainly incorrect. In ancient times the Name probably combined the vowel dots of Adonai and Elohim, but the correct form has been forgotten.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Jose of Galilee</title>
<p>T<small>HE DISTRICT OF</small> G<small>ALILEE</small> in northern Palestine was inhabited by non-Jews throughout the period of the existence of the first temple. Only in later years, during the times of the second temple, did Jewish settlements begin to extend into Galilee as the density of the population in the rest of the land increased. The emigrants who left the cities of Judea to settle in Galilee were mostly people poor in economic and spiritual resources, and there developed in Galilee a native type of &#x201C;Ame Aratzim.&#x201D; When these men of Galilee visited Jerusalem and later Jabneh, or some other city where the Sanhedrin resided, they were ridiculed for their childish naivete and were frequently called &#x201C;Galilean fools.&#x201D; The inhabitants of Galilee were also easily recognized by their manner of speech and by their uncouth behavior and the opinion was commonly held that Galileans are fools incapable of learning and that it was a waste of effort to attempt to change them.</p>
<p>Then there suddenly arose a &#x201C;Galilean&#x201D; scholar who came to be ranked with the highest from his very first appearance and who later became known by his name, Rabbi Jose of Galilee. It occurred during a discussion regarding the rules governing the eating of the flesh of a first born animal that Rabbi Jose arose from among the disciples and proved that the two leaders of the academy&#x2014;Rabbi Tarphon and Rabbi Akiba&#x2014;were mistaken. One can readily imagine the surprise of all those gathered when they heard the Galilean present many proofs on behalf of his contention and they saw his firmness of conviction. <sup><xref rid="fn264">1)</xref></sup> When Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha heard the arguments of the Galilean he asked that Rabbi Akiba be told that he was in error and that the law was as the Galilean said.</p>
<p>Since that day Rabbi Jose remained among the scholars of Jabneh and he was accorded greater honors from day to day. Everybody respected him. His opinions generally conflicted with those of Rabbi Akiba and although he considered Rabbi Akiba to be his teacher he once remarked to him, &#x201C;Were you to argue all day I would not accept your opinion.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn265">2)</xref></sup> Another time he interrupted Rabbi Akiba during a lecture and said to him: &#x201C;How much longer will you speak of the Shechinah as one speaks of an everyday subject?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn266">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Later it was said that Rabbi Jose of Galilee &#x201C;gathers every crumb of Torah wherever he can, even from the least of the disciples, even as God chose Mount Sinai, which is the smallest of the mountains, from which to hand down the Torah to the Jews.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn267">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding the scholarship of Rabbi Jose it may be said that he succeeded in discerning that which others failed to see. Gentle as he was in his conduct he nevertheless was severe to all those who tried to turn the Jews away from God and he said: &#x201C;If someone tries to prove to you that his god is the right one, you must not believe him even if he was to stop the sun in the middle of the sky.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn268">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some historians maintain that Rabbi Jose was well advanced in age when he came to Jabneh from Galilee and that he was already renowned at that time for his scholarship. They believe that, since Galilee was affected less than other sections of Palestine at the beginning of the revolt preceding the destruction, it probably became a place of refuge for the peace loving elements among the Jews who fled there to escape the vengeance of the rebels. Among the refugees was the wealthy Azariah, the father of Rabbi Elazar, who sent his son to study with Rabbi Jose.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jose was widely known for his piety and the belief was widespread that were a drought to occur and Rabbi Jose was to pray for rain, he would undoubtedly obtain from God whatever he requested. It was also characteristic of the man that he was unhappy in his domestic life. The wife of Rabbi Jose, who was also his niece, was a wicked woman. She frequently shamed him in the presence of his pupils and when they asked their master why he does not divorce her, he answered that he could not do so because he did not possess enough money to pay her enormous &#x201C;Kethubah&#x201D; (dower-rights).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jose once returned home from the academy accompanied by his pupil, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah. His wife paid no attention to him nor to his guest, and when he asked her whether she had any food prepared she replied angrily: &#x201C;There is some boiled grass in the pot.&#x201D; Rabbi Jose uncovered the pot and found in it the flesh of fatted hens. Together with his pupil he partook of the repast. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah then said to him: &#x201C;She said that there was only boiled grass in the pot when it contained the flesh of hens. Why should she deceive you so?&#x201D; Rabbi Jose replied, &#x201C;Very probably a miracle occurred. She put grass into the pot, just as she told me, but the grass turned into the flesh of fattened hens.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After the meal was finished Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said, &#x201C;Rabbi, send this woman away from your house. She does not know how to appreciate your worth.&#x201D; But Rabbi Jose said, &#x201C;She has a large &#x2018;Kethubah&#x2019; and I have no money with which to pay it.&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar answered, &#x201C;We, your pupils, will provide the money to pay her &#x2018;Kethubah&#x2019; and send her away.&#x201D; Rabbi Jose then did as his pupils advised him.</p>
<p>The woman then married the night watchman of the city who, soon after, lost all his possessions and also became blind. He therefore had to give up his position as watchman and his wife had to lead him from house to house to beg for alms for their sustenance. But whenever she came to the street where Rabbi Jose lived, she passed it by. Her husband then asked her why she did not lead him through the street of Rabbi Jose the Galilean, for he had heard that Rabbi Jose was very charitable, and she replied: &#x201C;I was divorced by him and I could not bear to go into his house to beg for alms.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But one day the watchman and his wife made the rounds of the whole city and received no money. She then entered the street where Rabbi Jose lived but she skipped his house. When the blind man noticed this he began to beat her with his cane. Rabbi Jose heard her cries and when he found out their condition he lodged both of them in one of his houses and provided them with sustenance all the days of their life. <sup><xref rid="fn269">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Especially interesting are the commentaries of Rabbi Jose to the commandments of the Torah. Sometimes he sought to lighten the burden of the commandments while at other times he tried to make them even more severe. The law concerning a &#x201C;disobedient son&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05DF; &#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05E8; &#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D4;</span>) the other scholars interpreted in manner that would have made it impossible to condemn one such to death. Since a &#x201C;disobedient son&#x201D; could not be condemned unless he was also a &#x201C;glutton&#x201D; they declared that he could not be considered as such until he consumed a pound of meat, half boiled and half raw, at one gulp and at the same time drank half a quart of the best Italian wine at one sip. His gluttonous feast had to be made in the company of immoral youths and was to be bought with money stolen by the &#x201C;disobedient son&#x201D; from his father. In addition, they ruled that the &#x201C;disobedient son&#x201D; had to be at least thirteen years and one day of age but not much older than that, for then he could no longer be considered a &#x201C;son&#x201D; dependent on his father. The culprit must have had both a father and a mother who were required to be of the same opinion and appearance, for both had to lead him to court and had to present the same complaints against him.</p>
<p>But Rabbi Jose believed that the essence of the sin of a &#x201C;disobedient son&#x201D; was gluttony and he believed that such a culprit deserved the death punishment because of his possible future. Engaging in such gluttony, a &#x201C;disobedient son&#x201D; was sure to waste his father&#x2019;s wealth and to turn to stealing in order to satisfy his habits. He therefore believed that the Torah preferred the death of such a person while still innocent rather than his execution after committing crimes. <sup><xref rid="fn270">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jose followed in the footsteps of Rabbi Akiba in the matter of expounding every saying of the Torah which might have seemed to be superfluous. Thus he explained the verse &#x201C;but my Sabbaths you shall observe&#x201D; (Ex. 31:13) to indicate that certain labors may be performed on the Sabbath such as work in the Temple or in order to save a human life. This interpretation he based on the word <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05D0;&#x05DA;&#x05F4;</span> in the Hebrew text. <sup><xref rid="fn271">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the case of many other commandments Rabbi Jose sought to lighten the burden of their observance. He ruled that no &#x201C;Bikurim&#x201D; (offering of first fruits) need be brought from the lands east of the Jordan because it was not characterized as a land of milk and honey. <sup><xref rid="fn272">9)</xref></sup> He established the rule that so long as a person is engaged in the observance of one commandment he is absolved from observing any other commandments at the same time. <sup><xref rid="fn273">10)</xref></sup> The verse, &#x201C;Before an old man you shall rise,&#x201D; (Lev. 19:32) he explained to mean that only a scholarly person is to be accorded that honor. <sup><xref rid="fn274">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He also expressed opinions which did not become accepted. He declared, for instance, that the prohibition against deriving any benefit from leavened bread during the Passover is not effective on all the seven days of the holiday. Leavened bread, which was held over the Passover, he suggested, could certainly be used. <sup><xref rid="fn275">12)</xref></sup> In Rabbi Jose&#x2019;s native city people were in the habit of eating the meat of fowl with milk and Rabbi Jose attempted to justify this on the ground that birds do not yield milk and the prohibition, &#x201C;you should not boil a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk,&#x201D; therefore did not apply to fowl. <sup><xref rid="fn276">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some Biblical descriptions of historical events, such as the exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, Rabbi Jose raised to great poetic heights. Expounding the verse, &#x201C;why do you skip on wrinkled hills,&#x201D; (Psalms, 68:17) he said: &#x201C;When God was ready to give the Torah from Mount Sinai, the other mountains skipped about in confusion. They argued among themselves and each one claimed the honor of having God give the Torah to the Jews from its top.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In describing the rending of the sea before the Jews, Rabbi Jose said that when the Jews jumped into the sea even before the waters parted before them, Mount Moriah was torn out from its place and the altar upon which Isaac was to have been sacrificed hastened to the sea. Only when the image of Isaac lying bound on the altar and Abraham standing over him with his slaughtering knife could be seen did the sea part its waters, for only because of the merit of Abraham&#x2019;s offering of Isaac was the sea rent for the Jews.</p>
<p>And when the Jews emerged on the other side of the sea and they began to chant songs of praise, even the children in their mothers&#x2019; arms turned their faces heavenward and sang and the babies left their mothers&#x2019; breast and also sang. <sup><xref rid="fn277">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>No mention is made of the death of Rabbi Jose of Galilee. It is possible that when the revolt of Bar Kochba was being prepared, he returned to Galilee and there he died.</p>

<title>Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph</title>
<p>T<small>HE HIGHEST PLACE OF HONOR</small> among all of our national heroes undoubtedly belongs to Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph. Like the lives of all historically outstanding personalities, Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s life history is also surrounded with legends which shed a saintly halo on his origin and personal development.</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s father was a proselyte, or the son of a proselyte, and he traced his descent from Sisera, the commander of Jabin the king of Hazor. In his youth Rabbi Akiba was a shepherd in the service of the wealthy Kalba Savua.</p>
<p>Kalba Savua (sometimes referred to as Ben Kalba Savua) was one of the wealthiest men of Jerusalem before its destruction and he was renowned for his charities. During the war against the Romans he undertook to supply the inhabitants of Jerusalem with food for the duration of the siege of the city. There exist differing opinions regarding the meaning of the name. Some explain it to indicate that he was a descendant of Kaleb ben Jephuneh while others say that he obtained it because of his generosity&#x2014;if a poor man came to his house hungry as a dog, he left it filled. But there is the much simpler explanation that the name Kalba Savua meant a &#x201C;storeroom filled with grain.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rachel, the daughter of Kalba Savua, loved Akiba and promised to become his wife if he would agree to devote himself to learning. It is told that Akiba was at that time already a man close to forty years of age and he did not even know the Alphabet. He had a son by a previous wife who was also an uneducated man. The love of Kalba Savua&#x2019;s daughter was variously interpreted. Some said that it was but the whim of a spoiled rich man&#x2019;s daughter who became infatuated with a shepherd. Others reasoned that the shepherd must have possessed such noble traits as would captivate even so noble a lady as the daughter of Kalba Savua.</p>
<p>When Kalba Savua heard of this he disowned his daughter and vowed to disinherit her. <sup><xref rid="fn278">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is necessary to mention that when Rachel asked Akiba to devote himself to learning he at first doubted the wisdom of her request. At that time he felt a considerable disdain for scholars and also doubted his own capabilities of learning. But one day he happened to see how falling drops of water had, in time, hollowed out a stone and he said to himself: &#x201C;If water, which is soft, could hollow out the hard stone, the words of the Torah, which are hard, will certainly make an impression on my soft heart.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Together with his son he went to a teacher and began his studies. But after he finished studying the Torah, history makes no more mention of the development of his son and continues to relate of Rabbi Akiba alone. For many years he was a disciple of Nahum of Gimso, then he turned to Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Rabbi Joshua ben Chananiah to show him the ways of the oral law. Rabbi Eliezer paid not the slightest attention to him. He only allowed him to audit his expositions but otherwise he ignored him. Rabbi Joshua, on the other hand, treated him seriously, for he appreciated his great desire to learn.</p>
<p>For a long time Rabbi Akiba sat at the feet of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua. In later life he told that he served them both and did whatever they commanded him to do and even kneaded the dough for their bread. From this we may conclude how difficult were Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s circumstances. He was a poor man and his father-in-law would not aid him in the least. He gained his livelihood by picking a bundle of wood every day, half of which he sold while from the other half he would make faggots to light the house while studying. His neighbors then complained that the smoke from the faggots inconvenienced them at night and they advised him to sell all the wood and to buy oil instead. <sup><xref rid="fn279">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When, despite his work, there still was not enough food in the house, his wife Rachel cut off her beautiful braids and sold them to aid her husband and to enable him to devote more time to the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn280">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>For thirteen years Rabbi Akiba studied with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and the latter never deigned to ask an opinion of him until one day Rabbi Akiba began to ask questions of his master and he could find no answer to them. Rabbi Joshua then addressed Rabbi Eliezer with the following verse, &#x201C;Is not this the people that you have disdained? Go and contend with them,&#x201D; by which he meant to say that here was one whom Rabbi Eliezer constantly ignored and now he posed questions which could not be answered. <sup><xref rid="fn281">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another description of those events relates that after an absence of twelve years Rabbi Akiba returned to his native city accompanied by twelve thousand disciples. Listening to what was going on within his house he heard his wife arguing with a neighbor who asked her, &#x201C;How much longer will you lead the life of a widow,&#x201D; and she replied that if she were sure that her husband was devoting himself to learning she would gladly wait another twelve years. <sup><xref rid="fn282">5)</xref></sup> Upon hearing this Rabbi Akiba returned to his studies for another twelve years and then he came accompanied by twenty-four thousand disciples.</p>
<p>One can easily imagine what the poor woman felt when she saw her husband surrounded by so many thousands of disciples. As she made her way through the throngs and fell at his feet Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s disciples wanted to push her away, but he said to them: &#x201C;Leave her be, that which I possess today and from which you can benefit I acquired only through her.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Kalba Savua heard that one of the outstanding Jewish scholars arrived, he came to him that he may absolve him of his vow regarding his daughter. At that time Kalba Savua repented having allowed his daughter to suffer hunger for twenty-four years. Rabbi Akiba made himself known to his father-in-law and they were reconciled and Kalba Savua gave him half of his wealth.</p>
<p>The Talmud relates that Rabbi Akiba then possessed golden and silver tables in his house and that he ascended his bed on golden stairs. As a reward for his wife who cut off and sold her hair to help him, he bought for her the most expensive adornments, one which was an image of Jerusalem engraved in gold which she wore on her head in place of the hair which she had cut off. But such ornaments were not allowed, at that time, to be worn by married women because of the mourning for the destroyed Temple, and the wife of Rabban Gamliel the Nasi envied the wife of Rabbi Akiba and told her husband. But Rabban Gamliel said to her, &#x201C;If you had done for your husband what she did for hers I would buy you an ornament just like it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn283">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As might have been expected, Rabbi Eliezer was dissatisfied with the appearance of a new star on the firmament of Jewish learning, for it was obvious that he would tread new paths. Rabbi Eliezer clung strictly and without questioning to the traditional interpretations of the Torah. Rabbi Akiba, on the other hand, evolved a new method. He believed that the oral law was not a predetermined matter without spirit and incapable of further development. Not adduced from the text and the letters of the Torah.</p>
<p>The Torah as we have it, Rabbi Akiba said, is complete and there is nothing lacking or superfluous in it. In its entirety it is all content without embellishment; it contains no artistic descriptions and no useless words. Every letter and every dot possesses some special significance.</p>
<p>Wherever there occurs a repetition of a word it probably serves to indicate a special meaning. Even the connecting words and articles such as &#x201C;if,&#x201D; &#x201C;the,&#x201D; &#x201C;but&#x201D; and &#x201C;also&#x201D; are subject to interpretation. When it seems to one that there is a superfluous word in the Torah it is only because the person cannot grasp its meaning with his limited intelligence. Even the word <span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05D0;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05F4;</span>&#x201E; which frequently occurs in the Bible has its significance and could be expounded. The article <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05EA;&#x05F4;</span>&#x201E; in the verse &#x201C;you shall fear the Lord your God (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05EA; &#x05D4;&#x05F3; &#x05D0;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;&#x05D9;&#x05DA; &#x05EA;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;</span>) he explained to indicate that man must fear both God and his Torah. Another time he modified his explanation to mean that man must fear God and the scholars.</p>
<p>Until that time the scholars only considered the content of the law and not its form. The oral law was not classified according to content and it was necessary to study much and to possess a tremendous memory in order to retain the rulings of all the scholars. Rabbi Akiba began to classify each law according to its content and he laid the foundation for the compilation of the Mishna which was finally written down and edited many years later.</p>
<p>Regarding the significance of the interpretations of Rabbi Akiba to the Torah there exists a legend <sup><xref rid="fn284">7)</xref></sup> which relates that when Moses ascended heaven to receive the Torah he saw God attaching little crowns to the letters of the Torah. Moses thereupon said to God: &#x201C;Lord of the world&#x0021; What prevents you from giving the Torah without these crowns?&#x201D; and God answered him: &#x201C;Some day after many generations there will arise a man Akiba ben Joseph who will derive heaps of laws from every little dash and it is for his sake that I prepare these little crowns.&#x201D; Moses then said, &#x201C;Will you show him to me? I would gladly look upon him.&#x201D; God commanded Moses to look among the scholars sitting on the eighth bench and he saw there a man and he heard him expound to his disciples but he did not understand a word of what was being said although he heard the man conclude, &#x201C;This I received as law to Moses from Mount Sinai.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then Moses said, &#x201C;Lord of the world&#x0021; You have such a great man and You give the Torah through me?&#x201D; and God replied, &#x201C;It is My will.&#x201D; Moses thereupon said, &#x201C;You have shown me the man, now reveal to me his end,&#x201D; and God answered, &#x201C;Turn backwards and you will see.&#x201D; Moses looked and saw the body of Rabbi Akiba being torn to pieces.</p>
<p>A similar legend is also related in the Talmud that God revealed to Adam the record of all coming generations which will descend from him together with their scholars and their leaders and He also showed him the generation of Rabbi Akiba. Adam greatly enjoyed his learning but was saddened at sight of the death which awaited Rabbi Akiba. He attempted to obtain an easier death for him, but his request was denied. <sup><xref rid="fn285">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba headed an academy in Bnei Brak which was located south-east of Jaffa. He frequently came to the sessions of the Sanhedrin in Jabneh and no important law was ever adopted without his participation. Once he arrived late at the academy and remained sitting outside. It was then said that &#x201C;the Torah is outside&#x201D; and no decisions were adopted until he came in.</p>
<p>Attempting to describe the work of Rabbi Akiba, the scholars said that he was like a man who goes through the streets with a basket in his hand and picks up whatever he can find. If he finds wheat he puts it in his basket; if he finds barley he picks it up; the same with beans and lentils. Rabbi Akiba did likewise when he sought to introduce order into the laws. <sup><xref rid="fn286">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is claimed that Rabbi Akiba was versed in the various sciences, such as medicine and astronomy. He also spoke several languages and on several occasions he accompanied Rabban Gamliel on the latter&#x2019;s trips to Rome in the cause of the Jewish people. When Rufus (or Tyranos Rufus as he is called in the Talmud) was governor of Palestine, he frequently debated with Rabbi Akiba many matters pertaining to the Jewish faith and the Torah. And when the Roman government began to suppress the observance of the Torah Rabbi Akiba could easily counteract these decrees.</p>
<p>One of the brightest phases of the life of Rabbi Akiba, perhaps the outstanding event, was his participation in the revolt of Bar Kochba. Some historians claim that Rabbi Akiba was one of the leaders of the revolt, but this is probably an exaggeration just as the statements of others that Rabbi Akiba merely preached about Bar Kochba but took no active part in the revolt.</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba was already too old to take his place in the foremost ranks of the revolution. But his twenty-four thousand disciples, which according to legend died between the Passover and Lag B&#x2019;Omer, probably joined the forces of Bar Kochba. The trip of Rabbi Akiba throughout the cities of Palestine and also to those beyond the frontier in order to establish which year is to be &#x201C;Ibur&#x201D; (a year containing thirteen months which occurs thrice every eight years according to the lunar calendar) was probably undertaken as a journey of agitation for the cause of the revolution. The same may be said with a large degree of certainty regarding the &#x201C;Seder&#x201D; in Bnei Brak where the most prominent Jewish leaders were assembled in Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s house.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that the records of this revolt are so meager. In the description of the destruction of the Temple are included some events of the destruction of Betar and it is very difficult to separate them. Conclusive descriptions of Bar Kochba&#x2019;s activities are found only in the Jerusalem Talmud <sup><xref rid="fn287">10)</xref></sup> and in Midrash Eicha Rabathi. But these are also complicated and mixed with terrifying legends. In addition there exists a description of Bar Kochba&#x2019;s revolutionary wars in the writings of the Roman historian Dio Cassius who described the Jewish hero in a horrifying form. It thus becomes necessary to glean the events from various other occurrences of that time and still more is left for the imagination.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Akiba saw Bar Kochba in all his glory he is said to have exclaimed, &#x201C;This is the king the Messiah.&#x201D; He invoked the verse from the prophet (Haggai, 2:21) which foretold that God would cause the heaven and the earth and the sea and the dry land to quake and that He would destroy the thrones of the Gentile kingdoms; their strength would be made to naught and their chariots and horses would be overthrown so that one would be slain by the sword of the other. Rabbi Akiba thus exerted a profound influence on the people. Hosts of people arrived daily to pledge their allegiance to Bar Kochba, for they all believed the words of Rabbi Akiba that Bar Kochba was the long awaited Messiah and that he would bring about the redemption of his people.</p>
<p>Because of his belief in Bar Kochba, Rabbi Akiba allowed himself to be insulted by an obscure colleague, Rabbi Jochanan ben Toratha, who said to him: &#x201C;Akiba, grass will grow out of your cheek bones and the Messiah will still not have arrived.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In explanation of the cause of Bar Kochba&#x2019;s immediate popularity, Talmudic sources relate that when the Roman soldiers hurled stones at the walls of the Jewish cities with their machines, Bar Kochba ascended the walls and, catching the stones between his knees, he hurled them back at the enemy killing a few of them with each stone. Dio Cassius, on the other hand, relates that Bar Kochba would light a flaxen faggot and keep it in his mouth to convince his followers that he was a fire eater.</p>
<p>Today we definitely know that the political situation of that time was intolerable. The Temple was destroyed and the Jewish state was no longer in existence for sixty years. Only a handful of the older generation who remembered the temple still survived, but its memory lived in the heart of the people and everyone dreamed of its restoration. The temple hill was transformed into a Roman soldiers&#x2019; camp and the Jews were in a worse position than slaves in their own country. The Roman governor of Palestine was the murderous despot whom the Jews named Tyranos Rufus and he persecuted them relentlessly and ridiculed their suffering. As the conditions became unbearable, the Jews thought constantly of liberation and whenever they gathered they would ask each other: &#x201C;Will the Roman legions always keep their foot upon the neck of Judea? How much longer will the Roman eagle sink its claws into the living body of the Jewish people?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Bar Kochba then undertook to organize a Jewish army of hundreds of thousands of men with the consent of Rabbi Akiba and he succeeded in maintaining his revolt for three and a half years. Talmudic sources estimate the number of Bar Kochba&#x2019;s soldiers at 400,000. Dio Cassius relates that the number was 580,000 or nearly two hundred thousand more than the Talmudic figure. People streamed from all sides and even the Samaritans, the traditional enemies of the Jews, forgot their hatred and joined the Jews in the struggle against Rome. Numerous neighboring people also joined the uprising in the hope that the liberation of Judea would also bring freedom from the Roman yoke for them.</p>
<p>Wishing to test the bravery of his soldiers, Bar Kochba commanded each of them to cut off, or, with his own teeth, to bite off one of their fingers. But the scholars sent the following message to Bar Kochba, &#x201C;Why do you cause your people to cripple themselves?&#x201D; Bar Kochba replied by asking, &#x201C;What other method shall I use to test their bravery?&#x201D; and he was advised to command that each soldier must uproot a cedar of Lebanon with his bare hands while riding on a horse. Bar Kochba subsequently had 220,000 soldiers with cut off fingers and another 200,000 who uprooted trees bare handed while riding by on a horse.</p>
<p>Sometime after this experiment Bar Kochba is said to have addressed the following words to God: &#x201C;Since You have forsaken us and no longer go with us in our wars, we ask of You that You should not intervene. We do not require Your aid but only ask that You should not aid our enemies.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It was already remarked above that the descriptions of that war are very meager and at times contradictory. Nearly all the scholars of that time, with the exception of Rabbi Akiba, did not support the revolution and when it ended in failure they condemned Bar Kochba, and of the saying of Rabbi Akiba concerning Bar Kochba that &#x201C;a star has arisen from Jacob,&#x201D; they declared that he should not have used the word <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D1;&#x05F4;</span>&#x201E; (a star) but rather the word <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D5;&#x05D6;&#x05D1;&#x05F4;</span>&#x201E; (a deceiver).</p>
<p>The revolt was prepared during the famous &#x201C;Seder&#x201D; night which is mentioned in the Hagada. Several Tanaim met in the home of Rabbi Akiba in Bnei Brak, where he headed a large academy with many thousands of students, to discuss the miracles of the departure from Egypt because it was necessary to come to a final decision regarding the burning question of that day&#x2014;the impatience of the younger Jewish generation and their spirit of rebellion against Roman tyranny.</p>
<p>The Roman authorities knew the mood of the people and attempted to suppress it. Informers mingled with the Jewish young men and every suspicious remark was reported to the Romans. They therefore feared to discuss openly the problem of Roman oppression and they spent the whole night discussing the &#x201C;exodus from Egypt&#x201D; and the great number of plagues which were visited on Pharaoh, to the number of 250, for they considered ten plagues insufficient in view of the suffering of the Jews. They also sought to console themselves with the hope that God would punish the enemies of his people as they deserved.</p>
<p>This &#x201C;debate&#x201D; lasted all night while crowds of impatient people stood outside and waited for the decision of the scholars. In the light of the Passover moon, this group of men who came to celebrate the &#x201C;Seder&#x201D; in the home of Rabbi Akiba and told each other of the wondrous valor of Bar Kochba, seemed strange indeed. But the hours meanwhile passed. As the moon paled and the horizon became suffused with crimson, the pupils of Rabbi Akiba began to look into the house where the scholars sat and still debated the &#x201C;departure from Egypt.&#x201D; The people realized the danger of the situation, for Roman soldiers might arrive at any moment and inquire the reason why the &#x201C;Seder&#x201D; lasts so long. Their patience finally exhausted, they opened the doors and shouted, &#x201C;Our teachers, the time for the morning &#x2018;Shema&#x2019; has arrived,&#x201D; hinting that it was time to end the debate.</p>
<p>This exclamation put an end to the discussion. The impatience of the younger men triumphed over the weariness of the old. A ray of light penetrated the house and the scholars together with their disciples began to chant the old hymn of revenge, &#x201C;Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that have not known You.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The echo of the chant resounded from the hills of Judea. Like one man the people arose from Gilead to Bashan to cast off the yoke of the Romans. Young men armed themselves and the blacksmiths forged swords out of scythes.</p>
<p>The Roman legions which were stationed in Palestine were too weak to withstand the army of Bar Kochba and the governor Rufus was forced to withdraw from the fortresses. Dio Cassius relates that the Jews immediately occupied fifty fortified cities and 985 open towns and villages. The Romans then withdrew from Judea, Samaria and Galilee and the Jews took over the government.</p>
<p>When the first reports of the revolt were brought to Hadrian, he ridiculed them; but when other messengers arrived one after another reporting the defeat of the Roman legions and the danger that the revolt may spread to other provinces of the Roman empire in Asia, Hadrian became concerned and dispatched still other legions. But the reinforcements could achieve nothing.</p>
<p>The victories of the Jews inspired within them the belief that they have regained their national freedom. Many Jews, who previously denied their origin and adopted heathen faiths to escape persecution, returned to the religion of their forefathers. Bar Kochba also wanted to immortalize the event of Judea&#x2019;s liberation and he had coins minted in honor of the victory with the Hebrew inscription (in Samaritan alphabet) &#x201C;to the liberty of Israel&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05EA; &#x05D9;&#x05E9;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05DC;&#x05F4;</span>&#x201E;).</p>
<p>It is not known whether Bar Kochba occupied Jerusalem or whether he planned to restore the temple. There are grounds to believe that he was willing to forego Jerusalem and that he planned to move the boundaries of the land of Israel toward Galilee because of the condescending attitude and the ridicule with which the inhabitants of Jerusalem treated the people of Galilee. It is even told that the people of Betar celebrated with lighted torches the day that Jerusalem was destroyed.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn288">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>With deep concern Hadrian heard of the spread of the revolt and all the forces which he sent against it met with failure. The Jews were victorious in over fifty encounters with the Romans and the commanders whom Hadrian sent had to return to Rome defeated and shamed.</p>
<p>Hadrian then recalled his greatest military commander, Julius Severus, who was then engaged in war in the British isles and placed him in command of the war in Palestine. Despite the bravery of Severus and the number of his troops which outnumbered the Jews two or three to one, he did not venture to meet the Jews in open conflict after the experience of his predecessors, and he waited for an opportunity to employ his strategy of small attacks. This type of warfare wearied the Jewish soldiers. The Samaritans, who fought alongside of the Jews at first, betrayed their allies. Severus persisted in attacking the Jewish forces on several sides at one time in order to force them to concentrate their armies in one place where he could finally engage them in a decisive struggle.</p>
<p>This strategy forced the Jews to concentrate in the fortress of Betar which Severus then besieged. The inhabitants of Tiberias and Sephoris also deserted the cause of Bar Kochba and joined the Romans. An unusual drought affected the land and deprived the people of water. But all of these circumstances proved of no avail until Severus bribed the treasonable Samaritans. Bar Kochba was wary of the Samaritans and probably guessed that their loyalty was doubtful. But since the Samaritans could enter and leave the fortress freely they had an opportunity to show the Romans the secret entrances and their treason succeeded.</p>
<p>The immediate cause of the fall of Betar is given by the Talmud as the blow which Bar Kochba delivered to Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin and which resulted in his instantaneous death. Throughout the siege of Betar, Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin shielded the city with his piety and everyone was convinced that the fortress would not fall as long as he lived. As Rabbi Eliezer was standing deeply immersed in prayer, a Samaritan came up and whispered to him something which he could not hear. This was related to Bar Kochba who questioned the Samaritan as to the secret which he whispered to Rabbi Eliezer. The Samaritan replied: &#x201C;If I will not tell you what I said to Rabbi Eliezer, you will kill me; if I do, Emperor Hadrian will have me executed.&#x201D; Bar Kochba guessed that Rabbi Eliezer was negotiating peace with the Romans and he therefore delivered the blow which caused his death. But this resulted in a moral defeat for Bar Kochba. The people within the fortress lost their war spirit and the Samaritans found it a relatively easy task to bring in the Romans.</p>
<p>The horror of the Roman occupation of Betar is described in the story that their horses waded in blood and that the river which flows around Betar was two-thirds full of blood. The blood of the victims flowed in a mighty stream to the Meditaranean Sea and in its onrush it swept tremendous obstacles.</p>
<p>Severus was anxious to capture Bar Kochba alive in order to lead him in his triumphal entry into Rome just as Titus did to the heroes of Jerusalem after the destruction of the temple. When he failed in this he promised a great reward to the one who would bring to him the body of Bar Kochba. A Samaritan brought Bar Kochba&#x2019;s head and claimed that he had killed him. But Severus commanded him to bring the body of Bar Kochba, for he did not believe that the Samaritan could have killed the Jewish hero. When the body of Bar Kochba was discovered, a snake was found coiled around it and Severus declared: &#x201C;I knew that only God could kill such a man, for no man could avail against him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After the destruction of Betar Hadrian undertook to annihilate the whole Jewish people and wherever one was met he was put to death. If the person captured was of some importance he was tortured first and the tortures increased in brutality in proportion to the importance of the captive. Rabbi Akiba was one of the first victims. While still alive, his body was cut with iron combs. When the angels in heaven saw this they wept bitterly and their tears fell into the great sea and caused it to boil and the whole world was shaken by their voices as they asked God: &#x201C;Is this Your reward to a man who observed Your Torah?&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Rabbi Akiba only began his career the aged Rabbi Dosa ben Horkinas said of him that &#x201C;his name resounds from one end of the world to the other.&#x201D; Rabbi Tarphon similarly said to him, &#x201C;Whoever departs from you is like one who departs from life.&#x201D; When Rabbi Akiba was dead, all the scholars agreed that &#x201C;the arms of the Torah were severed and the springs of wisdom were sealed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba often said, &#x201C;Whatever God does, man must believe that it will end well. Whatever happens has been foreseen from above, but man nevertheless possesses a free will to control his actions. The world should be judged according to its virtues and whatever one receives in this world is but a small share of the reward which is to come. If one sees a wicked man who is happy, he must be sure that his end will be evil.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn289">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>If people are satisfied with a person, Rabbi Akiba said, it must be taken as a sign that God is also pleased with him, and if a person displeases his fellow men, it is a sign that he also displeases God. If one is satisfied with his possessions, it is a good sign for him, but if one is displeased with his possessions, it is a bad omen.</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba laid down seven rules of conduct which he taught his son. 1) Do not reside on the busiest street of the city if you wish to study undisturbed. 2) Do not reside in a city whose rulers are scholars, for they will be busy with their studies and will not devote themselves to the needs of the city. 3) Do not enter your house, and especially your friend&#x2019;s house, suddenly, for its occupants may be engaged in some action which you should not see. 4) Do not go about barefoot in the streets, for it is unseemly. 5) It is better to rise and to dine early during the summer on account of the heat and during the winter because of the cold. 6) It is better to set your Sabbath table as poorly as on a week day rather than to ask for human aid. 7) Always endeavor to gain the friendship of men who are successful in their enterprises. <sup><xref rid="fn290">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Rabbi Akiba instructed his son not to go about barefoot, it happened that on one of his trips to Rome to interceed for the Jews he walked about the city without boots. He was met by one of the emperor&#x2019;s eunuchs who said to him, &#x201C;You are a teacher among the Jews and I will tell you three things: If a man rides on a horse he is a king; if he rides on an ass, he is a free citizen; if he wears boots, he is an ordinary man. But one who possesses none of these would be better off dead.&#x201D; To this Rabbi Akiba replied. &#x201C;Three things you have told me and I will say three things to you: the ornament on a man&#x2019;s face is a beard; the joy of a man&#x2019;s heart is a wife, and the gift of God are children. Woe to the man who possesses none of these.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn291">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>During all of his lectures Rabbi Akiba moralized his listeners in an inspiring fashion and the maxims which he expressed were repeated in every Jewish home and every man tried to regulate his life according to Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s moral precepts. In one such lecture he formulated six rules for his audience: 1) Do not associate with the scornful that you may not copy their deeds. 2) Do not partake of food with an ignorant priest lest he give of the tithes to eat and you will be guilty of benefiting from the &#x201C;holies.&#x201D; 3) Do not indulge in too many vows, for you may not be able to fulfill them and you will be guilty of breaking your oath. 4) Refrain from eating at all feasts, for some day you may have to depend on charity. 5) Refrain from actions the sinfulness of which you doubt and you will be preserved from certain sin. 6) Avoid leaving the Land of Israel, for it may lead you to idolatry. <sup><xref rid="fn292">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On another occasion Rabbi Akiba said: &#x201C;For their three good habits I love the Medians: 1) When they cut meat, they do so on a table. 2) When they kiss each other, they kiss the hand. 3) When they have to confer with each other, they go out into the fields. <sup><xref rid="fn293">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Talmud relates that when Rabbi Akiba was imprisoned <sup><xref rid="fn294">17)</xref></sup> Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai came to visit him and said to him, &#x201C;Rabbi, teach me.&#x201D; But Rabbi Akiba refused and Rabbi Simeon said, &#x201C;If you will not teach me I will tell this to my father Yochai and he will report you to the government.&#x201D; <xref rid="fn295">&#x002A;</xref>) Rabbi Akiba replied, &#x201C;Much as the calf is willing to feed, the cow is even more anxious to feed it,&#x201D; and Rabbi Simeon responded, &#x201C;If feeding is dangerous, the calf is in greater peril.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba then told him the following five rules of life: 1) If you wish to hang yourself, you must do so on a high tree (meaning that if one wishes to quote someone he should quote the words of a great man). 2) When you teach your son, teach him from a correct book that he should not become accustomed to errors. 3) Do not use a pot which others have used before you (meaning that one should not marry a woman who was possessed by another man). 4) Observing a commandment, when one is certain of it, is like lending money on a field which bears fruit. 5) Observing a commandment with a clean body is like marrying a woman and begetting children.</p>
<p>Whoever takes even a cent from charity when he does not need it&#x2014;Rabbi Akiba said&#x2014;will certainly need charity before he dies. Whoever wraps his eyes or arms and legs with rags in order to deceive people and to beg for alms will certainly become a cripple. One who throws bread upon the ground or scatters his money in his anger will be forced to depend on charity before he dies. He who tears his clothes or breaks a dish in his anger should be considered like one who worships idols. <sup><xref rid="fn296">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Loaning money for interest was always considered by the scholars to be a great sin. In defining interest Rabbi Akiba said that even an extra greeting may be considered as such, as, for example, when a person who never greeted another begins to greet him after he borrowed money from him. Such a greeting is equivalent to interest. <sup><xref rid="fn297">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba believed that the Jewish people proved the greatness of God. When he redeemed them from captivity, He did so for His own benefit, for He redeemed Himself together with them. Wherever the Jews are in exile the &#x201C;Shechinah&#x201D; is with them, and when they leaxe exile it is as if God had been redeemed as well. God also obtained a &#x201C;bargain&#x201D; in choosing the Jews as his people because other peoples praise their gods when they prosper and curse them when their fortunes change; but the Jews praise God always, when they prosper and also when they are in difficulties.</p>
<p>He also compared the Jewish people to a bird; just as a bird depends on its wings to carry it, so also do Jews follow the teachings of their elders. He believed that even the poorest Jew could consider himself an aristocrat because of his descent from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. <sup><xref rid="fn298">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The highest phase of Jewish life is the Torah. This gift of God to the Jews deserves that people should sacrifice their lives for it. When Hadrian issued a severe edict imposing the death penalty on any one who devoted himself to its study, Rabbi Akiba gathered his disciples wherever he could to continue their studies. The people then asked him: &#x201C;Are you not afraid of the government?&#x201D; and he answered them with a fable:</p>
<p>A fox went near a river and saw the fish scurrying around in great fear. The fox said to them, &#x201C;What do you fear and from whom are you fleeing?&#x201D; and the fish replied, &#x201C;We flee the nets which men have spread for us.&#x201D; The fox then said, &#x201C;It would be better if you came out on dry land and we would live together just as my forefathers once lived together with your forefathers.&#x201D; But the fish answered, &#x201C;Are you he who is reputed to be the wisest of the animals? You are not the wisest but the most foolish. If we are afraid of being caught here, in the water, which is the place of our life, how much more should we be afraid on the dry land where we would die?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba finished his fable by saying: &#x201C;The same is true of our learning. If we are in danger of being caught when we are engaged in the study of the holy Torah, how much greater would the danger be if we should cease to devote ourselves to it.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn299">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Terrible as the conditions were at that time, Rabbi Akiba did not give up hoping that the Jewish kingdom would be restored. This hope was so great that despite the might of Rome and the ruin of Jerusalem, when Tyranos Rufus ordered the site of the Temple to be plowed up at the command of Hadrian, he still believed in the happy future of his people. When other scholars mourned the destruction, Rabbi Akiba smiled, for in his imagination he visualized the future splendor of Israel&#x2019;s land of which he was convinced.</p>
<p>We already related that the Roman governor, Tyranos Rufus, frequently debated with Rabbi Akiba questions of faith. Being informed about the Jewish scriptures, he loved to debate those matters which seemed contradictory to him. He thus once asked Rabbi Akiba, &#x201C;If your God loves the poor, why does he not feed them?&#x201D; Rabbi Akiba answered: &#x201C;He does so to provide us an opportunity to show charity and to stave ourselves from Gehenna.&#x201D; &#x201C;On the contrary, believe that He condemns you to Gehenna,&#x201D; Rufus replied. &#x201C;Take as an example a king who is angered by his slave and has him put into prison and he commands that none of the servants should give the slave anything to eat or drink. If the king should hear that the slave was fed, would he not be displeased?&#x201D;</p>
<p>But Rabbi Akiba replied: &#x201C;Let us consider this example in a somewhat different version. A king was angry with his son and he had him put in prison and he commanded that none should give food or drink to his son. Then there came a servant and offered the prince food and drink. Would not the king give beautiful gifts to the servant, when he heard of his dead?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn300">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The verse &#x201C;you shall drink water from your well&#x201D; Rabbi Akiba explained to mean that the development of learning is based on a simple understanding of what one hears from others. Just as one can draw water from any side of the well without diminishing the water in the well, so also do students come to their teacher but they do not diminish their teacher&#x2019;s knowledge any more than one who inhales the fragrance of an &#x201C;ethrog&#x201D; or one who lights his candle by the flame of another candle. But a scholar must remember that if he had disciples in his youth, he must also have disciples in his old age for one can never know which disciples will cling to their studies and which will abandon it.</p>
<p>The worth of a scholar may also be likened to a golden vessel. When a golden vessel breaks it can be mended and made whole again; when a scholar forgets his learning he can win it back again. <sup><xref rid="fn301">23)</xref></sup> But a man must never be proud of his learning and one who prides himself on his knowledge of the Torah may be likened to a carcass which lies on the road and every passerby holds his nose to avoid the smell. <sup><xref rid="fn302">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Much was spoken of Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s modesty which could serve as a model for all generations. When his son died Rabbi Akiba said the following words over his grave: &#x201C;Jews have gathered here not because of my learning for greater scholars than myself have come; they also did not come because of my riches for there are present men richer than myself. The men of the South know me and they have come to the funeral, but the men of Galilee, how should they know me? There exist many Akibas like myself but they all came in honor of the Torah and to fulfill a commandment. This realization would console me were my sorrow sevenfold as great.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn303">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of all the books of the Bible Rabbi Akiba loved the Song of Songs most and he said that &#x201C;the whole world is worth less than the day on which the Song of Songs was given to the Jews,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn304">26)</xref></sup> and &#x201C;If God had not given the Torah, the Jewish people could conduct their spiritual world with the aid of the Song of Songs.&#x201D; Rabbi Akiba was one of the first who visualized in the Song of Songs a description of the love of God for the Congregation of Israel. Among the people who lose their share in the life to come he listed those who attempt to transform the Song of Songs into an everyday tavern song. <sup><xref rid="fn305">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus once arose during a fast day to pray for rain. He recited 24 benedictions and still no rain descended. Rabbi Akiba then approached the pulpit and exclaimed: &#x201C;Our father, our king, we have no other ruler but you. Our father, our king, do for your own sake and have mercy upon us.&#x201D; Immediately rain began to fall. Those assembled were disappointed that God answered the prayer of the pupil instead of the prayer of the teacher, but Rabbi Akiba calmed them with a fable: &#x201C;There was once a king who had two daughters, one of which was a quiet person while the other was loud in her demands. The king commanded his servants that when the insistent daughter will ask for anything her demands should be granted at once. But the quiet daughter never received what she wanted for she asked for it humbly and the king also loved to hear her suppliant voice.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba was condemned to death immediately after the fall of Betar. At that time he had already been imprisoned for some time either as a hostage or he was captured during a raid on one of the gatherings where it was only necessary to say that the Jews should not obey the Roman decrees regarding the Jewish faith, or that one should sacrifice his life for his beliefs, in order to be arrested.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Akiba was in prison there arose a number of important problems which could not be decided before hearing his opinion. Since no one was allowed to visit Rabbi Akiba, the Talmud relates that the scholars once sent Rabbi Jochanan ha-Sandlar, a disciple of Rabbi Akiba, dressed up as a peddler with a bundle of merchandise on his back. Rabbi Jochanan walked by the prison where Rabbi Akiba was held and he called out: &#x201C;Needles, who&#x2019;ll buy needles? Hooks, who&#x2019;ll buy hooks? And what is the law regarding a <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05E6;&#x05D4;</span> who has no witnesses?&#x201D; Rabbi Akiba stuck his head out betwen the bars of his cell and called out, &#x201C;Do you have any spindles? Yes, it is legal.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn306">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reasons for this question dated back to the case of a man in prison who granted Halitza to the wife of his deceased brother not in the presence of a court and without witnesses for none were allowed into his cell and the people who accompanied the woman had to remain outside the prison and could not see what went on within.</p>
<p>On another occasion the decision of Rabbi Akiba was required in a case of (a woman who refuses to live with her husband to whom she was married before she reached maturity). It was then necessary to hire a person for forty dinars who should steal into the prison to ask Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s opinion. <sup><xref rid="fn307">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba was imprisoned for a long time and during his incarceration he determined three consecutive leap years. This may indicate that he declared three successive years as leap years or&#x2014;as is the opinion of some commentators&#x2014;that he determined the three following leap years which were to be approved by the court although it was forbidden at that time to establish leap years in advance. <sup><xref rid="fn308">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Rabbi Akiba was closely guarded while in prison, he was sometimes allowed some liberties. He was probably closely watched that he should not continue to teach his disciples but he was allowed to have one person to serve him and that person was Rabbi Joshua Hagarsi, who stayed with him till the last minute.</p>
<p>It is told that Rabbi Joshua Hagarsi always brought water to Rabbi Akiba for his daily use. But one time the prison overseer met him while he was carrying the water and he was displeased, for it seemed to him that too much water was being brought for the use of one person. He thereupon remarked, &#x201C;Why do you bring so much water to your teacher? Are you trying to undermine the prison?&#x201D; and saying this he poured out half of the water.</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiba feared that if he would drink some of it there would not be enough water left with which to wash his hands and he would thus disobey the commandment to wash one&#x2019;s hands, he therefore decided to suffer thirst rather than forego the commandment of washing one&#x2019;s hands before a meal. The scholars afterward commented on this and said that if he was so observant while in prison one could easily imagine his conduct when he was at liberty. <sup><xref rid="fn309">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally the day of Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s trial by Tyranos Rufus came. This was a day of terror for all the Jews. Rabbi Joshua Hagarsi prayed to God for Rabbi Akiba until the minute that the sentence was passed and as he stood immersed in prayer a cloud overcast the sky. Rabbi Joshua remembered the verse of the Lamentations (3:44) and he addressed the following words to God: &#x201C;You have covered yourself with a cloud that my prayer should not reach You and that You should not hear my appeal.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn310">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After a terrible judgment Tyranos Rufus condemned Rabbi Akiba to the most horrifying death. Ordinarily the Romans condemned their victims to be crucified; the prisoner would then be nailed to a wooden cross where he would hang until he died. Rabbi Akiba was condemned to be flayed alive with iron combs.</p>
<p>As Rabbi Akiba was being led to execution it was morning and time for reciting the &#x201C;Shema.&#x201D; Even as his flesh was being tom he did not allow this to interfere with his reciting the &#x201C;Shema.&#x201D; The execution was public and was witnessed by the whole population. When Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s disciples saw the suffering of their teacher they said: &#x201C;Maybe it is enough?&#x201D;, implying that perhaps it was time to pay more attention to the suffering of the body instead of the suffering of the soul. But he replied to them: &#x201C;All the days of my life I have regretted that I had no opportunity to show my love for God in the manner which the Bible commands, that one must love God with his whole soul, even if He were to take that soul away. Now that I have an opportunity to fulfill this commandment shall I not do so?&#x201D; And in reciting the &#x201C;Shema&#x201D; he prolonged the word <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D7;&#x05D3;&#x05F4;</span>&#x201E; until he expired. <sup><xref rid="fn311">33)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Jerusalem Talmud <sup><xref rid="fn312">34)</xref></sup> relates the events at the execution in a slightly different manner. It tells that Tyranos Rufus was personally present at the execution and when he saw Rabbi Akiba recite the &#x201C;Shema&#x201D; with a smile upon his lips he said to him: &#x201C;Are you a sorcerer that you laugh at your suffering or are you doing so to hurt me?&#x201D; Rabbi Akiba answered: &#x201C;May you die. I am not a sorcerer nor am I insensible to my suffering, nor is it my wish to pain you with my smile. But we were commanded to love our God with our whole hearts, our whole souls and all our possessions. Until this day I have shown my love for God with my heart and my possessions. But this day I have an opportunity to show my love of God with my soul. I am therefore happy that I have attained this moment.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But the Roman governor was not satisfied that the above described execution would permanently insure the death of Rabbi Akiba and he commanded that the dead body be cut into pieces. <sup><xref rid="fn313">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another legend describes the death of Rabbi Akiba in an idyllic manner. It relates that on the eve of a holiday Rabbi Joshua Hagarsi, who was always with Rabbi Akiba, went to his home for the holiday. But before he reached his house he found the prophet Elijah waiting at his door and he announced to him the news that Rabbi Akiba died in prison. They immediately hastened to the prison and they found the door of Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s cell wide open. They placed the body of Rabbi Akiba on the couch and they departed. That night they returned and took the body which they carried to Caesarea and there they buried it in a cave.</p>
<p>There exists an interesting legend regarding the relationship between Rabbi Akiba and the wife of Tyranos Rufus. It relates that Tyranos Rufus was always dejected after his arguments with Rabbi Akiba, for the latter always triumphed over him in the presence of the emperor. After one such debate the wife of Tyranos Rufus said to him: &#x201C;Why are you so dejected?&#x201D; and he replied, &#x201C;This Rabbi Akiba always confuses me with his discourses and I can never conquer him.&#x201D; The woman then said, &#x201C;The God of the Jews hates immorality. If you will allow me, I will cause Rabbi Akiba to sin and he will lose his militant spirit.&#x201D; &#x201C;Do as you understand,&#x201D; Tyranos Rufus said to her.</p>
<p>The woman then adorned herself and came to Rabbi Akiba. She tried with all her wiles to cause him to sin. But when Rabbi Akiba looked at her he spit, then he laughed and then he wept. The woman asked him, &#x201C;What is the meaning of these things you do?&#x201D; and he replied, &#x201C;Two things I can explain to you but the third I cannot tell you. I spit because I remembered the process whereby a person is brought into the world. I wept because I thought of your beauty which will end by rotting in the ground.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And why did he laugh? The legend concludes that he laughed because he foresaw with the aid of the Holy Spirit that she would become converted and that he would marry her. But this he refused to tell her. <sup><xref rid="fn314">36)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although learning was forbidden, Rabbi Akiba found frequent oportunities to express his teachings even when he was in prison. It may also be assumed that the six rules which he gave to his son were formulated in prison.</p>
<p>In addition there exist some maxims of Rabbi Akiba which bear the stamp of having been expressed in similar circumstances. Thus he said that five types of sinners can never be forgiven: 1) One who repents too much. 2) One who sins too often. 3) One who sins when others are pious. 4) One who sins with the intention of repenting. 5) One who causes the desecration of the name of God by his sins. <sup><xref rid="fn315">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time he poetically interpreted a verse of the Song of Songs that the Gentile nations ask the Jewish people, &#x201C;How is your lover different from other lovers?&#x201D;, how is your God different from other gods that you allow yourself to be killed for his sake? Such heroic people as you are could easily come and mingle with us. But the congregation of Israel replies: &#x201C;My lover is clear and radiant, he is higher than ten thousand.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn316">38)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is characteristic of the end of Rabbi Akiba that Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus once foretold that he would meet a violent death. During an argument concerning the preparation of sacrifices for slaughter on the Sabbath, Rabbi Eliezer became annoyed at Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s numerous questions and he said angrily: &#x201C;You have contradicted me in matters of slaughter and you will meet your death in slaughter.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn317">39)</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn295">&#x002A;) It would seem that Yochai, the father of Rabbi Simeon, was an official of the Roman government and that it was his duty to prevent the Jews from studying the Torah. Those who engaged in such study were sentenced to death. But the political role of Yochai is not entirely clear. The entire conversation between Rabbi Simeon and Rabbi Akiba is illogical. Since Rabbi Akiba was already imprisoned for teaching the Torah, it was no longer necessary to report him to the authorities, and since he refused to teach Rabbi Simeon, there was nothing to report.</ftnote>

<title>The Ten Martyrs</title>
<p>L<small>EGEND</small> R<small>ECORDS</small> that about the time of the destruction of Betar, or immediately after that event, the Roman governor of Palestine had ten of the most prominent Jewish leaders executed in a most barbarous fashion.</p>
<p>Emperor Hadrian&#x2014;so relates Midrash Eicha Rabathi&#x2014;then undertook to wipe off the Jewish people from the face of the earth and he was assisted in this plan by his governor, Tyranos Rufus, who served as executioner. It was the habit of the emperor, or of one of his representatives, to sit at the gate of the city and to await any passing Jew who would then be captured and executed.</p>
<p>While doing so the Romans made merry over the fate of the unfortunate Jews. If a Jew greeted a Roman, he would be addressed in the following words: &#x201C;How dare you, a Jew, greet me? You are probably trying to deceive me with your greeting while you curse me in your heart. You therefore deserve to be put to death.&#x201D; But if the Jew did not greet the Roman he would be addressed in this wise: &#x201C;There goes a Jew who shows no respect for his emperor, he therefore deserves to be put to death.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It seems probable that thousands of Jews lost their lives in this manner. This is evident from the Talmud <sup><xref rid="fn318">1)</xref></sup> which cites a statement of the scholars to the effect that a man who lost his life for the reason of his being a Jew becomes sanctified and no one else may equal him in merit.</p>
<p>Although the martyrs numbered in the thousands, legend conferred a special saintly halo upon ten of them. This legend mentions the names of the Ten Martyrs and it has been established historically that these were executed by the Romans although they did not all die at the same time.</p>
<p>The story of the &#x201C;Ten Martyrs&#x201D; is retold twice each year; once during the recitation of the Laments on the ninth day of Ab and the second time during the afternoon service of the Day of Atonement.</p>
<p>The author of the mentioned Lament as well as the author of the other prayer followed the story of the events as they are related in the Midrashim where the names of the martyrs are listed in two different versions.</p>
<p>These men were executed&#x2014;the legend continues to relate&#x2014;when they were reading the Torah to the empreror and they came to the law which states that a person who steals a man and enslaves him, is to be put to death. (Ex. 21:16.) The emperor then said: &#x201C;Where are your forefathers, the sons of Jacob, who sold their brother into slavery? If I had them here I would immediately have them put to death. But since they are not here you will have to atone for their crime.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The emperor then allowed them three days in which to prepare themselves for the execution. Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha said to his comrades: &#x201C;If you will take upon yourself part of the sin, I will pronounce the <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DD; &#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05E4;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05E9;&#x05F4;</span>&#x201E; (the express name of God) and by its power I will ascend heaven to ascertain whether this decree is the will of God. If God willed it, we will bow to his will, otherwise I will try to undo the decree of the emperor with the power of God&#x2019;s name.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The other scholars answered, &#x201C;Do whatever you can and we will assume our share of responsibility for the sin.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After he pronounced the &#x201C;Shem Hamforash&#x201D; a strong wind arose and carried Rabbi Ishmael to heaven. There he met the angel Metateron whom he asked concerning the decree and the angel said to him, &#x201C;I have heard it announced that ten of the greatest Jewish scholars are to lose their lives at the hands of the Roman government.&#x201D; Rabbi Ishmael descended and found his comrades engaged in prayer and fasting. They then began to discuss the laws pertaining to Passover. A messenger of the emperor arrived and said to them: &#x201C;You know that you have been condemned to death and you have the patience to engage in learned discussions.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thus the Midrash, and the authors of the lament and the mentioned prayer, describe the events of the martyrdom, which removed ten of the noblest Jewish men. But the Talmud states that they died at widely separated intervals. This is also evident from the &#x201C;Book of Lineage&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>) who explicitly states that one must not be misled to believe that the Ten Martyrs were executed at the same time, for Rabbi Akiba lost his life sixty years later and the other scholars suffered martyrdom at a still later date.</p>
<p>According to Talmudic sources <sup><xref rid="fn319">2)</xref></sup> the first death sentence was pronounced upon Rabbi Simeon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. When Rabbi Ishmael was informed of the sentence he wept bitterly and Rabi Simeon said to him, &#x201C;You should be happy that two steps from here you will be taken to the bosom of the saints. Why do you weep?&#x201D; Rabbi Ishmael answered, &#x201C;I do not weep because I have to die but because we are to be led to execution like common murderers.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the news of their death was announced to Rabbi Akiba and to Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba they said, &#x201C;All Jews must realize that if good times were in the offing, these two, Rabbi Simeon and Rabbi Ishmael, would be among the first to benefit from them. But the Creator knows that terrible punishment is about to be visited upon the world and He therefore removed them from the earth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Rabbi Akiba was killed the news was carried to Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba and to Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion. These rent their garments and donned sackcloth and said: &#x201C;Hearken to us, brethren. Rabbi Akiba was killed not because he committed robbery, nor because he neglected God&#x2019;s Torah. This is therefore a sign that evil times are about to come. We may therefore expect that before long there will not be a place in the Land of Israel which will not be strewn with human bodies.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba, another one of the Ten Martyrs, lost his life during the period of the decree against ordination. He was a pupil of Shmuel the Younger (Hakatan) and later he was a colleague of Rabbi Akiba in Jabneh and he frequently debated with him the regulations of Jewish life. <sup><xref rid="fn320">3)</xref></sup> When the persecution was in full force he ruled that weddings were legal even when performed in the presence of one witness. When testimony was taken regarding the various Jewish customs, he related that on one occasion in Jerusalem a rooster was condemned to be stoned to death for killing a child in its crib by piercing its head with its beak. He was renowned for his piety and all Talmudic stories which begin with the words, &#x201C;It once occurred to a pious man&#x201D; refer to Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba; only in a few exceptional cases do these refer to R. Jehuda ben Elai. <sup><xref rid="fn321">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is further told of Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba that all his actions were motivated by piety and that, when he died, no one could remember any sinful deed committed by him except that he had kept a goat in his house, a thing which was forbidden by the scholars of Palestine because goats habitually graze in strangers&#x2019; fields. The reason why he kept a goat was that Rabbi Jehuda suffered from severe coughing and the doctors advised him to drink goat&#x2019;s milk while it was still warm. To prevent his goat from entering strangers&#x2019; fields, he always kept it tied to the bed post. Nevertheless the scholars refused to enter his house when he was sick because of the &#x201C;robber&#x201D; which he housed <sup><xref rid="fn322">5)</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>At that time the government issued a decree forbidding the ordination of pupils and anyone who issued or received such ordination was to forfeit his life, and the city where such ordination was conferred was to be razed to the ground. Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba then took his place between two mountains, between the cities of Usha and Shefarom, in order to ordain his disciples. He reasoned that if he was to be caught there no city would suffer through his deed. There he ordained five or six of his pupils. Suddenly they noticed soldiers approaching and Rabbi Jehuda said to his pupils, &#x201C;Children, flee from here.&#x201D; &#x201C;But what will happen to you?&#x201D; they asked him. He answered, &#x201C;I will lie down on the ground and pretend death.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the soldiers approached they saw what they thought to be a dead body, lying on the ground. Wishing to assure themselves that he was really dead they pierced his body with three hundred javelins until it was riddled like a sieve <sup><xref rid="fn323">6)</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Such seems to have been the death of Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba. It is also more than certain that some of his pupils were captured and killed.</p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>Among the Ten Martyrs there were also men like Rabbi Yeshebab the Scribe, and Rabbi Hutzpith the Interpreter, who did not head academies but were officials of the court in Jabneh. They therefore succeeded in hiding for some time in Sephoris but finally they were captured. Rabbi Yeshebab copied books of the Torah and recorded the proceedings of the Court. He was a pupil of Rabbi Akiba and later became his colleague and together they discussed various legal matters. The poverty of the Jews of Palestine was very great at that time and many people distributed the greater part of their possessions, despite the warning of Rabban Gamliel that one should not give away more than one fifth of his possessions <sup><xref rid="fn324">7)</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>According to another source it was not Rabban Gamliel but Rabbi Akiba who advised Rabbi Yeshebab to distribute no more than one-fifth of his possessions <sup><xref rid="fn325">8)</xref></sup>. This suggestion was enacted as a law by the Sanhedrin in Usha <sup><xref rid="fn326">9)</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Of Rabbi Hutzpith we know that he was interpreter for the Sanhedrin in Jabneh. It was also his duty to explain the Torah to the uneducated men and the women. One legal opinion of his is cited in the question of &#x201C;Prosbol.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn327">10</xref></sup> <xref rid="fn328">&#x002A;</xref>)</p>
<p>Before the Roman executioner killed Rabbi Hutzpith, he had his tongue cut out and thrown away. Later it was seen that dogs were carrying the tongue and the scholars mourned that &#x201C;The tongue which poured forth pearls should lie in the dust.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn329">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>Among the martyrs of that time there were also the brothers Pappus and Julianus. Even though they are not listed among the Ten Martyrs, they are mentioned in connection with Rabbi Akiba.<xref rid="fn330">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref>)</p>
<p>According to the Talmud Pappus and Julianus were brothers and they were executed by Tyranos Rufus in the city of Lodakia. When a princess of the imperial family was found murdered, the Jews were held to be responsible and the Roman governor commanded that all the Jewish inhabitants of that city be killed. The two brothers appeared before the governor and assumed all blame for the murder of the princess. They thus saved the Jewish community from annihilation.</p>
<p>Another version describes the death of the two brothers in this manner. The emperor said to them: &#x201C;If you belong to the same people as Mishael, Hanania and Azariah, then God will save you from my hands.&#x201D; But the brothers replied, &#x201C;Mishael, Hanania and Azariah were pious men and Nebuchadnezzar was a worthy king. Because of their merit a miracle occurred. But you are an ordinary wicked man and we are guilty. If you will not kill us, there will be others that will do so. But if you will kill us God will avenge our blood upon you.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn331">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the complicated tangle of legends which surrounds these men we may conclude that Pappus ben Jehuda believed in maintaining peaceful relations with Rome. When he saw Rabbi Akiba publicly teaching the Torah to his disciples, despite the prohibition of the government, he rebuked him. But when he was later himself arrested for some transgression and he was sentenced to death he said to Rabbi Akiba, &#x201C;Happy are you Rabbi Akiba that you were captured while teaching God&#x2019;s Torah, but woe to Pappus that he was captured because of some foolish deed.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn332">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>When the Roman government disbanded the central academy of the Sanhedrin in Jabneh and, after executing many of the scholars in Lud, forced the remaining ones to flee to Usha, there appeared a number of academies that were located in numerous towns that were difficult of access and where a measure of safety from the Romans existed. It was characteristic of these academies that every one knew of their existence despite the fact that any contact with them was punishable by death. Like Rabbi Akiba who insisted on continuing his teaching openly, Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion also scorned all danger and continued his educational work.</p>
<p>He often said that if two people are together and do not engage in &#x201C;words of the Torah&#x201D; it is a gathering of the scornful, but whenever two occupy themselves with the Torah, the Shechinah rests upon them. Even when a person is alone he should devote himself to study and God would reward him. <sup><xref rid="fn333">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But it is important to remember that it was almost impossible for a person to study alone. Aside from the Scriptures there were no written books, and even the possession of a book of the Scriptures by one person was very rare. All study was done orally; one man read a verse from the book and offered his interpretation; the others questioned him or offered their own commentaries.</p>
<p>In the early years of his career Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion studied together with Rabbi Jose ben Kisma but it appears that Rabbi Jose departed when the situation became too dangerous and when learning of the Torah was declared to be an &#x201C;offense&#x201D; punishable by death. When Rabbi Jose fell sick before his death he was visited by Rabbi Hanina and he chided the latter for his daring in endangering his life because of his teachings. Rabbi Jose said, &#x201C;God handed the government to the Romans. They destroyed his house, burned his temple, slaughtered the pious, the best men of our people, and now I hear that you gather disciples and teach them from the book of the Torah which you keep hidden in your bosom. Would it not be better for you to consider how all this will end?&#x201D;</p>
<p>To this Rabbi Hanina replied, &#x201C;God in heaven will have mercy&#x0021;&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Jose further said, &#x201C;I speak to you logically and you answer about the mercy of heaven. I should not be surprised if you are captured with the book of the Torah in your possession.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn334">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>This attitude of Rabbi Jose, his readiness to bow before the might of the Romans, was probably known to the authorities. He was highly regarded by the governor of Caesarea and when he died, Roman officials attended the funeral and mourned over his grave. While returning from the funeral, the Romans saw Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion with a book of the Torah expounding to his disciples who were seated about him. He was immediately brought to trial and condemned to be burned. His wife was also condemned to death and his daughter was sent away to a house of ill repute.</p>
<p>Together with Rabbi Hanina the Romans also captured his friend, Rabbi Elazar ben Parta who had to face charges on five different infractions of the law. When they both met, Rabbi Elazar said, &#x201C;Woe is me that I was caught while breaking five different laws.&#x201D; But Rabbi Hanina said to him, &#x201C;You are a happy man indeed that you were arrested for five transgressions and you will certainly be saved from all of them. Your salvation is more certain because you devoted yourself to learning as well as to charitable deeds while I only engaged in learning.&#x201D;</p>
<p>During his trial Rabbi Hanina bluntly declared that he was &#x201C;fulfilling the command of God.&#x201D; He was then wrapped in the book of the Torah which he kept in his bosom, he was surrounded with bundles of thin branches and these were set on fire. To prolong his agony the Romans placed moist wool over his heart.</p>
<p>The execution had to be witnessed by his daughter and his disciples, and his daughter exclaimed, &#x201C;Woe is me, father, that I see you suffering like this.&#x201D; Rabbi Hanina said to her, &#x201C;If I were to burn alone, my suffering would be very great. But since I am being burned together with a book of the Torah I am certain that He who will punish the burning of the book will also avenge my death.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Hanina&#x2019;s disciples then asked him, &#x201C;Rabbi, what do you see?&#x201D;, and he answered, &#x201C;I see the parchment burning but the letters on it are flying upward.&#x201D; His disciples said, &#x201C;Open your mouth and let the fire enter it and you will die sooner,&#x201D; but he answered, &#x201C;I do not wish to hasten my death by my own act.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Seeing this, the executioner who lit the fire asked Rabbi Hanina, &#x201C;Rabbi, if I will increase the fire that you may die sooner, will you lead me into the world to come?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Hanina assured him that he would do so and the executioner removed the wool from over his heart and Rabbi Hanina at once expired. <sup><xref rid="fn335">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar ben Parta, a kindly and scholarly man, was captured together with Rabbi Hanina. Of Rabbi Hanina it was said that he was very just in matters of charity but that he was always calculated and gave no more than his share. On one occasion only did the sums which he set aside for charity and for a Purim feast become mixed and he distributed the whole sum to the poor. This he afterward mentioned as an innovation.</p>
<p>Whether Rabbi Elazar ben Parta was saved from death remains unknown. If he was, then it was probably due to his leanings toward peace with Rome, as was also the attitude of Rabbi Jose ben Kisma. The legends regarding his defense against the accusations of the Romans indicate that in itself it would have been insufficient to save him from the bloodthirsty Romans. He was accused of devoting himself to learning and also of participating in the activities of the various robber bands which infested the land at that time. To these accusations he replied: &#x201C;If you suspect me of devoting myself to the book, you cannot accuse me of using the sword, and if you accuse me of using the sword, you cannot suspect me of engaging in the study of the book. Since one is not true, the other also must be false.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;If you did not engage in the study of the book,&#x201D; the judges asked, &#x201C;why do people call you Rabbi?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;They call me Rabbi,&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar replied, &#x201C;because I am the teacher of the weavers.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Wishing to test his knowledge of weaving, the judges commanded that a piece of woven cloth be brought and he was told to point out the warp and the woof. At that moment a miracle occurred and a drone alighted on a thread of the warp while a bee descended on a thread of the woof. Rabbi Elazar understood the significance of the insects&#x2019; action and he convinced the Romans of his knowledge of weaving.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why were you absent from the meetings of &#x2018;Be Avidan&#x2019;?&#x201D; the judges continued to ask, and Rabbi Elazar replied that being an old man he was afraid of being crushed in the melee. The judges at first refused to accept this reason but another miracle occurred and on the same day an old man was crushed at the meeting of &#x201C;Be Avidan&#x201D;.<xref rid="fn336">&#x002A;</xref>)</p>
<p>&#x201C;And why did you liberate your slave?&#x201D;, the judge further queried. But Rabbi Elazar denied this. One of the witnesses was ready to testify against him when the prophet Elijah appeared in the guise of a Roman official and said, &#x201C;Since miracles already occurred to substantiate his statements, it is probable that another miracle will occur.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In justification of the severe punishment which was meted out to Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion&#x2014;Rabbi Hanina was burned, his wife was killed and his daughter was sent away to a house of shame&#x2014;the scholars later declared that he deserved it because of his sins. Rabbi Hanina frequently employed the <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DD; &#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05E4;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05E9;&#x05F4;</span>&#x201E; his wife heard him pronounce it but never warned him to refrain while his daughter once passed by a group of Roman officials and heard them praise her graceful bearing; she was then filled with pride and her fate in later life was a punishment for this pride.</p>
<p>A second daughter of Rabbi Hanina became the wife of Rabbi Meir and she too met with much suffering because of her original convictions about women. It is also noteworthy that on an occasion, when the scholars debated a legal matter, a son and a daughter of Rabbi Hanina participated in the discussions. At that time Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba said that Rabbi Hanina&#x2019;s daughter showed a better understanding of the law than her brother did.</p>
<p>Rabbi Hanina&#x2019;s son joined a brigand band during the life of his father. After the collapse of the revolt of Bar Kochba the remaining Jewish soldiers organized themselves into bands to conduct guerilla warfare against the Romans and they also looted and murdered wherever they could. The Romans applied all their efforts to rid the land of these bands. Rabbi Hanina&#x2019;s son, who was a member of such a band, was caught by the Romans. They promised to spare his life if he would disclose secret information regarding the band. He did so and his comrades later killed him and stuffed his mouth with mud. Three days later his body was found and it was placed in a casket for burial. Out of respect for his parents the people were going to mourn him but Rabbi Hanina did not allow it. <sup><xref rid="fn337">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have previously mentioned that Rabbi Jose ben Kisma was an adherent of the movement for peace with the Romans. He was convinced nevertheless that in the end the Romans would be driven out of Palestine by the Persians after they would conquer Babylonia. He instructed his disciples that they should bury him in a very deep grave because &#x201C;the time will come when there will not be a single palm tree in the Land of Israel but a Persian horse will be tied to it, and there will not be a single casket in the land that a Median horse will not feed from.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At this time his disciples asked him when Messiah will come. At first he refused to tell them but when they insisted he said, &#x201C;When the gate will be destroyed and rebuilt anew. Then it will be destroyed again, and before there will be time to rebuild it, Messiah will come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn338">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jose did not explain which gate he was referring to and his statement was variously interpreted. &#x201C;Yalkut Hamachiri&#x201D; says that it refers to the gate of Tiberias; Rashi, on the other hand, claimed that it referred to the gate of Rome.</p>
<p>Further light is shed on the character of Rabbi Jose ben Kisma by the following story. It is told that a very wealthy man asked Rabbi Jose to settle in his city and he promised to reward him with much gold and silver and precious stones, but Rabbi Jose replied that were he to be offered all the gold and silver and precious stones of the world he would not reside anywhere except in a place of learning. <sup><xref rid="fn339">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar ben Parta, who was captured together with Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion, left one law on the subject of a woman who is the wife of a Cohen and who is informed that her husband was travelling on a ship which became lost or that he was facing trial and in danger of losing his life, whether such a woman was entitled to eat of the tithes which are offered to a priest. Rabbi Elazar ruled that she was entitled to benefit from the tithes because the possibility existed that her husband might still escape alive.</p>
<p>It seems probable that Rabbi Elazar ben Parta was a pupil of Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin and a colleague of the scholars at Jabneh with whom he debated the interpretations of the laws. He said that since the destruction, the rains in Palestine had become lighter and less fruitful and that all of Palestine&#x2019;s natural phenomena have changed; either there is too much or too little rain; sometimes it falls on time and at other times it is delayed. &#x201C;When rain falls on time, what may it be compared to? It may be compared to a slave whose master gives him his pay on Sunday and he can bake his dough and eat his bread on time. But when rain does not fall on time what may it be compared to? It may be compared to a slave whose master gives him his pay at the end of the week; he cannot properly bake his dough or eat his bread on time.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn340">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar said that gossip is severely punished. This is obvious from the punishment which God meted out to the spies which Moses sent to see Palestine who slandered only trees and rocks upon their return. How much greater would be the punishment of one who slanders his neighbor. <sup><xref rid="fn341">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>Another martyr was Hanina (or Hananiah) ben Hachinai, a disciple and a friend of the outstanding scholars of the time. It seems that he never received &#x201C;Semicha&#x201D; (ordination) to teach others in an academy of his own. His opinions, however, were held in great esteem and they were considered on numerous occasions when the laws were being determined. <sup><xref rid="fn342">22)</xref></sup> A few times he is referred to as Rabbi, but this seems to be an error of the copyists who could not imagine that the Mishna or Talmud should quote a man who was not ordained. His name is mentioned among the scholars who were said to know &#x201C;seventy languages&#x201D; and also in connection with other prominent men who did not possess the title of Rabbi such as Simeon ben Azai, Simeon ben Zoma and Hanan the Egyptian. <sup><xref rid="fn343">23)</xref></sup> One of his opinions that was cited concerned the weight of the stones which Joshua erected in Gilgal after the Jews crossed the Jordan. <sup><xref rid="fn344">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>His mode of thought is illustrated by a maxim which he frequently repeated: &#x201C;He who wakes at night and he who walks alone by the way and he who makes his heart empty for idle thoughts is guilty against himself.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn345">25)</xref></sup> Also interesting is his interpretation of the Biblical verse regarding a man who denies his friend. He said that a man who denies the words of his friend does so because he denies God. <sup><xref rid="fn346">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hanina studied for some time, together with other scholars, in the academy of Rabbi Tarphon. Later he became a disciple of Rabbi Akiba who found him worthy to discuss with him the mysteries of the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn347">27)</xref></sup> On one occasion he argued against the viewpoint of Rabbi Akiba. <sup><xref rid="fn348">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hanina attended the academy of Rabbi Akiba at Bnei Brak together with Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai. <sup><xref rid="fn349">29)</xref></sup> They remained there about twelve or thirteen years. Throughout these years Rabbi Simeon received messages from his home and he was informed of what went on there, but Hanina never sent any message home and seemed not to be concerned about what happened there. One day he received a message from his wife: &#x201C;Your daughter is ready to be wed and you must return at once to give her in marriage.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hanina received permission from his master to return home. During all these years the city and its buildings had changed and he did not know where to find the house in which his family lived. He sat down near the city well to await someone who could direct him. He then heard some girls addressing another girl, &#x201C;Hanina&#x2019;s daughter, fill your jar with water and go home.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He followed this girl until he reached the house. When his wife saw him she fainted from great excitement. Hanina then stopped to pray and he addressed God in the following words, &#x201C;Is this Your reward for the poor woman who waited for me so many years?&#x201D; Realizing the justice of Hanina&#x2019;s prayer God hearkened to it and the woman revived.</p>
<p>Hanina&#x2019;s wife was well known for her kindliness. At that time the scholars interpreted the verse of the Bible &#x201C;I will make a help against him&#x201D; to mean that if a man is deserving, his wife is a help, but if he is not deserving she is against him. Rabbi Joshua b. Nehemiah amplified this interpretation and said that if a man is deserving he obtains a wife like the wife of Hanina ben Hachinai, but if he is not deserving he gets a wife like the wife of Rabbi Jose of Galilee.</p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>Still another martyr of that time was Rabbi Jehuda the Baker. Whether he was really a baker, as his name would seem to indicate, remains unknown. He was very close to Rabbi Akiba and knew his life history. His word was therefore accepted in correcting an error regarding the dispute of Rabbi Akiba with Rabban Gamliel.</p>
<p>While trying to establish the day of the new month, Rabbi Akiba once delayed the testimony of people from his city. Rabban Gamliel then sent a message to Rabbi Akiba saying, &#x201C;If you prevent the majority from fulfilling a commandment, you cause them to sin and you deserve to be ostracized.&#x201D; The people believed that Rabbi Akiba was excommunicated but Rabbi Jehuda the Baker declared that it was not so and that Rabbi Akiba was only removed from his position of representing the city of Geder, which he then held. <sup><xref rid="fn350">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The legend regarding the tongue of Rabbi Hutzpith the Interpreter, which the Romans are said to have cut out and thrown to the dogs is given in the Jerusalem Talmud <sup><xref rid="fn351">31)</xref></sup> as referring to Rabbi Jehuda the Baker, and it is said that it was Rabbi Jehuda who was thus tortured. There also exists a Midrash which relates that when Rabbi Jehuda the Baker was led to execution there came a man named Guphia who offered his life in place of Rabbi Jehuda. The Romans accepted the substitute but Rabbi Jehuda was later indicted on another charge of violating a Roman law and he was condemned to death.</p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>The name of Rabbi Elazar Harsena is also listed among the Ten Martyrs and some historians identify him with Rabbi Elazar ben Harsom who was said to be the owner of a thousand cities on land and a thousand ships on the sea. From this wealth, which Rabbi Elazar is said to have inherited from his father, he derived no benefit. He would only take one sack of flour to bake the bread which he needed. He wandered from one city to another and visited the academies. When he returned to his house and wanted to enter, his own slaves did not know him and suspecting that it was a thief attempting to enter a strange house, they beat him.</p>
<p>Another version declares Rabbi Elazar ben Harsom to have been high priest for eleven years. <sup><xref rid="fn352">32)</xref></sup> This legend, however, must refer to another person than the martyr. Also no high priest of that name is mentioned by Josephus in his list of high priests. We may therefore assume that the legend refers to a person regarding whom all information had been lost and his name is confused with other historical personalities.</p>

Since Rabbi Elazar was accused of not coming to the gathering at &#x201C;Be Avidan&#x201D;, it would seem to indicate that the disputes were not with Christians nor with Persians.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Simeon ben Azai and Simeon ben Zoma</title>
<p>(Two of the &#x201C;Four Who Entered the Pardes&#x201D;)</p>
<p>T<small>HE</small> T<small>ALMUD</small> relates that four of the most outstanding scholars entered the &#x201C;Pardes&#x201D;&#x2014;the garden of knowledge&#x2014;and with the power of their reason they sought to discover the causes underlying man&#x2019;s life and the mysteries of God.<xref rid="fn353">&#x002A;</xref>)</p>
<p>The affliction of the Jews were then indescribable. The Roman government endeavored with all its might to erase all trace of the Jewish faith. Since the Temple was destroyed, Judaism could only survive through the observance of such laws as had no direct relation to the temple. The government therefore prescribed the death sentence for the observance of Sabbath, for studying the Torah or for the circumcision of male children. If a person openly renounced Judaism, he joined the Romans or some other nationality and was granted Roman citizenship which insured his security.</p>
<p>Four of the outstanding scholars therefore attempted to discover the reason why God inflicted this suffering upon the Jews. These four were: Simeon ben Azai, Simeon ben Zoma, Elisha ben Avuyah and Rabbi Akiba. Ben Azai soon died from too much pondering; Ben Zoma lost his reason; Elisha ben Avuya &#x201C;cut down the plants,&#x201D; believing that God abandoned the Jews he said, &#x201C;Of what avail is the Torah and why should we suffer to observe it?&#x201D; He then abandoned the faith and became &#x201C;Acher&#x201D;, a stranger, an open enemy of the Torah and of those who clung to it. Only Rabbi Akiba suffered no harm and emerged unchanged from this venture. Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s strong spirit which mocked at death and which, at the very moment that Romans were tearing his flesh with iron combs, gave him the strength to declare that he was happy to be able to show his love of God even at the price of his life, this spirit penetrated the mysteries of Pardes without suffering any injury.</p>
<p>Simeon ben Azai, who died after pondering the mysteries, and Simeon ben Zoma who lost his reason, were members of Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s academy and were recognized as prominent disciples whose opinions were frequently sought. <sup><xref rid="fn354">1)</xref></sup> They were considered capable of heading separate academies although they were not confirmed <sup><xref rid="fn355">2)</xref></sup> and special honor was accorded to Ben Azai. Although unordained, he was at times called Rabbi <sup><xref rid="fn356">3)</xref></sup> and when he differed with Rabbi Akiba his opinion is mentioned first at least on one occasion. <sup><xref rid="fn357">4)</xref></sup> At other times Rabbi Akiba retracted his opinions in favor of those of Ben Azai <sup><xref rid="fn358">5)</xref></sup> and once Ben Azai vanquished Rabbi Akiba in a debate to the complete satisfaction of the other scholars. <sup><xref rid="fn359">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At first Ben Azai studied with Rabbi Tarphon <sup><xref rid="fn360">7)</xref></sup> then with Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah and later he became a disciple and friend of Rabbi Akiba. <sup><xref rid="fn361">8)</xref></sup> He then had many opportunities to inform Rabbi Akiba of the legal opinions of Rabbi Joshua. <sup><xref rid="fn362">9)</xref></sup> but his adoration of Rabbi Akiba was so great that he once said that in his eyes &#x201C;all the scholars taken together are of no more worth than the shell of garlic, except Rabbi Akiba,&#x201D; to whom he referred as &#x201C;the man with the bald head&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn363">10)</xref></sup> This contempt for the scholars of his time was expressed by Ben Azai, who on another occasion warned against underestimating any person and believing anything to be impossible. <sup><xref rid="fn364">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ben Azai engaged in his scholastic work in Tiberias. He was famous for his unusual diligence and after his death it was said that all diligence has departed. <sup><xref rid="fn365">12)</xref></sup> His great devotion to learning led him to become estranged from his wife <sup><xref rid="fn366">13)</xref></sup> who was the daughter of Rabbi Akiba. Like her mother, she also sent her husband to an academy. <sup><xref rid="fn367">14)</xref></sup> When Ben Azai once declared that &#x201C;he who does not strive to bring children into the world may be compared to a murderer&#x201D;, the people said to him &#x201C;You preach well but you do not practice your own principles.&#x201D; Ben Azai then answered, &#x201C;I cannot help it. My heart yearns for the Torah and the world will have to recreate itself without me.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn368">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the time of his death, Ben Azai was still a young man. From the descriptions of his life that we possess it is evident that his diligence, his renunciation of the joys of life and his piety contributed to his early death. His piety was known far and wide and people believed that &#x201C;he who sees Ben Azai in his dream may expect to become pious.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn369">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There exists another opinion that Ben Azai met with a violent death and that he was one of the first victims of Hadrian, but there is no historical substantiation for this point of view.</p>
<p>Ben Azai&#x2019;s legal opinions are frequently quoted in the Mishna as in the case of the &#x201C;red heifer&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#xFB44;&#x05E8;&#x05D4; &#x05D0;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D4;</span>) and also his belief that the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes are sacred. <sup><xref rid="fn370">17)</xref></sup> In this particular instance the discussion ends with the following words: &#x201C;They agreed and decided according to the words of Ben Azai.&#x201D; In the question of the advisability of teaching one&#x2019;s daughters, Ben Azai was of the opinion that every father should teach the Torah to his daughter. <sup><xref rid="fn371">18)</xref></sup> He also expressed an opinion regarding the time of the offering of tithes from cattle. <sup><xref rid="fn372">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ben Azai&#x2019;s philosophy of life is expressed in some of his teachings which can rank with the most highly civilized ethical precepts. &#x201C;Everyman whose understanding is clouded by his knowledge,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;should be approved of; but it is a bad sign for a man if his knowledge is clouded by his understanding.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn373">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>His favorite maxim stated, &#x201C;Be swift to fulfill a minor commandment even as you would an important one and flee from every transgression. For the reward of a commandment is a commandment and the reward of transgression is trangression. <sup><xref rid="fn374">21)</xref></sup> A more ample version of this maxim is given in Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan: &#x201C;If you have fulfilled a commandment without regret you will be led to fulfilling other commandments; but if you have committed a trangression without regretting it, you will be led to commit other transgressions.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The observance of God&#x2019;s commandments,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;requires a strong will. Thus we are commanded not to eat blood and the Bible says &#x2018;Be strong not to eat the blood&#x2019;. Even though this is an easy commandment to fulfill we must be strong; how much stronger must we be to fulfill other commandments.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He also said, &#x201C;When does God show the just men the reward that He has prepared for them? When they are near death.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn375">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time he advised as follows: &#x201C;When you seek a place to sit on, chose one which is a few steps lower than what you think you deserve. For it is better that you be told to go up rather than to descend.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn376">23)</xref></sup> The most important element of the Jewish faith is the Torah. Of this Ben Azai said: &#x201C;Whoever allows himself to be humiliated for the honor of the Torah, will be honored in the end, and he who degrades himself for the sake of the words of the Torah will be elevated in the end.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn377">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ben Azai expressed numerous interesting opinions regarding various omens accompanying death according to which it was possible to judge the life of the patient. It is a good omen for a man to die with a clear conscience and without regretting his life. Other good signs are if wise men are pleased with one; when the patient dies with his face turned upward and looking at the people surrounding him and when his face becomes suffused with color. <sup><xref rid="fn378">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>One time the people asked Ben Azai to expound the Lamentations. He then said: &#x201C;The Lamentations begin with the word &#x2018;Eicha&#x2019; and it should be explained according to its letters. The Aleph indicates that the Jews were exiled when they denied their only God; the Yud shows that they abandoned the ten commandments; the Chaf proves that they did not fulfill the commandment of circumsion which was given twenty generations after the creation of the world; the Heh shows that they denied the five books of the Torah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn379">26)</xref></sup> (Use is here made of the substitution of Hebrew letters for numbers: Aleph, 1; Chaf, 20; Yud, 10; Heh, 5.)</p>
<p>Legend relates that when Ben Azai was expounding he was surrounded by tongues of flame. The people thought that he was explaining the mysteries of the &#x201C;Divine Chariot,&#x201D; but it was only an ordinary exposition of the Torah. He then explained that the tongues of fire were caused by the joy of the Torah which remains new as on the day that it was given from Mount Sinai. Since the Torah was handed down in fire it is always accompanied by fire. <sup><xref rid="fn380">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aside from his underestimation of his colleagues, Ben Azai scorned those scholars who were not interested in gaining learning but merely wished to test their teachers. Of such people he said, &#x201C;It is easier to conquer the whole world than to sit in front of people who wrap themselves in their shawls and whose faces one cannot see.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn381">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his method of exposition Ben Azai followed in the footsteps of Rabbi Akiba. At times he amplified words of Rabbi Akiba with his own interpretation. Thus Rabbi Akiba said that it was because of the merit of the Jews that God spoke to Moses. Ben Azai expanded this statement to indicate that not only to Moses but to all other prophets God spoke because of the merit of the Jews. Another time he modified Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s explanation of the duty to serve God with one&#x2019;s whole soul in a manner that would prove that man must be ready to give his soul for the privilege of observing God&#x2019;s commandments. <sup><xref rid="fn382">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ben Azai believed in moralizing people with a view to improving them. When he was asked: &#x201C;How far must one go in his moralizing, whether until the person preached to is ready to fight or to curse, he answered that it was enough if such a person began to scold. <sup><xref rid="fn383">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>Simeon ben Zoma was another one of the four who entered the &#x201C;Garden of Knowledge&#x201D; in an attempt to determine the ways of heaven and earth and to fathom that which was before the world was created and that which will be after the world will cease to be.</p>
<p>Together with Ben Azai he was a pupil of Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah and later they both joined the academy of Rabbi Akiba who treated them as comrades and disciples. At the same time that Ben Azai met with an untimely death as a result of his attempt to fathom problems which no human reason can conceive, Ben Zoma went out of his mind and also died soon after that. Despite the fact that he was not ordained, Ben Zoma is twice referred to as Rabbi in the Talmud <sup><xref rid="fn384">31)</xref></sup> and he was listed among those disciples who attended the Sanhedrin and whose opinions were sought in discussing the laws. <sup><xref rid="fn385">32)</xref></sup> He was also prominent as a preacher and at his death it was said that good preaching has ceased. <sup><xref rid="fn386">33)</xref></sup> The high esteem in which his education was held by the people may be gauged from the popular belief that a person who sees Ben Zoma in his dream may surely expect an increase in wisdom. <sup><xref rid="fn387">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Very few of his Scriptural interpretations have come down to us, but those that are in existence indicate a brilliant mind that was somewhat eccentric from too much pondering. The Midrash cites <sup><xref rid="fn388">35)</xref></sup> that when the verse &#x201C;And God made the sky&#x201D; was being discussed Ben Zoma severely questioned its implication that God had to make the sky instead of creating it by pronouncing the word. The scholars frequently turned to him for advice and his opinion was taken as that of an authority. <sup><xref rid="fn389">36)</xref></sup> When the question of the offerings that were to be brought by a Nazarite was being debated, Ben Zoma differed with his teacher Rabbi Joshua and his opinion was established as the law. <sup><xref rid="fn390">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was elected Nasi, he declared that he could never convince his colleagues of the necessity of reciting the chapter on &#x201C;Tzitzith&#x201D;, which includes the mention of the deliverance from Egypt, during the evening Shema until Ben Zoma proved it from the Biblical verse &#x201C;And you shall remember the day of your deliverance from Egypt all the days of your life&#x201D; by concluding that the word &#x201C;all&#x201D; implies the obligation to mention the deliverance at night as well as during the day. But Ben Zoma could not understand the saying of the scholars that the deliverance from Egypt would have to be mentioned even after the coming of the Messiah until they derived their conclusion from the same word. <sup><xref rid="fn391">38)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The favorite maxim of Ben Zoma stated, &#x201C;Who is wise? He who learns from every man&#x0021; Who is strong? He who conquers his passions&#x0021; Who is rich? He who is satisfied with his portion&#x0021; Who is honored? He who honors others&#x0021;&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn392">39)</xref></sup> Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan adds the following to this maxim: &#x201C;Who is a most modest man? He who is as modest as Moses&#x0021; One who controls his passions may be compared to a man who conquers a city full of warriors.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is related that Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah once walked on the military highway and he met Ben Zoma who was so preoccupied with his thoughts that he did not even notice his teacher and did not greet him. Rabbi Joshua stopped Ben Zoma and asked him: &#x201C;Whence do you come and whither are you going, Ben Zoma?&#x201D; And he replied: &#x201C;I was contemplating the upper and the lower waters and I have discovered that the space between them is no more than the breadth of three fingers.&#x201D;<xref rid="fn393">&#x002A;</xref> <sup><xref rid="fn394">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Joshua heard his words he remarked to his pupils, &#x201C;You see, Ben Zoma still stands without.&#x201D; A short time after that Ben Zoma died. <sup><xref rid="fn395">41)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time Ben Zoma saw a great concourse of people and he said, &#x201C;Praised be God who probes all mysteries and who created so many people, no two of which have like faces nor like opinions and He nevertheless knows what transpires in the heart of each of them; and all these He created to serve me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ben Zoma also marvelled at human progress and said: &#x201C;Let us consider how much effort Adam had to exert before he could eat a piece of bread. He had to plow the field and sow the seed and harvest the grain then bind and thresh and winnow and select the grains, after that he ground the wheat and sifted the flour and kneaded the dough and baked it and only then could he eat bread; but I rise in the morning and find it all prepared and ready for my use.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Speaking in the same vein he also said: &#x201C;Let us consider the efforts of Adam before he had a garment to wear. He had to shear the wool or reap the flax then he had to comb the wool or beat the flax and after that he had to spin and weave it and only then could he wear a garment; but I rise in the morning and find it ready for my use. All the artisans of the world diligently toil to prepare all these for my satisfaction.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Another time he said: &#x201C;When a respectable person goes visiting, what does he say? May the name of my host be praised for the effort which he exerted on my behalf. How many wines and cakes and other good things he prepared for my sake. But when an ungrateful man goes visiting, what does he say? Whatever the host did, he did for his own wife and children. For how much did I consume? Only one slice of bread and one piece of cake and one glass of wine. <sup><xref rid="fn396">42)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some commentators explain this saying of Ben Zoma as illustrating the attitudes of various types of people to God who prepared everything for the benefit of humanity. Some are willing to thank Him while others say that no thanks need be given because God wanted to have people on the earth and He therefore had to provide them with all their needs even as He provides for all the other creatures.</p>
<ftnote id="fn353">&#x002A;) The literal meaning of &#x201C;Pardes&#x201D; is a grove. The entrance of the four into the &#x201C;Pardes&#x201D; is explained by some commentators to show that by the power of sacred names they ascended heaven and were punished for looking at the &#x201C;Shechina&#x201D;. Later commentators explained the word &#x201C;Pardes&#x201D; according to its letters as symbolizing a four branched system of expounding the Torah&#x2014; Peshat, (<span dir="rtl">&#xFB44;&#x05E9;&#x05D8;</span>) simple explanation; Remez (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05DE;&#x05D6;</span>) hidden hints; Derash, (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05E8;&#x05E9;</span>) exposition; Sod, (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;</span>) mystical interpretation. Describing what they saw in the &#x201C;Pardes&#x201D;, the Talmud states that Rabbi Akiba warned his colleagues that when they come to the place of the &#x201C;pure marble&#x201D; they should not shout, &#x201C;Water&#x201D;. Rashi comments on this that the marble resembled water and Rabbi Akiba intended that they should not become discouraged and say: &#x201C;Here is a body of water; how can we cross it?&#x201D;</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Elisha ben Avuya &quot;Acher&quot;</title>
<p>E<small>LISHA BEN</small> A<small>VUYAH</small> was the third member of the group of four who penetrated the Pardes of knowledge. Because of his unusual ideas regarding Judaism, which were held to be harmful to the faith, he came to be called &#x201C;Acher&#x201D;&#x2014;the one who is different&#x2014;and it was said that his delving into the mysteries of the faith confused him to such a degree that he finally came to oppose it. In the idiom of that day it was said that he &#x201C;cut down the plants.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Elisha was still a student at the academy, everyone believed that he had no other interests outside of the Torah, but he read many Greek poems and books of philosophy filled his pockets. Years later, when the Roman government sought to suppress the Torah and forced the Jews to break its commandments, Elisha advised the enemy and pointed out to the Romans which labors a Jew may perform on the Sabbath without incurring a sin.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;unclean&#x201D; books which Elisha read are referred to in the Talmud as &#x201C;books of the erroneous&#x201D; and &#x201C;books of the heretics.&#x201D; Because of the severe persecutions, the faith of many became weakened and they turned to these sects. It would seem that Elisha hovered between the two, but the spark of Judaism continued to bum within him. He had absorbed too much of the Torah to be able to break away from it entirely.</p>
<p>It is difficult at this day to define the teachings of the Gnostics. They pondered the mysteries of the Godhead and employed both rationalism as well as mysticism in their attempt to solve the problem. An important question for them was the determination of the material from which God created the world. Recognizing that the world was motivated by various forces, they concluded that God in heaven had no control over events on earth. At first they believed that the world was created out of a definite material which they could not describe and they also believed that there existed forces which were not subject to the control of God and that the angels participated in the government of the world. Later they altogether denied the existence of a God who rules the world.</p>
<p>These doubters were considered harmful to the Jewish faith and they were persecuted and expelled from Jewish society. They then joined other sects, but they were also expelled from there. These confused spculations brought Elisha to a state of extreme pessimism and depression and he was haunted by a voice from heaven which seemed to announce: &#x201C;Repent, all lost children, except Acher, for whom there is no repenance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Elisha believed that people suffer for the sins of their parents and he declared that when he was still a child his father sinned in vowing to make a scholar out of his son, not in order to fulfill the commandment of studying the Torah but out of pride. He was also oppressed by the weight of the sin of his mother who happened to pass by a house of idol worshiping when she was pregnant and inhaled the odors of the unclean sacrifices.</p>
<p>Concerning his origin Elisha told that his father was one of the wealthiest men in Jerusalem. On the day of Elisha&#x2019;s circumcision, his father prepared a great feast and invited all the prominent men of the city among whom were the two greatest scholars of the day, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanos and Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah. When the guests turned to idle conversation after the feast, Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Joshua, &#x201C;Let them speak of that which interests them while we will go to another room and discuss matters of the Torah.&#x201D; When they began to discuss the Torah, a cloud of fire descended from heaven and enveloped them. Seeing this Avuyah said to them, &#x201C;Do you wish to bum my house?&#x201D; But they replied, &#x201C;God forbid&#x0021; We do not play with fire but are only discussing the Torah.&#x201D; Avuyah then said, &#x201C;If the power of the Torah is so great, then I vow that if my son will live to reach manhood I will consecrate him to the Torah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Talmud relates that the name &#x201C;Acher&#x201D; by which Elisha was called was not given to him by the scholars but by a harlot. It is told that a decision was adopted in heaven that since Elisha embraced an &#x201C;evil culture&#x201D; and lost his share in the world to come, he was to be allowed to enjoy the pleasures of this world to the full. Elisha once encountered a harlot on the street and asked her to go with him but she said, &#x201C;Are you not Elisha ben Avuyah whose name is renowned throughout the world?&#x201D; He tried to prove that he was another person and, it being a Sabbath day, he pulled out a radish from a field and offered it to her. The woman then remarked, &#x201C;If you do so, you must be someone else.&#x201D; (Acher &#x2014;a different one.) Since that time the name &#x201C;Acher&#x201D; clung to Elisha.</p>
<p>But despite Elisha&#x2019;s heresies, he did not cease to study the Torah. Some even claim that he revered it to his dying day and praised those who fulfilled its commandments. Some of his sayings have become immortalized but it seems probable that the scholars refrained from acknowledging his authorship in many instances and even refused to quote them as having been stated by &#x201C;Acher&#x201D;. His statements generally dealt with secular and human problems. In only one instance is his name mentioned in connection with a regulation regarding mourning. <sup><xref rid="fn397">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elisha was the teacher of Rabbi Meir, who was also a disciple of Rabbi Akiba and who was held in great esteem by his colleagues. The name of Rabbi Meir is frequently mentioned as the author of many opinions; but whenever it was suspected that Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s statements were based on the opinions of his teacher Elisha, such statement were referred to as &#x201C;others say&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD; &#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>).</p>
<p>Legends surround all of Elisha&#x2019;s accomplishments from his childhood till the day of his death. Thus it was told that he sought to uproot the Torah and went from one academy to another driving out the pupils and handing over the teachers to be executed by the government. He then used to say, &#x201C;Why waste the time of innocent children with such things? Would it not be better if they were taught to be masons or carpenters, hunters or tailors?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Another legend tells that when Elisha entered &#x201C;Pardes&#x201D;, he saw the angel Metateron whose duty it is to write down all the good deeds of the Jews once every day and he asked: &#x201C;How is it that we have learned that none ever sit down in heaven for no weariness exists there but I saw the angel sitting when he recorded the deeds of the Jews. Is it possible that there are two kinds of forces which guide the world?&#x201D;</p>
<p>The angel was then scourged with sixty fiery lashes to prove to Elisha that he had no more rights than the others. It was then asked, &#x201C;Why should the angel have been punished?&#x201D; The answer was given that the angel should have risen when he saw Elisha. But despite the punishment the angel was given the privilege of erasing all the good deeds of Elisha from the book of records.</p>
<p>It is probable that Elisha headed an academy before he was overcome by doubts and of his pupils Rabbi Meir attained prominence. Rabbi Meir said that he considered Elisha as one does a pomegranate&#x2014;he ate the heart of the fruit and threw away the skin. Rabbi Meir sought every opportunity to listen to Elisha in an attempt to learn something new from him. Once on a Sabbath, Rabbi Meir was sitting with his pupils in the academy when he was informed that Elisha was riding by. Rabbi Meir went out to hear what Elisha had to say, but Elisha continued riding on his horse and Rabbi Meir followed him. When they approached the limit which one is allowed to walk on the Sabbath, Elisha said, &#x201C;Turn back Meir for you may go no farther. By the walk of my horse I recognize that we have reached the limit of the distance one may walk on the Sabbath.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Meir then said, &#x201C;Will you not return also?&#x201D;, but Elisha answered, &#x201C;I have told you long ago that I heard a voice from behind the scenes that all strayed children may repent except &#x2018;Acher&#x2019;.&#x201D; Rabbi Meir insisted that they return to the academy. The first boy whom they met, Elisha asked what he had learned on that day and the boy replied, &#x201C;There is no peace for the wicked, says God.&#x201D; (Isaiah, 48:22) They then approached another academy and Elisha again asked the first boy whom they met what he had learned and the boy answered, &#x201C;Even though you wash in much chalk and use much soap the stain of your sin will remain.&#x201D; (Jeremiah, 2:22) They thus made the rounds of thirteen academies and in every instance the children recited verses which were bad omens. Finally they approached the thirteenth academy and the boy said that he had learned the verse, &#x201C;To the wicked God says, why do you speak of my laws?&#x201D; (Psalms, 50:16) The boy stammered while reciting and it seemed to Elisha that the boy said <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05E9;&#x05E2;</span> instead of <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05E9;&#x05E2;</span> (wicked). Elisha became very angry and some say that he drew a dagger and killed the boy while others claim that he merely said, &#x201C;If I had a dagger I would now kill you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Another time Elisha is said to have asked Rabbi Meir for his interpretation of the verse, &#x201C;One against another God made them&#x201D;. (Eccles. 7:14) Rabbi Meir said that whatever God created, He also created its opposite; He created high mountains and low hills; He created the seas and the rivers. Elisha then remarked, &#x201C;Rabbi Akiba explained this verse otherwise. He said that God created just men and wicked men; He created a Paradise and a Gehenna. Every Jew may therefore choose between two shares, one in Paradise and one in Gehenna. If he is a just man he takes his own and his neighbor&#x2019;s share in Paradise; if he is a wicked man he takes his own and his neighbor&#x2019;s share in Gehenna.</p>
<p>Elisha also asked Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s explanation of the verse, &#x201C;She may not be valued in gold or in glass and vessels of pure gold are not her equal.&#x201D; (Job, 28:17.) Rabbi Meir declared that the verse refers to the Torah which can not be valued in gold but is broken as easily as glass. Elisha said, &#x201C;Not so did your teacher Rabbi Akiba say. He said that just as golden and glass vessels may be mended after they are broken, even so may a sinful scholar be made whole again.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Will you not repent now?&#x201D; Rabbi Meir said. But Elisha answered, &#x201C;I am lost for I heard a voice that all may repent except Acher.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Talmud further relates that when Elisha died it was said in heaven that he can neither be judged nor can he have a share in the world to come. He could not be judged because he devoted himself to the Torah and he lost his share in the world to come because of his sins. Rabbi Meir said that it was better that he be judged that he may afterward regain his share in the world to come. &#x201C;When I die,&#x201D; Rabbi Meir said, &#x201C;you will see smoke coming out of Elisha&#x2019;s grave for I will certainly bring him to judgment because of his knowledge of the Torah.&#x201D; Afterward Rabbi Meir also told that when Elisha was nearing death he wept because of his sins and it seemed that he repented in his heart.</p>
<p>After Elisha&#x2019;s death his daughter (the Jerusalem Talmud says his daughters) came to Rabbi Jehuda the Nasi to ask for bread. Rabbi Jehuda asked her who she was and she said, &#x201C;I am the daughter of Elisha.&#x201D; Rabbi Jehuda wondered that such a wicked man had children who remained Jews but the daughter pleaded, &#x201C;Remember his Torah and overlook his deeds.&#x201D; Fire then descended from heaven and enveloped Rabbi Jehuda. Rabbi Jehuda wept and said, &#x201C;If this happens to those who dishonor the Torah, how much more can happen to those who glory in it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Some historians maintain that one of the reasons for Elisha&#x2019;s abandonment of Judaism was his great envy of Rabbi Akiba. Elisha felt humiliated that a man of unknown origin who began his studies in his later years should be elevated to such a high position by the people. He then said, &#x201C;He who learns when a youth may be compared to one writing with ink on new paper, but when one begins his studies after he is old it may be compared to writing on erased paper.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn398">2)</xref></sup> This is more exactly expressed in Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan: &#x201C;He who studies in his youth absorbs the words of the Torah into his blood and they come clearly out of his mouth; but he who studies when he is old does not absorb the words of the Torah into his blood and they come out of his mouth indistinct.&#x201D;</p>
<p>From Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s statements we may conclude that he was an enemy of Elisha. Rabbi Akiba opposed Greek philosophy and said that whoever studies it loses his share in the world to come. Since Elisha devoted himself to Greek writings we may assume that Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s words were directed at him.</p>
<p>Elisha seems to have had no sympathy with the movement of rebellion against Rome. When the Roman government began to persecute the students of the Torah, Elisha maintained, as did many other scholars, that one must not endanger his life for it.</p>
<p>A Talmudic legend traces the beginning of Elisha&#x2019;s doubts to his having seen a man climb a tree to remove a nest containing both fledglings and the mother bird. Although this was against the commandment of the Torah, nothing happened to the man. The following day he saw another man removing a nest with fledglings but the man sent the mother bird away, as the Torah commanded. Although the fulfillment of this commandment is to be rewarded by long life, the man was bitten by a snake when he descended from the tree and he immediately died. Elisha then asked, &#x201C;Where is the long life that was promised to the man?&#x201D; Others said that he began to doubt when he saw the tongue of Rabbi Jeduha the Baker (or of Rabbi Hutzpith the Interpreter) dragged around by dogs. Elisha then came to the conclusion that there was no reward for just men and he also lost his belief in the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>We have already remarked that there probably exist numerous opinions of Elisha whose authorship is not acknowledged. But Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan contains a chapter devoted to Elisha&#x2019;s sayings and to his opinions regarding men of great learning who also commit good deeds and men who only possess great learning. Elisha there says that a man of learning and of good deeds may be compared to a structure built on a foundation of stone while the walls are made of bricks; even the greatest flood cannot undermine such a structure. But a man who possesses much learning but no good deeds may be compared to a structure with a foundation of bricks and walls of stone. Such a structure is easily undermined.</p>
<p>Another statement of Elisha in the same book well characterizes the man. He said: &#x201C;A man may study for twenty years and forget all his knowledge in two years so that he would not know to differentiate between the clean and the unclean and he would confuse the opinions of one scholar with those of another until he finally would have to remain silent.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It thus becomes obvious that Elisha was a man of contradictions. At times he honored the Torah and was a friend of the scholars. On other occasions he was an enemy of the Torah and aided the Roman government in persecuting the scholars. He was always full of regrets and contemplated repentance but he was deeply convinced that he was beyond repentance because of his many sins.</p>
<p>Elisha&#x2019;s greatest crime was his treason to his people and his aiding the enemy at a time of persecution against the Jews. His intentions might not have been treasonable and it is possible that he honestly believed that bowing to the will of the Romans was the best policy. But history has proved this opinion to be false and the attempts to placate the Romans have ended in catastrophe. It is therefore no wonder that Elisha was condemned.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel II</title>
<p>D<small>ESPITE ALL</small> the decrees and the false accusations which the Roman government levelled against the Jews in its attempt to eradicate their feeling of national solidarity and to make impossible their observance of the Torah, the Romans were unsuccessful. At the very moment that the oppression of the faith seemed to become intolerable, the Jews discovered a neighboring country where they could freely maintain their faith and openly live as Jews. This country was Babylonia. Babylonia was then ruled by the Parthians who withstood all efforts of the Romans to subjugate them and all the might of the Roman empire did not suffice to penetrate their borders.<xref rid="fn399">&#x002A;</xref>)</p>
<p>Hadrian, who was responsible for much of the suffering inflicted upon the Jews, died and was succeeded by Antoninus Pius who immediately lightened the burden of the Palestinian Jews. It seems that there occurred a rebellion of the non-Jewish population of Palestine which was supported by the Parthians. Wishing to placate the Jews and to prevent their participation in the uprising, Antoninus Pius ordered that they should be treated more kindly.</p>
<p>The news of the improved political position of the Palestinian Jews rapidly reached Babylonia and many of the exiles, together with a great number of the scholars who fled Palestine, began to return. Among these repatriates there was also Rabban Simeon the son of Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh. Upon his return he was elected Nasi as Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the Second.</p>
<p>Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel II was a sixth generation descendant of Hillel and he was considered fit to hold the position of his forefathers. During the time of the Bar Kochba rebellion and the persecutions that followed it Rabban Simeon remained in hiding and none heard of him; but when the Romans later permitted the reorganization of the Sanhedrin they did not object to the election of Rabban Simeon as Nasi.</p>
<p>The newly reorganized Sanhedrin settled in Usha instead of Jabneh. Among the repatriates there also returned Rabbi Nathan the Babylonian, who was the son of the Exilarch of that country, and he was appointed head of the court. Rabbi Meir, the disciple of Elisha ben Avuyah, received the title of &#x201C;Chacham&#x201D; and was the third leader of the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p>But Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel was not elected Nasi merely because he was a descendant of Hillel. His elevation to this post was due primarily to his personal qualifications. The scholars knew him well from the time that he was a young man in his father&#x2019;s house. At that time he strictly observed the commandment to honor one&#x2019;s father and in spite of the fact that Rabban Gamliel possessed many slaves, Rabban Simeon diligently sought to serve him. He frequently complained that &#x201C;no matter how much I serve my father it is not even a hundredth part of that which Esau did for his father Isaac.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn400">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As long as he was Nasi, Rabban Simeon sought to enhance the importance of that office. He once conceived the idea of doing away with the equality of the three leaders of the Sanhedrin which was the rule till that time. He then issued a regulation that when the Nasi entered the academy everyone was to rise and to remain standing until the Nasi would command them to be seated; when the head of the court entered, the people on both sides were to form two lines and were to remain standing until he was seated; when the &#x201C;Chacham&#x201D; entered everyone was to retain his position, whether seated or standing, until the &#x201C;Chacham&#x201D; took his seat. <sup><xref rid="fn401">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>This regulation was issued on a day when neither Rabbi Nathan nor Rabbi Meir were in the academy. When they came on the following day they considered this regulation as an attempt to diminish their authority in the eyes of the people. They were both greatly angered and Rabbi Meir declared that by issuing this regulation the Nasi broke a long standing custom that a man may only be advanced in sacred authority but not demoted. They decided to repay the Nasi in kind and since they were considered to be better informed in matters of law than the Nasi was, they determined to confront him with questions which he would be unable to answer. In thus exposing the Nasi&#x2019;s inadequate learning they hoped to have him deposed even as his father was once deposed.</p>
<p>Rabbi Nathan and Rabbi Meir decided to ask the Nasi to expound the regulations pertaining to the stems of fruit and its bearing on the cleanliness of the fruit. They expected to be able to confuse him very easily in these matters. But one of the Nasi&#x2019;s devoted adherents heard of the plan and he thought that such questions and pilpulistic reasoning may bring shame on the Nasi. He therefore began to walk back and forth in front of the Nasi until he attracted his attention. He then told the Nasi of the plot and Rabban Simeon prepared himself for all possible questions. To make doubly sure, he did not allow Rabbi Nathan and Rabbi Meir to enter the academy on that day. They then sent in their questions in writing from the outside and Rabban Simeon sought to answer them as best he could. Whenever he was in doubt regarding some matter, the two on the outside sent in their answers.</p>
<p>Seeing this game Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta said to the Nasi: &#x201C;The Torah remains outside while we sit calmly within.&#x201D; Rabban Simeon permitted the two expelled scholars to return but he ruled that all laws which were to be enacted according to their opinions from that day on should not be quoted in their names. This ruling was adopted and all the laws determined by Rabbi Nathan were prefaced by &#x201C;some say&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05E9; &#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) while those of Rabbi Meir were quoted as &#x201C;others say&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD; &#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>).</p>
<p>Some time later both Rabbi Nathan and Rabbi Meir beheld a dream in which they were told to become reconciled to the Nasi. Rabbi Nathan obeyed the dream: he bowed before the will of the Nasi and submitted to punishment, but Rabbi Meir refused to submit and he declared that all dreams were vain. The Nasi brought the matter before the scholars and they decided to excommunicate Rabbi Meir. When he heard of it he sent word to the scholars warning them not to take this unjust step and also that he would not recognize the excommunication. <sup><xref rid="fn402">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the end Rabbi Meir had to leave Palestine and he settled in a city of Asia Minor, where he remained until his death. Before his death he sent a message to Palestine saying: &#x201C;Your Messiah (&#x0021;) died on strange soil.&#x201D; He also commanded that he be buried on the shore of the sea which touches Palestine so that it should be the same as if he was buried in that country. <sup><xref rid="fn403">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his exposition Rabban Simeon followed his own method. He taught his disciples only those laws which had been sanctioned by the great court and he avoided all those which were in doubt or concerning which there were differences of opinion and which had not yet been discussed with the consent of the majority of the scholars. Whenever people came to him for trial in money matters he ruled that the custom of the country and common sense must determine the judgment even when the scholars arrived at differing conclusions from the text of the Bible. Rabban Simeon also tried to raise the prestige of the court and he said that the decision of a judge must be considered as the law.</p>
<p>In his father&#x2019;s house there were many scholars who studied Greek and Rabban Simeon declared that it was permissible to write a book of the Torah in that language. <sup><xref rid="fn404">5)</xref></sup> Another time he declared that only in the Greek language was it possible to make a correct translation of the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn405">6)</xref></sup> He was also versed in the natural sciences and in horticulture, <sup><xref rid="fn406">7)</xref></sup> and he was acquainted with the sciences of anatomy and medicine. When he was consulted regarding problems of marital life or concerning the laws which forbid or allow certain actions, he always paid more attention to the intent of an action rather than to its superficial aspect.</p>
<p>Rabban Simeon sided with the weak against the strong and he supported the rights of women in the laws of a &#x201C;Kethubah&#x201D;. He demanded justice for Gentile slaves and declared that people are commanded to redeem slaves just as they are obliged to ransom free men who had been kidnapped. <sup><xref rid="fn407">8)</xref></sup> He supported capital punishment for murderers in order to prevent the increase of murderers among Jews. This conviction he held against the opinion of many scholars who were opposed to capital punishment. <sup><xref rid="fn408">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Being tolerant toward people of other faiths Rabban Simeon said that a Gentile who appears before a Jewish court should be judged according to Jewish law. <sup><xref rid="fn409">10)</xref></sup> Documents of indebtedness which were signed by non-Jews he held to be valid and, in opposition to the conviction of other scholars, he maintained that Samaritans were to be considered as Jews in all matters for every commandment which the Samaritans undertook to observe they observed more scrupulously than the Jews. <sup><xref rid="fn410">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabban Simeon said that the world is based on three things: truth, justice and peace. <sup><xref rid="fn411">12)</xref></sup> In his lectures he stressed the value of peace and declared that numerous passages of the Torah use ambiguous language out of a desire for peace. <sup><xref rid="fn412">13)</xref></sup> On another occasion he declared that &#x201C;he who makes peace in his own home is like one who makes peace among all Jews. <sup><xref rid="fn413">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabban Simeon was raised in royal splendor in his father&#x2019;s house and for this reason he frequently complained that Jewish life had lost its glamor of days past and that even nature had changed in Palestine in comparison with earlier days. In days gone by God had shown his love for Israel and sometimes even changed the course of natural events for their sake. <sup><xref rid="fn414">15)</xref></sup> But since the destruction of the temple the dew no longer causes the plants to grow and the fruit has lost its taste. <sup><xref rid="fn415">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>All the religious innovations which his father introduced in Jabneh, such as the lighting of candles in honor of the Sabbath, Rabban Simeon sought to establish in Usha. In this attempt, however, he met with but little success. He often recounted the memories of early days, when the temple was still in existence, which he heard in his father&#x2019;s house. He would gladly have introduced in Usha all the customs of which he had heard were it not for the opposition which he met from other scholars.</p>
<p>He also endeavored to strengthen the office of Nasi with an eye to establishing the rule of the dynasty. Since he was the sixth Nasi descended from Hillel, he believed that a scion of the dynasty was entitled to the office of Nasi even if he was not the greatest in his generation and that it was inconceivable for a member of another family to occupy the post. This effort of his was especially strengthened by the remembrance that when his grandfather Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the Elder was killed by the Romans, he was not immediately succeeded by his son. When the son was later elected Nasi he was afterward deposed for a short time. After the death of Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh, the office was not at once conferred upon the rightful heir and other candidates were tested first. He was especially impelled by the desire to avoid in the future any repetition of that which happened to his father and which almost happened to himself&#x2014;that a sudden opposition to the actions or the opinions of the Nasi should make it possible to have him deposed.</p>
<p>With a special poignancy Rabban Simeon used to tell of the time before the temple was destroyed. His father saw the temple when he was still a child and he repeated his memories to Rabban Simeon. He told that Jews had no holidays happier than the fifteenth day of Ab and the Day of Atonement when the girls all paraded through the streets dressed in white garments which they borrowed from one another in order not to shame those which did not possess any. Afterward they danced in the vineyards and called upon the young men who came to watch them to choose the most beautiful or the wisest as their brides. <sup><xref rid="fn416">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He also told of the Jerusalem custom of receiving guests that the host would offer them the use of the house and would himself remain outdoors overnight, <sup><xref rid="fn417">18)</xref></sup> and of the river Shiloah whose waters welled out through an opening no larger than a copper coin. When the king commanded that the mouth of the river be widened, the quantity of water decreased; the king therefore ordered that the opening be sealed again and the water continued to flow as heretofore. Rabban Simeon also declared that there was no organ in the temple because it was liable to interfere with the harmony of the singers although that instrument is pleasing to the ear by itself. <sup><xref rid="fn418">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel recounted these stories because he wanted to maintain the patriotic fervor of the people for Jerusalem and he was also convinced that the city would regain its old splendor even in his day. He believed that when the Jews would be liberated from the Roman yoke Jerusalem would become a center for all surrounding nations and that people would flock thither to learn the true faith. Because of his devotion to Jerusalem he stressed the significance of Tisha b&#x2019;Ab and declared that one who breaks the fast of Tisha b&#x2019;Ab is like one who eats on the Day of Atonement. <sup><xref rid="fn419">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>For although the government persisted in its persecutions, the people seemed to have become accustomed to these and as long as the existence of the Sanhedrin was permitted the people did not complain much of the other forms of oppression. This is evident from the saying of Rabban Simeon that &#x201C;our forefathers could not endure even a little suffering but we who suffer for so many generations have more cause to lose our patience. <sup><xref rid="fn420">21)</xref></sup> Another time he said: &#x201C;We have learned to love our sufferings but were we to write them down, we would not have enough strength.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn421">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some people once approached Rabban Simeon and attempted to persuade him that it would be well for the Jews to aid the Egyptians in an attempt to overthrow the Romans and Rabban Simeon said to them, &#x201C;If we look at the wealthy and wicked government we can see that all its regiments are always occupied both day and night but when we look at Egypt we see its soldiers always idle. How then can we hope to be victorious with their help?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn422">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the previously described behavior of Rabban Simeon one may get the impression that he was a proud man. Such a conclusion, however, would be far from the truth for Rabban Simeon was renowned for his modesty. In the performance of his duties as Nasi he dictated his will and brooked no opposition, but in private life there could not be found another man as modest as he was. When in his capacity of Nasi he determined a leap year (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;</span>), he wrote to all the Jewish communities informing them that he consulted no one and made the decision himself&#x2014;as against the custom of his father who wrote that he made the decision with the consent of his colleagues. But of his personal modesty an anecdote was being related of a man who vowed not to touch his wife until she would spit in the face of the Nasi. The woman did so and Rabban Simeon did not scold her. When Rabban Simeon&#x2019;s son complained to him that he had been insulted by Rabbi Elazar ben Simeon, he said to him, &#x201C;My son, pay no attention to it for Rabbi Elazar is a lion, the son of a lion, but you are only a lion, the son of a fox.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn423">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aside from the above mentioned sayings of Rabban Simeon, the following maxims are characteristic of his trend of thought:</p>
<p>Every commandment which the Jews joyfully accepted from Mount Sinai they continue to observe with joy and no amount of persecution will avail against them. <sup><xref rid="fn424">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>One may profane the Sabbath for the sake of a living, day old child, but one may not profane the Sabbath for the sake of a dead King David. <sup><xref rid="fn425">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When a man sells his daughter or a book of the Torah in order to satisfy his hunger, such a sale will never bring him luck. <sup><xref rid="fn426">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is not necessary to reect monuments to just men for their words are their memorials. <sup><xref rid="fn427">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It might have been necessary to pass a law forbidding the eating of meat and the drinking of wine since the temple was destroyed; but such a law could not be enforced and it is therefore unnecessary to enact it. Ever since the government decreed that no one must engage in the study of the Torah it should have been necessary to enact a law that people should not marry and have children. The necessity for teaching the Torah to the children would then no longer exist. But one must not think of doing so and the Jews must be allowed to do as they wish and they will certainly find the right way to save themselves from the decrees. <sup><xref rid="fn428">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>If a man vows not to eat meat, he may still eat the head and the feet of an animal, for these parts are not considered as meat and he who eats them is not considered a man. <sup><xref rid="fn429">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He who studies the Torah in his youth is like a young man who marries a virgin and both possess their youthful ardor; she turns to him with love and he embraces her; but he who began to study the Torah in his old age may be compared to an old man who married a virgin; she lovingly caresses him but he avoids her. <sup><xref rid="fn430">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A student who abandons the Torah may be compared to a bird which cannot find its nest and is sure to fall to the ground when it is weary of its wanderings. <sup><xref rid="fn431">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been mentioned before that many Jews settled in the neighboring countries to escape the persecution of the Romans. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel strove to preserve the significance of Palestine as the center of the Jewish faith in the minds of the exiles and to prevent the establishment of another new religious center similar to the &#x201C;Temple of Onias&#x201D; in Alexandria. In this effort he was eminently successful.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Nathan of Babylonia</title>
<p>T<small>HE CITY</small> of Usha was chosen as the seat of the Sanhedrin after that body was reorganized with the permission of the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius who ascended the throne some time after the destruction of Betar. At the time that Rome was almost successful in eradicating Judaism from Palestine there developed a new center of Jewish spiritual life in Babylonia, which was not subject to Roman rule. The city of Nehardea occupied a particularly prominent place in the life of the Jews because it was the seat of the Exilarch who represented the Babylonian Jews and who was granted special privileges by the Parthian government. Before Nehardea attained its importance, there was a large Jewish settlement in the city of Netsivin which was closer to Palestine but Hadrian&#x2019;s legions reached this city and laid it waste and slaughtered its inhabitants. Among those that saved their lives there was also Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra II who later organized an academy. But he did not succeed in concentrating a large number of people about his academy because everyone sought to settle farther in the interior of Babylonia in order to be safe from Roman attacks. It was then that another scholar Hananiah (or Hanna) the nephew of Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah, selected Nehardea as his residence and established there a large academy.</p>
<p>When it became known in Babylonia that all religious activity in Palestine was being suppressed, Hananiah undertook to establish a Supreme Court. Feeling convinced that since the destruction of the temple the main duties of the court consisted in determining the leap years and establishing the dates for the festivals, he believed that these functions could just as well be fulfilled in Babylonia. But this situation was considered by the Palestinian scholars as an attempt to undermine their authority. The Nasi, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, especially objected to self established authorities outside of Palestine and he sent two special messengers to BabyIonia to attempt to change matters.</p>
<p>This mission to Babylonia is described in two differing versions.<xref rid="fn432">&#x002A;</xref>)</p>
<p>It is told that the Nasi entrusted three letters to the messengers which he sent to Hananiah in Babylonia and he commanded them to show these letters one at a time. The first letter contained &#x201C;greetings to the worthy holiness of Hananiah&#x201D;. When the messengers were asked what their mission was in coming to Babylonia, they said that they came to study. Hananiah then presented them to his colleagues and said, &#x201C;These are renowned men whose forefathers conducted the service in the temple.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Later the messengers paid close attention to the expositions of Hananiah and attempted to prove to him that he was in error regarding various laws. Greatly angered Hananiah wanted to denounce them but they showed him the second letter of the Nasi which informed him that &#x201C;the kids which he had left in Palestine had meanwhile grown up and developed sharp horns.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hananiah wanted to denounce the messengers from Palestine as swindlers but they said to him, &#x201C;Since you believed our words before, you cannot now denounce us.&#x201D; At the same time they also gave him the third letter of the Nasi in which Hananiah was commanded not to assume the right of establishing New Years and determining the Holidays. Hananiah objected that he had a right to do whatever he thought was best for the people and he also cited that Rabbi Akiba once determined a leap year when he was outside the boundaries of Palestine.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do not compare yourself to Rabbi Akiba,&#x201D; the messengers answered, &#x201C;for none could compare with him even in Palestine.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Neither did I leave in Palestine anyone that could compare with me,&#x201D; Hananiah retorted.</p>
<p>The messengers then called his attention to the contents of the second letter which reminded him that the small people which he left in Palestine had grown in stature and that they commanded him, &#x201C;if you will obey and depart from your ways all will be well, otherwise you will be driven out from the community of Israel and you can choose a place for an altar and sacrifices and music even as the Jews of Alexandria once did.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the messengers realized that Hananiah was still unwilling to submit, one of them ascended to read the Torah on the day that Hananiah declared to be a feast day, but he changed the text to read, &#x201C;These are the holidays of Hananiah&#x201D;. The audience immediately corrected him that he should read &#x201C;These are the holidays of God&#x201D;. The messenger replied, &#x201C;It is true that in our books it is written &#x2018;These are the holidays of God,&#x2019; but here one should substitute the name of Hananiah because he determines the holidays as he chooses and not as God commanded&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Then the second messenger arose and recited a verse &#x201C;Out of Babylon shall come the Torah&#x201D;; the audience corrected him that he should say &#x201C;Out of Zion&#x201D;. The messenger replied: &#x201C;In our books it is written &#x2018;Out of Zion,&#x2019; but judging by your conduct you may write &#x201C;Out of Babylon&#x201D; in your books.&#x201D;</p>
<p>All the people gathered began to weep and were ready to obey the words of the messengers from Palstine but Hananiah still refused to submit. He went to Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra of Netsivin to ask his advice. Rabbi Jehudah suggested that he submit because the Great Court of Palestine was the only body with authority to regulate the religious life of the people both within as well as outside of Palestine.</p>
<p>It is also related of Hananiah that he frequently travelled from Palestine to Babylonia but he was always grieved to leave the country. Once he was accompanied by Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra, Rabbi Mathia ben Harash and Rabbi Jonathan. When they reached the boundary of Palestine and bethought themselves of the land which they were leaving, they rent their garments and wept. Grieved at the thought of leaving the Land of Israel, they abandoned all thoughts of personal safety which awaited them in Babylonia and returned. <sup><xref rid="fn433">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hananiah was a pupil of his uncle at Jabneh and later he mingled among the greatest men of his generation. When he fell sick, he was visited by the most outstanding persons but because of his frequent departures from Palestine and his attempt to rebel against the scholars of Palestine he was not ordained. Two or three times he is referred to in the Talmud as Rabbi but this appears to be an error of the copyists. His legal opinions are not quoted in the Mishna but they frequently appear in the &#x201C;Boraitha&#x201D;.<xref rid="fn434">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Hananiah visited Babylonia several times and each time he returned to Palestine but after his clash with the messengers of the Nasi he remained in Babylonia permanently.</p>
<p>The reason that Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah sent his nephew, Hananiah, to Babylonia is said to have been due, not so much to the danger which threatened all scholars of Palestine as to the fact that the &#x201C;Minim&#x201D; (the Jewish Christians) cast a spell on him and he forgot which day it was and came riding to the academy on the Sabbath. Wishing to save him from this spell, his uncle sent him away to Babylonia.</p>
<p>The Jews of Babylonia lived in security and peace while the Jews of Palestine were being sorely oppressed. Even after the emperor Antoninus Pius alleviated their prosecutions and granted them freedom to observe all the customs of the Jewish faith, the situation of Palestine Jewry still could not compare to that of the Jews of Babylon who enjoyed autonomy in their religious life under the leadership of an Exilarch. But these differences in favor of Babylonia did not deter many Jews from returning to Palestine as soon as they heard of the improved situation in that country for everyone believed that in Babylonia he was removed from God and that God&#x2019;s grace rested only in Palestine.</p>
<p>During the time that Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel was Nasi in Palestine Rabbi Nathan of Babylonia came to settle in that country and the Sanhedrin at Usha elected him head of the Court soon after his arrival. Rabbi Nathan was the son of the Exilarch as is evident from the remark of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel who said to him: &#x201C;Now that you are head of the court because of the silver girdle of your father (the official symbol of the rank of the Exilarch) you should not strive to become Nasi.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn435">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There exists an opinion that Rabbi Nathan had visited Palestine before he was elected head of the court and that he was a pupil of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and of other scholars whom he later mentioned. But when the persecutions increased, he left the country and travelled through many lands until the political situation improved when Antoninus Pius ascended the throne.</p>
<p>He told that on one of his journeys there was brought before him a weak child of a woman whose two previous children died as a result of circumcision. He looked at the child and he saw that its skin was red and he commanded that circumcision be postponed until the blood would become diffused throughout its body.</p>
<p>During these journeys he kept informed on what transpired in Palestine and he was filled with great reverence for the Palestinian Jews who sacrificed their lives for the observance of the Torah. He related that walking in the street one could see Roman soldiers leading a Jew to execution and when the man was asked what he had done to deserve the punishment he said that he had circumcised his son; another man would be executed for studying the Torah. Further one could see a man being led to crucifixion and when asked what he had done he said I have eaten Matzoth on Passover&#x201D; or one could see a man being scourged for taking up the Lulab. <sup><xref rid="fn436">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The editing of the Mishna into books and tractates was begun during the lifetime of Rabbi Nathan. His role in this labor is indefinite and there are only two references in the Talmud to the existence of a Mishna of Rabbi Nathan. <sup><xref rid="fn437">4)</xref></sup> According to another source the Mishna was completed by the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah and by Rabbi Nathan. <sup><xref rid="fn438">5)</xref></sup> Rabbi Nathan did leave a book of social, ethical and religious maxims very similar to the book of Aboth and this book is called &#x201C;Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan&#x201D;. In the opinion of some, the book Mechilta was collated by the pupils of Rabbi Nathan from the sayings of their teacher who quoted the lectures of his master Rabbi Ishmael</p>
<p>Rabbi Nathan&#x2019;s system of exposition was to trace every law to the original text and to remove all contradictions. His legal opinions are quoted in the Talmud and are always very penetrating. <sup><xref rid="fn439">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the death of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, Rabbi Nathan continued as head of the court of the Sanhedrin during the administration of Rabbi Jehudah despite the fact that he frequently conflicted with him. The Nasi Rabbi Jehudah personally declared that: &#x201C;I was once childish and brazenly opposed Rabbi Nathan of Babylonia.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn440">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Characteristic of Rabbi Nathan&#x2019;s trend of thoughts are the following social, ethical and religious maxims which he based on the text of the Torah. The verse: &#x201C;You shall not wrong or oppress a stranger for you were strangers in the land of Egypt&#x201D; (Ex. 22:20) Rabbi Nathan interpreted that &#x201C;a man should never accuse others of the fault from which he is suffering&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn441">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Menorah was constructed so that the three lights on either side were inclined toward the central light. This indicates that the one in the center is always the most important one. <sup><xref rid="fn442">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Nathan opposed vows and he said: &#x201C;For the sin of making a vow and not fulfilling it, a man is punished by the death of his wife. <sup><xref rid="fn443">10)</xref></sup> Another time he said, &#x201C;He who makes a vow is like one who builds a Bamah (an altar outside of the temple) and the sin of one who fulfills his vow is like the sin of a man who offers sacrifices on a Bamah. <sup><xref rid="fn444">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A man who accepts bribes to pass an unjust sentence will not die before one of the following three calamities will befall him: he will lose his reason, he will become dependent on human charity or the vision of his eyes will be diminished. <sup><xref rid="fn445">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another saying of Rabbi Nathan gives a clear picture of the conditions of that time: &#x201C;It is a good omen for a man to receive his punishment immediately after his death by not being buried, by not being mourned, by having his body devoured by animals or by having his body exposed to the rain. All these indicate that the man received his due punishment immediately after his death. <sup><xref rid="fn446">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have remarked before that Rabbi Nathan travelled through many countries and it was then that he observed the nature of the various nations which he characterized in the following manner:</p>
<p>1) Nine-tenths of the harlotry in the world is concentrated in Alexandria and the remaining tenth is spread over the rest of the world.</p>
<p>2) Nine-tenths of the wealth of the world is in Rome and the remaining tenth is scattered throughout the rest of the world.</p>
<p>3) Nine-tenths of the poverty in the world is concentrated in Lud and the remaining tenth is distributed in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>4) Nine-tenths of the witchcraft in the world is in Egypt and the remaining tenth in all the other countries.</p>
<p>5) Nine-tenths of the foolishness in the world is possessed by the Ishmaelites and one-tenth by all other peoples.</p>
<p>6) Nine-tenths of the filth in the world is possessed by the Persians and the remaining tenth by all other peoples.</p>
<p>7) The land of Media possesses nine-tenths of the beauty in the world and all the other countries possess but one-tenth.</p>
<p>8) Nine-tenths of the ugliness in the world is in the East (?) and one-tenth in all other countries.</p>
<p>9) The Chaldeans possess nine-tenths of the strength in the world and all the other countries possess but one-tenth.</p>
<p>10) The tribe of Judah possesses nine-tenths of the valor in the world and all the other countries possess the remaining tenth.</p>
<p>11) The Land of Israel possesses nine-tenths of the wisdom in the world and all other countries possess but one-tenth.</p>
<p>12) The Jews possess nine-tenths of the Torah (learning) in the world and all the other peoples possess but one-tenth. <sup><xref rid="fn447">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking in the same vein on another occasion he said: &#x201C;There is no greater love than the love of the Torah; there is no greater wisdom than the wisdom of the Land of Israel; there is no greater beauty than the beauty of Jerusalem; there is no greater wealth than the wealth of Rome; there is no greater valor than the valor of the Persians; there is no greater immorality than the immorality of the Arabs; there is no greater rudeness than the rudeness of the land of Elam; there is no greater flattery than the flattery of Babylonia; there is no greater witchcraft than the witchcraft of Egypt.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn448">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following statements of Rabbi Nathan concerning the creation of the world are also very interesting:</p>
<p>&#x201C;The whole world is beneath one star. One can see this by looking at a star. If a man walk to the East, the star is above him; if he walk in another direction the star is still over him. During the summer the sun is high in the sky and the whole world is hot but the water from the springs is cold; but during the winter the sun is low in the sky and the whole world is cold but the water from the springs is warm. <sup><xref rid="fn449">16)</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn432">&#x002A;) The story of this mission is described in Berachoth, 66 as well as in Jerushalmi Nedarim, 6:5 and in Sanhedrin, 1:5. The names of the messengers that are given in the Babylonian Talmud are different from those listed in the Jerusalem Talmud. The Jerusalem Talmud also omits the name of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel and only mentions &#x201C;Rabbi&#x201D; which might indicate that this event occurred during the days of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah. But such an assumption is hardly probable since the office of the Nasi in Palestine during the time of Rabbi Jehudah was secure and it was unlikely that anyone in Babylonia would have tried to compete with the Palestinian leadership at that time.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn434">&#x002A;) A &#x201C;Boraitha&#x201D; is an opinion on law which was not included in the Mishna, when it was compiled by Rabbi Jehudah, the Nasi.

<chapter>
<title>RABBI MEIR</title>
<p>T<small>HE REMNANT</small> of Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s disciples together with those scholars who were ordained by Rabbi Jehudah ben Baba were the main pillars of the Sanhedrin at Usha. Rabbi Meir was one of the most important of these.</p>
<p>Nothing is known of Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s family; even his name is not known for certain. Some authorities maintain that his real name was not Meir but Nehorai and that he was called Meir because &#x201C;he illuminated the vision of the scholars with his learning.&#x201D; Others say that his name was Miasha or that he was identical with Rabbi Elazar ben Arach. <sup><xref rid="fn450">1)</xref></sup> It is interesting to note that the names Meir and Nehorai have the same meaning. Meir is the Hebrew for &#x201C;one who gives light&#x201D; and Nehorai is its Aramaeic equivalent. It is also noteworthy that the Talmud cites a dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Nehorai. <sup><xref rid="fn451">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A legend relates that Rabbi Meir was descended from a Roman general who was sent to subdue Palestine and who was converted to Judaism. It is therefore remarkable that despite his uncertain origin Rabbi Meir became the son-in-law of Rabbi Hanina ben Tradion who gave him his brilliant daughter, Beruriah, in marriage.</p>
<p>The first years of Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s activity must have occurred after the destruction of Betar and before emperor Antoninus Pius alleviated the condition of the Jews. Since Rabbi Meir was a pupil of Elisha ben Avuyah during the time of Hadrian&#x2019;s decrees against the study of the Torah, it may be assumed that together with other scholars he fled to Babylonia for a time and returned with the accession of Antoninus Pius to the throne of Rome.</p>
<p>At first Rabbi Meir was a pupil of Rabbi Ishmael and later he studied with Rabbi Akiba. He was also a pupil of Elisha ben Avuyah and he maintained a close friendship with a Gentile philosopher Abnimos Hagardi, who was a great friend of the Jewish people and who revered the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn452">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s devotion to Elisha ben Avuyah has been described before. His friendship for Abnimos Hagardi was equally great and when the parents of his friend died he visited him and condoled with him. <sup><xref rid="fn453">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It thus becomes evident that Rabbi Meir was interested in the Gentile sciences as well as Jewish learning and he was probably acquainted with the Greek writings of his time. The three daily benedictions which Rabbi Meir instituted (for not being born a Gentile, for not being born a woman and for not being created a boor) he did not receive by tradition from previous scholars but he probably imitated the Greek philosopher Socrates who recited three similar benedictions to his idols. This supposition is further substantiated by his devotion and friendship for Elisha ben Avuyah and Abnimos Hagardi. It is impossible to think that these two did not acquaint him with Greek literature or that Greek letters should have made no impression upon him even where they did not conflict with the tenets of Jewish religion. This influence is also evident from his statement that &#x201C;just as a judge covers his face with a veil even so did the generation of the deluge believe that God covered his face with clouds.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn454">5)</xref></sup> Saying this Rabbi Meir must have had in mind the Greek goddess of justice (Themida) who is pictured with eyes covered.</p>
<p>All of Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s statements were concise and short and were interwoven with fables from which he deduced legal opinions as well as he used them to illustrate legends. <sup><xref rid="fn455">6)</xref></sup> When Rabbi Meir died it was said that the mastery of fable has departed. <sup><xref rid="fn456">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s first public appearance resulted in a conflict of opinions. A meeting was held at that time in the valley of Rimon to determine the question of the leap year because the calculations of the calendar were confused. Rabbi Jochanan the Sandal-maker opposed the calculations of Rabbi Meir and when the latter insisted on his opinion and quoted Rabbi Akiba, Rabbi Jochanan said to him, &#x201C;I have always served Rabbi Akiba as a disciple while you were only one of the audience.&#x201D; Rabbi Jochanan implied that he was better informed of the opinions of Rabbi Akiba but Rabbi Meir replied to him, &#x201C;You are only an Alexandrian&#x201D;. (The term Alexandrian suggested a person who was limited in his understanding of the words of his master.)</p>
<p>This clash, however, did not engender any hatred between the scholars for they all realized that peace was essential at that time for the observance of the commandments of the Torah. Therefore none of those gathered departed until peace was restored between the disputants. <sup><xref rid="fn457">8)</xref></sup> Only much later did a sharp conflict take place between Rabbi Meir and the Nasi, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, which ended with Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s departure from Palestine to settle in a city of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>Some of Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s statements definitely show the influence of his contact with Elisha ben Avuyah and Abnimos Hagardi. Thus when he said that &#x201C;even a Gentile who devotes himself to the Torah is like a High Priest&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn458">9)</xref></sup> he probably had in mind his friend Abnimos; and when he said that &#x201C;all Jews are God&#x2019;s children when they behave like children as well as when they misbehave&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn459">10)</xref></sup> he no doubt thought of Elisha ben Avuyah.</p>
<p>Rabbi Meir considered learning to be the most important thing in life. A man must always devote more time to learning than to worldly affairs, he said, and whoever devotes himself to learning for its own sake attains various stages of perfection and he is justified in believing that the world was created for his sake. Such a person is beloved of God and men, people are pleased with him as well as God; he is modest and pious, just and devoted, he refrains from sin and his advice is sought, for the Torah confers on one the understanding of its mysteries. <sup><xref rid="fn460">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the inhabitants of the city of Sephoris disapproved of his custom of greeting mourners on the Sabbath, because he believed that the Sabbath was not a day of mourning, Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta, Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s friend, defended him and said that he was &#x201C;a great man, a holy and a modest man&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn461">12)</xref></sup> Still greater praise of Rabbi Meir was expressed by Rabina who said that whoever saw Rabbi Meir in the academy could imagine seeing him pull up the largest mountains and crushing them one against the other for then a person could gain knowledge even from Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s cane. <sup><xref rid="fn462">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Meir was attached to Palestine by the bonds of deep love and he spoke with great enthusiasm of the Hebrew language. He greatly treasured these two national assets and declared that whoever settles in the Land of Israel and speaks the Hebrew language is certain to deserve a share in the world to come. <sup><xref rid="fn463">14)</xref></sup> He was also a master of legal argumentation and later generations admitted that in his day there was none to equal him. But his legal opinions were frequently rejected because his intent could not be fathomed. Applying pilpulistic reasoning he could prove that which everybody held to be clean as unclean and vice versa. <sup><xref rid="fn464">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>An anecdote was therefore current at that time that Rabah bar Shilo once met the prophet Elijah and asked him what God was doing. Elijah replied that God was pondering the words of all the scholars except those of Rabbi Meir, because he was a pupil of &#x201C;Acher&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn465">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is necessary to remark, however, that Rabbi Meir never tried to lighten the burden of the law in order that people may not say that he allows liberties to be taken with the law because of his knowledge of secular sciences. He was therefore strict in his interpretation as, for instance, when he ruled that a Kethuba (marriage certificate) which promises less than two hundred dinars for a virgin or less than one hundred dinars for a widow is not valid, <sup><xref rid="fn466">17)</xref></sup> or that a bill of divorce which differs even by one word from the form prescribed is invalid and any children which the woman may have by a subsequent marriage are illegitimate. <sup><xref rid="fn467">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He frequently brought up for discussion legal situations which may occur only very rarely or never at all. In doing so Rabbi Meir tried to provide complicated exercises for his pupils as, for example, in the problem which he posed before them about the possible case of a man who had two groups of daughters from two wives and one of the daughters was married but he did not know whether it was the oldest of the first group or the oldest of the second, or possibly the youngest of the older group who was older than the oldest of the younger group. <sup><xref rid="fn468">19)</xref></sup> Another time he suggested the problem of an ox belonging to a deaf person, a foolish man or a minor which gored the ox belonging to an intelligent man. <sup><xref rid="fn469">20)</xref></sup> The following was another example of this type of questions: the law forbids to slaughter an animal and its offspring on the same day; but a man who slaughtered an animal and its third generation offspring has broken no law. If however this person proceeds to slaughter the daughter of the old animal (and the mother of the young) he breaks the law twice but he is to be punished only once. <sup><xref rid="fn470">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Meir died, his colleague, Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai, asked that his disciples should no longer be admitted to the academy because of their attitude of spite; they came not to learn but to ask perplexing questions which could not be answered. <sup><xref rid="fn471">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It would be difficult to list here all of Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s legal opinions since the Mishna alone contains over 300 laws which bear his name. In addition it is traditionally accepted that all laws whose authorship is not mentioned are generally those of Rabbi Meir. We are more concerned here with his ethical maxims which reflect a great love for the Jewish people, the Torah and the Land of Israel. Of special interest are his ideas about death.</p>
<p>Death was not considered as an uncommon and cruel phenomenon during the time of Rabbi Meir. The constant wars and the bloody persecution of the Jews hardened the people to consider death with indifference. If a man lost his life for his observance of Judaism, his relatives were comforted by the belief that he had sacrificed himself for the sake of God, Rabbi Meir probably witnessed the death of Rabbi Akiba as well as the execution of many others. Later he witnessed the death of his father-in-law, Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion. Rabbi Meir therefore evolved a philosophic outlook on death and he frequently turned to the book of Job. Rabbi Jochanan relates that every time that Rabbi Meir finished reading of that book he would say: &#x201C;The end of a man is death; the end of animals is slaughter; everything in the world is doomed to die. Happy is he who is raised in the knowledge of the Torah and who strives for it thus causing satisfaction for his Creator. Such a man prospers in his good name and he leaves the world in good repute as king Solomon said: a good name is better than fragrant oil and the day of death is better than the day of birth.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn472">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The same idea lies at the root of his statement that the Biblical description of the creation of the world which ends in saying that God saw all that He created and that it was &#x201C;very good&#x201D; implies that death is &#x201C;very good&#x201D;. After the creation of the world God was satisfied with its growth and development as well as with the death of its inhabitants.<xref rid="fn473">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s attitude toward an &#x201C;Am Haaretz&#x201D; was unusual. It is told that he always rose at the sight of an old man even if the man was an &#x201C;Am Haaretz&#x201D;. When he was asked why he accords such honor to an old &#x201C;Am Haaretz&#x201D;, he replied, that if God chose such a man to grant him many years of life, he must have deserved it and he therefore also deserved that people should accord him honor. <sup><xref rid="fn474">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But despite the honor which he accorded them, Rabbi Meir felt an instinctive hatred of the &#x201C;Am Haaretz&#x201D; and he said, &#x201C;When a man marries his daughter to an &#x2018;Am Haaretz&#x2019; it is as if he bound her and placed her in front of a lion who steps on his victim with his paws before devouring him. An &#x2018;Am Haretz&#x2019; may also beat his wife and love her at the same time without shame&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn475">25)</xref></sup> Another time he expressed his hatred of an &#x201C;Am Haaretz&#x201D; in even sharper terms when he said that &#x201C;one who allows an &#x2018;Am Haaretz&#x2019; to sleep in his house and finds him awake when he enters the house, must consider the house to be unclean&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn476">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s social orientation may be gleaned from his statement that a bill of debt which includes a clause about interest is invalid and even the principal may not be collected. <sup><xref rid="fn477">27)</xref></sup> The charging of interest he considered to be on a par with robbery and the repentance of a man who had committed robbery would never be accepted. <sup><xref rid="fn478">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Meir studied with three masters (Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiba and Elisha-Acher) and of this he said: &#x201C;A man who learns the Torah from one master may be compared to a person who owns one field, part of which is sown to wheat, part to barley, another part is planted with olives and the remainder with other trees. Such a man will see no blessing in his field. But one who learned from two or more masters may be compared to a person who owns several fields, one of which is sown to wheat and another to barley, one is planted with olive trees and another field is planted with other kinds of trees. Such a man will find blessing in his fields. <sup><xref rid="fn479">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s wife was the daughter of Rabbi Hanina ben Tradion. He had two sons, both of whom suddenly died on a Saturday afternoon, and one daughter who was married to a scholar named Zivtai. He derived no income from his scholastic work and he obtained his sustenance as a copyist. By doing this work he earned three ducats a week, one of which he spent for food for his household; one he spent for clothes and the third one he distributed to the needy scholars. When he was asked what he was doing to assure the future of his children, Rabbi Meir replied: &#x201C;If my children will be just men, God will provide them with their needs according to the verse that there was never a just man seen whose children should be forced to beg for bread. But if they will not be just men, why should I leave money for the enemies of God?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn481">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the matter of the observance of Judaism Rabbi Meir would tolerate no compromises; if he suspected a man of breaking even the slightest commandment, that man was already suspected in his eyes of breaking all the commandments of the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn482">31)</xref></sup> This attitude was parallel to the accepted rule that a false witness who gave untrue testimony was capable of committing every sin mentioned in the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn483">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Every man should teach his son a clean and easy trade but at the same time he must pray to God for a livelihood for there is no trade but that some who are engaged in it are rich while others are poor. Poverty and wealth are not the result of following a certain trade but every man obtains that which he merits. <sup><xref rid="fn484">33)</xref></sup> A man may gain his livelihood by doing any kind of work but happy is the man who sees his parents doing noble work and woe to him who sees his parents engaged in low work. <sup><xref rid="fn485">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concerning prayer Rabbi Meir said that one must not speak too much when praying to God <sup><xref rid="fn486">35)</xref></sup> and that it is necessary to praise God for the evil as well as for the good. <sup><xref rid="fn487">36)</xref></sup> Above all is the significance of repentance which may cause God to forgive the sins of the whole world because of the repentance of an individual. <sup><xref rid="fn488">37)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In interpreting the text of the Bible Rabbi Meir often used fables. He thus pointed out that the prophet Obadia was an Idumean proselyte and that his prophecy foretold the downfall of Idumea. This he compared to an ax which tries to chop down a forest but cannot do so until it first obtains a handle from the trees of the forest. <sup><xref rid="fn489">38)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The tree of knowledge of which Adam ate, Rabbi Meir declared to be a wheat plant (&#x0021;) and a foolish man may be said never to have eaten bread made of wheat. <sup><xref rid="fn490">39)</xref></sup> When one comes to a strange city he should follow the customs of that city. When Moses ascended to Heaven he neither ate nor drank but when the angels descended to earth they consumed food. <sup><xref rid="fn491">40)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s opinions regarding relations between man and wife illustrate that it was very difficult at that time to preserve the women from the Roman soldiers, who evidently considered them as their possession. Rabbi Meir said: &#x201C;Just as there are different tastes regarding food even so there exist different attitudes to women. One man will throw out the fly which falls into his beaker but will drink no more of it while another man will cast out the fly from his beaker and will continue to drink from it. <sup><xref rid="fn492">41)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whenever Rabbi Meir saw a man leaving on a journey he would say: &#x201C;Go in peace, you who are doomed to death&#x201D;. Due to the insecurity of the highways at that time it could be assumed that any man going on a trip was sure not to return alive; and when he saw two people going on a journey he would say: &#x201C;Go in peace, men of discord&#x201D;, for he was certain that when two people travel together they are bound to quarrel. But when Rabbi Meir saw three people going on a journey he would say, &#x201C;Go in peace, oh children of peace,&#x201D; because he felt certain that if two of them were to quarrel, the third one would reconcile them. <sup><xref rid="fn493">42)</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the death of Rabbi Meir, his contemporaries claimed that a definite type of person had died out. Rabbi Tarphon was said to have been the tallest man of his generation and Rabbi Meir only reached up to his shoulder. After Rabbi Tarphon died, Rabbi Meir remained the tallest man of his generation and the Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah, only reached to his shoulder. <sup><xref rid="fn494">43)</xref></sup></p>
<p>All of Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s days were one long series of uncommon afflictions and suffering. Together with the other Jews of his time he had to bear the burden of persecutions which he probably felt more keenly than the others. This may be gathered from his story that when he was attending the academy of Rabbi Akiba, everybody recited the Shema in such low tones that they could not hear their own murmuring for fear that the military guard who was stationed at the door to watch all their movements may hear them pray. It would seem that the study of the Torah was not entirely forbidden at that time but that the reciting of the Shema was prohibited. <sup><xref rid="fn495">44)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But incomparison with the suffering that followed, the early difficulties seemed no more than child&#x2019;s play. Rabbi Meir had to witness the terrible death of Rabbi Akiba when his flesh was torn with iron combs; later he saw his father-in-law, Rabbi Chanina ben Teradion, burned at the stake, his mother-in-law executed and his sister-in-law sent away to a house of ill repute for the gratification of the Roman officials.</p>
<p>Rabbi Meir was known for his modesty toward women and he frequently scorned those who succumbed to their passions. He said that human intelligence should be able to control all passions; nevertheless he once had an experience of which he was later very much ashamed. Walking along the bank of a river, the Evil one appeared before him in the guise of a beautiful woman on the other shore of the stream who tempted him so luringly that he lost all control of himself and decided to cross to the other side of the river. But no boat was available and there was only a board floating in the middle of the stream. Picking up a rope which he found on the shore, he tried to reach the board and when his attempt was unsuccessful he waded in the water trying to reach the board. But the woman on the other side of the stream meanwhile vanished and he returned to the shore shamefaced at having succumbed to the vision. <sup><xref rid="fn496">45)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beruriah, the wife of Rabbi Meir and the daughter of Rabbi Chanina ben Teradion, was the only woman ever mentioned in the Talmud for her scholarship and learned men respectfully listened to her opinions on legal as well as secular matters. <sup><xref rid="fn497">46)</xref></sup> When Rabbi Jose of Galilee once asked her opinion in some matter she made fun of him for speaking lengthily and thus breaking the commandment of the scholars not to speak too much with a woman. She is also said to have complained against a pupil of her father who studied very quietly and she said that only when one studies aloud can he understand his learning. <sup><xref rid="fn498">47)</xref></sup> She was the spiritual support of Rabbi Meir and comforted him in time of need. It is thus related that Rabbi Meir once lived in the neighborhood of a group of rude people who plagued him greatly and he cursed them. His wife chided him for cursing them and said that one should never condemn sinful people but rather condemn their sins. Rabbi Meir began to pray to God to reform these people and his prayer was granted. <sup><xref rid="fn499">48)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like her husband Beruriah also felt confident of her will power and scorned those who said that women were light minded. Rabbi Meir warned her against this attitude saying that some day she may prove this rule but she insisted that no woman who held fast to her opinions need be led astray. Rabbi Meir then persuaded one of his pupils to attempt to seduce her; he was certain that his pupil would not go further than the attempt and he could then prove to his wife the truth of the opinion of the scholars regarding women when they said that even an educated woman could be led astray. But Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s disciple betrayed him and when Beruriah found out that the affair had been planned beforehand she hanged herself out of chagrin.</p>
<p>We have previously mentioned that Beruriah&#x2019;s sister was condemned to be sent to a house of ill repute that was located in Antioch where lived the officials of the Roman administration of Palestine. Beruriah begged Rabbi Meir to try to save her sister and he went to Antioch, dressed as a Roman noble in order to deceive the guard of the house as well as his sister-in-law as to his identity. Legend recounts many wonders which occurred during this attempt. When he was convinced that Beruriah&#x2019;s sister preserved her purity he took a measure of gold and offered it to the guard to release her. He told the guard to keep half of the gold and to use the other half to bribe the officials if he was to be caught. The guard feared that money would be of no avail if he was caught and Rabbi Meir advised him to pronounce the words: &#x201C;God of Meir, save me&#x0021;&#x201D; and he would certainly be saved.</p>
<p>The guard still refused to believe that these words would help him when in danger and Rabbi Meir proved this to him. About that house there were savage, man eating, dogs and Rabbi Meir began to tease them. The dogs pounced upon him ready to devour him and he exclaimed, &#x201C;God of Meir, answer me&#x0021;&#x201D; and the dogs immediately left him in peace. Seeing this the guard was convinced that he could safely accept the bribe.</p>
<p>When the guard was finally caught and sentenced to be crucified he pronounced these words and was saved. The executioners marvelled at this and asked him what incantation he knew that could save him from the cross and he told them everything that he knew. They then began to search for Rabbi Meir and they engraved his image on the gates of Rome (more probably Antioch) and issued a commandment that whoever will recognize the man who resembled the likeness of the image should seize him and bring him before the imperial authorities. One day Rabbi Meir was recognized and an attempt was made to seize him.</p>
<p>There exist numerous versions concerning the manner in which he escaped his pursuers. One version states that he fled into a house of ill repute and his pursuers were convinced that they were mistaken and that it could not have been Rabbi Meir for he would not enter such a house. Another version relates that in his flight he came upon a pot of unclean food; he then placed his finger in it and ate some of it. Obviously he did not put into his mouth the finger which he inserted into the unclean food, but from a distance, his pursuers could not distinguish what he did and they felt certain that it was not Rabbi Meir that they were following. Another version relates that the prophet Elijah appeared in the guise of a harlot and embraced Rabbi Meir and thus deceived his pursuers as to his identity. <sup><xref rid="fn500">49)</xref></sup></p>
<p>On one of his journeys Rabbi Meir spent a night in a hostelry and he saw that the proprietor woke the guests at night and told them to proceed on their way. The proprietor then escorted each of the guests part of the way. Rabbi Meir understood that the proprietor was in league with a band of robbers and when his turn came he said that he could not go because he was waiting for his brother to accompany him. The proprietor of the hostelry asked Rabbi Meir what the name of his brother was and where he lodged and Rabbi Meir answered him that his name was <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9; &#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05F4;</span>&#x201E; and that he lodged in the synagogue. The man then stood all night in front of the synagogue calling: &#x201C;It is good, come out; your brother is waiting for you,&#x201D; but no one came out and he received no answer.</p>
<p>In the morning Rabbi Meir was ready to leave and the inn keeper said to him: &#x201C;Where is your brother? Why don&#x2019;t you wait for him?&#x201D; Rabbi Meir replied: &#x201C;The light of day is my brother for so the Bible says that the light of day is good, and this verse was in a book of the Bible in the synagogue all night.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn501">50)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beruriah, Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s wife, exerted a great influence over him and it is therefore interesting to relate how she informed him of the sudden death of their two sons. It happened on a Sabbath before sunset when Rabbi Meir was in the academy engaged in his studies that his sons suddenly died. Legend does not mention the cause of their death. Beruriah placed the bodies of her sons on the bed and covered them with a sheet without saying a word to anyone. When Rabbi Meir returned to his house he immediately asked where his sons were and she replied that they were probably in the academy. He was surprised and said: &#x201C;I have looked everywhere in the academy but I did not see them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Somewhat later he asked for his sons again and she replied that they probably tarried in conversation on the way home and would soon return. Then Beruriah turned to Rabbi Meir with the following question: &#x201C;I was once given a valuable treasure to guard until it would be called for. Today the man came to claim his treasure; should I return it?&#x201D; Rabbi Meir at once replied: &#x201C;Of course you must return that which was given to you to guard. I do not understand why you have to ask me such a question.&#x201D; Beruriah then took Rabbi Meir by the hand and led him to the bed where their dead sons lay and she said: &#x201C;This is the treasure which God gave me to guard and today he claimed it.&#x201D; Rabbi Meir began to weep bitterly but she said to him, &#x201C;Did you not say that it was necessary to return a treasure which was given to one to guard?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn502">51)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wonderful stories are told of Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s modesty. One of these is very similar to the one told about Baba ben Zuta of how a woman threw a candlestick at him at the command of her husband.</p>
<p>The story concerning Rabbi Meir relates that there was a woman who loved to hear his lectures and on a certain Sabbath she tarried long in the academy listening to him. When she returned home late, her husband expelled her from the house and threatened to divorce her if she would not spit in Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s face. When Rabbi Meir heard of this he summoned the woman and said to her: &#x201C;I have an ailing eye and the doctor said that if a woman were to spit in it seven times it would be healed.&#x201D; At first the woman refused to do as Rabbi Meir asked her but when he insisted, she was persuaded and did as she was asked. Rabbi Meir then said to her: &#x201C;Go and tell your husband that not once but seven times you spit in Rabbi Meir&#x2019;s eye. <sup><xref rid="fn503">52)</xref></sup></p>

But this version is obviously erroneous although none of the commentators ever called attention to it.

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai</title>
<p>W<small>HEN THE</small> scholars gathered in Usha, they honored the outstanding man of that city, Rabbi Jehuda bar Elai. At that gathering he spoke of the various customs and commandments which were nearly forgotten during the days of Hadrian and he gained the appelation &#x201C;The first speaker on every occasion&#x201D;. This name was associated with Rabbi Jehudah all the days of his life. Various sources indicate that he was the only scholar of that time whose opinions concerning Halacha, Hagada and the contemporary problems of life were listened to with respect. Nearly three thousand statements of Rabbi Jehudah are quoted in the Mishna, Boraitha, Tosephta, Safra, Sifri and Mechilta. All statements, credited to Rabbi Jehudah without any further designation, are the statements of Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai.</p>
<p>The statements of Rabbi Jehudah concerning accepted laws quoted the opinions of his teachers, or traditional interpretations which they received from their predecessors, as it was customary at that time to quote opinions of authorities dating back before the destruction of the Temple.</p>
<p>Rabbi Elai, the father of Rabbi Jehudah, was a Tana of the Mishna and a contemporary of Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh. <sup><xref rid="fn504">1)</xref></sup> He was a disciple of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus <sup><xref rid="fn505">2)</xref></sup> and of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. <sup><xref rid="fn506">3)</xref></sup> Rabbi Elai was the first teacher of his son Jehudah; later he sent him to the academy in Jabneh to receive instruction from the same men that he had studied with in his youth. Rabbi Jehudah studied with Rabbi Akiba and even more with Rabbi Tarphon. He thus accumulated a large volume of information which he later quoted in the name of his masters.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah was an opponent of Rabbi Meir. This opposition was so strong that after the death of Rabbi Meir Rabbi Jehudah asked that the disciples of the former should not be admitted to the academy because &#x201C;they are spiteful and they come not to learn but to ask questions which cannot be answered&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn507">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following was a favorite maxim of Rabbi Jehudah: &#x201C;Be cautious in learning for error may lead to sin.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn508">5)</xref></sup> This maxim he further elaborated and said: &#x201C;The errors of a scholar are considered as intentional sin while the intentional sin of an Am Haaretz is considered as an unconscious transgression.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn509">6)</xref></sup> He also said: &#x201C;He who makes the Torah the outstanding purpose of his life and relegates his worldly occupations to a secondary position will come to be considered by the world as of importance; but a man who makes his worldly occupations the central motive of his life and relegates the Torah to a secondary place will himself come to be considered as of no importance. It is like choosing between two highways, one of which is made of fire while the other is covered with snow. If one goes on the fiery road he may be burned and if he goes on the snowy road he may be frozen. It is therefore necessary to follow a middle course and to beware of the heat of the fire and of the frost of the snow.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn510">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah highly valued the worth of labor and he said that it honors those that engage in it. <sup><xref rid="fn511">8)</xref></sup> Among the duties of a father toward his son he also included that of teaching him a trade and he added that &#x201C;one who does not teach his son a trade may be compared to a person who teaches his son to be a robber.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn512">9)</xref></sup> But despite his attitude toward labor he still ascribed the highest importance to learning and he said: &#x201C;Previous generations definitely established the time to be devoted to learning but the time to be devoted to their occupations and their personal interests was left undetermined. They therefore found time for both. But later generations determined the time for their labors and did not definitely establish the time to be devoted to learning. They therefore found time for neither.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn513">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the question was discussed whether it was more important to study the commandments or to practice them Rabbi Jehudah said that the fulfillment of the commandments was of greater significance than learning and when he saw that a dead person had to be buried or a bride had to be led to the canopy, he commanded his disciples to interrupt their studies and to attend the funeral or the wedding. <sup><xref rid="fn514">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah learned most from Rabbi Tarphon and he frequently related things which he had learned from him. Thus he told of the occasion when, as a small boy, he read the Megillah in the presence of Rabbi Tarphon and of other scholars <sup><xref rid="fn515">12)</xref></sup> or the various customs which Rabbi Tarphon saw him performing during the lighting of the candles or in the matter of removing objects out of a house through a window on the Sabbath. <sup><xref rid="fn516">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have mentioned before that Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai was &#x201C;the first to speak&#x201D; in Usha because he was a native of that city. This position he maintained also after the Sanhedrin returned to Jabneh for a short time as a result of Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s friendly attitude toward Rome.</p>
<p>The manner in which his attitude became known to the Romans is related in the following story. Rabbi Jehudah, Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta and Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai once sat in the academy together with Rabbi Jehudah ben Gerim. A discussion developed regarding the achievements of the Romans in Palestine and Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai praised the Romans for paving highways and building baths and bridges. Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta heard these praises and remained silent. He did not agree with Rabbi Jehudah but he was afraid to contradict him. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai then could not control himself and he said: &#x201C;What is there to praise? Whatever the Romans did, they did for their own benefit. They paved streets in order to settle their harlots there; they built bath houses in order to anoint themselves; they built bridges in order to collect tolls.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Unintentionally perhaps, Rabbi Jehudah ben Gerim repeated these words in the presence of others and the Roman authorities finally heard of the discussion and were greatly displeased with it. They commanded that Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai, who praised the Roman achievements should be honored. Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta, who remained silent and did not express his agreement with Rabbi Jehudah, they interned in his native city of Sephoris and he was forbidden to leave it. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai, who denounced the Romans, was condemned to death. <sup><xref rid="fn517">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The elevation of Rabbi Jehudah consisted in that be continued as the head speaker and he later became a tutor in the house of the Nasi. It must be borne in mind that although the decrees against the Jews were abrogated, the Roman government still looked unfavorably on the Dynasty of the Nasi which was derived from the royal house of David and government circles understood that the Jews did not consider themselves as subjects of Rome but looked up to the Nasi as to their God anointed ruler. But the Romans had great confidence in Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai and they overlooked the royal honors which the Jews accorded to the Nasi. The Roman attitude was one of toleration and they allowed the Jews to &#x201C;play&#x201D; with a Nasi as long as they paid their taxes regularly.</p>
<p>Despite Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s prominence among the Jews and his favorable position among the Romans he suffered great poverty. His wife was always dressed in old woolen garments and they had only one heavy coat. When Rabbi Jehudah had to go into the street he put it on and when his wife had to go to market she wore it. Poverty was very common at that time and it was told that six people had to share the same blanket. <sup><xref rid="fn518">15)</xref></sup> Many people wanted to aid Rabbi Jehudah but he refused all assistance and once, when the Nasi declared a fast day and Rabbi Jehudah failed to appear at the prayers following the fast because he had no garment to wear, the Nasi sent him some garments, but even these he refused.</p>
<p>But Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s face never betrayed his poverty. It is related that he once sat before Rabbi Tarphon and the latter said to him: &#x201C;You appear to be merry today.&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah replied: &#x201C;Your slaves went into the field today and they brought me some greens which I ate without salt. This is the reason why I am merry. You may also imagine how much better I would feel if I had some salt to eat with the greens.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Another time a Roman matron said to him: &#x201C;You are a scholar but you look like a person who is drunk.&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah replied, &#x201C;I swear by my faith that I drink no wine except for Kidush and Havdalah; when I drink the prescribed four glasses of wine on the Passover I suffer from headaches until Shavuoth.&#x201D; A Sadducee who met Rabbi Jehudah said to him, &#x201C;You look like a usurer or like a swineherd.&#x201D; But Rabbi Jehudah answered, &#x201C;I am a Jew and therefore I can be neither.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn519">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From that which has been related so far we may conclude that Rabbi Jehudah was a man of modesty and of extreme piety. <sup><xref rid="fn520">17)</xref></sup> He said, &#x201C;Better eat an onion and sit in the shade and refrain from eating geese and hens and your heart will not palpitate. It is better still to eat less and to drink less in order to live better.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn521">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s attitude toward the political situation of the Jews is expressed in his statement regarding the Biblical verse which sometimes compares the Jews to the dust and other time to the stars. When the Jews fall, he said, they fall as low as the dust but when they are elevated, they are raised to the stars. <sup><xref rid="fn522">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like some other Tanaim Rabbi Jehudah was ready to overlook his own dignity when peace between husband and wife was at stake. Thus it happened that a man once vowed not to taste of his wife&#x2019;s cooking until Rabbi Jehudah would first partake of it. <sup><xref rid="fn523">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following expressions of Rabbi Jehudah are also characteristic of his trend of thoughts:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do you want to know what man is worthy to speak to God for his congregation when a fast has been declared to avert a calamity? Such a man must have many children and must not have enough food for them; he must be a hard worker and his house must be empty, in addition he must have a fine voice and a good diction. He must be modest and beloved of the people. He must know the Scriptures, the Mishna, Halacha and Hagada as well as all the benediction.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn524">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;When a man is sick with croup it generally begins with the intestines and it ends with his mouth. Even so is the development of sin: the kidneys mislead, the heart understands, the tongue speaks and the mouth ends it all.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn525">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Charity is a great virtue and it brings redemption nearer. God created ten kinds of strength each of which is stronger than the preceding one and acts as a cure for it. A mountain is strong but iron cuts it; iron is strong but fire melts it; fire is strong but water puts it out; water is strong but the clouds carry it away; clouds are strong but the wind disperses them; wind is strong but the human body withstands it; the human body is strong but fear breaks it; fear is strong but wine dispels it; wine is strong but sleep does away with its effects. The strongest of all is death but charity saves one from death.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn526">23)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>OSE BEN</small> C<small>HALAFTA</small> was one of the outstanding disciples that survived Rabbi Akiba. Together with a group of others he was ordained by Rabbi Jehudah ben Baba in the mountains between Usha and Shefarom, when the Roman government forbade ordination. Rabbi Jehudah ben Baba paid with his life for this act.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jose was said to have been descended from an aristocratic line. When a list of genealogies was found in Jerusalem, Rabbi Jose traced his descent from Jehonadab ben Recheb <sup><xref rid="fn527">1)</xref></sup> who aided Jehu, the king of Israel, to destroy the house of Ahab and to eradicate idolatry from among the ten tribes. It may be assumed that Rabbi Jose&#x2019;s grandfather came to Palestine from Babylonia and his racial purity was therefore unquestioned. Rabbi Jose was very proud of this and he said: &#x201C;All lands are as sour dough when compared to the Land of Israel, but the Land of Israel is as sour dough when compared to Babylonia&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn528">2)</xref></sup> In saying this Rabbi Jose implied that the purity of the race was better preserved in Babylonia than in Palestine, where the immorality of the Romans influenced the general behavior.</p>
<p>Rabbi Chalafta, Jose&#x2019;s father, was one of the most prominent people in the period preceding the decrees of Hadrian. It seems probable that he was head of the court in Sephoris which was located eighteen miles from Tiberias. <sup><xref rid="fn529">3)</xref></sup> Rabbi Jose told that his father saw Rabban Gamliel the Elder before the destruction of the Temple. His father was also Rabbi Jose&#x2019;s first teacher and he frequently quoted laws in his name. <sup><xref rid="fn530">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once the question arose whether it was permissible to use a Greek translation of the Scriptures and Rabbi Jose related that his father once came to the house of Rabban Gamliel II and he found him perusing a Greek translation of the book of Job; he then said to him, &#x201C;I remember seeing your grandfather, Rabban Gamliel the Old, standing on the stairs of the temple and he was given a Greek version of the book of Job. He then commanded the master of the builders to put the book into the walls of the temple. <sup><xref rid="fn531">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jose followed the method of Rabbi Akiba in his legal opinions, <sup><xref rid="fn532">6)</xref></sup> because he was a disciple of Rabbi Akiba but at various times he also was a pupil of Rabban Gamliel II, Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah, Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, Rabbi Tarphon and Rabbi Jochanan ben Nuri. For a time he also studied with Abtolemos who was a Tana of the period of the creation of the Mishna and whose name is mentioned only three times. <sup><xref rid="fn533">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Together with the other scholars who survived the persecutions of Hadrian, Rabbi Jose witnessed the afflictions which were visited upon the Jews of Palestine after the execution of many of the outstanding leaders of the people. He witnessed the destruction of his native city Sephoris. After the city was restored he told that the destroyed city contained 180 thousand markets (&#x0021;) where cooking utensils were sold exclusively. <sup><xref rid="fn534">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the death of Rabbi Akiba all the academies were closed until the death of Hadrian brought a respite from the decrees. It was at this time that the famous discussion concerning the achievements of the Romans took place, and Rabbi Jose, who was present at the discussion, remained silent or expressed his disapproval with a gesture and was interned in his native city of Sephoris. During the time of his stay the city was rebuilt and he became its representative. It also appears that at a later date the decree against Rabbi Jose was annulled and he was again free to participate in the deliberations of the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p>Both the Nasi Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the second as well as his son Jehudah established all laws according to the decision of Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta. This was especially true when other scholars disputed Rabbi Jose&#x2019;s contentions. When the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah was asked why the law is always enacted according to the opinion of Rabbi Jose he replied: &#x201C;Just as the distance between the most holy and the ordinary is great even so is there a great difference between our generation and the generation of Rabbi Jose.&#x201D; Rabbi Ishmael, the son of Rabbi Jose, expressed himself in a similar vein when he declared: &#x201C;The difference between our generation and the generation of my father is as great as the difference between dust and gold.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn535">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The arguments of Rabbi Jose are referred to as &#x201C;Nimukim&#x201D;, deeply considered convictions. <sup><xref rid="fn536">10)</xref></sup> His method was to eliminate all disputes and to explain all contradictions. <sup><xref rid="fn537">11)</xref></sup> The opinion prevailed that Rabbi Jose was an unusually pious and guarded man. It was therefore unbelievable when the rumor was circulated that he once secretly performed ablutions on the Day of Atonement. <sup><xref rid="fn538">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Talmud relates that the prophet Elijah frequently appeared to Rabbi Jose and spoke to him as man to man. <sup><xref rid="fn539">13)</xref></sup> Rabbi Jose nevertheless allowed himself to make a statement which contradicted the basic tenets of the faith. He said that &#x201C;the <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D4;</span> (the majesty of God) never descended to earth and Moses and the prophet Elijah never ascended heaven&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn540">14)</xref></sup> The Talmud attempted to explain the words of Rabbi Jose which were in direct contradiction to the text concerning the granting of the Torah and the ascension of Elijah. It was then said that the &#x201C;Shechinah&#x201D; never descended lower than ten &#x201C;handsbreadths&#x201D; <span dir="rtl">&#x05D8;&#x05E4;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> above ground and that Moses and Elijah never ascended higher than ten &#x201C;handbreadths&#x201D; above the ground. In contradiction to the accepted belief that God judges the world four times a year Rabbi Jose maintained that He judges humanity every day. <sup><xref rid="fn541">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jose&#x2019;s modesty was a subject of admiration long after he died and everyone was convinced that considering his reverence for the authorities that preceded him it could be assumed that despite his age and his superior scholarship he would have respected the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah as his master had he lived. <sup><xref rid="fn542">16)</xref></sup> This conviction was reenforced by the fact that Rabbi Jose always spoke with the greatest respect of his colleagues. <sup><xref rid="fn543">17)</xref></sup> Of himself Rabbi Jose said that he never rescinded his word nor did he ever do otherwise than the scholars commanded. <sup><xref rid="fn544">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jose gained his livelihood by tanning animal skins. According to the concepts of that time, this occupation was considered as a low type of work. <sup><xref rid="fn545">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>From numerous statements in the Talmud we may conclude that Rabbi Jose was versed in the natural sciences. He described numerous strange animals which the laws mentioned and which the scholars were at a loss to identify. He was also an accomplished historian and he composed a chronology of Jewish history from the time of the creation to his own day under the name of &#x201C;Seder Haolam&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jose frequently related the customs of previous generations and he based his own opinions on those customs. He thus elucidated customs concerning the scapegoat, <sup><xref rid="fn546">20)</xref></sup> the sanctification of the new month, <sup><xref rid="fn547">21)</xref></sup> the regulations pertaining to women who bring offerings to the temple, <sup><xref rid="fn548">22)</xref></sup> and numerous others.</p>
<p>The miracles accompanying the creation of the world Rabbi Jose described in an unusually poetic manner. People, he said, look but they know not what they see; they stand and they know not what they stand on. Consider the earth for instance. What is the earth supported by? The earth is supported by pillars; the pillars of the earth are based on water; the water rests on mountains; the mountains hang in the air; the air rests on storm and the storm is held in the arms of God. <sup><xref rid="fn549">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>His concepts of justice are exemplified by his statement that a witness who has been proved false in money matters may testify in cases affecting life. <sup><xref rid="fn550">24)</xref></sup> He maintained that a court may admit the testimony of such a witness on the ground that if a man states a falsehood once it is not proof that he will testify falsely every time.</p>
<p>Another time he said: &#x201C;See how blind usurers are. If a man should call another person a wicked man he would be ready to kill him, but usurers bring witnesses and a scribe and they sign their own names to a statement that they deny the Jewish God who commanded not to loan money for interest. <sup><xref rid="fn551">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jose often disputed with infidels and among them was one matron who asked innumerable questions. Once she asked him what God was doing all the time and he replied that God was busy making ladders on which he raised some people and lowered others; to some He gives money and from others He takes it away to give it to others. The matron was dissatisfied with this answer and Rabbi Jose said that at the time God was busy arranging marriages.</p>
<p>Hearing this the matron exclaimed: &#x201C;Is this all that your God does? I can do the same. I have a host of men and women slaves and in one hour I can marry them all to each other.&#x201D; Rabbi Jose replied, &#x201C;That which seems easy in your eyes is as difficult for God as the rending of the sea.&#x201D; The matron then chose one thousand men slaves and one thousand women slaves and arranged them in two lines and declared, &#x201C;This slave will marry this woman servant and this woman servant will marry that slave.&#x201D; In this manner she mates them all in a short time.</p>
<p>The following day they all came to her with various complaints. One had a broken head and another had a black eye or a broken leg. When the matron asked them what had happened they voiced their protests that she had chosen for them the wrong mates. The matron then realized that marriage between two human beings was not as simple as she thought it to be. <sup><xref rid="fn552">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jose had five sons: R. Ishmael, R. Elazar, R. Chalafta, R. Abtilas and R. Menahem. All of them figured among the scholars of their time and Rabbi Jose proudly said that he had planted five cedar trees among the Jews. <sup><xref rid="fn553">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that Rabbi Jose was opposed to afflicting the human body and he declared that an individual may not establish fast days for himself for if such a person will need the aid of others they will refuse it and say that he is used to fasting. <sup><xref rid="fn554">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta died it was said that &#x201C;the pipes of Lodakia flowed with blood&#x201D;. The reason that was given for this phenomenon was Rabbi Jose&#x2019;s readiness to die for the fulfillment of the commandment of circumcision <sup><xref rid="fn555">29)</xref></sup> Another text declares that &#x201C;the pipes of Sephoris flowed with blood&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn556">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Jose died it was said that understanding ceased from among the Jews. <sup><xref rid="fn557">31)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> S<small>IMEON BEN</small> Y<small>OCHAI</small> was gifted with numerous virtues which made him a favorite among the people of his district. He also possessed much knowledge and he followed a strictly logical method of reasoning. His activity as a leader dated from the time that he returned from exile when, together with a group of others he escaped the wrath of Hadrian&#x2019;s decrees after the death of Rabbi Akiba and after he was ordained by Rabbi Jehudah ben Baba. The position of his father Yochai was not very clear and from some statements it would seem that he was an official of the Roman administration and that it was his duty to report all those who did not act in accordance with the Roman laws. This seems to be implied by the story that when Rabbi Akiba was in prison Simeon came to him and asked him to teach him. Rabbi Akiba then said, &#x201C;I will not teach you&#x201D;, and Rabbi Simeon said to him: &#x201C;If you will not teach me I will tell my father and he will report you to the government.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn558">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is therefore remarkable that although Yochai was an adherent or an official of the Roman government, his son Rabbi Simeon was an enemy of Rome. The authorities were probably aware of his attitude and sought for an opportunity to capture him. When the scholars returned during the reign of Antoninus Pius and resumed their scholarly labors, Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai gained the disfavor of the authorities because of his criticism of the Roman government and he was condemned to death.</p>
<p>Numerous miracles are related concerning the escape of Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai. One of these stories states that he escaped together with his son Elazar and that they hid in the academy for a long time and food was secretly brought to them from their home. But when the authorities intensified their search for Rabbi Simeon he feared his wife might not be able to withstand the stringent questioning and might reveal the hiding place of her husband and son. Father and son decided to hide in a cave and there they were fed in a miraculous manner. A number of carob trees began to grow about the cave and a spring of water appeared.</p>
<p>In that cave&#x2014;it is further related&#x2014;they sat naked and buried to the neck in sand and continued their studies. Only when prayer time arrived did they emerge from the sand and donned their garments for the prayer. With praying finished they again disrobed, in order not to wear out their garments, and continued sitting buried in sand.</p>
<p>Thus they sat for thirteen years until one day Elijah appeared and said, &#x201C;Who will announce to Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai that the emperor died?&#x201D; Rabbi Simeon and his son then left the cave and when Pinchas ben Yair, Rabbi Simeon&#x2019;s son-in-law, heard that they had emerged from the cave he went to meet them and took them to his house.</p>
<p>As he was leaving the cave Rabbi Simeon met Rabbi Jehudah ben Gerim, who thirteen years earlier repeated Rabbi Simeon&#x2019;s remarks which led to his being sentenced to death, and he exclaimed: &#x201C;This person is still alive?&#x201D; As he said this he stared at Rabbi Jehudah with his burning eyes and the latter fell down dead.</p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon then began to cure the body of his son and Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair attended to Rabbi Simeon. The body of Rabbi Simeon was creased and swollen from the many years of sitting in the sand and from the diet of &#x201C;Johns bread&#x201D; and water. When Rabbi Pinchas saw this, he began to weep and the tears which fell on Rabbi Simeon&#x2019;s body caused him great suffering because of their salty tang.</p>
<p>This happened in the city of Tiberias where Rabbi Pinchas then lived. Rabbi Simeon bathed in the warm springs of that city and his body healed rapidly. Out of gratitude he wanted to confer some favor on the city and he said: &#x201C;Since a miracle occurred to me in the city of Tiberias I would gladly do something for this city.&#x201D; His son then said to him: &#x201C;For the many favors which this city extended to us we should declare it to be permissible for Jewish residence.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to tradition Tiberias was situated on the site of an old cemetery and many priests as well as other pious Jews refused to reside there in order not to be contaminated by the impurity of the dead. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai declared the city to be clean and fit for residence. <sup><xref rid="fn559">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>One must bear in mind that Tiberias was founded by Herod Antipas, a grandson of Herod the Great, on the site of the ancient city Hamath. When the ancient city was deserted the ground was used as a cemetery. Priests and pious Pharisees therefore refused to settle in the city despite the fact that Herod Antipas freed its inhabitants from all taxes. Only such people as were forced to reside in the city because of their occupations settled there and even these considered their residence in Tiberias as a sin because of the contamination of its soil. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai therefore favored the city when he decreed it to be clean and fit for the residence of even the most pious.</p>
<p>Palestine was meanwhile again agitated by political unrest. Despite the relatively favorable attitude of Antoninus Pius toward the Jews, they were influenced by the Parthians, who ruled in Babylonia and were independent of Rome, and again revolted against Roman rule. The Parthians were anxious to free themselves from the threat of Roman invasion and attempted a struggle with Rome in which the Jews aided them (or, as others maintain, the Jews began the struggle and were aided by the Parthians).</p>
<p>The Jews felt confident of achieving liberation with the aid of the Parthians. The Roman empire was then occupied with wars on many fronts due to the simultaneous revolts of the Germans and the Dacians. It was therefore said that &#x201C;whenever one sees the horse of a Parthian tied to a tombstone in Palestine he may expect the early coming of the Messiah.&#x201D; Another statement of the scholars declared that &#x201C;they who have destroyed the temple will in the end fall into the hands of the Parthians.&#x201D; <xref rid="fn560">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>This rebellion lasted for four years until the Romans triumphed again under the leadership of Atidius Cornelianus. It may be surmised that the Jews again had to withstand persecution and oppression. The first decree abrogated the right of the Jews to be tried before a Jewish court in civil disputes. This decree was not considered as a great calamity and Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai even declared his satisfaction with it because &#x201C;Jews no longer have the wise men required to decide in such matters.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn561">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Roman imperial throne was also in an uncertain state at that time. At first Hadrian appointed Antoninus Pius as his successor. Later he made the acquaintance of Marcus Aurelius, who was a military leader, and he liked him also. Hadrian then commanded Antoninus Pius to appoint Marcus Aurelius as his successor. Since that day Marcus Aurelius assumed the name Antoninus and after the death of Antonius Pius the Roman senate decided that a son of his, named Lucius Varus, should share the throne with Marcus Aurelius. It thus occurred that two emperors reigned simultaneously.</p>
<p>During this war against Rome the Parthians advanced into the Roman provinces to the north west of their possessions until they arrived in Syria. Under the leadership of their king Valagesias they captured the Roman governor Atidius Cornelianus and put him to death. Afterward they occupied one Syrian city after another and for a moment it seemed that the Romans would be expelled from Palestine forever. But these victories were not lasting and when emperor Varus arrived with reenforcements of Roman legions the Parthians were driven out from all the positions which they had occupied.</p>
<p>It would seem that the scholars remained neutral in this war. No mention is made either of their participation or of their opposition to it. But since emperor Varus reenacted some of Hadrian&#x2019;s decrees forbidding the observance of the Sabbath and the practice of circumcision it may be assumed that the masses of the people actively participated in the struggle with the consent of the scholars or against their wishes. It is also apparent that the Nasi, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, no longer lived at that time and that no other Nasi had yet been elected by that time.</p>
<p>When Varus died, Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai was sent to Rome to intercede with emperor Antoninus Marcus Aurelius and to obtain the nullification of the decrees of Varus. Although they knew that Marcus Aurelius was not favorably inclined toward the Jews they trusted his sense of justice for he was known as a kindly and philosophical man.</p>
<p>To accompany Rabbi Simeon the scholars sent Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta, who could speak Latin. Both arrived in Rome and, with the aid of the Roman Jews, who wielded a considerable influence in government circles, they successfully completed their mission.</p>
<p>Legend relates the following miracle to have occurred during this journey. The emperor&#x2019;s daughter Lucilla was then possessed by a &#x201C;devil&#x201D; or &#x201C;dybbuk&#x201D; with the name Bar Tamalion. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai expelled the spirit and as a reward the emperor told him to enter the treasury and to choose the most valuable gift. Rabbi Simeon entered the royal treasury and selected the document of Varus&#x2019; decrees against the Jews and he forthwith tore it before the emperor. <sup><xref rid="fn562">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai was a pupil of Rabbi Akiba for thirteen years and he did not leave him until the day of Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s martyr death. But once Rabbi Akiba expressed his preference of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Simeon was displeased. Even Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s later statement that Rabbi Simeon should &#x201C;be satisfied that I and God know how to appreciate your power&#x201D; failed to reconcile him. <sup><xref rid="fn563">5)</xref></sup> Rabbi Simeon remembered this incident long after Rabbi Akiba died and he allowed himself to say that which no other disciple allowed himself; he declared that Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s interpretation of four Biblical verses were not correct and that his own explanations were more acceptable than Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s. <sup><xref rid="fn564">6)</xref></sup> Another time he addressed his pupils in the following words: &#x201C;My children, copy my manners for mine are copied from Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s best manners.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn565">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon&#x2019;s system of study was highly original and he always sought the cause of the interpretations of the text of the Torah. He always asked: &#x201C;Why does the Torah command us to do this?&#x201D; In this respect he was an exception in his generation. He based his opinions on reason irrespective of whether they were in agreement with the opinions of scholars of previous generations. In such cases he showed no reverence for his contemporaries nor for authorities of an earlier day. Intentionally he sought to exterminate ideas which others planted when he was convinced of their incorrectness.</p>
<p>The Torah commanded that the garment of a widow may not be taken in pawn and the Mishna <sup><xref rid="fn566">8)</xref></sup> declared that this law applied equally to rich as well as to poor widows. But Rabbi Simeon declared that this regulation applied only to poor widows because the rich ones undoubtedly possessed other garments. Unable to base his opinion on purely humanitarian grounds he explained that in the case of a poor widow, who may not have any other garments, such a pawn would have to be returned every evening and the repeated visits of the pawnbroker may cause suspicion to be cast on the character of the widow.</p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon also sought to lighten the burden of the observance of the Sabbath in contradiction to the other scholars who heaped prohibition upon prohibition. He thus allowed the moving of household furniture if care was taken not to dig up the ground in doing so. <sup><xref rid="fn567">9)</xref></sup> He ruled similarly concerning other types of work which were at that time prohibited. <sup><xref rid="fn568">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fully cognizant of his worth Rabbi Simeon never pretended modesty. On the contrary, he sometimes expressed himself in a manner which might indicate pride. Thus he said: &#x201C;There are few good people in the world. If there are a thousand such then I and my son are among them. If there are one hundred such then I and my son are among them. If there are only two such then I and my son are they.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn569">11)</xref></sup> On the same occasion he further stated: &#x201C;Because of my merit I can redeem the world from judgment for all sins that have ben committed since the time of my birth until this day. Were the merit of my son Elazar to be joined to mine I could free the world from judgment for all sins that were committed since the creation of the world until this day.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Like the other scholars of his day Rabbi Simeon also sought to preserve peace between husband and wife, but he never sought to attain this end at the expense of his own dignity. We have previously told of how Rabbi Meir allowed a woman to spit in his face when her husband commanded her to do so. Another man refused to partake of his wife&#x2019;s cooking until Rabbi Jehudah and Rabbi Simeon would taste of it. Rabbi Jehudah then agreed to do so but Rabbi Simeon said: &#x201C;Were the man to starve and were the woman to remain a widow and her children were to die I would not do this.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn570">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this connection it is interesting to relate an incident which occurred while Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai was in Sidon. A married couple who lived together for ten years and had no children came to him to obtain a divorce. Rabbi Simeon said to them: &#x201C;Since you do not want to part in anger you must do now as you did at the time of your wedding. At your wedding you made a feast; you must also make a feast at your parting.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The husband and wife did as Rabbi Simeon advised them. During the feast the husband became merry with drink and he said to his wife: &#x201C;Choose that which is most beautiful and dearest to you in the house and take it with you when you return to your father&#x2019;s house.&#x201D; When the husband fell asleep she ordered the slaves to carry him on his bed to her father&#x2019;s house. When he awoke and found himself in strange surroundings he asked his wife, &#x201C;Where am I?&#x201D; and she replied, &#x201C;You are in my father&#x2019;s house&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The man further asked, &#x201C;What have I to do in your father&#x2019;s house?&#x201D; and his wife replied, &#x201C;You asked me to take that which I held dearest in your house and I could find nothing dearer to me than yourself&#x201D;. They then went to Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai a second time to ask him what to do. He advised them not to part for he was certain that God would reward such a wife with children. He also promised to pray for them. <sup><xref rid="fn571">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon&#x2019;s attitude toward the Romans was always one of condemnation. He could never forget the suffering which the Romans inflicted upon the Jews nor the fact that all scolars had to flee Palestine to save their lives. Even when they were allowed to return during the rule of Antonius Pius they were forced to wander from city to city. At first they settled in Sidon, later in Usha and finally in Jabneh. When Rabbi Simeon expressed criticism of the Romans he was forced to hide in a cave. All of these events aroused within him a hatred for all Romans and he declared that the best among the Romans was like a snake whose head should be crushed. <sup><xref rid="fn572">14)</xref></sup> Another time he said that only Jews may be considered as human beings. <sup><xref rid="fn573">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a result of these events and also because of his personal misfortunes Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai became embittered and he ruled that as long as Jews are in exile no one must laugh wholeheartedly. <sup><xref rid="fn574">16)</xref></sup> When in later life he suffered from being reported to the government he ruled that even wicked people who curse their fathers and deserve to forfeit their lives according to law, should not be reported to the authorities. <sup><xref rid="fn575">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon valued the Torah above all else and he declared that &#x201C;Three who have eaten at one table and have not said over it words of the Torah are as if they had eaten of the sacrifice of the dead.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn576">18)</xref></sup> He further said that no scholar may partake of a feast the purpose of which is not to fulfill some commandment, <sup><xref rid="fn577">19)</xref></sup> and that people who do not engage in learning are to be punished. <sup><xref rid="fn578">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Three valuable gifts God granted to the Jews&#x201D;, he said, &#x201C;and all three are bound up with suffering. These three gifts are: the Torah, the Land of Israel and the world to come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn579">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;If I had been present on Mount Sinai when the Torah was given to the Jews&#x201D;, he said, &#x201C;I would have asked God to grant us two mouths, one for the study of the Torah and the other for all other purposes.&#x201D; But he immediately added that two mouths might even be worse than one for if one mouth can cause so much trouble by carrying reports, how much worse might the world be if people possessed two mouths. <sup><xref rid="fn580">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Being imbued with such a great love for the Torah Rabbi Simeon abhored all those who rebelled against its commandments and he said: &#x201C;Whoever wishes to taunt a wicked man may do so without compunction&#x201D;, <sup><xref rid="fn581">23)</xref></sup> for the gain of a wicked man is the loss of a just man. <sup><xref rid="fn582">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking of relations between people Rabbi Simeon declared that deceiving one&#x2019;s neighbor by words is even more wicked than obtaining his money under false pretenses. <sup><xref rid="fn583">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The saintliness of Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai was revered among Jews long after his death and it was said that during his lifetime no rainbow ever appeared because no flood could have descended upon the world due to his merit. <sup><xref rid="fn584">26)</xref></sup> It is also related that when Rabbi Joshua ben Levi died he entered paradise and there he found Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai reclining on thirteen golden thrones. Rabbi Simeon asked him: &#x201C;Did a rainbow ever appear during your life time?&#x201D; and Rabbi Joshua said that it did. Rabbi Simeon remarked: &#x201C;If so, then you were not a very just man.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn585">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Upon returning from his hiding place in the cave Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai settled in Meron where he lived until his death. The anniversary of his death is observed in Meron to this day.</p>
<p>During all the years that Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai and his son Rabbi Elazar remained secluded in their cave they pondered the mysteries of the Torah. It must be borne in mind that no books except the Bible were then available. The Mishna was then still being repeated orally and if someone wrote down interpretations of the Torah these were not circulated in writing in order to prevent such writings from assuming the sanctity of the written scriptures. It is therefore quite certain that Rabbi Simeon possessed no written books in his cave.</p>
<p>Leading an isolated existence and deriving nourishment from a carob tree and a spring of water for thirteen long years the thoughts of Rabbi Simeon and his son naturally turned to the mysteries of the creation of the world and to original interpretations of the Biblical texts. The proximity of the desert, the encounters with wild animals and poisonous snakes and their miraculous escapes, all these no doubt still further accentuated their interest in the imponderable aspects of life.</p>
<p>When they emerged from the cave later and resumed their teaching in the academy they expressed many of the mystical conclusions and observations which accumulated during the years they lived as hermits. These ideas they wrote down, or repeated orally to their pupils who gathered them in book form. But since these ideas had no direct bearing on the legal regulations they remained unknown for centuries until a Jewish scholar discovered them and compiled the famous book of &#x201C;Zohar&#x201D;.</p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua and Rabbi Jochanan the Sandalmaker</title>
<p>A<small>FTER</small> R<small>ABBI</small> A<small>KIBA&#x2019;S</small> 12,000 (or 24,000) pupils died and he was imprisoned for treason to the Romans there remained with him only a few disciples who stayed at his side until the time of his execution. Two of these, Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua and Rabbi Jochanan the Sandalmaker, exemplified the spirit of Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s last disciples. After the death of Rabbi Akiba they decided to go to Netsivin where Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra conducted an academy, but when they reached Sidon and looked back upon the Land of Israel which they were leaving behind they both wept in grief and returned.</p>
<p>These two were the last of Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s disciples and Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua was the more prominent of the two. <sup><xref rid="fn586">1)</xref></sup> All statements in the Mishna and Boraitha which are quoted in the name of Rabbi Elazar (without further identification) are the opinions of Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua. <sup><xref rid="fn587">2)</xref></sup> It was said of Rabbi Elazar that he was a pupil of Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah, Rabbi Jose of Galilee and Rabbi Tarphon before he became a disciple of Rabbi Akiba.</p>
<p>Despite his love for Palestine Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua was later forced to seek refuge in a strange country where the persecutions of the Romans were not so severe. When the political situation improved and the Jews were allowed to engage in the Torah again, Rabbi Elazar did not return to Usha with the other scholars. Rabbi Jochanan the Sandalmaker also remained in a foreign land. Rabbi Elazar then founded an academy in one of the cities of Galilee and this institution gained such fame that the Nasi, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, sent his son Jehudah to study at this academy. It was said that Jehudah remained there for many years and did not even return to his home for the holidays.</p>
<p>Years later the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah related that when he came to the academy the other pupils surrounded him angrily and would not allow him to engage in study. <sup><xref rid="fn588">3)</xref></sup> The academy was very crowded and six people were forced to sit in the space of one ell. <sup><xref rid="fn589">4)</xref></sup> In his later life Rabbi Jehudah visited Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua to inquire concerning the essense of some of his teachings. <sup><xref rid="fn590">5)</xref></sup> From this we may conclude that even after he was Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah still consulted Rabbi Elazar in all difficult questions.</p>
<p>The name of Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua is also listed among the ten martyrs and he was said to have been 105 years old at the time of his death. It was remarked that he never prayed aloud nor quarrelled with other people and that he fasted for 85 (&#x0021;) years. When he was asked what he had done to merit such a long life he declared that he never used the synagogue as a place for idle wasting of time, he never humiliated others and he did not pronounce the priestly blessing without reciting the benediction first.</p>
<p>The following maxim characterizes Rabbi Elazar&#x2019;s conception of the proper type of human behavior; he said: &#x201C;Let the honor of your disciple be dear to you as your own honor, and the honor of your friend should be like your reverence for your master, and your reverence for your master should be like your fear of God. <sup><xref rid="fn591">6)</xref></sup> Like other scholars he also spoke frequently of the value of peace and he said: &#x201C;All the teachings which the prophets sought to implant in the hearts of the people had but one aim&#x2014;peace.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn592">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar frequently repeated the following parable: &#x201C;There exist three types of scholars and they may be compared to three kinds of stones. One type of scholar is like a stone pointed at one end; another type may be compared to a two pointed stone, the third type is like a stone which is hewn on all sides. Who may be likened to a stone pointed at one end? One who studied Midrash and if he is questioned of the Midrash he is able to reply. Who may be likened to a two pointed stone? One who studied Midrash and Halacha and when he is questioned he is able to answer from both. Who may be compared to a hewn stone? One who studied Midrash, Halacha, Hagada and Tosephta. Whatever such a scholar is asked he is able to answer.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn593">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>There exists one legend connected with the life of Rabbi Elazar for which it is impossible to find any historical substantiation. This legend <sup><xref rid="fn594">9)</xref></sup> relates that Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua once strolled on the seashore and he saw a ship tossed on the waves. Before it could be clearly discerned the ship sank with all on board and only one man clung to a board and reached dry land without any clothes. Just then a group of Jews passed by on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. (Although the temple was destroyed Jews continued to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem as often as the Romans allowed them.) The survivor appealed to them and said: &#x201C;I am one of your brother Esau&#x2019;s children and I beg that you should give me a garment to cover my nakedness. The sea destroyed my ship and I could save none of my possessions.&#x201D; To this the Jews replied, &#x201C;If you are one of Eau&#x2019;s children then it were better that your whole people had been destroyed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The survivor looked around and seeing Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua he said to him, &#x201C;It is discernible that you are a prominent man among your people and you will no doubt understand that it is not proper to allow a man to go about naked. I therefore beg you to perform a good deed and to give me a garment because the sea had taken all of my possessions.&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar was wearing seven garments and he immediately removed one of them and he gave it to the man. He then took him to his house and gave him food and drink and a gift of two hundred ducats he also gave him and he mounted him on one of his asses and escorted him a distance of 14 miles to his house.</p>
<p>Some time later the king (?) died and another king was chosen in his place. The new ruler issued a decree against that country (?) to have all the males killed and to do with the women as they chose. The inhabitants of that country asked Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua to intercede with the king on their behalf and they gave him 4000 ducats to offer as a gift to the king. Rabbi Elazar proceeded to the palace of the king and when he entered the throne room the king descended from his throne and bowed before him and asked, &#x201C;What is your request?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar said: &#x201C;I want you to have mercy on the kingdom and to rescind your decree.&#x201D; The king then replied: &#x201C;It is written in your Torah that an Edomite or a Moabite may not be included in the congregation of God because they did not meet the Jews with bread and water when they came out of the land of Egypt. The Torah also states that you may not humiliate an Edomite because he is your brother. But your people dealt otherwise with me and because they did not observe this commandment of the Torah they have forfeited their lives.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nevertheless you must forgive them,&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar said. &#x201C;You must have mercy on them for if they did not act according to the commandment of the Torah they did so out of foolishness and God will forgive them.&#x201D; Saying this Rabbi Elazar handed the king the 4000 ducats which the people gave him. Then the king said, &#x201C;The 4000 ducats you may keep instead of the 200 ducats which you gave me. Because you gave me food and drink I will also forgive the sins of that country. You may also enter my treasury and choose the most beautiful garments for the one garment that you gave me to wear.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>The name of Rabbi Jochanan the Sandalmaker is mentioned only three times in connection with legal matters. When the question arose concerning the case of a woman who received &#x201C;Halitza&#x201D; in the presence of witnesses one of whom was later proved to be a relative of the woman, or disqualified as a witness for some other reason and it was decided that such &#x201C;Halitza&#x201D; was invalid, Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai and Rabbi Jochanan the Sandalmaker declared that such &#x201C;Halitza&#x201D; was valid. During this debate Rabbi Jochanan related his ruse in visiting Rabbi Akiba in prison to ask his opinion in this question. <sup><xref rid="fn595">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A maxim of Rabbi Jochanan stated: &#x201C;Every assembly which is conducted for the sake of God will remain permanent, but assemblies which are not for the sake of God will not last. <sup><xref rid="fn596">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Opinions differ concerning his appelation of &#x201C;Sandlar&#x201D; (sandalmaker). The book of genealogies (Yuchasin) declares that Rabbi Jochanan was a sandalmaker or that he drilled pearls to be strung, but some modern philologists dispute this point of view and interpret the name &#x201C;Sandlar&#x201D; to indicate that he was a native of Alexandria.</p>

<chapter>
<title>RABBI NEHEMIAH AND OTHER DISCIPLES OF RABBI AKIBA</title>
<p>T<small>HE LAST</small> disciples of Rabbi Akiba began the work of compiling the Mishna as they received it from their master. One of these was Rabbi Nehemiah who participated in the first gathering of the scholars after the death of emperor Hadrian. <sup><xref rid="fn597">1)</xref></sup> He was also present at the convocation at Usha although he did not actively participate in it. <sup><xref rid="fn598">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Little is known of the life and activities of Rabbi Nehemiah except the fact that he was very poor and a potter by trade. <sup><xref rid="fn599">3)</xref></sup> The name of his father is also unknown although it is certain that he was a prominent scholar because Rabbi Nehemiah once quoted his opinion in a legal matter <sup><xref rid="fn600">4)</xref></sup> Rabbi Nehemiah opposed the methodology of Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai and contradictory reports concerning his personality were circulated in later generations. One opinion claimed that all anonymous statements in the Tosephta were those of Rabbi Nehemiah. <sup><xref rid="fn601">5)</xref></sup> When the book of the genealogy of the noble families of Jerusalem was discovered it was found that Rabbi Nehemiah was a descendant of Nehemiah the Thirshata. <sup><xref rid="fn602">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another belief current in later generations maintained that Rabbi Nehemiah was identical with the Tana Rabbi Nehorai. In explanation it was said that he was called Nehorai because he shed light on doubtful legal questions. <sup><xref rid="fn603">7)</xref></sup> But Rabbi Nehorai had also been previously identified with Rabbi Elazar ben Arach. <sup><xref rid="fn604">8)</xref></sup> These beliefs therefore lack all substantiation because we also find a text quoting a dispute between Rabbi Nehorai and Rabbi Nehemiah and on another occasion the opinions of both are listed side by side. <sup><xref rid="fn605">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following statements are characteristic of Rabbi Nehemiah&#x2019;s ethical precepts: &#x201C;Suffering is good for people. Just as sacrifices placate God and still his anger even so does human suffering placate the Almighty. Moreover, human suffering is even more effective than the offering of sacrifices.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn606">10)</xref></sup> &#x201C;The sin of unfounded hatred is punished by domestic discord, frequent miscarriage and the early death of children.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn607">11)</xref></sup> &#x201C;He who undertakes to fulfill even one commandment honestly is deserving that the Holy Spirit should rest upon him. Thus we see that our forefathers left Egypt and believed in God and the Holy Spirit rested upon them and they merited the privilege of praising God. <sup><xref rid="fn608">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking of the time of the coming of the Messiah Rabbi Nehemiah declared that &#x201C;brazenness will then increase and honored men will follow devious ways. The vineyards will bear fruit but wine will be scarce. Government will be transformed into the rule of cliques and there will be no man capable of pointing out the right path. <sup><xref rid="fn609">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his exposition of the Scriptures Rabbi Nehemiah based his opinions on logic as well as on the grammatical structure of the Scriptural texts. He said: &#x201C;The words of the Torah are sometimes insufficient in one place and superfluous in another. <sup><xref rid="fn610">14)</xref></sup> When scholars expressed differing opinions regarding the duration of the time known as <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D4;&#x05E9;&#x05DE;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> (twilight), Rabbi Nehemiah declared that it lasts as long as it would take a man to walk one thousand ells. <sup><xref rid="fn611">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>Another important Tana of that time was Rabbi Joshua ben Korcha. Talmudic commentators such as Rashi, Rabenu Gershom Meor Hagolah and Rashbam claim that he was the son of Rabbi Akiba, who was nicknamed &#x201C;Kereach&#x201D; (the bald) because of the statement of Ben Azai who said that all Jewish scholars are worth no more than the skin of garlic except the bald one (referring to Rabbi Akiba). As a result of this Rabbi Joshua came to be called Ben Korcha, the son of the bald one. <sup><xref rid="fn612">16)</xref></sup> But Tosaphoth argues that this could not be the case and that Ben Azai&#x2019;s reference to Rabbi Akiba as &#x201C;the bald one&#x201D; did not suffice to justify Rabbi Joshua&#x2019;s appellation of Ben Korcha instead of ben Rabbi Akiba. The chronological order of the generations is also against such an assumption. When Rabbi Joshua was dying, the Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah, asked him for a blessing and Rabbi Joshua said: &#x201C;I wish that you may live at least half as many years as I did&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn613">17)</xref></sup> Had Rabbi Joshua been the son of Rabbi Akiba this blessing would have been meaningless.</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua&#x2019;s name is mentioned only four times in the Mishna, but the Talmud frequently quotes his legal opinions. Rabbi Joshua was in favor of allowing witnesses to appear one after the other <sup><xref rid="fn614">18)</xref></sup> and he declared that a messenger had the same legal powers as his sender. <sup><xref rid="fn615">19)</xref></sup> He believed in the strict enforcement of all Scriptural commandments but he was lenient concerning the fulfillment of the Rabbinical regulations. <sup><xref rid="fn616">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following of his moral maxims are noteworthy: &#x201C;He who studies the Torah but does not review his studies may be compared to a man who sows a field but does not harvest the crop.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn617">21)</xref></sup> &#x201C;He who hides his eyes from charity is like one who worships idols.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn618">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Brigandage was very prevalent at that time and the government found itself powerless to suppress it. Whether these were ordinary robbers or rebels whom the government declared to be bandits is hard to determine today. It is interesting to note, however, that the government appointed Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai, who hid with his father in a cave for many years, to exterminate the brigands. This office was similar to that of his grandfather Yochai which was commented on previously.</p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar had been a pupil of Rabbi Joshua ben Korcha for some time and when Rabbi Joshua heard of the new office of his pupil he sent the following message to him: &#x201C;Who gave you the right to exterminate God&#x2019;s people?&#x201D; Rabbi Elazar replied: &#x201C;I only pull out the weeds from the vineyard.&#x201D; To this Rabbi Joshua retorted: &#x201C;The owner of the vineyard can destroy the weeds himself.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn619">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua ben Korcha lived to a ripe old age. According to some he was 160 years old at the time of his death. The Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah, once asked him to explain the cause of his long life but Rabbi Joshua felt offended and said: &#x201C;Are you tired of seeing me alive?&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah assured him to the contrary and explained that he was interested from a scientific point of view. Placated, Rabbi Joshua answered: &#x201C;All my life I never looked at a wicked man.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn620">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>Among the scholars who met in Jabneh and later in Usha after the destruction of Betar there was also Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Jose of Galilee. <sup><xref rid="fn621">25)</xref></sup> Of him it was said that whenever Rabbi Elizer spoke of the Hagada it was advisable to pay close attention. <sup><xref rid="fn622">26)</xref></sup> He rarely participated in legal discussions and he gained his fame by compiling a list of 32 rules of logic according to which the Hagada was being interpreted. Aside from two or three laws which are ascribed to him we possess a statement of Rabbi Eliezer which says: &#x201C;If one begins to fulfill a commandment but does not complete it and another man finishes the work, credit is given to the one who finished the work. <sup><xref rid="fn623">27)</xref></sup></p>

<title>RABBI JEHUDAH THE NASI</title>
<p>A<small>S A RESULT</small> of the renewed persecution of the Jewish faith which became effective after the death of emperor Antoninus Pius, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the Second had to move his academy from Usha to Shefarom. The new decrees which were promulgated during the joint reign of Lucius Varus and Marcus Aurelius did not strike at the study of the Torah but only at the observance of its commandments, particularly as they concerned the observance of the Sabbath and the practice of circumcision. When Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel II died, his son Rabbi Jehudah was appointed Nasi. Although documentary evidence is lacking, it is apparent that the assumption of office by the new Nasi took place with the consent of the authorities. Roman suspicion of the Nasi&#x2019;s descent from the royal House of David had subsided by that time and no attempt was any longer being made to offer the office to a man of less aristocratic lineage.</p>
<p>The Talmud always refers to Rabbi Jehuda the Nasi only by his title of &#x201C;Rabbi&#x201D;. Because his contemporaries were convinced that he was the most pious man since the days of Moses, he was also called &#x201C;Rabenu Hakadosh&#x201D;, our holy teacher. His whole life history is surrounded by legends of miracles which were said to have occurred from the day of his birth until many weeks after his death. It was said that he was born on the same day that Rabbi Akiba was executed. <sup><xref rid="fn624">1)</xref></sup> Hadrian&#x2019;s decrees against the practice of circumcision were then in full force and both the child and its parents had to forfeit their lives. One Midrash relates that Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s parents were reported to the government for having circumcised their son. Parents and child were then brought before the emperor (more correctly before the imperial representative then residing in Palestine), but a Gentile neighbor who was a member of a prominent Roman aristocratic family pitied the child and she gave her own son to Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel to show to the judges.</p>
<p>The city wherein Rabbi Jehudah was born is unknown. Because of the turbulence of the times it is impossible to know definitely where Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel resided at that time. Being the son of the Nasi and destined to occupy the post of his father, Rabbi Jehudah was provided with the best tutors who acquainted him with all sciences. Gifted with great talents and a natural curiosity he absorbed much learning and assimilated it in his personality. In his youth Rabbi Jehudah studied with his father <sup><xref rid="fn625">2)</xref></sup> and later he was a pupil of the academies of Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai, Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua and others.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah evinced a great love of the Bible and all his life he sought to establish Hebrew or Greek as the spoken language among the Jews. He was grieved to hear the Jews speak a mixture of languages <sup><xref rid="fn626">3)</xref></sup> and in his own household everyone spoke Hebrew. Rabbi Jehudah owned a woman slave (frequently mentioned in the Talmud as &#x201C;the servant in the house of Rabbi&#x201D;) who was an authority on the Hebrew language and who was often consulted by some of the scholars in the matter of the Hebrew names of various subjects. <sup><xref rid="fn627">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like his predecessors Rabbi Jehudah also devoted much time to the study of the natural sciences. His position as Nasi imposed upon him the obligation of determining the dates of the new months and the holidays and he had to know astronomy. He likewise had to know the nature of various plants and animals in connection with the dietary laws and the regulations pertaining to cleanliness. These sciences attained a higher stage of development among the Gentiles who were not bound by the regulations of the Torah and Rabbi Jehudah declared that whenever a law was not involved the opinion of Gentile naturalists was to be considered as more valid than the opinions of the Jewish scholars. <sup><xref rid="fn628">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi was very rich and his wealth was often described with fantastic exaggeration as, for instance, when it was said that his cattle fed from golden troughs and that his stables contained more gold than the treasure rooms of the Persian king. <sup><xref rid="fn629">6)</xref></sup> Because of his prominent position he had to conduct a lavish court in the manner of a royal prince, but it is nevertheless known that he used little of his wealth for his personal use. <sup><xref rid="fn630">7)</xref></sup> Whenever necessary he gave generously for charitable purposes, for the maintenance of needy students and to feed the poor. <sup><xref rid="fn631">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At that time there occurred a great famine throughout all the provinces of the Roman empire. Rabbi Jehudah opened his storehouses filled with grain to distribute to the poor but at first he commanded that only those who had studied the Torah should be given bread. One of his disciples, Rabbi Jonathan ben Amram, appeared dressed as an Am Haaretz and when Rabbi Jehudah refused to give him bread he said: &#x201C;Does not even a crow or a dog have the right to be fed?&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah then concluded that no distinctions should be made in the matter of the distribution of bread and he commanded that it be given to all who asked for it.</p>
<p>Despite his great personal success Rabbi Jehudah never exhibited the least sign of pride. None of the scholars so readily acknowledged the value and the superiority of the others as he did. <sup><xref rid="fn632">9)</xref></sup> The following was one of his most favorite maxims: &#x201C;I have learned much from my teachers; I have learned even more from my friends, but I have learned most from my pupils.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn633">10)</xref></sup> When certain activities of other people were being judged and criticism was leveled against them, Rabbi Jehudah carefully weighed his opinions before passing judgment. When a man was brought for trial before Rabbi Jehudah on the grounds that he did not observe the regulations of the Sabbatical year, Rabbi Jehudah carefully listened to the accusation as well as to the arguments of the defendant and said: &#x201C;What else could you expect the poor man to do when he was hungry?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn634">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like his grandfather, Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh, Rabbi Jehudah realized that the regulations of the Sabbatical year were a heavy burden upon the poorer people and that they should be modified. The poorer elements of the community usually remained without bread on the Sabbatical year and it was obvious that they had to resort to eating the fruit which ripened on that year. Rabbi Jehudah was ready to open the subject for discussion with Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair but realizing that he would be overruled he said nothing. <sup><xref rid="fn635">12)</xref></sup> Nevertheless he succeeded in repealing several prohibitions of the Sabbatical year which were effective till that time. Rabbi Jehudah acted similarly to reduce the burden of the tithes <sup><xref rid="fn636">13)</xref></sup> and he also declared that the population should not be burdened with too many fasts. <sup><xref rid="fn637">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi never insisted on his personal prerogatives but he severely punished all infringements on the dignity of the office of Nasi. The office of Nasi therefore attained a great measure of authority. Wherever Jews lived the word of the Nasi was listened to attentively. His pronouncements were considered as law and no one dared to criticize his actions. Rabbi Jehudah devoted much effort to the attainment of this goal and he was successful. In Babylonia as well as in Palestine and in all the other countries his decisions were unquestioned. As a result of this the organization of Jewish life proceeded in better order than ever before and it was said that &#x201C;from Moses until Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi there was not another man who combined learning and greatness of spirit to such a degree. <sup><xref rid="fn638">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of his descent from Hillel of Babylonia and from king David, Jews accorded him all honors of which they were capable. He was the recognized leader of the people and his word carried more weight than that of all the other members of the Court together. His opinion determined whether one of the disciples should be ordained irrespective of the opinions of the other scholars. At that time it was also ruled that &#x201C;when a court appoints one to an office without the sanction of the Nasi such appointment is invalid; but when the Nasi appoints a person to an office without the sanction of the court the appointment is valid.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn639">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The court of Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi had no superior judge (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1; &#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05EA; &#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>) and the post of &#x201C;Chacham&#x201D; was also done away with. These changes eliminated conflicts and disputes between the Nasi and the other scholars. Rabbi Jehudah also knew how to keep his decisions within certain bounds. He always sensed possible opposition to new and radical legislation and he avoided enacting it. Due to the changing developments in the political situation in Palestine he felt compelled to introduce some reforms in Jewish religious life. He thus abolished the time honored custom of lighting fires on the mountain tops to announce the beginning of a new month which determined the dates of the holidays and he substituted the sending of messengers to the communities instead. <sup><xref rid="fn640">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The cause of this innovation was the renewed animosity between the Samaritans and the Jews which flared up again after a period of friendship among the two peoples when they were both equally oppressed by the Romans. In order to confuse the Jews in the celebration of their holidays the Samaritans often lit fires on the mountain tops at the wrong time. As Rabbi Ishmael ben Rabbi Jose was once making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem he passed through Shechem. The Samaritans ridiculed him for making a pilgrimage to a ruin which God rejected and declared that it would be more reasonable to offer prayers on Mount Gerizim which had been blessed by God. Rabbi Ishmael replied that the Samaritans probably venerate mount Gerizim because Jacob buried on it the idols which he took from Laban&#x2019;s house. This reply incensed the Samaritans and they were ready to kill Rabbi Ishmael who escaped with great difficulty. <sup><xref rid="fn641">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The observance of the Sabbatical year and the payment of tithes at that time began to constitute a severe problem due to the prevalent poverty. Rabbi Jehudah modified the regulations governing the Sabbatical year and the tithes. Moreover he could see no justification for the continued payment of tithes to the Priests and Levites after the Temple was destroyed. He therefore declared the environs of many cities which were not included in the first conquest of Canaan by Joshua as foreign territory and not subject to those commandments which were operative in Palestine only. The inhabitants of these districts were thus freed from the burden of both the Sabbatical year and the tithes. <sup><xref rid="fn642">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The conditions of Jewish life had also changed to such an extent that it became necessary to think of modifying the restrictions of the Sabbath in order to allow people to go from one city to another as was the case between the cities of Geder and Hamthan. <sup><xref rid="fn643">20)</xref></sup> Rabbi Jehudah also simplified the procedure for accepting proselytes <sup><xref rid="fn644">21)</xref></sup> and he attempted to modify the observance of the ninth day of Ab. His reforms in this case are not entirely clear. The Talmud relates that he wanted to do away with the observance of the ninth day of Ab altogether. Later scholars doubted the possibility of such an intention and declared that he merely wanted to abolish the fasting when that day coincided with the Sabbath. Since fasting was prohibited on the Sabbath he wanted to do away with the fast on such a year. <sup><xref rid="fn645">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah ruled that students who were considered capable of heading an academy should not be allowed to open one without the permission of the Nasi. <sup><xref rid="fn646">23)</xref></sup> He also instructed his son Rabban Gamliel, who was to be his successor, to conduct himself with dignity and to inspire fear among his disciples. <sup><xref rid="fn647">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speaking to one of his disciples (Rabbi Chiya) Rabbi Jehudah declared that he would do the wish of any person except that which the Men of Bathyra did when they renounced the office of Nasi in favor of Hillel. &#x201C;But&#x201D;, he added, &#x201C;were the Exilarch Rav Huna to come from Babylonia, I would not renounce my office but I would give him the seat of honor for he is descended from a son of king David while I am descended from a daughter of the king.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Some time later, when this conversation had been forgotten by all, Rabbi Chiya entered the academy of Rabbi Jehudah and announced: &#x201C;The Exilarch Rav Huna of Babylonia has arrived.&#x201D; He noticed that Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s face changed colors from great agitation and he immediately added: &#x201C;The dead Rav Huna and not the living one has arrived.&#x201D; (Rav Huna commanded in his will that his body be interred in Palestine and it was the arrival of the body that Rabbi Chiya announced.)</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi was greatly angered at this attempt to confuse him for even a moment and he punished Rabbi Chiya by denying him entrance into the academy for thirty days. <sup><xref rid="fn648">25)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another angry outburst of Rabbi Jehudah against Bar Kapara is related in the following story. Rabbi Jehudah had a son-in-law named Ben Elasha who was a wealthy man but not versed in learning. On the occasion of a feast which Rabbi Jehudah tendered in his house the guests proposed riddles for the audience to solve, but Ben Elasha remained silent. Bar Kapara then said to him: &#x201C;Why are you silent, brother?&#x201D; And Ben Elasha replied: &#x201C;You know that I know not what to say.&#x201D; Bar Kapara suggested that he should ask the following riddle:</p>
<p>The grebe looks down from heaven, it hovers in all the corners of the house, it frightens all the birds. Young ones see it and hide, old ones remain standing in fright. Whoever escapes cries out in pain and he who is caught, is caught in his own sin.</p>
<p>This riddle was aimed at the leadership of Rabbi Jehudah and he understood that it could not have been thought up by his son-in-law. Rabbi Jehudah also noticed Bar Kapara smiling and he felt certain that Bar Kapara was the author of the riddle. In great anger he exclaimed: &#x201C;I do not want to know you any longer, old man.&#x201D; This was a great blow for Bar Kapara who could never obtain ordination after that, although he deserved it more than many others. <sup><xref rid="fn649">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A similar incident occurred with Shmuel Yarchinai who was one of the greatest scholars of the time, but who never received ordination. He had served Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi for many years as physician and cured him from a dangerous disease. It is unknown what Shmuel Yarchinai&#x2019;s offense consisted of. It is also possible that he did not receive ordination because of insufficient acquaintance with the law; he devoted himself mainly to the sciences such as astronomy and astrology. Shmuel consoled himself with the belief that since the time of Adam it had already been foretold that he would be a learned man but not ordained and that he would bring about the cure of Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi. <sup><xref rid="fn650">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah was prone to anger as a result of his sickness which caused him great suffering. These outbursts of anger brought about a subdued discontent among his disciples as well as among the members of his household. This discontent was never uttered except on one occasion during a feast in the house of the Nasi. When everyone was merry with wine, Rabbi Jehudah asked the two children of Rabbi Chiya, Jehudah and Hezekiah, to say something. The two boys began describing the time of the coming of the Messiah and they said that Messiah would not arrive until the two ruling houses, those of the Nasi and of the Exilarch of Babylonia, would be done away with for these hinder the redemption. Rabbi Jehudah was greatly grieved to hear this but being in a good mood he did not expel the boys from the house, and he merely remarked: &#x201C;Children, you cast thorns in my eyes.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn651">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The whole generation of Rabbi Jehudah was unanimous in its veneration of the saintliness of the man and he was therefore called &#x201C;Rabenu Hakadosh&#x201D; (Our holy teacher). His personal qualities and his nobility in his relation with people caused him to be the beloved friend of a Roman emperor (according to some historians it was a Roman governor) who secretly visited him to gain information on Judaism until he was convinced of the truth of the Jewish faith and became converted. One must bear in mind that the Romans looked with contempt upon the Jews at that time. A Jew who could win the friendship of a Roman emperor, or governor, had to be a shining example among millions. Under these circumstances it is understandable why the Jewish people idolized Rabbi Jehudah and when Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia listed seven virtues which every just man must possess he immediately added that all of these were united in Rabbi Jehudah and his family. These are: beauty, strength, honor, wisdom, a manly beard, old age and successful children. <sup><xref rid="fn652">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>People therefore believed that one who sees Rabbi Jehudah in his dream could expect wisdom, <sup><xref rid="fn653">30)</xref></sup> and later scholars declared that he drew his wisdom from deep wells <sup><xref rid="fn654">31)</xref></sup> and that the prophet Elijah sat among the disciples of Rabbi Jehudah to hear him teach the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn655">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When he was asked &#x201C;What is the right way which a man should chose?&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah replied that every way is good when it is fit for the people who follow it and men could pride themselves on it. To elucidate his meaning he immediately added: &#x201C;Be careful in the case of a light commandment as in that of a weighty one for you know not the value of the commandments. Everyone must therefore weigh the loss incurred in fulfilling a commandment against its reward and the reward of a sin against its loss.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn656">33)</xref></sup> &#x201C;When a man commits a good deed he should be joyful, because it is certain to lead him to other good deeds, but one who commits a sin must feel sorrowful because he will be lead to commit other sins.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn657">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Evil nature and its relation to the sinner, Rabbi Jehudah said, may be compared to two persons who enter a house and one of them is caught in the act of stealing. When the guilty person is asked, &#x201C;Who was with you?&#x201D; he could say that he was alone responsible but seeing that he was to be condemned to death he also involves his friend. Evil nature acts similarly and when one of man&#x2019;s limbs sins and loses its share in the world to come all the other limbs are also lost. <sup><xref rid="fn658">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;One who enjoys the pleasures of this world,&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah continued, &#x201C;is denied the pleasures of the world to come; one who is denied the joys of this world is certain to share in the pleasures of the world to come. A just man who meets with difficulties in this life may be compared to a cook who prepares a feast for himself: although he has to work hard to prepare the feast he has the realization that he will enjoy it later. Wicked men who meet with difficulties may be compared to a cook who prepares a feast for others; he has to work hard and he does not enjoy the fruit of his labor.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn659">36)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But it is remarkable that despite Rabbi&#x2019;s conviction that all of man&#x2019;s activities must be directed toward the attainment of a share in the world to come he nevertheless once expressed himself in the following terms: &#x201C;One hour of repentance and good deeds in this world outweighs all the life in the world to come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn660">37)</xref></sup> This statement was interpreted to refer to the satisfaction that one derives from repentance or good deeds which is more important than the joy of anticipating a world to come.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Torah Rabbi compared it to water. Just as an adult is not ashamed to ask a child to give him water to drink even so should a man not be ashamed to ask one lesser than himself to clarify some doubtful passage of the law. The Torah may also be compared to water in another manner. One who is thirsty diligently searches for water to quench his thirst and a student must be diligent in his attendance at the academy. <sup><xref rid="fn661">38)</xref></sup> No man can hide his learning and even if he engages in study secretly the Torah will announce itself to all. <sup><xref rid="fn662">39)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of his great veneration of the Torah and its followers Rabbi despised the uneducated and he declared that only students may eat the flesh of animals or fowls but the uneducated must not eat of it for they themselves are not different from the animals. <sup><xref rid="fn663">40)</xref></sup> He believed that all evil which was visited upon the world was in punishment of the sins of the &#x201C;Ame-Aratzim.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn664">41)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like many of his predecessors Rabbi Jehudah also believed in peace and he said that &#x201C;even if the Jews were to worship idols but live in peace God himself would be powerless to harm them&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn665">42)</xref></sup> He attached great significance to labor and declared: &#x201C;Great is the value of labor. When people see a man who is not engaged in some occupation they wonder where he gets his income from. Such a man may be compared to an unmarried woman who adorns herself before going out into the street and thus attracts the unfavorable comment of the people. Similar attention is attracted by a man who does not work.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn666">43)</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the daily prayers Rabbi Jehudah pronounced a prayer of his own in which he asked to be preserved from meeting with arrogant people and from showing arrogance and to be spared from untoward events, from evil thoughts, from wicked friends, from bad neighbors, from severe laws as well as from severe judges. <sup><xref rid="fn667">44)</xref></sup> Rabbi Jehudah was always ready to acknowledge the correctness of the views of others, but if one of his pupils corrected him in public, he never forgave him even though he may have agreed with the correction. <sup><xref rid="fn668">45)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following story is related in the Talmud concerning the kindness of Rabbi Jehudah. As he once sat in front of the synagogue of the Babylonians in Sephoris, a calf was led by to slaughter. The animal fawned upon Rabbi Jehudah and bleated pitifully as if asking him to save it from slaughter, but Rabbi Jehudah said to it: &#x201C;I cannot save you. You must follow where you are led for you were created for the purpose of slaughter.&#x201D; It was then announced in heaven that since Rabbi did not pity God&#x2019;s creature, he was to be punished and Rabbi Jehudah suffered from tooth aches for thirteen years. Some time later his daughter saw an insect in the house and she wanted to kill it, but Rabbi Jehudah said to her: &#x201C;Leave it be. God created it and He pities all his creatures.&#x201D; It was then decided in heaven to have mercy on Rabbi Jehudah because he showed mercy to a living creature . <sup><xref rid="fn669">46)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Jehudah was about to die he commanded his children that the conduct of the house should not be altered in any manner. He then raised his hands heavenward and said: &#x201C;Creator of the world, you know the truth. All my days I have devoted to the Torah and I have not enjoyed the pleasures of this life in the slightest measure.&#x201D; As his death drew near the scholars declared a fast and fervently prayed to god. They also said that whoever would announce the death of Rabbi Jehudah was to be pierced with a sword. Later they sent Bar Kapara to see Rabbi Jehudah but when he arrived Rabbi Jehudah was dead. Bar Kapara rent his garments and returning to the academy he said: &#x201C;Angels and men have contended for the Holy Ark but the angles triumped and the Ark was taken away.&#x201D; He was then asked, &#x201C;Is Rabbi Jehudah dead?&#x201D; and Bar Kapara answered, &#x201C;You have said it. I could not bring myself to utter the word.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn670">47)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many of the stories of the activities of Rabbi Jehudah which are related in the Talmud and the Mishna mention an intimate friendship which existed between him and the Roman emperor Antoninus and it was said that the emperor often visited the house of Rabbi Jehudah through a secret tunnel which led from Rome to the house of the Nasi.(&#x0021;) During these visits they engaged in friendly arguments concerning religious questions. The confidence of the emperor in the Nasi was said to be so great that he often asked Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s advice in such matters as the succession to the Roman throne and his conduct toward his daughter who deviated from the ways of morality.</p>
<p>Most of these stories are related in Tractate Avoda Zara and as historical proof of their being based on fact we may cite the writings of the Christian Church-Father Hieronymus, who lived at a time when these events were still fresh in the memory of the people. Other historians, however, find it difficult to establish definitely which emperor was referred to. During the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah there ruled two or three emperors who added the name Antoninus to their given names. But the personalities of none of these emperors fit the legendary description of a great friendship with the Jewish leader. Antoninus Pius, who was the first to ameliorate the condition of the Jews in Palestine, could not have been the hero of these legends because he was not a friend of the Jews despite the fact that he modified Hadrian&#x2019;s decrees. Furthermore the period of his reign does not coincide with the period given in these legends either.</p>
<p>Still other historical commentators deny the truth of the legend and maintain that the growth of Christianity which then gained the friendship of some Roman emperors caused the Jews to ally themselves with the Roman opponents of Christianity and to fabricate the story of the friendship of the emperor. Some of those that recognize the factual basis of the legend claim that it concerned a Roman governor named Antoninus and not an emperor.</p>
<p>The legend continues to relate that there was a secret passage from the governor&#x2019;s palace in Caesaria to the house of Rabbi Jehudah and that he was always accompanied on his visits by two slaves. Fearing that the slaves might disclose the secret of his friendship with the Nasi which might harm his status in Rome, the governor killed one of the slaves upon his arrival at the house of the Nasi and the other upon his return to the palace.</p>
<p>Antoninus objected to the presence of outsiders during his visits and when he once found Rabbi Chanina bar Chama in the house of the Nasi he asked in anger, &#x201C;Who is this person?&#x201D; Rabbi answered, &#x201C;This is not a human being but an angel.&#x201D; &#x201C;If so,&#x201D; Antoninus said, &#x201C;let him go out and awaken my slave who is sleeping at the door.&#x201D; Rabbi Chanina went out and with his prayers he caused the dead slave to come to life again.</p>
<p>Antoninus consulted Rabbi Jehudah concerning his family problems and in order that none may understand the subject under discussion they frequently conducted a &#x201C;correspondence of flowers&#x201D;. When Gira, the daughter of Antoninus, began to conduct herself immorally Antoninus sent to Rabbi Jehudah a herb named Gagira thus informing him of the situation and requesting his advice. Rabbi responded by sending a herb named Chusbarta to express his opinion that he was justified in killing her. In reply Antoninus sent a bloom named Karthi indicating his inability to execute a member of his family and Rabbi sent him a herb named Chasa to advise him that he should keep the whole matter secret.</p>
<p>Another time Antoninus sent the following message to Rabbi Jehudah: &#x201C;The treasury is empty. Tell me what to do.&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah led the messenger into his garden and in his presence he pulled out some large radishes and planted small ones in their stead. When the messenger asked him for a reply, R. Jehudah said that none was needed. The messenger returned to Antoninus and reported that Rabbi Jehudah gave no answer to the question. &#x201C;Did he do anything in your presence?&#x201D; Antoninus asked and the messenger related what he had seen. Antoninus understood the hint and he discharged some officials and appointed others in their place. In a short time the royal treasury was again filled with gold. <sup><xref rid="fn671">48)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Antoninus once said to Rabbi: &#x201C;I would like to see my son Severus succeed me to the throne and I also want to make Tiberias a free city, but I can only do one of these two things and I don&#x2019;t know which to choose.&#x201D; Rabbi advised him to appoint Severus as his representative and he would later declare Tiberias a free city.</p>
<p>Several episodes related in the Talmud indicate that the relations between Antoninus and Rabbi were no longer kept secret after a while. It is told that Antoninus sought to serve Rabbi every time he visited him and when Rabbi was taking his place in the litter to be carried to the academy, Antoninus would bend down so that his back might serve as a step for Rabbi. When Rabbi Jehudah objected to this servility because it lowered the dignity of the royal office Antoninus remarked: &#x201C;I wish that I could be as a rug under your feet in the world to come.&#x201D; Antoninus also sent sacks full of gold to Rabbi and these he covered with wheat to hide from the populace the fact that he was giving money belonging to the government to the Nasi. Rabbi Jehudah said to him: &#x201C;Why do you do this? I do not need it.&#x201D; Antoninus replied: &#x201C;Let it remain for those who will come after you and they can pass it on to future generations.&#x201D; It is also told that Antoninus leased to Rabbi Jehudah two thousand acres of land in Palestine. <sup><xref rid="fn672">49)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some versions of this legend declare that Antoninus was converted to Judaism but this fact is contradicted in other places. Antoninus is reported to have remarked to Rabbi Jehudah: &#x201C;You promise that in the world to come I will partake of the Leviathan but now you do not allow me to eat of the Paschal lamb.&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah pointed out that the uncircumcised were forbidden to eat of the Paschal lamb. Antoninus then underwent circumcision and it was said that when Messiah comes he would be in the front rank of the proselytes. Incidentally it was also told that Antoninus presented a &#x201C;menorah&#x201D; to the synagogue in Tiberias. When Rabbi heard of the gift he exclaimed: &#x201C;Praised be God who inspired him with this idea&#x0021;&#x201D; The fact that he did not say, &#x201C;Praised be <italic>our</italic> God&#x0021;&#x201D; was interpreted by some to prove that Antoninus had not embraced Judaism. <sup><xref rid="fn673">50)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Antoninus frequently invited Rabbi Jehudah to his own house and Rabbi often arranged feasts in honor of Antoninus. At one such feast which took place on a Sabbath only cold food was offered. Antoninus ate the food and praised it highly. At another feast which was given on a week day hot victuals were served but Antoninus declared that the cold foods that were offered on the Sabbath were tastier. Rabbi Jehudah explained that the hot food did not contain a certain herb which was mixed with the cold food. When Antoninus asked in surprise what that herb was, Rabbi said that it was named &#x201C;Sabbath&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn674">51)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Antoninus often engaged Rabbi in philosophic and religious discussions during which he asked questions such as: &#x201C;Whence does man derive his soul?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Since when does evil nature rule humanity?&#x201D; Ofttimes he was not satisfied with the replies of Rabbi Jehudah and offered his own explanations which Rabbi admitted to be correct. <sup><xref rid="fn675">52)</xref></sup></p>
<p>During one of these discussions Antoninus argued that both body and soul may escape punishment on the day of judgment. The body may claim that it could not sin if it had not been imbued with a soul and the soul could reason likewise. Rabbi Jehudah explained what could be done in such a case with the following example from human behavior: The owner of a garden hired two watchmen, one of whom was blind and the other lame, to guard the fruit. The lame one saw the fruit on the trees and he desired to eat of them. He then said to the blind watchman, &#x201C;Lead me to the tree and we will both eat the most beautiful fruit.&#x201D; The blind man then carried the lame one on his shoulders and they ate all the fruit. Later the owner of the garden arrived and he asked: &#x201C;Who ate all the fruit of the tree?&#x201D; The blind man said: &#x201C;You cannot blame me for you know that I cannot see.&#x201D; The lame watchman similarly declared: &#x201C;You cannot blame me for I could not walk to the tree.&#x201D; The owner then placed the lame one on the back of the blind one to show them that he understood how they reached the fruit and he punished them. God does likewise when body and soul attempt to escape punishment by placing the blame on the other.</p>
<p>When Antoninus died Rabbi Jehudah sighed and exclaimed sorrowfully: &#x201C;Society has now broken down.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The greatest achievement of Rabbi Jehudah which immortalized his influence and gave him a place in our history almost rivalling that of Moses was his editing of the Mishna in which he compiled all the laws and customs of Jewish life as they were then accepted by the people orally as interpretations and supplements to the commandments of the Torah. The traditional oral explanations were handed down from one generation to another by the priests, the Levites and the scholars. These laws and opinions were never systematically written down in order to prevent their rivalling the sanctity of the Scriptures but single scholars kept short notes of what they heard from their teachers and these notes circulated extensively until they were gathered and edited by Rabbi Jehudah. Many of these traditional interpretations were accepted as legally binding as early as the time of Simeon the Just but during the years they were amplified and developed until there arose differences of opinion which seemed contradictory.</p>
<p>The first Mishna of tractate Berachoth thus begins with a question: &#x201C;At what time does one have to recite the Shema?&#x201D; The Mishna expresses no doubt regarding the necessity of reciting the Shema, but is merely concerned with the length of time allowed for this prayer. The majority of the laws and customs cited in the Mishna are not referred to any one person. It was considered irrelevant who the original author of a basically accepted law had been. As the years went by the names of these authors were often forgotten and the Mishna merely endeavored to establish the origin of the laws in the scriptural texts deriving them literally or through exposition.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries that elapsed from the time of Simeon the Just until the days of Rabbi Jehudah many scholars were killed and with them the distinct knowledge of many laws was lost. Numerous customs also lapsed in the course of time. The remaining scholars would then assemble witnesses to testify concerning doubtful interpretations of laws and the manner of their observance. In compiling the Mishna Rabbi Jehudah sought to achieve a similar goal.</p>
<p>The persecutions which mounted through the ages severed the Jews from contact with the surrounding environment and forced them into the narrow bounds of their own intimate group life thus blinding them to what was going on outside. They then devoted all their spiritual energies to the Torah; they reckoned every word and letter in the Torah and surrounded even minor words and seemingly unnecessary letters with numerous interpretations.</p>
<p>These interpretations and elucidations were called Mishna because it was a more complete and improved code of laws for the conduct of mankind. Many of the Biblical commandments were rather vague in their context and required further elucidation. Nevertheless when Rabbi Jehudah compiled the Mishna in six &#x201C;orders&#x201D; which were divided into sixty tractates there remained some laws which were not included for some reason unknown to us and these were later included in the Talmud as Boraitha or in Tosephta. The Mishnaic method of interpretation thus became the nerve center of Jewish jurisprudence and the Jerusalem Talmud explains <sup><xref rid="fn676">53)</xref></sup> even where tradition and the Biblical text were contradictory it was sought to find some way to derive the tradition from the text in order not to impair the sanctity of the Scriptural text. Actions which were forbidden at one time were permitted at a later date but both the prohibition and the permission were derived by expounding the same text. A case in question involved the time when cultivation of the fields on the year preceding the Sabbatical year had to cease. <sup><xref rid="fn677">54)</xref></sup></p>
<p>This approach was maintained toward all laws irrespective of whether they were based on traditional interpretation or on the regulations of the Elders which were enacted from time to time since the days of the Great Synagogue. A similar attitude was observed toward customs which became hallowed by time and which were originated by the teachers of the law or were commanded by the Torah. The Mishna did not differentiate between these two types of laws.</p>
<p>Much has been said concerning the difference between the schools of Hillel and of Shammai and that for a time it seemed as if two separate sets of laws would be established. Such fears, however, could be entertained only by the superficial observer for despite all differences both schools had but one aim, to attain the truth.</p>
<p>As Rabbi Jehudah grew old he felt concerned for the fate of the traditions and he feared that they would be forgotten by later generations. He therefore decided to have them written down and edited. He entertained no such fears concerning the Torah and he felt sure that its spirit would remain alive even if the books of the Torah were to be destroyed. The constant oppression and the weakening human spirit did inspire him with foreboding concerning the observance of the numerous traditions.</p>
<p>As Rabbi Jehudah gathered the various laws to include in the Mishna he omitted the explanatory arguments and conflicting opinions which had been added. He also sought to retain the original style and form of the laws and he included laws and customs which were no longer observed in his day. All these he tried to present in the clearest possible manner. <sup><xref rid="fn678">55)</xref></sup> The Mishna thus bears the marks of organic unity despite the many disputes which took place during the formulation of the laws and it appears as if written by one man. Any contradiction which may be found in it were considered to be superficial because &#x201C;everything which a scholar may learn someday had previously been said to Moses on Mount Sinai.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn679">56)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Mishnaioth (pl. of Mishna) of Rabbi Jehudah could be classified under two headings: Halacha (law) and Drasha (exposition). The word Halacha signifies &#x201C;conduct&#x201D; and it refers to traditionally accepted customs irrespective of whether they are based on Biblical commandments in their essence or in detail. It was an accepted axiom of the Jewish faith that all of these Halachoth were orally given to Moses on Mount Sinai. Differences of opinion which existed regarding some of these, were settled by a &#x201C;Bath Kol&#x201D; (public opinion) which declared that the contentions of both sides were the words of the living God. <sup><xref rid="fn680">57)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Graeco Jewish philosopher Philo described in his books the customs of the Jews and he defined these customs (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E0;&#x05D4;&#x05D2;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) as unwritten traditional interpretations of the laws. From this we may conclude that the origin of an Halacha was a popular custom. In time, however, laws and customs became differentiated into separate types of observances. When we assume that custom was the foundation of law we must bear in mind that customs become antiquated and lose their original purpose. We therefore find in the Mishna numerous laws whose intent is no longer clear. In such cases it was the established rule of the court to observe the accepted procedure of the populace. A rule was established that customs which are contradictory to old laws should not be abolished and it was said that &#x201C;custom outweighs the law&#x201D;. <sup><xref rid="fn681">58)</xref></sup> Another rule declared that &#x201C;a person may be punished for the infraction of a custom as well as for breaking a law.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn682">59)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The laws of the Mishna developed to a large extent out of analysis of the words of the Torah. This method was then considered to be the most valid and the only one capable of bringing out the simple meaning of the text. The Biblical verse &#x201C;on the morrow after the Sabbath&#x201D; (Lev. 23:15) was thus explained to mean the morrow of the first day of Passover and not the morrow of the Sabbath as the Sadducees claimed. The interpretation of the Sadducees would cause Shavuoth to occur on a Sunday always. Similarly they explained the Biblical injunction that a man must marry the childless widow of his brother to be operative only if the woman had no children at all despite the text of the Bible which reads &#x201C;if he has no son&#x201D;. These two interpretations must have been accepted long before the compilation of the Mishna because the Septuaginta, the Greek translation of the Torah, rendered these verses in accordance with the Mishnaic explanation.</p>
<p>After the destruction of the temple this method of exposition gained in popularity and every word was minutely analyzed. The seven rules of interpretation which Hillel the Old set up increased in time to thirteen (formulated by Rabbi Ishmael) and later they were expanded by Rabbi Jose of Galilee to 32. Rabbi Akiba attached significance to every word and letter in the Bible. A contributing factor which influenced this form of reasoning was the fact that the text of the Bible was then written without vowel signs. Although everyone knew the traditionally correct reading of the text tradition was frequently overlooked and the ambiguity which the lack of vowel signs caused gave ground to interpretations contrary to the spirit of the text.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Jehudah began to compile the Mishna, two generations had passed since the first tractate &#x201C;Eduyoth&#x201D; was composed. In the intervening time many laws developed along new lines due to historical developments which could not have been foreseen. Rabbi Jehudah carefully weighed all the pros and cons concerning all laws before he determined their final form. Although he used the Mishna of Rabbi Akiba extensively he did not include all the laws listed in it because his decisions were based on the opinions of the majority of his contemporary scholars. He also changed the order of Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s Mishnayoth which arranged the laws according to their authors and not according to subject matter.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah arranged the Mishna according to subject groups. The first group dealt with prayers and benedictions; the second dealt with the laws of cultivation of the soil and the attendant regulations; the third dealt with the regulations governing the observance of the Sabbath and the holidays, fast days and other historical memorial days; the fourth group included laws pertaining to family life, vows and Nazarites; the fifth dealt with money matters, the Sanhedrin and relations between man and the community; the sixth included the laws of the sacrifices and the regulations of cleanliness. But Rabbi Jehudah was not altogether successful in classifying the material as he wished. The great volume of subject matter at hand could not easily be made to conform with rigid classifications and we thus find problems of money matters among the laws of marriage or the regulations of the holidays; dietary laws are frequently found among regulations pertaining to the offering of sacrifices.</p>
<p>Historians differ as to the motives which prompted Rabbi Jehudah to compile the Mishna. Some maintain that he undertook the work in order to preserve the traditions from being lost. Others claim that his primary motive was to define the laws once and for all and to remove any possible ambiguities. Such conflicting opinions as are found in the Mishna or cases where the final decision concerning a law was not laid down these historians explain as being additions of a later day.</p>
<p>The Halacha, which constitutes the greater part of the Mishna, is accompanied by all the arguments which were advanced concerning the law as well as by the fundamental cause which brought about the enactment of the law, which was often derived from scriptural text which had no direct bearing on that law. In explanation of this view the Talmud states that Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai studied the disputes of Abayei and Rava <sup><xref rid="fn683">60)</xref></sup> implying that he foresaw the possible future argumentation of these two scholars. Since Rabbi Jochanan lived nearly two hundred years before Abayei and Rava no other view may be taken of this statement.</p>
<p>The second important component of the Mishna is the Drasha (exposition) which consists of interpretations of words to substantiate the opinions of the Tana. These Drashoth (pl. of Drasha) are generally preceded by the words &#x201C;I am instructed to say&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05D3; &#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;</span>) or &#x201C;it is intended to teach you&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D3;&#x05DA;</span>). It is noteworthy, however, that in some cases the law is stated at once in its final form while at other times all the interpretations of the words and even of the letters are quoted.</p>
<p>The Mishna was written in Hebrew which was slightly modified from the language of the Bible. Because of the practical problems with which it concerned itself it had to depart from the poetic idiom of the Scriptures and in order to express the numerous new concepts words had to be borrowed from the languages which were then currently spoken in Palestine such as Chaldean, Aramaeic, Greek and Latin. The foreign words that were introduced into the Mishna were modified to conform to the spirit and the grammar of the Hebrew language. The same words were not always used to define one concept because the editor of the Mishna sought to retain the original idiom of the Tana who expounded the law and these employed the idioms that were current in their time. The style of the Mishna illustrates Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s keen sense for the Hebrew language. In his own household Hebrew was spoken exclusively and to determine the correct spoken form of some Hebrew word many went to hear the servant of Rabbi Jehudah speak. The Hebrew language was still the spoken tongue of the majority of the Jews and it was flexible enough to express the finest abstract concepts.</p>
<p>It is impossible to point out those Halachoth in the Mishna which were quoted from the original statements and those which Rabbi Jehudah phrased in his own words. Only a skilled philologist could recognize the stylistic nuances between the original statements and those which were rephrased. The beginning of every book of the Mishna quotes the most important laws of the group dealt with. It is therefore assumed that these are quotations from earlier Tanaim and are given in their original wording with the name of the Tana omitted. This is also the case when the authorship of the Tana was acknowledged. However there are statements in the Mishna that are ascribed to certain Tanaim which are recognizable as not being direct quotations. In such cases Rabbi Jehudah was probably more interested in the essence of the opinion rather than in its exact wording.</p>
<p>There are indications that the text of the Mishna underwent modification during the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah. Some of these were probably made by Rabbi Jehudah himself. This may account for the different version of the Mishna which sometimes occurs in the Jerusalem Talmud. Others claim that the text of the Mishna as it is quoted in the Babylonian Talmud is its final form and it was brought to Babylonia by Rav (Aba Arecha) after Rabbi Jehudah introduced improvements. We may also be justified in assuming that certain changes were introduced into the Mishna after the death of Rabbi Jehudah. As a result of these changes a number of corrections were made by various scholars who understood that it was impossible to preserve the original text of the Mishna without variations. The tendency to change the text is evidenced by the warning of Rabbi Jochanan (the editor of the Jerusalem Talmud) who said: &#x201C;No one may add to the language which the early ones used.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn684">61)</xref></sup> Other scholars warned against confusing the names of the Tanaim and ascribing a saying of one Tana to another. Such errors, they said, amounted to committing the sin of &#x201C;changing eternal boundaries.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn685">62)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following story is characteristic of the attitude toward changing the text of the Mishna. Levi ben Sisi once asked Rabbi Jehudah to improve a certain sentence in the Mishna and Rabbi Jehudah was angered with him for making such a request. Levi nevertheless changed the text as he saw fit. <sup><xref rid="fn686">63)</xref></sup> Others no doubt followed the example af Levi, for we frequently find in the Jerusalem Talmud the statement, &#x201C;we studied the Mishna in this form&#x201D; or &#x201C;there are those who study it otherwise&#x201D;. It is evident that in all these cases changes had been introduced.</p>
<p>This practice was later engaged in by the Amoraim when they found that the Mishna conflicted with the views they were trying to prove, and the corrections remained permanent despite the accepted rule against introducing changes. This practice was more prevalent in Babylonia because &#x201C;pilpul&#x201D; was more popular in that country. Sometimes these changes were not incorporated into the body of the Mishna and we thus find the Jerusalem Talmud use the phrase: &#x201C;The Mishna should have read otherwise&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Taking all these into consideration we may conclude that the text of the Mishna often caused misunderstandings among the scholars who failed to comprehend the original meaning. The introduction of changes continued for a long time until the Talmud was ready to be compiled. Conflicting versions became popular and Rabbi Zeira (a pupil of Rabbi Jochanan) complained that indifference was shown to the original text of Rabbi Jehudah. <sup><xref rid="fn687">64)</xref></sup> In addition the Talmud declares that some sentences in the Mishna were not inserted by Rabbi Jehudah. <sup><xref rid="fn688">65)</xref></sup></p>

<title>CONTEMPORARIES OF RABBI JEHUDA haNasi</title>
<h1><bold>Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia</bold></h1>
<p>There was an entire group of scholars who lived and exerted an influence during the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah but who conducted independent academies and frequently even opposed Rabbi Jehudah. This group marked the transition from the Tanaim who lived after the completion of the Mishna to the Amoraim, who were the authors of the Gemara.</p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia belonged to this group of transition scholars. He was a member of a society of pious men who were called &#x201C;The Holy Congregation&#x201D; because of their habit of dividing the day into three parts one of which they devoted to learning, the second to prayer and the third to work. Other members of this society divided the year into two parts; the winter they devoted to study and the summer to labor in their trades. It was this group that Rabbi Jehudah had in mind when he declared that &#x201C;man should gain the knowledge of an occupation as well as knowledge of the Torah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn689">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon was a disciple of Rabbi Meir and he always quoted his master in legal matters. <sup><xref rid="fn690">2)</xref></sup> Some of his references to Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai indicate that he had studied with him also. <sup><xref rid="fn691">3)</xref></sup> Rabbi Menasia was diligent in spreading the praise of Rabbi Jehudah despite the fact that he at times disagreed with his opinions. <sup><xref rid="fn692">4)</xref></sup> He listed seven virtues which every pious man must possess and he immediately added that Rabbi Jehudah and his family combined all of these in their personalities. <sup><xref rid="fn693">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simon b. Menaisa&#x2019;s sense of justice is expressed in his dictum concerning the proper conduct of a judge during trial. He declared that a judge must endeavor to conciliate the contending parties before he has heard their grievances or before he had made up his mind which of them had justice on his side. But after he had heard their arguments and had decided which of them was right and which was wrong he no longer had the right to attempt conciliation and had to pass sentence. <sup><xref rid="fn694">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concerning the Sabbath Rabbi Simeon b. Menasia said that the Biblical verse &#x201C;Behold I have given you the Sabbath&#x201D; indicates that the people have the right to regulate the Sabbath more than the Sabbath should regulate their lives. He therefore concluded that it was permissible to desecrate the Sabbath once to save a human life in order that the person might live to observe many Sabbaths in the future. <sup><xref rid="fn695">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A fantastic remark of Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia concerning the punishment of the original sin was interpreted by some as ridiculing those scholars who believed that God sent angels to cut off the feet of the snake after Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Rabbi Simeon b. Menasia said: &#x201C;It is rgerettable that we have lost an excellent servant in the snake. Had Eve not been led to sin the snake would not have been cursed and every Jew could keep two snakes in his house one of which he could sent to the East and the other to the West. The snake could then have brought him diamonds and other wealth from the ends of the earth and none could have harmed him. Snakes could also have been used for all kinds of labor instead of camels and asses; in addition snakes could have carried the fertilizer into the gardens.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn696">8)</xref></sup></p>
<h1><bold>Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair</bold></h1>
<p>Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair was another contemporary of Rabbi Jehudah. According to the Talmud he was the son-in-law of Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai; but according to the Zohar, he was his father-in-law. In mental brilliance Rabbi Pinchas was the equal of Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai and it was said that whenever Rabbi Simeon asked a question during their studies Rabbi Pinchas immediately had twelve answers; when Rabbi Pinchas asked some question Rabbi Simeon at once answered it in twenty-four different ways. <sup><xref rid="fn697">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>But Rabbi Pinchas gained his reputation not because of his scholastic attainments but because of his piety concerning which many wonderful stories were related. The Talmud therefore contains no legal opinions of Rabbi Pinchas but much was told of his painstaking care in observing the commandment of offering tithes to such an extent that even his ass would not eat grain which had not been tithed. Although he declared that the city of Ashkelon was not included in the boundaries of Palestine and should therefore have been considered free from the commandment of offering tithes, he nevertheless insisted that Jews who lived in that city must abide by this commandment. <sup><xref rid="fn698">10)</xref></sup> His belief in the significance of this commandment was so great that he ascribed all punishment which was visited on people as being caused by avoiding the offering of tithes.</p>
<p>It is thus related that he once came to a city where the people complained of a plague of mice which were eating up the harvest. Rabbi Pinchas warned them against shirking the offering of tithes and when the inhabitants of that city began to pay closer attention to the fulfillment of this commandment they were rid of the mice. Another time some people came to him and complained that the city well did not yield enough water. Rabbi Pinchas said: &#x201C;This is certainly a punishment for your disregarding the tithes.&#x201D; The people vowed to change their ways and the well began to yield sufficient water for all their needs. <sup><xref rid="fn699">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Pinchas&#x2019; ass was said to be able to discern which grain had been tithed and which had not. When it was stolen, it refused to eat for three days. The thieves realized that it would starve to death and they released it, whereupon it returned to its master. Rabbi Pinchas was glad to get his animal back and he commanded that it be fed at once, but when some barley was offered to it the ass recognized that the barley had not been tithed and refused to eat. Rabbi Pinchas&#x2019; pupils then said to him: &#x201C;Did you not teach us that in doubtful cases it is unnecessary to offer tithes from grain which is to be fed to animals?&#x201D; and Rabbi Pinchas answered: &#x201C;What can you do to this animal which insists on the strict observance of the law?&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn700">12)</xref></sup> <xref rid="fn701">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Rabbi Pinchas listed a number of human virtues, each of which grows out of the preceding one and leads ever higher to the final stage of perfection. Observance leads to modesty, modesty leads to fear of God, fear of God leads to piety, piety leads to the holy spirit and the holy spirit leads to resurrection. <sup><xref rid="fn702">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another time Rabbi Pinchas complained about the low moral state of the Jewish people and he declared that since the destruction of the temple scholars are shamed and decent people go about with bowed heads; the desire to do good deeds is weakened and men of strong arms and arrogant tongues have gained the upper hand. Nevertheless no one wishes for anything, for all things have lost their worth and any man who is dissatisfied may only look to God. <sup><xref rid="fn703">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Talmud relates that on one of his journeys to redeem captives Rabbi Pinchas came to a river named Ginai and he could not cross it because there was no bridge nor boat at hand. He then addressed the river: &#x201C;Make way that I may cross&#x0021;&#x201D;, but the river answered: &#x201C;You are about to do the will of the Creator and I always do His will, but you are not certain whether your journey will be successful while my path has been laid out by God. I therefore need not change my course.&#x201D; Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair commanded: &#x201C;If you will not make way for me I will decree that your sources be dried.&#x201D; Upon hearing this threat the river was frightened and at once made a path for Rabbi Pinchas.</p>
<p>Then there came a man who carried a sack of Passover wheat on his back. Rabbi Pinchas commanded the river to let this man also pass because he was on his way to fulfill a commandment. This time the river parted its waters at once. Meanwhile there came a wanderer who joined the other two and Rabbi Pinchas again asked the river to let the wanderer pass so that it might not be said that a companion of his was discriminated against and the river parted its waters for the third time. <sup><xref rid="fn704">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the disciples of Rabbi Pinchas heard of this occurrence they asked their master whether they would ever be able to perform the same miracle and he replied: &#x201C;If you will feel certain that you never harmed a Jew nor shamed any person you will be able to perform the same.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn705">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is further related that Rabbi Pinchas never ate at a stranger&#x2019;s table and that after he grew of age he did not even eat at his father&#x2019;s table. When Rabbi Jehudah once heard that he had arrived in the city he invited him to dine with him and Rabbi Pinchas accepted the invitation. Rabbi Jehudah was overjoyed at this and openly showed his gladness. Seeing Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s joyful expression Rabbi Pinchas said: &#x201C;You seem to think that I had vowed not to derive any benefit from Jews but the situation is entirely different. It is true that Jews are a holy people, but there are some who would gladly give you food but have none while others have enough but do not want to share it. I therefore decided never to take any food that was offered to me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Rabbi Pinchas reached the door of Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s house he saw there two white mules and he exclaimed: &#x201C;The angel of death is in this house, how can I eat here?&#x201D; (His reference to the mules as the angel of death is explained by the fact that the people of that time believed, that a blow of a white mule could never be healed.)</p>
<p>As Rabbi Jehudah heard the exclamation of Rabbi Pinchas, he came out of the house and said: &#x201C;If you are not satisfied that I keep white mules I will sell them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You must not do so,&#x201D; Rabbi Pinchas replied, &#x201C;for that would amount to putting a stone in the way of a blind man that he may stumble on it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then I will disclaim ownership of the animals so that anyone may take them, that you may come into my house,&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah continued.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You must not do so either because of the loss that you will suffer,&#x201D; Rabbi Pinchas responded.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In that case I will have their hooves removed that they may harm no one,&#x201D; Rabbi Jehudah urged.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If you do so you will commit the sin of causing suffering to an animal,&#x201D; Rabbi Pinchas objected.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then I will kill the mules that you may enter my house,&#x201D; Rabbi said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You must not do so either,&#x201D; Rabbi Pinchas said, &#x201C;for it is against the law to damage objects of value.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In the end Rabbi Pinchas did not enter the Nasi&#x2019;s house and since that time the two became estranged and never met again. <sup><xref rid="fn706">17)</xref></sup></p>
<h1><bold>Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar and Bar Kapara</bold></h1>
<p>The Tana Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar who was also a contemporary of Rabbi Jehudah was famous for his saying that &#x201C;envy, desire and ambition drive a man out of the world.&#x201D; He also declared that &#x201C;those that are born are destined to die, the dead are destined to rebirth, the reborn are to be judged; to know, to make known and to be aware that God is the Creator, the Discerner, the judge and the witness, the plaintiff and the highest authority at the trial. In His presence there is neither injustice nor forgetfulness, nor respect of persons nor taking of bribes. All is according to reckoning. Let not your nature persuade you that the grave will be a refuge, for against your will you were created and against your will you were born, against your will you live and against your will you must die and give account and reckoning before the King of Kings.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn707">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his warning against pride Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar said: &#x201C;You must not strive to be like the highest stair but rather like a doorstep upon which everyone treads, for when the house is being destroyed the doorstep remains in place to the very end.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn708">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like other contemporaries of Rabbi Jehudah whose names did not appear in the Mishna despite the fact that they were considered to be authorities in legal questions, Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar also figures in the Boraitha only. <sup><xref rid="fn709">20)</xref></sup> There are grounds to believe that Rabbi Eleazar&#x2019;s father was also a learned man, for we find Rabbi Eleazar referred to as Rabbi Eleazar ben Rabbi and Rashi interprets this to indicate that his father was held to be a great man. Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar had a son named Eliezer. Historians are confused concerning the identity of this son; some say he was the well-known Bar Kapara while others maintain that these two are names of the same person. We thus find some statements in the Talmud attributed sometime to one and on other occasions to the other. This confusion of names is ascribed by some Talmudists to the editors of the Talmud.</p>
<p>We find a clear indication of the economic conditions of that time in Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar&#x2019;s statement that &#x201C;a man must constantly pray to God to preserve him from poverty.&#x201D; Rabbi Eleazar was convinced that poverty was bound to affect every family and that if one was spared the anguish of poverty his sons or grandsons were sure to be affected by it. <sup><xref rid="fn710">21)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of the great development of Jewish religious life in Babylonia there were many scholars who feared that in time that country would become a serious competitor to Palestine similar to the case of Alexandria generations earlier. Rabbi Eleazar therefore declared that &#x201C;all the synagogues and academies of Babylonia will in the end. be transported to Palestine.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn711">22)</xref></sup> Like his contemporaries he also valued peace because &#x201C;all the benedictions of the Shmone Esrei end with the blessing of peace.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn712">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>During a discussion concerning these virtues of the Jews which gained for them their redemption from Egypt, Rabbi Eleazar declared that this was due to the fact that &#x201C;they avoided immorality and slander and did not change their language.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn713">24)</xref></sup> This statement was a sharp protest against the conduct of many Jews of that time who reported one another to the authorities and who abandoned the Hebrew language in favor of Greek.</p>
<p><img src="images/3star.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>Bar Kapara was a contemporary of Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar. Despite the contention of some Talmudic critics that both Rabbi Eleazar and Bar Kapara are the same person we can not assume this point of view because we find in the Talmud a dispute between these two concerning the regulations of slaughtering fowl. Rabbi Eleazar declared that the regulations governing slaughter were introduced by the Rabbis while Bar Kapara maintained that they were a commandment of the Torah. <sup><xref rid="fn714">25)</xref></sup> The true name of Bar Kapara has not been definitely established. &#x201C;Yochasin&#x201D; calls him Simeon, &#x201C;Aruch&#x201D; refers to him as Eleazar and the Midrash mentions his name as Aba. <sup><xref rid="fn715">26)</xref></sup> Others explain this ambiguity as due to the fact that he was named after his father who died before the son was born.</p>
<p>Bar Kapara compiled a collection of laws, but these did not become as popular as the Mishnaioth of Rabbi Jehudah and many of them were lost in time. Of the remainder only a few were included in the Talmud as Boraithas and these were always introduced by the words &#x201C;Bar Kapara taught.&#x201D; But it must be borne in mind that Bar Kapara&#x2019;s opinions were highly respected among the students of the academies and they were called the Mishna of Bar Kapara. <sup><xref rid="fn716">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aside from his prominence in Halacha Bar Kapara was famous for his expositions and his clever interpretations and deductions from Biblical passages were repeated in the academies of Palestine and Babylonia. The following are some examples of his aphorisms and treatment of Biblical texts:</p>
<p>In Isaiah (9:6) we find an exceptional case where a final &#x201C;mem&#x201D; is used in the middle of a word. What could we conclude from this? God had decided to make king Hezekiah the Messiah and to transform the wars of Sanherib into the wars of Gog and Magog. The &#x201C;Midath Hadin&#x201D; (emanation of justice) thereupon said to Him: &#x201C;Creator of the world&#x0021; Why would you do so? King David sang your praise and You did not make him Messiah. You have already performed many miracles for Hezekiah, You saved him from Sanherib and You healed him of his sickness. Why should You give him this additional honor?&#x201D; God&#x2019;s will was thus frustrated. The earth then said to God: &#x201C;I will sing your praise instead of Hezekiah but appoint him Your Messiah,&#x201D; but this was not accepted. The angel in charge of the whole world (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05E8; &#x05D4;&#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05DD;</span>) then proclaimed: &#x201C;Creator of the world&#x0021; Do as you see fit,&#x201D; and a Bath Kol announced: &#x201C;This is my secret&#x0021; This is my secret&#x0021;&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn717">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In one of his lectures he hinted that man must always be ready to give account of his deeds in the following manner: &#x201C;A woman whose husband went on frequent journeys always adorned herself in her best garments. Seeing this her neighbors said to her: &#x2018;Your husband is not at home, why do you adorn yourself?&#x2019; and she replied: &#x2018;My husband is a sailor and as soon as he will earn something he will return home. It is therefore possible that he will arrive at any moment and it is best that he should find me adorned to meet him.&#x2019; &#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn718">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following are noteworthy among Bar Kapara&#x2019;s maxims:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Love peace and despise disputes. Beware of anger, for anger will lead you to sin.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn719">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;He who honors his neighbor because of his wealth will in the end part from him in shame, but he who shames his friend for the sake of the fulfillment of a commandment will in the end part from him in honor.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn720">31)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;The activities of just men are of more importance than the creation of the earth and sky.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn721">32)</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;An angry man possesses nothing except his anger.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn722">33)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many anecdotes were current in the academies of Palestine and Babylonia concerning the relations between Bar Kapara and the family of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah. We have previously related how Bar Kapara persuaded Ben Elasha, the wealthy but dull son-in-law of Rabbi Jehudah, to propose a riddle, to the guests assembled at a feast, which criticised the conduct of Nasi. It was also related that every time that Rabbi Jehudah laughed some punishment was visited upon the world. But since Rabbi was frequently laughing at the witticisms of Bar Kapara he one day offered Bar Kapara forty measures of wheat if he would remain serious on that day. Bar Kapara thereupon brought a great basket smeared with tar and turning it upside down he asked Rabbi to fill it with grain. Another time Bar Kapara made a bet with Rabbi&#x2019;s daughter that he would succeed in causing her father to sing and her mother to dance for him. The following day he attained his aim by a clever stratagem. Ben Elasha, who was present, resented the fact that his father-in-law did everything that Bar Kapara wanted him to do and together with his wife he left the house in displeasure. <sup><xref rid="fn723">34)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the fact that he was not ordained, Bar Kapara was the teacher of nearly all the members of the first generation of Amoraim. Of Bar Kapara&#x2019;s private life we only know that he was poor and that he gained his livelihood from manual labor. There exist vague hints that he was occupied in some work on a small rocky island in the sea.</p>
<p>It is told that Bar Kapara once had a dream which he told to Rabbi Jehudah and asked him to interpret it. In his dream he saw his nose fall off his face. Rabbi Jehudah declared that it was a sign that God had been angry with him but that now the anger had passed. Another time he dreamed that his hands were cut off and Rabbi Jehudah explained it as a sign that he would no longer have to work with hands for his sustenance. <sup><xref rid="fn724">35)</xref></sup></p>
<p>A legend relates that Bar Kapara once saw a ship sink and only one of its passengers was saved from drowning. He pitied the man and took him into his house where he gave him food and some money. Years later some Jews were taken captive and Bar Kapara was sent to ransom them with the sum of 500 ducats. When Bar Kapara arrived at the palace he found the man whom he had saved and he discovered that this man was a high official of the government.</p>
<p>When the man saw Bar Kapara he ran to greet him and asked him what his mission was. Bar Kapara told him that he had come to ransom the captive Jews and he showed him the money that he had brought, but the man said to him: &#x201C;You may keep this money instead of the five Shekolim which you gave me and because you gave me food and drink I will free your brothers without ransom.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn725">36)</xref></sup> <xref rid="fn726">&#x002A;)</xref></p>
<p>Since that time Bar Kapara&#x2019;s situation improved and he could easily provide for his household as well as feed a number of students at his table. <sup><xref rid="fn727">37)</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Rabbi Chiya Rabah bar Aba</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HIYA BAR</small> A<small>BA THE FIRST,</small> usually referred to in the Talmud as Rabbi Chiya (without his patronymic) or Rabbi Chiya Rabah (the great), <sup><xref rid="fn728">1)</xref></sup> to distinguish him from Rabbi Chiya bar Aba the second who was an &#x201C;Amora,&#x201D; was a colleague and a pupil of Rabbi Jehudah and his influence was exerted after the Mishna had been completed preceding the beginning of the epoch of the Amoraim. Rabbi Chiya was born in a town near Sura in Babylonia about 190 years after the destruction of the temple. Some said that his family was descended from Shephatiah, the son of king David, <sup><xref rid="fn729">2)</xref></sup> while others traced its origin to Shimei, the brother of king David. A passage in the Talmud relates that Rabbi Jehudah wanted to marry his son to the daughter of Rabbi Chiya and just before the ceremony of the wedding the bride suddenly died. Rabbi Jehudah considered this to be a sign from heaven and he suspected some fault in Rabbi Chiya&#x2019;s family. The origins of the two families were investigated and it was discovered that Rabbi Jehudah was descended from Shephatiah ben Avital, while Rabbi Chiya was descended from Shimei, the brother of king David. <sup><xref rid="fn730">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Little is known of the youth of Rabbi Chiya, even as little is known of the other Babylonian scholars who lived in his time. It appears that the Jews of Babylonia maintained great academies, for when Rabbi Chiya arrived in Palestine together with his sons, they were already well versed in the Torah. Since they never visited Palestine previously they must have gained their knowledge in academies in Babylonia.</p>
<p>The statement of the Talmud that &#x201C;when the Torah was once forgotten Ezra came from Babylonia and renewed it then came Hillel the Babylonian and renewed it again,&#x201D; which is followed by &#x201C;when the Torah was again forgotten Rabbi Chiya came with his sons and they renewed and expanded it,&#x201D; therefore appears incomprehensible. <sup><xref rid="fn731">4)</xref></sup> When Rabbi Chiya arrived in Palestine, learning was at a high level of development. Rabbi Jehudah was &#x201C;Nasi&#x201D; and he had many disciples so that there could hardly be any talk of the Torah being forgotten. The family of the Nasi occupied the undisputed leadership of the people and even had learning been at a low ebb the Nasi would not have allowed a recent arrival from Babylonia to become the &#x201C;savior&#x201D; of the situation.</p>
<p>However, there is no doubt of the fact that Rabbi Chiya was an important figure in Jewish life. He often lectured at the door of the Nasi <sup><xref rid="fn732">5)</xref></sup> and when his colleagues spoke of him they referred to him as &#x201C;the lion of the company.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn733">6)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Characteristic of the determination not to allow learning to die down is the following statement of Rabbi Chiya who said: &#x201C;If the Torah were to be forgotten, I would take flax and weave nets with which I would capture deer. The flesh of the deer I would give to the orphans and from the skins I would make parchment on which to write the Torah. Then I would go to cities where there are no teachers; I would have the five books of the Torah written down and I would teach them to the children; later I would teach them the six orders of the Mishna. All that I would do to prevent the Torah from being forgotten.&#x201D; When Rabbi Jehudah heard of this he said: &#x201C;See what great deeds Rabbi Chiya promises to perform.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn734">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Upon his arrival in Palestine Rabbi Chiya was received with love and honor by Rabbi Jehudah and he ate at his table. <sup><xref rid="fn735">8)</xref></sup> When he helped the Nasi with the formulation of a law, Rabbi Jehudah applied to him the verse of Isaiah (46:11) &#x201C;from a far land my counsellor has come.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn736">9)</xref></sup> The great respect in which Rabbi Jehudah held Rabbi Chiya was exhibited on numerous occasions; when they arrived at the academy, Rabbi Jehudah asked Rabbi Chiya to enter first <sup><xref rid="fn737">10)</xref></sup> and during a discussion of a question of cleanliness Rabbi Jehudah declared: &#x201C;Leave my words and listen to the words of Rabbi Chiya.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn738">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah always confided to Rabbi Chiya all his scholastic innovations and when he once forgot some of these during his sickness, Rabbi Chiya repeated them to him. Rabbi Jehudah then declared: &#x201C;You have again made me what I had been&#x0021;&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn739">12)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Outstanding among Rabbi Chiya&#x2019;s legal achievements are his formulations of the laws governing interests. <sup><xref rid="fn740">13)</xref></sup> He also made many innovations which he wrote down in a book, but these were not accepted by the people and they were named <span dir="rtl">&#x201E;&#x05DE;&#x05D2;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05EA; &#x05E1;&#x05EA;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;&#x05F4;</span> (the scroll of secrecy). <sup><xref rid="fn741">14)</xref></sup> Rabbi Chiya participated in the compilation of the &#x201C;Tosephta&#x201D; and together with his pupil Rabbi Oshaia he shared in gathering the &#x201C;Boraitha.&#x201D; It was an accepted rule at that time that any Boraitha which was not expounded by either Rabbi Chiya or Rabbi Oshaia is of doubtful authenticity. <sup><xref rid="fn742">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chiya frequently accompanied Rabbi Jehudah on the latter&#x2019;s travels in the fulfillment of his duties as Nasi or to the imperial court in the interests of the people. <sup><xref rid="fn743">16)</xref></sup> Whenever Rabbi Jehudah was displeased with him he merely remarked: &#x201C;I think that someone is calling you outside.&#x201D; Rabbi Chiya would then understand the hint and would remain away from the academy for thirty days. <sup><xref rid="fn744">17)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chiya resided in Tiberias most of the time and there he conducted an academy. Frequently he would be empowered by Rabbi Jehudah to determine the day of the new months and to establish leap years and he would then be sent to other communities to inform the inhabitants of these decisions. Rabbi Jehudah lived in Sephoris which was located in Galilee, but the law prescribed that the determination of a new month or a leap year had to be made in a city of Judea. <sup><xref rid="fn745">18)</xref></sup> A special court was therefore established in Ein Tuv and Rabbi Chiya went there to represent the Nasi at these functions. <sup><xref rid="fn746">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>To earn his livelihood Rabbi Chiya engaged in commerce and in partnership with Rabbi Simeon, the son of Rabbi Jehudah, he traded in silk which was then marketed in Tyre. <sup><xref rid="fn747">20)</xref></sup> Later he also traded in flax. <sup><xref rid="fn748">21)</xref></sup> He was successful in his commercial ventures and he had to entrust the conduct of some of his business to his nephew Rav (Aba Arecha). Rabbi Chiya was also considered to be an authority on coins. It is related that a woman once came to him and asked him concerning the value of a coin and he declared that it was genuine. The following day the woman brought the same coin and he said that it was false, but since he declared it to be genuine on the previous day he commanded Rav to exchange it for a good coin and to write down the loss as an unsuccessful transaction. <sup><xref rid="fn749">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite his success Rabbi Chiya never boasted of his wealth and when the poor came to his house he would say to his wife: &#x201C;Give them bread and in the future they may return it to your children.&#x201D; His wife objected by saying: &#x201C;You curse your own children,&#x201D; but Rabbi Chiya replied: &#x201C;I do not curse them but such is the changing fate of the world.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn750">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of Rabbi Chiya&#x2019;s family life it was related that his wife twice gave birth to twins and because her laboring pains were so great, she vowed never to bear children again. Dressed in different clothes and with her face covered by a veil to prevent her husband from recognizing her, she came to his academy and asked him whether a woman was legally compelled to bear children. Rabbi Chiya declared that she was not compelled to do so. The woman then drank a medicine which the women of that time used to avoid bearing children. <sup><xref rid="fn751">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chiya was devoted to the Torah and at prayer he would repeat a special prayer of his own asking God to make the Torah his life work and to preserve him from an ailing heart and from failing vision. <sup><xref rid="fn752">25)</xref></sup> When he was asked what was the aim of woman in life if she was not obliged to engage in study, he replied that &#x201C;women should bring their children to the academy and they must also accompany their husbands to the synagogue and wait there until they will come out after prayer.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn753">26)</xref></sup></p>
<p>To avoid seeing others put to shame Rabbi Chiya sometimes sacrificed his own dignity. It once occurred that while he was lecturing at the academy, Rabbi Jehudah noticed the odor of garlic. Being in an angry mood that day Rabbi Jehudah exclaimed: &#x201C;Whoever had eaten garlic should leave the academy.&#x201D; Rabbi Chiya was the first to rise and leave the building. The others saw him leave and knowing that he could not have been guilty of the offense they all followed his example and went out in order not to put the offender to shame. <sup><xref rid="fn754">27)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Much was spoken of Rabbi Chiya&#x2019;s saintliness and it was said that since his arrival in Palestine storms no longer occurred and the wine never turned sour. <sup><xref rid="fn755">28)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another legend related that the prophet Elijah appeared to Rabbi Jehudah and informed him that in the eyes of God Rabbi Chiya and his sons had the same merit as the Patriarchs and that all their prayers would be answered. It then occurred that no rain fell for a long time. Rabbi Jehudah declared a fast and he ordered Rabbi Chiya to pray before the pulpit. As soon as Rabbi Chiya reached the words &#x201C;He causes the winds to blow&#x201D; a strong wind arose and when he pronounced the words &#x201C;He causes the rain to fall&#x201D; rain began to descend. When Rabbi Chiya reached the words &#x201C;He causes the dead to come to life&#x201D; everyone in heaven was disturbed, for it seemed that the hour of resurrection was at hand and it was asked in heaven who had revealed the secret to the people. When it became known that Elijah had revealed the secret, he was punished with sixty fiery lashes. Elijah then descended to earth in the guise of a fiery bear and scattered the congregation from the synagogue. <sup><xref rid="fn756">29)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Legend further relates that when Rabbi Chiya was about to die, the angel of death was afraid to touch him. He therefore assumed the guise of a poor man and knocked on the door. Rabbi Chiya heard this and said to the members of his household: &#x201C;There is a poor man at the door. Give him some bread.&#x201D; The angel of death appealed to Rabbi Chiya and said: &#x201C;I have heard you pity a poor man and order that he be given bread. Why then do you also not have pity on me? You know that I was sent to take your soul. Give it to me that I should not have to come here again.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn757">30)</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rabbi Chiya died&#x2014;the Talmud continues&#x2014;fiery stones fell from heaven. <sup><xref rid="fn758">31)</xref></sup></p>

<title>RABBI SIMEON ben CHALAFTA</title>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> S<small>IMEON BEN</small> C<small>HALAFTA</small> was one of the outstanding colleagues of Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi during the latter&#x2019;s old age. He was a member of a family of scholars and the Talmud referred to his father as Be Rabbi (the son of a rabbi) which indicates that at least three generations had been ordained. The family of Rabbi Simeon was a loyal adherent of the dynasty of the Nasi for many generations. Rabbi Chalafta (sometimes called Chalfuta, Chulafta and Tachlifa) was a son of Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta who prided himself that he had planted five cedar trees in Israel, referring to his five sons of whom Chalafta was one. <sup><xref rid="fn759">1)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon ben Chalafta was one of the last disciples of Rabbi Meir. Later he attended the academy of Rabbi Jehudah and he was befriended by the Nasi because of the loyalty of his family to the holders of that office. Rabbi Simeon lived in the town of Ein T&#x2019;enah which was located between Sephoris and Tiberias. Once a month he regularly visited Rabbi Jehudah when the latter lived in Sephoris and also after he moved to Tiberias. As Rabbi Simeon left the house of the Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah once sent his son to follow him and to obtain his blessing. Rabbi Simeon blessed him in the following words: &#x201C;May God grant that you should never put others to shame nor be put to shame yourself.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn760">2)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Rabbi Simeon grew older it became more difficult for him to make the trip and he finally gave up his visits to the house of the Nasi. When Rabbi Jehudah asked him: &#x201C;What is the cause of your absence that I cannot greet you any more as my fathers used to greet your fathers?&#x201D; Rabbi Simeon replied: &#x201C;The stones on my way have become larger and I can no longer step over them. Things nearby appear to be far and I cannot see them; that which is distant must now appear to be near that I may hear it and in addition to my two feet I need a third one to lean on.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn761">3)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon maintained a close friendship with Rabbi Chiya bar Aba and with Rabbi Simeon, the son of the Nasi. It is related that all three of them once were in doubt concerning the meaning of some Hebrew words, but passing by an Arab merchant they discovered the meaning of the words from his conversation. <sup><xref rid="fn762">4)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Mishna quotes Rabbi Simeon only once to the effect that &#x201C;God has no better medium for blessing than peace.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn763">5)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The friendly relations between Rabbi Simeon and Rabbi Chiya were quite understandable. They were both students in the academy of the Nasi and when Rabbi Chiya was informed of the poverty of Rabbi Simeon he leased to him one of his fields from which Rabbi Simeon later derived a comfortable income. Before he leased the field Rabbi Simeon was in great need and his situation was aggravated by the fact that he refused all aid. It was said that out of great pity, Rabbi Jehudah would place small heaps of grain on the street; since these no longer belonged to anyone Rabbi Simeon would gather them. <sup><xref rid="fn764">6)</xref></sup> When on a certain Friday Rabbi Simeon found himself without a morsel of food in the house he went out of the city to pray that God may send him aid. He was then handed a diamond from heaven and this he pawned and obtained enough money to provide for the Sabbath, but his wife refused to partake of the food until he promised to return the diamond immediately after the Sabbath. <sup><xref rid="fn765">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another Midrash relates this story in a somewhat different version. Rabbi Simeon ben Chalafta and Rabbi Chiya are said to have been in the academy of Tiberias on the eve of a holiday. As they were engaged in study they suddenly became aware of a great commotion in the street and Rabbi Simeon asked what was the cause of it. Rabbi Chiya replied: &#x201C;Those who have money now go to buy the things they need for the holiday; those who have none go to their employers to obtain the necessary money,&#x201D; Rabbi Simeon then said: &#x201C;I will also go to my employer to ask for money for the holiday.&#x201D; By this he meant that he would pray to God whom he always served.</p>
<p>He left the academy and proceeded to the caves outside the city where he prayed to God. Suddenly a hand appeared and handed him a pearl. Rabbi Simeon took the pearl to Rabbi Jehudah who advised that he should not sell it until he ascertained its worth. Meanwhile Rabbi Jehudah gave him three ducats with which to purchase his holiday needs.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Simeon came home with his purchase his wife asked him: &#x201C;Where did you get the money? Did you not steal it?&#x201D; and he related to her what had happened. Rabbi Simeon&#x2019;s wife was displeased and said: &#x201C;Would you have a pearl missing from your crown in the world to come?&#x201D; Rabbi Simeon asked her what he should do and she advised him to return the purchased articles and with the money to redeem the pearl and to return it to heaven. <sup><xref rid="fn766">8)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another story is told of Rabbi Simeon ben Chalafta that on one of his journeys he came across two hungry lions. Rabbi Simeon was greatly frightened but before the lions attacked him he was handed from heaven two pieces of meat one of which he gave to the lions and the other he brought to the academy to ask the scholars whether it was clean and fit to eat. He was then informed that &#x201C;no unclean thing can come from heaven.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn767">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon&#x2019;s opinions are quoted in the Talmud and it was characteristic of his religious conception that he declared that children nine or ten years old should be commanded to fast on the Day of Atonement.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn768">10)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once Rabbi Simeon went with Rabbi Chiya in the valley of Arbel to watch the sunrise and to determine how long it takes from the first break of dawn until full day-light. On that occasion Rabbi Simeon said: &#x201C;See how slowly dawn turns into day. Equally slow is the coming of aid to Jews.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn769">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon declared that since flattery had become prevalent men follow devious ways and their activities have sunk to a low level and one may no longer boast to his friend that his actions are more important. <sup><xref rid="fn770">12)</xref></sup> Another time he said: &#x201C;The courageous usually triumphs over the modest.&#x201D; He came to this conclusion from the fact that God seemingly changed his mind and did not destroy the city of Nineveh as He announced through the prophet Jonah because &#x201C;he who is daring in his prayers can obtain his wishes even from God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn771">13)</xref></sup></p>
<p>He also said: &#x201C;One who has studied Torah but does not fulfill its commandments commits a greater sin than one who has never studied. It is as if one hires two watchmen for his garden, one of whom plants beautiful trees and later breaks them; the owner of the garden is angered with him more than he is angered with the watchman who planted nothing.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn772">14)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the stories that were told of Rabbi Simeon&#x2019;s poverty there were other legends current about wonderful events which happened to him. As he was once going to attend a circumcision dressed in his best garments he attracted the attention of the children of the street who surrounded him and would not let him pass until he danced before them. Rabbi Simeon pleaded with them that he could not dance because of his great age and when they refused to leave him he scolded them and said that the gate of the house would collapse. He then sent them to call the owner of the house to come out at once. When the owner appeared, Rabbi Simeon warned him to remove all his possessions from the house and as soon as that was done the gate collapsed.</p>
<p>At the feast which followed the circumcision the father served valuable old wine and said: &#x201C;If I will live I will serve the same kind of wine at the wedding of my son,&#x201D; and Rabbi Simeon replied : &#x201C;Even as the child was today inducted into the covenant of Abraham he will grow to go to the canopy and we will both drink again.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On his way home Rabbi Simeon met the angel of death who addressed him in the following words: &#x201C;Just because you are a just man are you not afraid to go alone at night?&#x201D; When Rabbi Simeon asked the angel whither he was bound, the angel replied that he was going to take the soul of the child that had been circumcised that day. Rabbi Simeon scolded the angel of death for wishing to prove him a liar because he had promised to drink at the boy&#x2019;s wedding and with these words he annuled the decree of death against the child. <sup><xref rid="fn773">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon ben Chalafta also devoted himself to the natural sciences and he cured a bird whose back was paralyzed. When one of his hens lost all her feathers he warmed the bird in an oven and covered it with a cloth and thus caused its feathers to grow again. <sup><xref rid="fn774">16)</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also related that Rabbi Simeon had a garden in which there was a hollow stump of a tree where a bird made its nest. Rabbi Simeon destroyed the nest but the bird repaired it again, and when he boarded up the hollow, the bird brought some herbs which it placed on the nails in the board and the nails were corroded. Rabbi Simeon then cursed the herb that it may grow no more for fear that thieves may discover it and use it to break locks. <sup><xref rid="fn775">17)</xref></sup></p>

<title>LEVI ben SISI</title>
<p>L<small>EVI BEN</small> S<small>ISI</small> was the most prominent of Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s last disciples. He is usually referred to without his patronymic and although he was often called a &#x201C;Great Man,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn776">1)</xref></sup> it appears that he was not ordained, for we find no instance in the Babylonian Talmud where he is referred to as Rabbi. This title was attached to his name in the Jerusalem Talmud and in the Midrashim. <sup><xref rid="fn777">2)</xref></sup> It is difficult to understand why Levi had not been ordained because he conducted his own academy and his legal opinions were quoted by many scholars of that time such as Rav (Aba Arecha), Shmuel Yarchinai, Rabbi Jochanan and Resh Lakish. This question becomes even more perplexing when one considers that his father was ordained and that no cause is mentioned for his lack of ordination.</p>
<p>Levi ben Sisi was born in Palestine about 160 years after the destruction of the temple. Some historians name the city of Lud as his birthplace. He was one of Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s brilliant pupils and he tutored Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s son Simeon. The relations between Levi and his pupil were not friendly and Simeon insisted on choosing his own subjects of study. <sup><xref rid="fn778">3)</xref></sup> These unfriendly relations probably continued until the death of Rabbi Jehudah. There are some indications that Levi was a candidate for the post of Chacham in the academy, but this office was bequeathed to Simeon in his father&#x2019;s will. <sup><xref rid="fn779">4)</xref></sup> For this reason, or because of his considerable wealth, to the administration of which he had to devote much time, Levi did not frequently attend the academy.</p>
<p>The attitude of Rabbi Jehudah toward Levi ben Sisi was not definite. When Rabbi Simeon ridiculed some question of Levi, Rabbi Jehudah declared that it was a wise question, <sup><xref rid="fn780">5)</xref></sup> and at one time he appointed Levi to an office in the academy. <sup><xref rid="fn781">6)</xref></sup> Another time Rabbi Jehudah was annoyed with Levi&#x2019;s questions and he exclaimed: &#x201C;It seems to me that this man has no brains in his head.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn782">7)</xref></sup></p>
<p>At Rabbi Simeon&#x2019;s wedding Levi was honored with reciting the benediction, <sup><xref rid="fn783">8)</xref></sup> and when representatives of Simunia, which was located in lower Galilee, came to Rabbi Jehudah and asked him to recommend someone who could fill the post of lecturer, judge, teacher and scribe, Rabbi Jehudah recommended Levi ben Sisi. The men of Simunia then seated Levi on a great platform and questioned him concerning the laws of &#x201C;Halitza&#x201D; and Levi could not answer their questions. Thinking that he was unacquainted with legal matters, they asked him the meaning of a verse of Daniel and he could not give that either. They then came to Rabbi Jehudah and said: &#x201C;Was it for such a man that we asked you?&#x201D; but Rabbi replied: &#x201C;I swear by my life that he is my equal in learning.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Later Rabbi sent for Levi and asked him the same questions which he answered correctly. &#x201C;Why did you not answer them before?&#x201D; Rabbi queried, and Levi replied: &#x201C;When they placed me on the platform I became confused and did not know what to say.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn784">9)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Levi ben Sisi also devoted himself to athletics and he could perform acrobatic tricks such as throwing eight knives simultaneously and catching them in his hand. He also performed other athletic feats despite the fact that he was lame. <sup><xref rid="fn785">10)</xref></sup> There is also evidence that he paid close attention to his appearance and that he painted his eyelids although he believed that the practice was dangerous and may cause death. <sup><xref rid="fn786">11)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like Rabbi Jehudah, Levi ben Sisi also compiled six &#x201C;orders&#x201D; of Mishnayoth which are mentioned in the Talmud under various names such as &#x201C;the books of Levi,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn787">12)</xref></sup> &#x201C;the holiness of the house of Levi,&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn788">13)</xref></sup> and &#x201C;the writings of Rabbi Levi. <sup><xref rid="fn789">14)</xref></sup> On other occasions opinions are introduced by the words &#x201C;Levi taught&#x201D; or &#x201C;Levi taught in the Mishna.&#x201D; Rashi likewise states that &#x201C;Levi compiled the &#x2018;Boraitha&#x2019; in six orders like Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Oshaiah.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn790">15)</xref></sup></p>
<p>As long as Rabbi Jehudah lived, Levi returned to Palestine after each trip abroad. <sup><xref rid="fn791">16)</xref></sup> Although he was not on friendly terms with the son of the Nasi, he frequently sent gifts to the house of the Nasi and once he sent wine made out of dates which was purified thirteen times. <sup><xref rid="fn792">17)</xref></sup> Only after the death of Rabbi Jehudah, when Levi remained without friends in Palestine, did he remember his comrades in Babylonia and he thought of finding a new field of work in that country. When Levi arrived in Nehardea he was received with open arms and he was assisted in founding an academy. <sup><xref rid="fn793">18)</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rumor rapidly spread that a &#x201C;great man&#x201D; had arrived and many people came from far and near to hear his lectures and to ask his opinion. Wonderful stories began to circulate about him. One of these related that when strange soldiers wanted to rob his city Levi took a book of the Torah and ascending the roof of the house he addressed God in the following words: &#x201C;Creator of the world&#x0021; If I have ever transgressed against one of your commandments let the enemy enter the city, but if I have not, then cause them to depart.&#x201D; The foreign soldiers immediately vanished from the city. <sup><xref rid="fn794">19)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Levi&#x2019;s lameness was explained to be the result of an acrobatic trick which he attempted to perform before Rabbi Jehudah. A more interesting explanation tells that it was a punishment for his arrogance against God. Once a severe drouth affected the land. A fast day was declared but still no rain fell. Levi is said to have made the following remark to God at that time: &#x201C;You sit on high and You have no mercy on Your children&#x0021;&#x201D; As soon as he finished this statement he became lame. <sup><xref rid="fn795">20)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his will Rabbi Jehudah commanded that his son Gamliel should succeed him to the office of Nasi, Simeon should be Chacham in the academy and Rabbi Chanina bar Chama should be head of the court in Sephoris. Rabbi Chanina refused to accept this post since Rabbi Ephes, the secretary of Rabbi Jehudah, was his senior by two years. Rabbi Ephes then became head of the court and Rabbi Chanina together with Levi were in the habit of sitting outside the academy. After the death of Rabbi Ephes, Rabbi Chanina assumed the post of head of the court and Levi remained alone. Levi also refused to recognize the authority of Rabbi Chanina because they were both of the same age and because he considered himself the equal of Rabbi Chanina in learning. It was at that time that Levi left Palestine and went to Nehardea.</p>
<p>In Nehardea he gained the friendship of Aba bar Aba, the father of Shmuel Yarchinai. Together they prayed and studied and, at the request of Aba, Levi examined his son Shmuel. <sup><xref rid="fn796">21)</xref></sup> After that, whenever Shmuel had any doubts he turned to Levi. <sup><xref rid="fn797">22)</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Nehardea Levi introduced new regulations. Thus he ruled that women may appear on the street on the Sabbath adorned in their jewelry. This regulation was accepted and the Talmud relates that twenty-four women appeared in their jewelry. <sup><xref rid="fn798">23)</xref></sup></p>
<p>Levi ben Sisi had ten scholarly sons whose names are listed in the Talmud. According to some authorities Rabbi Joshua ben Levi was also his son. When Levi died he was mourned by Aba bar Aba who pointed out the greatness of the generation of Rabbi Jehudah&#x2019;s contemporaries of whom Levi was the last one. In his eulogy Aba bar Aba said: &#x201C;The life of Levi ben Sisi may be compared to the story of a king who had a vineyard in which there were one hundred vines each of which yielded one hundred barrels of wine yearly. In time the vines dried up and with every passing year fewer remained until in the end there was no more than one vine left. The king loved this last vine as he once loved his whole vineyard. Even so was Levi ben Sisi beloved of God like an only remaining vine.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn799">24)</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the death of Levi ben Sisi the epoch of the &#x201C;Tanaim&#x201D; came to a close and the period of the &#x201C;Amoraim&#x201D; began.</p>
