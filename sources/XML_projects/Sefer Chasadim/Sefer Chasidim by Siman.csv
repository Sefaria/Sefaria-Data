"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 16",BOOK OF THE PIOUS
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 17","The rise of Hasidism in the life of German Jewry has long been regarded as one of the major events in the religious history of that community. For many scholars it is indeed the only decisive development of major consequence in the spiritual life of German Jewry.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Gershom Scholem, <i>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism</i> (New York: Schocken Books, 1946), p. 81.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 18","This particular religious growth which bears the name <i>Ha-Hasiduth Ha-Ashkenazith</i>, German Pietism, evolved under the impact of the crusades and their concomitant persecutions. In essence such newborn pietism represents a response to the methodical pattern of humiliation and degradation inflicted upon Jews during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; it is a heightened and more intense form of religio-moral idealism and saintliness. Destined to write a glorious chapter in Jewish history, it arose first in the Rhenish Jewish communities. Its representatives were referred to by their contemporaries as <i>Haside Ashkenaz</i>, The Devout of Germany."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 19","The creative period of the movement was relatively short, the century from about 1150 to 1250, but its influence on German Jewry was lasting. The religious concepts and ideas to which it gave rise and filled with meaning through their own practice and conduct retained their vitality for centuries.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> The protagonists of this heightened pietism were accepted and regarded as genuine representatives of an ideal Jewish way of life."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 20","While it is true that the movement itself never achieved the proportions or dimensions of a mass movement, the teachings and leadership did enjoy wide popularity, authority, and prestige. It must, of course, be recognized that the very nature of the calling with its demanding and exacting teachings made it a vocation for the few rather than for the multitude. Nevertheless, it did not preclude the community at large from aspiring to inclusion in its select ranks and being numbered among its devotees. The simple fact that this movement exerted such a powerful influence over a short period of time and a lasting influence over succeeding centuries demonstrates and reveals the deep roots it struck in the heart, life, and mind of German Jewry."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 21",<b>THE TIMES</b>
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 22","The settlement of Jews on German soil can be traced back to Roman times. A decree issued by the Emperor Constantine in 321 A.D. explicitly mentions Jews as Roman citizens in Cologne.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Adolf Kober, <i>Cologne</i> (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1940), p. 5.</i> In all probability Mayence and Treves also saw Jewish settlers in Roman times. The same may be assumed of other communities near the Rhine and Meuse, as well as for other sites along the Danube, for example, Augsburg, Regensburg and the region of Vienna.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Max Grunwald, <i>History of the Jews in Vienna</i> (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1936), p. 1. See also, Cecil Roth, “Economic Life and Population Movements,” <i>The World History of the Jewish People</i>, ed. Cecil Roth, XI (1966), 16: “Evidence shows the existence of a well organized Jewish community on the Rhineland in the early fourth century during the reign of Constantine.”</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 23","Even with the barbarian incursions and the gradual dissolution of Roman hegemony, Jews continued to live in the confines of the later Roman Empire until the time of Charlemagne. During his reign, Jews appear as immigrants following the commercial highways and the civilizing thrusts of cultural proliferation and development. The important trade routes stretching along the Rhine and the Moselle leading to the Danube and into eastern Europe received their share of Jewish merchants. Many settled permanently in these regions. With the emergence of the German cities in the tenth and eleventh centuries many Jews settled in urban centers. This in part was due to efforts made by the founders of these cities to attract Jews, such as, the favors granted them in the famous charter of Bishop Rudiger of Speyer in 1084.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ B. Blumenkranz, “Germany 843-1096,” <i>The World History of the Jewish People,</i> ed. Cecil Roth, XI (1966), 163. Also Grunwald, p. 41.</i> A large network of Jewish communities rose soon after to commercial importance and cultural reknown. Were it not for the havoc sown by the crusades, their achievement would have been even more significant and lasting."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 24","The crusades did much to disrupt, retard and destroy Jewish life in these communities, nevertheless, they endured. While the Jewish spirit was sorely tried and shaken by the destructive and wanton fury of the crusades, it remained unbroken. In many ways the year 1096, which ushered in the age of the crusades, marked a turning point in Jewish history. First, it brought home to the Jews and to their foes alike the utter instability of the Jewish position in the Western world. What had until now been sporadic outbreaks and incidents of a local nature, became concerted actions of widespread dimension. A mass psychosis, transcending national boundaries and directly sanctioning anti-Jewish persecution, blanketed a continent with its contagious appeal. Actually, the events of 1096, when seen in retrospect, appear as the culmination of anti-Jewish trends building up among the Western masses over several generations.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Salo W. Baron, <i>A Social and Religious History of the Jews</i> (8 Vols.; 2d ed. rev.; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1958) IV, 90.</i> Unfortunately, these nostile manifestations were so unrelated chronologically, causally and geographically, that their true portents could not be accurately evaluated even by the most cautious and astute leadership of the day. News of tragedy and terror within the Jewish community moved slowly. Communication with outlying Jewish communities was poor; outbreaks were soon forgotten, and in certain instances the causes were discounted, as largely accidental. This served to obscure the tragic fate in store for the Jews, a fate toward which all events were converging. The crusades not only exacted a toll in human life through massacre and rapine, but also left deep scars in Judeo-Christian relations by setting a very low evaluation on Jewish life and property. Count Emico, who murdered and plundered Jews in the Rhineland towns, was a representative of this new tradition. His actions signaled the beginning of an epoch of terrifying and fanatical brutality toward the Jew.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 132ff. One of the finest and most perceptive treatments of medieval millenary movements is Norman Cohn’s, <i>The Pursuit of the Millenium</i> (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1961).</i> Tragically, some of the most fruitfully rich and creative communities were among those singled out for destruction at the hands of the crusaders. The first and second crusades dealt crushing blows at Speyer, Mayence and Worms. The three crusades that took place within a century, 1096, 1144 and 1189, served another ignominious purpose. Generally, all three crusades conspired to underscore and reinforce the new pattern of degradation imposed upon the Jews. This new pattern manifested itself in economic, social and religious spheres."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 25","The Jew was forced into new avenues of economic activity. His opportunity within commerce became exceedingly limited. Agriculture was already closed to him. One could suggest quite correctly that this change in the economic activity of the Jew came about as a result of a new constellation of circumstances brought on in part by the crusades and the revival of commerce. Commercial traffic was reopened between East and West with dire consequences for Jewish interests. Italian merchant republics, especially Venice, Pisa and Genoa, were strengthened economically as a result of these crusades, and this helped greatly to push Jews out of commerce."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 26","By the end of the eleventh century one may say that the Mediterranean had been reconquered for Christian navigation and commerce between distant parts was entirely in the hands of Westerners. Thus the crusades completed the process of substituting Christian merchants for Jewish ones. This resulted from the fact that Christians had opened a route to the East.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Roth, XI, 36-37.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 27","Needless to say, the periodic crusading eruptions went far toward making it unsafe for Jewish merchants to travel the commercial highways. This contributed to the disruption and diminution of Jewish capital and enterprise. Guilds, operating as closed corporations, made artisan endeavor most difficult for the Jew. Thus, a majority of Jews derived their living from the few petty trades and artisan enterprises that remained open to them. Perhaps the most important economic activity they engaged in during this period was money-lending. In time, this would serve to strengthen the stereotype of the Jew as a commercial oppressor and exploiter of his fellow Christians.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ Solomon Grayzel, <i>The Church and the Jews in the Thirteenth Century</i> (ed. rev.; New York: Herman Press, 1966), p. 306: “Volentes igitur in hac parte prospicere Christianis ne a Judeis immaniter aggraventur …” (IV Lateran Council—1215).</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 28","During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Jew achieved a new status in the socio-economic context of the period. His condition was one of isolation and persecution, aptly characterized as the Age of Degradation. The most compelling factor driving the Jew towards ‟pariah marginality” was his utter exclusion from the great design of the <i>respublica Christiana</i>. In this new socio-religious integration, the Jew had no place.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ Sholom A. Singer, “The Expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290,” <i>Jewish Quarterly Review,</i> LV (October 1964), 117ff.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 29","These were not the only tensions, however, experienced by the Jew at this time. There was the presence and pressure of the Church, which intensified his alienation. The supremacy enjoyed by the Church during these centuries led to the characterization of this period as the Age of Papal-Caesarism. The term reflects the realities of the time, the dominance and incomparable prestige of the Catholic Church. It reached its zenith during the pontificate of Innocent III (1198-1216) and his successors, Honorious III, Gregory IX and Innocent IV (1243-1254)."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 30","Innocent III formulated the Church’s attitude and policy towards Jews. It was stern and oppressive. He urged Christian rulers to exercise their power so that, ‟Jews will not dare to raise their necks, bowed under the yoke of perpetual slavery, against the reverence of the Christian faith.”<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">/11/ Grayzel, p. 10.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 31",German-Jewish pietism emerged from this new configuration of historic forces and circumstances. Emphasis on greater piety and purity in the sight of God had to compensate the Jew for the loss of esteem in the eyes of fellow Christians. Heightened religious enthusiasm and total immersion into punctilious concern for ritual and cultic matters created a buffer for an oppressive and often unbearable reality.
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 32",<b>THE MAN</b>
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 33","Judah ben Samuel, the Pious of Regensburg (Ratisbon) who is regarded as one of the most prominent and influential of the <i>Haside Ashkenaz</i>, the Devout of Germany, was born in Speyer<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">/12/ Abraham Epstein, <i>Collected Writings</i> (2 Vols.; Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1950), I. 250, note 10. A complete discussion is presented by the author concerning Judah’s birthplace. The other ascribed birthplace, Worms, Epstein rejects. I. Elbogen, A. Freimann and R. Tykocinski in <i>Germania Judaica</i> (2d ed.; Breslau: Verlag M. and H. Marcus, 1934), p. 293, agree with Epstein in choosing Speyer as the birthplace.

Aptowitzer, <i>Introduction to Sefer Rabiah</i> (Jerusalem: Mekize Nirdamim, 1938), p. 348, note 20. The author presents convincing arguments in support of this rather than a later date. See also, J. Freimann in his introduction to <i>Sefer Hasidim,</i> Parma MS, Cod. de Rossi No. 1133, ed. Jacob Freimann and Jehuda Wistinetzki (2d ed.; Frankfort: M. A. Wahrmann Verlag, 1924), p. 14. Future reference to this will be designated as <i>S. H.</i>, Parma MS.</i> He died in Regensburg on February 22, 1217.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">/14/ Baron, VIII, 42 (<i>ca.</i>, 1140-1217); also Scholem, p. 82; Aptowitzer, p. 344; and Epstein, I, 150.</i> So long as Hasidism remained a living and vital force he held an almost unrivaled position of leadership. There can be no question that his own stature was enhanced by the fact that he was a descendant of one of the most illustrious families in Jewry, the Kalonymides. For many generations his family took a leading part in the development of Jewish learning in Germany.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">/15/ Isaac Broyde, “Kalonymus,” <i>Jewish Encyclopedia,</i> ed. Isidore Singer, VII (1904), 424a.</i> Although originally from Lucca, Italy, the family migrated to many different regions in Europe. A branch of the Kolonymides settled in Speyer, Mayence, and Worms."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 34","Judah the Pious’ grandfather, Kalonymus ben Isaac the Elder, already lived in Speyer during the eleventh and twelfth century and established a reputation as rabbi and halakhist. His son Samuel the Pious, the father of Judah, added further to the lustre of the family name through his writings, scholarship, and personal piety.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">/16/ Epstein, I, 251. The author provides a complete genealogical chart of Samuel’s forbears and descendants (Epstein, I, 248). This would have stabilized matters had it not been challenged by Aptowitzer, p. 348.</i> It is, however, unfortunate that most of his writings, which were considerable, have been lost."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 35","Samuel the Pious, his son Judah, and the latter’s disciple and relative Eleazar ben Judah of Worms may be regarded as the molders of German Hasidism.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">/17/ Scholem, p. 82.</i> The fact that scholarship still remains divided on the question of authorship for the opening sections of <i>Sefer Hasidim</i> between Judah, or his father Samuel, reveals the great similarity of ideology and teaching of these two men.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">/18/ Epstein, I, 260, ascribes the two chapters in <i>S.

H.</i>, Parma MS, p. 3, have a rather strenuous go at the difficult problem of identifying Samuel the Pious’ children. All three agree that he had two sons, one being Judah. They fail to agree on the identity of the other son. Aptowitzer further maintains that the person of Golda, usually described as Judah’s sister, is in fact Judah’s granddaughter.</i> who was head of an academy in Speyer, were apparently pupils of their father Samuel and received their early instruction from him.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">/20/ Epstein makes mention of the fact that the <i>Ma’aseh Book,</i> trans. Moses Gaster (2 Vols.; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1934), II, 326, records the name of Eleazer, supposedly a twin brother of Abraham. However he concludes quite plausibly and convincingly that the reference may be dismissed since it occurs just this one time and the source itself is not completely beyond question.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 36","Records indicate that Samuel the Pious was an outstanding Talmudic scholar for his time, in addition to being a pietist of distinction. He maintained an academy in Speyer, wrote commentaries and other works, and is quoted often by contemporary scholars.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">/21/ Epstein, I, 252.</i> As far as legend guides us, it seems that Abraham studied with his father Samuel in the conventional and customary setting of student-teacher relationship. Judah’s introduction to study was apparently delayed for many years because of his interest in more worldly matters. When he finally began to study, the moment of initiation reverberated with dramatic and prophetic effects,<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">/22/ <i>Ma’aseh Book</i>, II, 336.</i> pointing to the fact that Judah would soon overshadow his brother Abraham in mystical knowledge and achievement. After this, Judah applied himself diligently to study."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 37","Later, Judah went to Regensburg,<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">/23/ Aptowitzer, p. 346, challenges the date 1195 or 1196 as the time when Judah arrived in Regensburg. Contrary to Epstein and Freimann, he pushes it back prior to 1175.</i> established his dwelling there and was esteemed as one of the foremost scholars and teachers in that town. He wrote many mystical and ethical treatises, the best known being <i>Sefer Hasidim</i>.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">/24/ This point will be discussed at length in a special section.</i> He wrote a commentary on the Pentateuch and books on legalistic matters. Few of these have survived. He was the teacher of Rabbi Eleazar, author of the <i>Rokeah</i>, and his mentor in mysticism."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 38","Rabbi Isaac Or Zarua was another of Judah’s pupils. A correspondence was carried on between Rabbi Judah and many of the outstanding Franco-German scholars of the day. Rabbi Judah had three sons, Rabbi Samuel, Rabbi Zalman, and Rabbi Moses.<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">/25/ Here again the problem of identifying, let alone numbering, the descendants properly becomes quite difficult. A good deal of controversy among scholars persists. See Freimann’s remarks in his introduction to <i>S. H.</i>, Parma MS, pp. 2-3; Aptowitzer, p. 344; and Epstein, I, 248.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 39","Numerous and illustrious teachers contributed to the personality and development of Rabbi Judah the Pious. Aside from the instruction which Rabbi Judah received from his father in traditional matters, he received his mystical initiation from him as well.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">/26/ Freimann, <i>S. H.</i>, Parma MS, p. 2.</i> The meaning of the ‟Pyut” he learned from the martyred Rabbi Jom Tob the Holy.<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">/27/ <i>Ibid.</i> The identification of this individual is quite difficult.</i> He, in turn, influenced very many important rabbis, most especially Rabbi Eleazar b. Judah, called the ‟Rokeah,” Rabbi Baruch of Mayence, Rabbi Isaac Or Zarua. Judah the Pious was referred to by his contemporaries as the ‟Great Pietist,” ‟Father of Wisdom,” and the like."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 40","Legends about Judah abound but their reliability is doubtful.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">/28/ See <i>Ma’aseh Book</i> for much of the anecdotal material and legend on the life of Judah and many other notable rabbis.</i> However, through them all there shines the unquestionable impressiveness of his piety and holiness. Tradition states, ‟If he had lived in the time of the prophets he would surely have been a prophet, if during the time of the Tanaaim a Tana, and in the time of the Amoraim an Amora.”<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">/29/ <i>Germania Judaica</i>, p. 293.</i> His contribution to medieval Jewish mysticism is a matter still to be investigated and evaluated fully."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 41","Part of the difficulty of such an investigation stems from the lack of authentic and reliable primary material dealing with the period. Though the life of Francis of Assisi, a contemporary with whom Judah has been compared,<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">/30/ Baer, “Religious Social Tendency of the Sefer Hasidim,” <i>Zion,</i> III (1938), 1-50, cited by Scholem, p. 83.</i> is copiously commented upon by medieval writers, Judah’s life remains a mystery and virtually unknown. In spite of the fact that we have <i>Sefer Hasidim</i> before us, there is still much we should like to know in detail about the man. Even if we presume to attribute authorship to him, which is no small matter, other information about his personal life, and his opinions on important matters are still not available to us."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 42",<b>SEFER HASIDIM</b>
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 43","Concerning the authorship of the book there is no complete agreement among scholars except on one point, namely, that the book is not the work of one writer but a composite of many writers.<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">/31/ This, I would say, is the general consensus among scholars and most widely accepted opinion. See Freimann, <i>S. H.</i>, Parma MS, p. 12.</i> This is proved by an internal examination which discloses frequent conflicting statements and sentiments. Some believe<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">/32/ M. Gudemann, quoted by <i>Jewish Encyclopedia,</i> VII, 357.</i> that the book in its present form consists of three revisions of a text of which Judah is the original author.<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">/33/ Freimann, <i>S. H.</i>, Parma MS, p. 10, gives a very succinct and useful presentation of the major points of view in this very dubious matter of authorship.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 44","Moritz Gudemann is of the opinion that the task of assembling the material of <i>Sefer Hasidim</i> fell to the first and second generation of students and disciples of Judah the Pious, who had at their disposal their master’s original. The place of composition, Gudemann feels, as do almost all other scholars, is in the Rhineland. S. A. Wertheimer agrees that the book is not the work of Judah the Pious alone. He is of the opinion that Judah’s student Eleazar Rokeah played a major role in collating the material and adding his own to it. The text then passed into the hands of students who continued to add and arrange the material in diverse ways.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">/34/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> Abraham Epstein attributes authorship of the basic and earliest text to Samuel the Pious, Judah’s father, which Judah and his student Eleazar Rokeah embellished.<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">/35/ Epstein, I, 259.</i> There have been other writers who have attributed the book to other contemporaries of Judah the Pious, but such views have not been seriously received.<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">/36/ Graetz is one such case. He ascribes the book to R. Judah ben Isaac of Paris (b. 1166-d. 1224) sometimes called Sir Leon. Graetz does this on the strength of the French expressions occurring in the text See article on “Judah ben Samuel He-Hasid,” <i>Jewish Encyclopedia,</i> VII, 357.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 45","Perhaps the most balanced and measured opinion on the question of authorship has been put forward by Fritz Baer in a view which is shared by most scholars. He says<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">/37/ Baer, <i>Zion,</i> III, 1-50.</i> that the teachings of <i>Sefer Hasidim</i> form a definite and consistent whole emanating from a specific school and reflecting the spirit of a dominating central figure, Rabbi Judah the Pious. The book itself may be regarded as a collection of ethical and religious precepts for the life of the community and the individual in Germany during the early thirteenth century. It is not an anonymous creation of successive generations; on the contrary, two or three generations of development are seen here, starting with a small group of scholars gathering themselves around a specific leading personality. This one dynamic personality sets the foundation for the <i>Torath Hasidim</i>, ‟Doctrine of the Hasidim,” and for most of its conclusions. Baer feels that the tradition ascribing the book to Judah the Pious is quite correct in the sense that Judah stands in the center of the movement. The impact of his personality on his contemporaries may be considered from many points of view. There is hardly a category of thought or action which does not receive his comment. Perhaps it would be incorrect to ascribe all views found in the book to the man directly. But it would be fair to say, in the light of previous remarks, that they come as a consequence of the real and dominating position Judah the Pious enjoyed within the movement. Perhaps in view of the many difficulties that emerge when attempting to ascribe authorship to individuals, it would be more appropriate to refer authorship to a school of thought led by Judah the Pious. This sort of ascription, group or corporate, would of necessity imply in a single work the presence of diverse and often contradictory views. And such is the case here.<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">/38/ Examples abound in which conflicting directives are put forward.</i> Nevertheless, contradictions notwithstanding, the book aspires to a higher unity, which is in essence the groundwork and message of the <i>Haside Ashkenaz</i>. It represents their interpretation of ‟Pietism.” Naturally, such interpretation embraces a good deal: their view of the reality around them, their interpretation of ritual observance, their conception of Jewishness, of the relationship of man to God, of sin, prayer, and whatever may fall under the rubric of theology and spirituality. Observations on magic, death, and immortality and comments on miscellaneous other subjects are also present in the work. It is this latitude in subject matter, together with the unadorned treatment, that gives the book its intrinsic value as a primary source for the movement which it represents and adorns."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 46","The fact that it represents a departure from certain traditional rabbinic norms and categories of value accounts in part for the ambivalences and contradictions that frequently occur. The departure for new climes of opinion and feeling that characterize it, very often brings a reaction in the form of nostalgia for the older and more familiar traditional touchstones. Moreover, tradition itself, pervasive and all-penetrating as it is, very often makes us heirs of contrary and irreconcilable beliefs and views. The alternation between the old and new may therefore be viewed as being in fact less a matter of contradiction than of tension between two views for greater loyalty. Very often when deeper and more intensive probing occurs, we find that the yield of both views is complete agreement on a more sublime level of aspiration and intent. It is here that a convergence and unity involving religiosity and godliness is ultimately achieved."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 47","In an article dealing with Jewish liturgy and its development, Dr. Judah Rosenthal brings to our attention the infusion into German Hasidism of a mystical element from former generations.<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">/39/ Judah Rosenthal, “L’ToIdoth Ha-Siddur,” reprint from <i>Hadoar</i> (Shebat 5707), p. 11. This article helps us to appreciate more fully the rich resource of the prayer for investigating the diverse elements in the spiritual development of Judaism.</i> He traces the chain of continuity from Baghdad to Italy to the Rhineland, ultimately into the possession of Judah the Pious."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 48","The Kolonymides, outstanding and preeminent in scholarship, served in fact as the preservers of this tradition, handing down the legacy of mysticism from father to son. Dr. Rosenthal makes further mention of the important influence that this mystical tradition exerted over the content of Jewish prayer composed by German pietists during this period. He further indicates the important influence that the pietists and the movement as a whole exerted on the entire Jewish community at that time, most especially through the ‟Rokeah.”"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 49","With these observations in mind, certain deductions become quite apparent. The mystical tradition, complex and devious as it is, possesses a higher unity which makes blood brothers of diverse elements and points of view. Once again, the lack of absolute unity and agreement on all religious dicta gives an added dimension of historicity to this movement which in fact did not resolve all of its own problems systematically. Our book leaves us, so to speak, in <i>medias res</i> not at the end of a movement but in its middle, which happens to be the most advanced stage that German pietism achieved."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 50",<b>THE PIOUS</b>
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 51","In defining the nature of ‟piety” and the ‟pious” we can do so from two points of view. One view is that of the masses as reflected in contemporary literature. The other, perhaps more important and to which we will restrict ourselves, is the definition garnered from the book itself.<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">/40/ There is no complete unanimity on precisely who might be deemed a <i>hasid.</i> Very often terms other than <i>hasid</i> are used in a context designating piety. Often the attributes and qualities involved in piety are indicated without reference to an individual. It might be said, except in one instance of which I am aware, that the various scholars commenting and writing on this subject have used such excellent discretion and fair-mindedness in their handling of the references to “piety,” <i>hasid,</i> etc., that the question of taking liberties with the meaning seldom arises. Needless to say, the temptation to give infinite elasticity and application to the term <i>hasid</i> so as to cover almost everything, is great.</i> Here, broadly speaking, although a case could be made for additional and, if hard pressed, infinite subtleties and nuances, three main categories of behavior and attitude single out ‟the pious”; serenity of mind, altruism, and an ascetic renunciation of the things of this world.<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">/41/ Scholem, p. 92. See also, Norman M. Bronznick, “Some Aspects of German Jewish Mysticism as Reflected in the <i>Sefer Hasidim”</i> (unpublished M. A. dissertation, Department of Philosophy, Columbia University, 1947), p. 8, for a discussion of these categories and their component elements.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 52","A more detailed enumeration of the component elements comprising these major rubrics would be as follows: indifference to offenses of all sorts,<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">/42/ Judah the Pious, <i>Sefer Hasidim,</i> (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1957), secs. 7, 9, 10, 11. This version is generally referred to as the Bologna Edition. Future references will be designated as <i>S. H.</i>, Bologna Ed.</i> doing deeds of kindness,<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">/43/ <i>Ibid.</i>, secs. 7, 10, 11.</i> controlling the evil inclination in all its varied manifestations,<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">/44/ <i>Ibid.</i>, secs. 7, 9, 10, 29.</i> avoiding all idle and useless occupations and pastimes,<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">/45/ <i>Ibid.</i>, secs. 10, 29.</i> purity of intent and the doing of everything almost to extreme for the ‟sake of heaven.”<sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">/46/ <i>Ibid.</i>, secs. 9, 10, 12.</i> Baer is quite right in saying<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote"">/47/ Baer, <i>Zion,</i> III, 12.</i> that all these manifestations of pietism were elicited by a demand embodied in a higher form of law, <i>Ius Divinum</i>, heavenly law. The pietist must at times veer from <i>Ius Positivum</i>, the demands of conventional law of halakha, in order to fulfill the dictates of ‟heavenly law.”<sup>48</sup><i class=""footnote"">/48/ <i>S. H.</i>, Bologna Ed., sec. 44.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 53","We find <i>Sefer Hasidim</i> describing the substance of pietism as the duty to act beyond the limit of the law.<sup>49</sup><i class=""footnote"">/49/ <i>Ibid.</i>, sec. 11.</i> That the law does not represent the ideal optimum of justice has its genesis in Talmudic literature.<sup>50</sup><i class=""footnote"">/50/ See passages quoted in <i>S.

H.</i>, Bologna Ed., sec. 378, quotes statement from Kiddushin 21b.</i> Baer identifies this ‟heavenly law” which involves human relationships with natural human fairness and equity. Concerning relations between God and man this would provide a stricter interpretation and application of ritual and religious practices. This new line of action governed by good heart and conscience would naturally well up from the soul’s assimilation of the divine spirit."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 54","It is quite reasonable to assert that the distinctive element in ‟pietism” which gives it its most prominent characteristic is the striving to fulfill heavenly law, a demand which is additional, self-imposed by conscience and good heart, a law which is beyond the immediate claims of the traditional law or halakha."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 55",<b>PIETISM AND ASCETICISM</b>
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 56","The ascetic strain found within the pietism of the <i>Haside Ashkenaz</i> is touched upon by numerous authors. To my mind the subject has not really been given its proper perspective. Baer tries to show differences that exist between the ascetic proclivities of the <i>Haside Ashkenaz</i> and that of non-Jewish asceticism. More, perhaps, should have been said about the similarities which are equally interesting but have received sparse comment. Dom Ursmer Berliere’s remark concerning Christian mystics can very well apply to our own <i>Haside Ashkenaz;</i> that in every mystic there is an ascetic and that asceticism is at the very source of mysticism.<sup>52</sup><i class=""footnote"">/52/ Berliere is quoted by Ray C. Petry, <i>Late Medieval Mysticism,</i> Vol. XIII of <i>The Library of Christian Classics,</i> ed. John Baillie and others (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1953—), 19.</i> This, of course, helps to explain some of the severe forms of penance and self-denial in <i>Sefer Hasidim</i>. Moreover, we find in <i>Sefer Hasidim</i> overtones and allusions to that triple mystical root which has been sketched for the Christian mystic, purgation, illumination, and union. This is not native to Christianity alone, but was then and is today, shared by many other religions. This can be accounted for by the simple fact that so many faiths drink from a common ideational source.<sup>53</sup><i class=""footnote"">/53/ Evelyn Underhill, <i>Mysticism</i> (New York: E. P. Dutton and Co., 1960), p. 167. This is found in Platonic and Neoplatonic thought In view of the long history of Judaism something of this is therefore to be anticipated in the Jewish mystic.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 57","The period with which we are dealing and which witnesses similar mystical activity in Jewish and non-Jewish camps can be attributed to a religious influence and atmosphere, then prevalent, which affected both equally.<sup>54</sup><i class=""footnote"">/54/ H. H. Ben-Sasson, <i>On Jewish History in the Middle Ages</i> (Tel Aviv: Am Oved Limited, 1958), p. 190. Briefly, the author touches upon parallels between the German pietists and the Franciscans and some of their common characteristics. Also see Baron, <i>Social and Religious History of the Jews,</i> VIII, 295, note 54.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 58","Baer’s observation is quite true that the Jewish mystic-ascetic never goes beyond a certain point in self-denial because of legal prohibitions. However, this does not set him apart from the non-Jewish mystic-ascetic in their common striving and spiritual personality. In a manner of speaking, both Christian and Jewish mystics strive and achieve the extreme within their respective faiths that is permissible. It is only in comparison with each other that this ‟extreme” for the Jewish mystic appears foreshortened. The Jewish mystic goes to the extremity permitted by law as does the Christian; in the latter’s case, however, the extent of self-denial permitted is far more generous. The foregoing observation does not indicate at all that the basic concept and mood of Christian and Jewish mystics differ. It is the law which directs and defines the mystical ascetic personality. The Jewish mystic might well be placed beside the Christian and made to appear similar in terms of a common mood, view and aspiration. It is the rule of law and tradition which sets them apart sending them into different areas of mystical preoccupation. In this respect Baer is quite right when he says that <i>Haside Ashkenaz</i> did not and could not avoid involvement in the social scene and communal enterprise. The Christian mystical tradition with its greater latitude for escape and isolation could hold out to its contemplative mystics complete insulation from social contact and exposure. The ‟activists” however might well correspond in terms of their mobility and social exposure to a counterpart in Judaism, namely, the <i>Haside Ashkenaz</i>."
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 59","There are many Christian mystics who espouse in their writings, if not in their personal conduct, the virtues of the ‟mixed life,” a balance between contemplation and action, social responsibility and mystical experience, such as is found among Jewish pietists.<sup>55</sup><i class=""footnote"">/55/ Petry, <i>Late Medieval Mysticism,</i> 30: “In the balance of the contemplative and the active, there is in Augustine, as later in Gregory and Bernard, an incitement to Christian service and responsibility that inspired the whole of the Middle Ages.”</i> Men like Jan Rysbroeck,<sup>56</sup><i class=""footnote"">/56/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 319, quoting Rysbroeck in <i>The Sparkling Stone,</i> Chapter XIV.</i> Nicholas of Cusa, Meister Eckhart,<sup>57</sup><i class=""footnote"">/57/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 207, quoting from <i>Love Can Not Be Lazy,</i> Meister Eckhart.</i> Bernard of Clairvaux, let alone St. Francis and a host of others of lesser standing immediately come to mind.<sup>58</sup><i class=""footnote"">/58/ Ray C. Petry, “Social Responsibility and the Late Medieval Mystics,” <i>Church History,</i> Vol. XXI (1952). Here he develops the theme of balanced contemplation and action for many of the medieval mystics.</i> One could assent in behalf of the <i>Haside Ashkenaz</i> with Ray C. Petry’s observation that the call to renunciation echoes throughout the centuries of contemplation.<sup>59</sup><i class=""footnote"">/59/ Petry, <i>Late Medieval Mysticism,</i> 18.</i> We might add in conclusion that Gershom Scholem and Baer have in their own way, made this very same observation.<sup>60</sup><i class=""footnote"">/60/ Scholem, <i>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism,</i> p. 91; Baer, <i>Zion,</i> III, 27.</i>"
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 60",<b>THE TEXTS</b>
"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 61","In addition to the problem of authorship, there is the question which of the two editions of <i>Sefer Hasidim</i> is earlier.

"Sefer Chasidim, Introduction 63","For immediate purposes, without entering into a critical analysis of Freimann’s views, it suffices for us to agree with Freimann’s observations although not necessarily with his conclusions.

Sefer Chasidim 1,"This is called ‟Book of the Pious.” Its contents are sweet and most desirable. It is written for those who fear God and revere His name. There is a Hasid whose heart desires the love of His Creator, to do His will completely. But he does not know which matters to assume, which matters to avoid, or how to immerse himself thoroughly to do his Creator’s will. The reason is that hearts have become deficient. There is a Hasid who undertakes a great deal and there is one who does little, but if he knew and understood matters of piety he would do a great deal more than those who do much. It is for this reason that the ‟Book of the Pious” was written, so that all who fear God and those returning to their Creator with a sincere heart may see, know and understand all that they must do and all that they must avoid. This book was not written for the wicked, for if they read it much of its contents would strike them as nonsense. And if communicated to them, they would ridicule it. Concerning them Solomon in his wisdom said, ‟Speak not in the ear of a fool; for he will despise the wisdom of thy words” (Prov. 23:8). Similarly when Solomon wrote Proverbs, it was not intended for the wicked for even if he were to confront them with all his wisdom, it would not have availed either to better their hearts or to encourage their return (to God). He spoke only to the righteous who long for God’s word; he spoke to them that they might see, understand and become wise, as it is written, ‟For the ways of the Lord are right, and the just do walk in them; but transgressors do stumble therein” (Hos. 14:10). This demonstrates that the path of piety, humility and fear of the Lord is a snare unto the wicked but an ascent for the righteous."
Sefer Chasidim 2,"The author of this book who dealt with piety, humility and fear of the Lord in separate treatises, said, ‟I perceived for myself, and from my teachers I received understanding and instruction. It is proper for all those that fear the Lord to teach their children, students and all Israel how they can succeed in doing the will of our Creator, may His name be blessed and His fame be exalted.” His style is that of the allegory, comparing the Lord to the ways of mortals in order to reach the hearts of humans, to speak to them in their accustomed manner of hearing, to open the eyes of the blind and to enlighten uncircumcized hearts. And this is recorded in the Bible, ‟And His voice was like the sound of many waters” (Ezek. 43:2); ‟The Lord shall roar like a lion” (Hos. 11:10). He also likens His image to that of His creatures: ‟His eyes are like doves” (Cant. 5:12); and there are many other such examples: ‟His legs are as pillars of marble” (Cant. 5:15). All this is done in order to address them in their accustomed manner of hearing."
Sefer Chasidim 3,"‟The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing” (Prov. 10:7), i.e., the memory of the Righteous One of the world will be for a blessing.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Yoma 37a. All Talmudic references are to the Babylonian Talmud unless otherwise indicated.</i> Each time we invoke the revered and awesome name of God we are enjoined to bless Him in the sacred tongue, may His name be blessed.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 35b.</i> Even those of lesser knowledge will understand that this is comparable to a man whose son or loved one has gone on some distant journey; when he refers to him he does so saying, ‟My son, may he be remembered in peace this day, may all go well with him.” And whereas we say of the deceased, ‟His repose be peace,”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Kiddushin 31b.</i> all the more so are we enjoined (to say) concerning the Holy One, blessed be He, who is living and enduring, ‟may the revered name of our Creator be blessed.” Concerning this it was said, ‟He who hears his neighbor invoke God’s name (in vain) should excommunicate him, and if he fails to do so he is himself excommunicated.”<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Nedarim 7b.<br>______</i>"
Sefer Chasidim 4,"It is reported of a certain pious man that while seated in a wedding hall he heard one of the singers at the dance employing God’s name in his song. The pious man excommunicated him for each single offense. Even demons do not invoke God’s name in vain, as it is stated in the tractate Megillah, ‟Perhaps it was a demon? but we do know by way of tradition, they do not invoke the name of God in vain.”<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Megillah 3a.<br>______</i>"
Sefer Chasidim 5,"‟Thou shalt surely rebuke they neighbor” (Lev. 19:17). We are commanded to rebuke any Israelite who is resigned and careless of even one of the 248 positive commandments, or if he has violated one of the negative commands. And the sages tell us that he who has an opportunity to rebuke any Israelite concerning a positive or negative command and fails to do so is punished for all (the transgressions).<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Arakhin 16b.</i> As we have studied (Talmud), ‟He who has the opportunity to rebuke and protest the actions of his household members and fails to do so is punished because of them. If it involves people of his city he is held responsible because of them, if it involves the entire world he is held responsible for the entire world.”<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Shabbath 54b.</i> Whence do we know that we must return a second time to reprove someone if he has failed to respond at first? It is stated, ‟Whence do we deduce (the command) that if one has rebuked a first time he must rebuke his neighbor once again.” It is stated, ‟Thou shalt surely rebuke.”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Baba Metzia 31a.</i> He must do so in a manner commensurate with the qualities of the one who is being rebuked; if he be kindly let him reprove him benignly, if he be difficult let him rebuke him accordingly. Let him speak to him in parables and give proofs to enable him to restore his mind to his will. And he shall not favor an elder or superior if he wishes to avoid punishment because of (either of) them. He should warn them of their wicked deeds with impartiality, even when involving a teacher.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> For thus said the wise man, ‟Where there is a profanation of God’s name, one does not grant respect even to a teacher.”<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Berakoth 19b.</i> And they (the rabbis) said further, ‟Rebuke”; this implies a teacher towards his student. How do we know that a student may do similarly to his teacher? Read the text: ‟Thou shalt surely rebuke, in all cases.”<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Baba Metzia 31b.</i> We are obliged to rebuke transgressors and to shame them with their sins to the extent that they strike, insult and curse us. He who rebukes is obliged to reprove (purge) himself for that transgression and to rectify his (own) way before rebuking his neighbor. For if he fails to do so his neighbor will not accept his reproofs. Thus did they say, ‟Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together,” first adorn (correct) thyself and then adorn (correct) others.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Sanhedrin 18a.</i> And let no man rest without exploring all means to cause his neighbor to walk the straight path, furthering him from (assisting him against) transgression in worldly and spiritual matters. He who restrains himself from rebuking is guilty of his neighbor’s punishment; for it is written, ‟Thou shalt not bear sin because of him”<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Shabbath 54b.</i> (Lev. 19:17). And if he has rebuked him and his neighbor has not responded the rebuker is exempt from punishment for the sin. The rebuker nevertheless receives merit because he has admonished him to walk the straight path and to shun wrong, as it is explained in the paragraph, ‟Therefore, O thou son of man, etc….” (Ezek. 23:9) ‟Nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it and he turn not from his way he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul” (Ezek. 23:9). The root of this commandment ‟and not bear sin because of him” (Lev. 19:17), is that a man should not reprove his fellowman with anger or embarrassment,<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ Arakhin 16b.</i> but first quietly and privately that he not become insolent and recalcitrant and add wrong to his transgression.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ Shabbath 34a.</i> Thus did they say, ‟I might conclude that he may rebuke him even if his neighbor suffers embarrassment”; read the text, ‟Thou shalt not bear sin because of him” (Lev. 19:17).<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">/11/ <i>Sifra,</i> ed.

Sefer Chasidim 6,"‟Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor” (Exod. 20:13). By implication of this negative command it is forbidden to say a shameful thing about a neighbor not in his presence, i.e., that if he were to hear it, it would anger him.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Arakhin 15b.</i> As it is written, ‟Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother, thou slanderest thine own mother’s son” (Ps. 50:20).<br/>But if he has committed sins and has been reproved privately but he has not accepted (the reproofs) then it is permissible to reprimand him publicly for his evil doings, with or without his presence.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Maimonides, Hilkhoth Deoth, 6:8.<br>______</i>"
Sefer Chasidim 7,"Of what manner is the root of piety? When a man’s heart inclines toward qualities of piety and it is made difficult for him because all mock him and shame him and say things to torment him and recall his former evil deeds, let him not leave his piety because of the scorners, but let him acquire good qualities little by little, day after day: ‟he that gathereth little by little shall increase” (Prov. 13:11). Concerning this it is stated, ‟If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself” (Prov. 9:12). Concerning the scorners it is written ‟They make a man an offender by words” (Isa. 29:21), i.e., they (the scorners) speak badly about those who perform the commandments. It is a great sin to say to a penitent, ‟Remember thy former deeds”<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Baba Metzia 58b.</i> after he has evidenced through good deeds his desire to acquire the qualities of piety. He is not disturbed by the laughter of the scorners. Those that recall his former deeds are regarded as if closing the door to the penitent. And let him say to himself that his being shamed will be counted for him as a great merit and as righteousness.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Berakoth 12b.</i> And the pure fear of God enters his heart and purifies his heart and body of all evil because he will be aided from heaven to be strengthened in the fear of God. And so they said, ‟He who comes to be purified is assisted from heaven.”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Shabbath 104a.</i> And they prepare for him to make full repentance, for the doors of repentance are not shut.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ <i>Midrash Tehillim,</i> ed. Solomon Buber (Wilna: Romm Publisher, 1891), p. 313.</i> And precept leads to precept,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Aboth 4:2.</i> and now as the man enters through the doors of repentance he will pray day and night before his Creator that He rescue him from Divine Justice and there occur no stumbling through himself. And to the extent that a man treads in his piety and has no inclination to turn aside from his meritorious way—for it is upright in his sight—so the Master of Uprightness will lead him in the upright path. And thus David said, ‟Good and upright is the Lord; therefore doth He instruct sinners in the way. He guideth the humble in justice; and He teacheth the humble His way” (Ps. 25:8). And as he enters piety with difficulty so will it be the more difficult for him to leave his good way because of shame, because people might say, thus is it now known that this man strives for outward appearances only<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Samuel 16:7.</i> and in order to deceive people he has feigned piety, and it is forbidden to deceive people, even a gentile.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Hullin 94a.</i> And because piety is difficult to achieve initially it is good to start during youth, as it is written, ‟Remember then thy Creator in the days of thy youth” (Eccl. 12:1); ‟and even when he is old he will not depart from it” (Prov. 22:6). For the repentance of an old man, when he is aged and the desires are gone, resembles a man indulging in slander with his tongue gone and he speaks no more. But when a man returns while yet in his strength and might and his passion threatens to make itself master over him and he subdues it, this sort of repentance is the most praiseworthy. And a mighty act he performs indeed through controlling his intense and strong passion. Concerning this it is said, ‟and he that ruleth his spirit (rather) than he that taketh a city” (Prov. 16:32). And for each matter which is difficult for the individual but which he nevertheless accomplishes, his reward is very great.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Aboth 5:26.</i>"
Sefer Chasidim 8,"When Rabbi Simeon ben Gamaliel and Rabbi Ishmael went forth to be killed, said Rabbi Simeon b. Gamaliel to Rabbi Ishmael ‟I do not know why I am going forth to be killed.” He said, ‟Perhaps when you were expounding in public, your heart rejoiced and your heart was gratified.” He said, ‟You have consoled me.”<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ <i>Aboth of Rabbi Nathan,</i> ed.

For it is already stated, ‟conceal thy things” (Prov. 25:2) ‟and walk humbly with thy God” (Mic. 6:8). And let a man not claim credit for himself that his intentions are heavenly. Let him beware lest his heart profit or rejoice. For if his heart rejoices before the world, he has indeed already received a part of the reward for that command in this world. If his heart rejoiced against his will, that is to say without his knowledge or intent, let him condition his heart to overcome his passion and let him desist from that act in which his heart rejoiced. For many of those now deceased performed this specific deed and performed meritorious acts without number; they have passed on to their eternal rest and the matter is forgotten, they have left no remembrance because their memory is forgotten in this world with none to recall them, but their memory is for the after-life. Therefore what advantage or profit is mine if they praise me in this world? So should he think at all times also at night when retiring. He must be concerned lest eternal sleep overtake him and he will awaken no more. Wherefore should he continue to rejoice that they praise him in this world? All is vanity and a striving after wind."
Sefer Chasidim 9,"The main strength of piety from beginning to end is that although they scoff at him he does not forsake his piety, his intent is for heaven’s sake and he does not look at the countenances of women: especially so among other men where women are customarily seen, for example, if he has been in the wedding hall where the women were garbed in choicest ornaments and all were gazing but he did not stare, for that will he merit the great good that is laid up, as it is written, ‟which thou hast laid up for those that fear thee” (Ps. 31:20). And his eye will be satiated with the Divine Glory: ‟Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty” (Isa. 33:17). For this reason it is best for the individual when he meets a woman, whether single or married, whether a gentile woman or Jewish, whether she be of age or a minor, to turn his face aside from looking at her. Thus do we find in Job (31:1), ‟I made a covenant with mine eyes; how then should I look upon a maid.” And thus is it written in the book of Ben Sira, ‟Avert your eyes from a beautiful woman, lest you stumble and incur penalties for her.” <sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Ben Sira 9:5.</i> (So Isa. 33:15) ‟And shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil” refers to him who gazes not upon women at the time when they stand by their wash.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Baba Bathra 57b.</i> When they wash their garments and lift their skirts so as not to soil them, they uncover their legs, and we know a woman’s leg is a sexual incitement<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Berakoth 24a.<br>/4/ Solomon Ibn Gabirol, <i>Choice of Pearls,</i> ed.

T.<br>______</i> and so said the sage, ‟nothing interposes better before desire, than closing one’s eyes.”"
Sefer Chasidim 10,"The essence of piety is to apply oneself constantly to things, where his passions are most challenging, such as evil gossip, the evil inclination, vanities, not to speak falsely, not to stare at women or speak of worldly curiosities or walk about idly; implicit in all this is evil passion. Thus he should not swear at all, nor invoke God’s name in vain, and so in all similar matters that go on constantly, where his passion overpowers him and he cannot withstand (he will be able to resist) only if he has been trained from childhood. Therefore let a man train his children in these matters while they are yet small and when they grow old they will not forsake them or set them aside; as it is written, ‟And even when he is old he will not depart from it” (Prov. 22:6). Take, for example, tallith and phylacteries, many men of quality wish to garb themselves with fringes and put on the phylacteries but refrain from doing so because of embarrassment; however all matters in which a man is trained (to do so) in childhood, when he grows up and attempts to forsake (them) it will be as difficult for him as death. But if a man strengthens himself in Torah and commandments and good deeds, then it becomes difficult for him to depart from them because of the embarrassment; people will say all that he has done so far has been to deceive people, as has been mentioned. He is called <i>hasid</i>, which is derived from <i>hasadim</i> (kindness).<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ The term <i>hasid</i> used to describe the pious and saintly, derives from the Hebrew word <i>hesed,</i> meaning act of loving kindness.</i> He is also called <i>hasid</i> because of the term <i>hasidah</i> (stork) (Deut. 14:18) which Onkelos translates <i>huraitha</i> (white bird). And it is written, ‟not now shall he be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale” (Isa. 29:22), which has the meaning of insult and shame that if they insult him and cause his face to become white and he like one deaf can not hear and like a mute does not open his mouth and does not insult anyone, then he is called pious.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ <i>Midrash Tehillim,</i> ed. Buber, p. 123.</i> And in the hereafter his face will shine brightly and he will succeed to sit in the seven classes of righteous men who will receive the Shekhina and enjoy the Divine Glory.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> (New York-Berlin: Horeb Publishers, 1924), Leviticus, Chapter XXX, p. 81a.<br>______</i> As it is written, ‟Arise, shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee etc…. But upon thee the Lord will arise and His glory shall be seen upon thee. And nations shall walk by thy light and kings by the brightness of thy rising” (Isa. 60:1-3). These seven classes enjoy Divine Glory."
Sefer Chasidim 11,"One is not considered pious unless he is able to overlook personal grievances. If people come before him who have wronged him and have dealt with him unworthily, and now are sorry and seek his forgiveness; that which is in their power to correct of the wrong which they caused, they correct, and for that which they cannot remedy, they repent and seek his pardon, and agree to accept any judgement he sees fit to pass upon them. And when this one sees that it is in his power to do evil to them and repay them in kind, he forgives them with a whole heart and does not do evil to them. Because of this he is called pious, as it is written, ‟Return thou backsliding Israel, Saith the Lord; I will not frown upon you for I am merciful” (Jer. 3:12). And so the children of Jacob, when they sinned against Joseph, he forgave and did not repay in kind. And this is the root of <i>Hasiduth</i>, he must do beyond the line of strict justice in all matters, as it is written ‟and gracious in all his works” (Ps. 145:17)."
Sefer Chasidim 12,"The root of <i>Hasiduth</i> is fear of the Lord. If a man desires some matter of enjoyment and turns aside from his passion only because of fear of God and not because he fears retributions in the world to come, nor because of the enjoyment of this world and the world to come, but he rather fears that he will not be perfect in the love of the Creator, may His name be blessed, as it is written, ‟Thou shalt be wholehearted with the Lord thy God” (Deut. 18:13); this person is called a God-fearing man. The great and singular restraint is forsaking foods, for saturation with foods brings evil imaginations. How so? If there be before him a meal of fish or meat or of other dainties let him not resist from eating at all but for the fear of God let him not fill his stomach to the full reach of his appetite.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ <i>Sifra,</i> ed. Weiss, p. 93b.<br>______</i> It is the same with respect to one to whom a meritorious deed presents itself and it is difficult for him to do it, and (nevertheless) he does not desist from acting. And so we find with Abraham, ‟for now I know that thou art a God-fearing man” (Gen. 22:12)."
Sefer Chasidim 13,"The foundation of the fear of God is the trial. For the essence of fear becomes apparent in the time of trial. And as fear is apparent when involving passion for women, so is it recognizable in all sorts of passion. And the Holy One, blessed be He, does not put man to a trial except when He intends to do good to him; Satan, who embodies the attribute of strict justice, comes before God and says, ‟Lord of the Universe, it would not be proper to do good to him until he proves himself in trial.” Therefore the just are sworn to conquer their passion.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Hagigah 10a.</i> And thus when He brought good to Saul and his children He tried him, and so with Abraham and Job.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Aboth 5:3.</i> Man should always be deliberate in the fear of the Lord,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Berakoth 17a.</i> answering softly, turning back anger,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> speaking peacefully with his brothers and close ones, even with a gentile in the street, in order that he be beloved above and favored below and acceptable to human beings. They said concerning Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai, a man never was first in saluting him not even a gentile.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> And let a man be deliberate in fear of the Lord and understanding to think subtle thoughts for the improvement of the world and the honor of heaven. In the end the words of every man who is God-fearing are heard. As it is stated, ‟The end of the matter, all having been heard: fear God” (Eccl. 12:13).<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Berakoth 6b.</i> A man who possesses learning but is devoid of works is analogous to one to whom have been given the inner keys but not the outer ones by which he shall enter; and how shall he enter?<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Shabbath 31b.<br>______</i>"
Sefer Chasidim 14,"The root of loving God is loving God with all your heart (Deut. 6:4). Our Creator commanded us to serve him with love,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ The term “love” is the preferred reading.</i> that the love of our soul be bound up with His soul in joy and in His love and with a good heart. And the joy of this love is of such intensity and so overpowers the heart of those who love God, that even after many days of not being with his wife and having a great desire for her, in the hour that a man ejaculates he does not find it as satisfying as the intensity and power of loving<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Ibid.</i> God and finding joy in his Creator. And all the pleasures of playing with his children are as naught compared to the pleasures of the heart of the man who loves God with all his heart and soul and with all his might, i.e., with all his thoughts, about how to love God and how to make the public acquire merit and sanctify God’s name, and how to devote himself with love to the Creator,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Berakoth 61b.</i> as did Phineas the priest who dedicated himself with love for his Creator to be zealous in His name. Let him not covet money in a situation where there is a Sanctification of God’s name if he resists taking money, as we find with Abraham, ‟that I will not take a thread or a shoe latchet” (Gen. 14:23). And so (it was) with Elisha who did not want to take money from Naaman. Let him not neglect the study of the Law because of pleasures, playing with his children or attachment to his wives. Also let him give up leisurely walks, meeting with women, sweet songs, in order that his heart may be whole in the joy of God, toiling and laboring in that which is the will of the Creator. He should take a lesson from one of flesh and blood. If he knew a matter to be the desire of a king, he would not yield nor rest until he fulfilled the will of the king, who is a worm like himself. He would be overjoyed that his deeds received the notice of the king and especially if it met with the will of the Creator who is eternal. Therefore must he labor all the more and seek how to fulfill the will of His commandments. He who serves out of love, occupies himself with Torah and commandments, goes in paths of proper wisdom and occupies himself with Torah and loves God with great love, not for any other reason, and not for fear of evil, nor for the purpose of inheriting the good. But he serves in truth, because the Holy One, blessed be He, is truth and in the end the good will come because of it.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Nedarim 62a.</i> He must love the Creator with a great and strong love until he becomes sick because of his love, as the man who is love-sick for the affections of a woman and reels constantly because of his love, when he sits, rises, goes and comes, also when he eats and drinks. He neither sleeps nor slumbers because of this love. Greater than this should love of the Creator be in the hearts of those who love Him and they should be absorbed in it constantly,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Rosh ha-Shanah 4a.</i> as we were commanded, ‟with all thy heart, with all thy soul …” (Deut. 6:4); and this is what Solomon in his wisdom said by the way of simile: ‟For I am love-sick” (Cant. 2:5). And this is a matter as clear as day and sun, for all who know that love of the Creator is not bound up with the heart of man until he is absorbed in it continuously, so as, for example, to forsake all else in the world outside of Him, as He commanded us ‟with all thy heart” (Deut. 6:4). This is impossible except through the apprehension of the mind. Therefore this is the truth, and the sum of it all is, that man must understand and study in the wisdoms and disciplines that make known to him his Master<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Shabbath 75a.</i> according to the intellectual ability that he possesses to understand, consider and comprehend.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Maimonides, Hilkhoth Teshuvah, 10:6.</i> And the Creator, blessed be His name and exalted be His revered and awesome fame, commanded us to love and fear His name, as it is written ‟and thou shalt love the Lord thy God” (Deut. 6:4); and it is said, ‟thou shalt fear the Lord thy God” (Deut. 6:13). And which is the way in which to love Him and fear Him? In the hour that the individual comprehends the great and wondrous works of God, the Holy One, blessed be He, which are beyond assessment and limit, he immediately loves, praises, glorifies and yearns deeply to know that great, revered and awesome name.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Moses Maimonides, <i>Book of the Divine Commandments,</i> trans. Charles Chavel (<i>2</i> Vols.; London: Soncino Press, 1940), I, 82, commandment 3.</i> And thus did David say, ‟My soul thirsteth for God for the living God” (Ps. 42:3). And when he reflects upon these matters he will be startled, he will fear, and will tremble that he is a very small and lowly creature standing with poor and scanty knowledge before Him.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ Maimonides, Hilkhoth Yesode Ha-Torah, 2:2, adds the words, “Who is omniscient,” (literally, “Whose knowledge is complete”).<br>______</i> And so did David say, ‟When I behold Thy heavens the work of Thy fingers etc…. What is man that Thou art mindful of him” (Ps. 8:4)."
Sefer Chasidim 15,"Concerning the root of humility, one must remove oneself from a situation involving high office and honor, and let him not include himself with other individuals. How so? If he was before his teacher and he remembered a question or some query that he posed or some answer that he supplied, let him not say to his teacher or his friend, ‟So have I answered, so have I asked,” but ‟So have you asked,” in order that his heart may not be gratified.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Rashi, Shabbath 30b.</i> Also let him give his teacher or friend the honor and not himself. For such do we find with Moses, when he said to Joshua, ‟Choose us our men” (Exod. 17:9).<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ <i>Mekilta,</i> ed. Jacob Z. Lauterbach (3 Vols.; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1933-1935), Exodus II, 140.</i> From this Rabbi Gamaliel derived and wrote, ‟The matter pleases me and my colleagues.”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Sanhedrin 11b.</i> And it is also written that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Isaiah, ‟Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” (Isa. 6:8). From this the Torah indicated the path of humility for scholars. If you question why it is written, ‟Whom shall I send,” and it is not written ‟Shall we send,” the answer is: let it not be said that there are two powers governing the universe.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Sanhedrin 38b.</i> And he should mention his friend’s name before his own in all matters, in French, ‟vous et moi,” and let him not say ‟moi et vous.” Thus the Schools of Hillel and Shammai were wont to do. In relating the opinions of both each one mentioned the other’s reason before indicating its own,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Erubin 13b.</i> even in worldly matters.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Let him show respect to others.</i> And when he sits in council and knows both question and a good answer, let him not jump to speak until he sees that it will not occur to others, then may he speak.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Aboth 1:17.</i> And when he hears his friend speaking of a certain matter and he knows of it, likewise let him not leap and interrupt his friend’s remarks, saying, ‟I know about it”; rather let him be silent and hear him out.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Aboth 5:10.</i> For there will be many instances wherein he will hear explanations that he did not hear previously. Moreover what profit is there to glory in the matter saying, ‟I know as well as you do.” The end of the matter is that in every way that one is able to diminish his own honor in order to magnify the honor of those that fear God let him do so, as it is written, ‟In whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he honoreth them that fear the Lord” (Ps. 15:4). And if he sees that others pride themselves through humility resulting in his own embarrassment, let him listen to them. For example, if they are greater than he is and they do not wish to walk before him, i.e., they say, ‟We are also humble,” and because of this he is embarrassed in that he must walk before them; he is exposed to embarrassment because they urge him to walk in front and he grieves lest they say of him, ‟How impudent this one is who goes before us, it is we who are greater than he, and see how he magnifies himself because of it,” and in this they pride themselves. In spite of this he should bear the embarrassment in order to respect them, and it will be regarded as a sin and transgression on their part in that they honor themselves at the expense of his embarrassment Let him not honor his friend in a way that causes him embarrassment. For example, he (his friend) is customarily called by name, but he calls him ‟teacher,” and he (his friend) is embarrassed by this, in that he feels mocked and ridiculed.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ Gittin 56a.</i> (When studying with two teachers) Let him not praise one in the presence of the other<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ Pesahim 100a.</i> nor praise his teacher’s teacher in his teacher’s presence, that he should say to his teacher, ‟So and so your teacher,<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">/11/ Rashi, Ketuboth 69a.</i> etc….” Here is a case where students spoke to their teacher Rabbi Eliezer concerning Rabbi Eliezer’s teacher Rabbi Yochanan Ben Zakkai, saying, ‟Your colleagues have already been polled concerning you and have permitted it.”<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">/12/ Betzah 5b.</i> Although a person should not profit from his humility,<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">/13/ Sotah 22b.</i> as has already been stated; one should not extoll his own humility since it is written, ‟Let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth” (Prov. 27:2), however if he wishes to praise himself to his students and friends in order that they learn from his ways, he may praise himself, as David stated, ‟And I was single-hearted with Him” (Ps. 18:22), ‟For I have kept the ways of the Lord.” And so do we find a scholar who related to his students his good deeds for which he achieved longevity.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">/14/ Megillah 28a.</i> Let a man not stand in a place where he is being praised,<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">/15/ <i>Aboth of Rabbi Nathan,</i> ed. Schechter, version A, Chapter XXXIX, p. 87.</i> for it is impossible that he should not profit thereof. All the good deeds that a man might perform, are as a dish without salt if he be lacking in humility.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">/16/ Berakoth 34a.</i> And all humility which has not in it fear of heaven is as victuals without seasoning. This world compares to the world to come as sleeping to wakefulness. In a dream one is not ashamed. For if one were ashamed, imaginings such as, for example, that he is sleeping with a woman and playing with her would not occur to him. He would not do things (in his dream) that he would be ashamed of if they were done while awake. The reason is that dreams come as a result of imaginings.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">/17/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 55b.</i> If a man entertains impure thoughts he is not ashamed of them (his impure fancies), because (he realizes) that a man does not know or have an understanding of what his neighbor imagines in his heart, (for this reason) therefore he is not embarrassed during his dream. He who is God-fearing with all his heart and because of fear of his Creator does not imagine evil things when awake, will also never be visited with evil imaginings in his dreams.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">/18/ Ketuboth 46a.</i> And so did Ezekiel (4:14) say, ‟My soul hath not been polluted.” I did not imagine by day and therefore did not come to pollution at night.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">/19/ Hullin 44b.</i> And so did our rabbis explain, ‟Thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing” (Deut. 23:10). A man should not imagine by day and come to pollution by night.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">/20/ Ketuboth 46a.<br>______</i>"
Sefer Chasidim 16,"A man should not look at a woman even though she be unattractive,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Abodah Zarah 20a.</i> neither at the colored garments of a woman, neither at animals during mating,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> even though he be ‟full of eyes” as the Angel of Death. The rabbis have taught, ‟Thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing” (Deut. 23:10). From this Rabbi Phineas ben Jair makes the following<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> deduction: ‟Torah leads to zeal, and zeal leads to care, and care leads to cleanliness, and cleanliness leads to self-control, and self-control leads to purity, and purity leads to fear of sin, and fear of sin leads to saintliness, and saintliness leads to the resurrection of the dead; and saintliness is greater than all, as it is written, ‟Then Thou spokest in vision to Thy godly ones” (Ps. 89:20). Others say humility is greater than them all, as it is written, ‟Because the Lord hath annointed me to bring good tidings unto the humble” (Isa. 61:1). To bring good tidings to the saintly is not written, but to the humble. But the wicked who have evil imaginings and do not guard themselves against evil, come to uncleanliness at night, and to dreams, and to impure fancies leading to pollution. And as there is no shame for the dream, so is there no embarrassment for the wicked with their deeds in this world, as it is written, ‟Yet they are not at all ashamed, neither know they how to blush” (Jer. 6:15). And all those wicked who imagine evil things and do not dispel them with study of the Torah or with other means, in the world to come The Holy One, blessed be He, will give recompense; for in the same measure that a man commits evil so will he be repaid.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Sotah 8b.</i> Even though humility brings a person to the world to come, humility does not exist in the world to come, and no person will be able to honor his neighbor by saying, ‟Sit beside me.” For each one will rest on his couch and each one will come in peace to the place that is prepared for him. And each one who humbles himself in this world and is able to rule over himself and take a position of leadership and administration in the community, and has no desire to exalt himself, as did the Sons of Bathyra (Elders of Bathyra) who resigned their leadership in deference to Hillel who was greater than they,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ J.

Sefer Chasidim 17,"Concerning the root of study, the individual must steep himself in study and know the performance of each commandment, as it is written, ‟A good understanding have all they that do thereafter” (Ps. 111:10). It is not written, ‟All they that study,” but ‟They that do.” A man should not read and study and be contumacious with his father or teacher or one who is greater than he. He rather studies on the condition that he teach, observe and do, and this is study for its own sake.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Nedarim 62a.</i> And whoever studies the Law not for its own sake, better for him that he were not created.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ <i>Sifra,</i> ed.

From Ezekiel, as it is written, ‟Son of man behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee” (Ezek. 40:4). And is not the entire matter concluded <i>a minori ad majus!</i> If in the case of the Temple which was measured with a yardstick, God said to him to apply his heart, eyes, and ears; would it not be all the more so in the case of matters of the Law, which are as mountains hanging by a hair. One must set aside study periods for the Law each day and night to fulfill what is written: ‟Thou shalt meditate therein day and night”<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Shabbath 31a.</i> (Josh. 1:8).

Sefer Chasidim 18,"The root of prayer is joyousness of heart in the Holy One, blessed be He,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Berakoth 31a.</i> as it is written, ‟Glory ye in His holy name; let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord” (I Chron. 16:10). And that is why David, King of Israel, used to play on his lute all of his prayers and songs in order to fill his heart with joy in his love for God.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Shabbath 30b.</i> And when an individual prays he must direct his heart to Him before Whom he stands.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Berakoth 28b.</i> Five things prevent prayer even though its time has arrived. These are they: ritual purity of the hands, covering one’s nakedness, purity of the place of prayer, matters that distract, and the intent of the heart. ‟Ritual purity of the hands,” how so? He washes his hands with water unto the joint of the wrist, in French <i>jointure</i>, and then let him pray. If he has been walking and the time of prayer has arrived and he has no water, let him walk until (he reaches) a place of water, wash his hands and then pray. If there is between him and the water more than four miles<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Hullin 122b.</i> let him cleanse his hands with pebbles, or with sand, or on a post and pray, as it has been said,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Berakoth 15a.</i> ‟In what case was this said ‛before him,’ but ‛behind him’ we do not oblige him to return, but only up to a mile.” But if he has gone more than a mile he then cleanses his hands with pebbles, sand or on a post. ‟Covering one’s nakedness,” how so? <sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 25a.</i> Even though he has covered his nakedness in the manner that he covers himself for the reading of the <i>Shema</i>, let him not pray until he covers his bosom. And if he has not covered his bosom because of circumstance and has nothing with which to cover himself, since he has covered his shame and prayed he has done his duty. But at the outset he should not do so. ‟Cleanliness of the place of prayer,” how so?<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> Let him not stand in a filthy place and pray, nor in a bathhouse, nor in a privy, nor in a dung heap, nor in a place which has not a presumptive status of ritual cleanliness until investigated. The sum of the matter is that one does not pray in a place where he cannot recite the <i>Shema</i>. And in the same manner that one removes himself from excrement, similarly does one remove himself from urine and from bad odors and from indecent sights for prayer, as he would remove himself for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. If during the prayer one finds excrement in his place, since he has sinned by not investigating prior to praying let him repeat his prayers in a clean place. If one has been in the midst of prayer and seen excrement in front of him, if he is able to go forward putting a distance of four cubits between, let him go forth. If he is unable to do so, let him remove it to the side and if he is unable to do this, let him cease praying. ‟Matters that distract,” how so? If one has had need to evacuate and has prayed, his prayer is an abomination. He repeats his prayers after taking care of his needs.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 23a.</i> If he is able to contain himself for the time needed to traverse a parasang, his prayer is acceptable. But even so, let him not pray until he has examined himself thoroughly, let him remove phlegm, mucous, all spittle and filth of the nose, and then let him pray. One who belches, yawns or sneezes deliberately during his prayers, in French, <i>tousser, bâiller, éternuer</i>, is disgraceful. But if he has examined himself before praying and was overcome, it is of no consequence. If during his prayer he has chanced upon spittle, let him remove it with his prayer shawl or clothing, but if he be exceedingly sensitive and troubled thereby, let him cast it behind him, in order that he not be troubled during prayer. If he breaks wind during prayer unwittingly, let him be silent until the odor subsides and then return to his prayer. If he has had need to break wind and suffered greatly being unable to contain himself, let him remove himself a distance of four cubits, wait until the odor subsides, say, ‟Lord of all the universes, You have created me orifices and orifices, hollows and hollows. Before the throne of Thy glory is revealed and apparent our revilement all the days of our lives and that we are worms in our death.” And he prays once again in his place. If he has been in the midst of prayer and urine has dripped on his knees, he waits until it ceases and returns to the place in his prayers where he has stopped. And if he has paused for an interval of such duration as would have enabled him to conclude the prayer, let him return to the beginning. Similarly if he has urinated, he pauses for the duration of an interval necessary to walk four cubits and then prays.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ Megillah 27b.</i> ‟Directing one’s heart,” how so? A prayer which is devoid of inwardness let him repeat and pray with inwardness. If his mind has been confused and his heart troubled, he is forbidden to pray until his mind becomes settled. In what way is inwardness achieved? He should free his mind of all thoughts as if he were standing before the Lord. Therefore he must rest a bit before prayer<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ <i>The Zohar,</i> trans. H. Sperling, M. Simon and P. Levertoff (4 Vols.; London: Soncino Press, 1931-1934), II, 28.</i> in order to direct the prayer inwardly, and then let him pray with prayers and supplications. And let him not regard his prayer as if he were carrying some heavy burden which he casts aside and then moves on. Therefore, he should sit down after prayer and then leave. The scholars of former years tarried one hour before prayer and one hour after prayer and prolonged their prayers one hour.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">/11/ Berakoth 32b.</i> A person who is drunk should not pray,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">/12/ Erubin 64a.</i> and if he prays his prayer is an abomination, because there is no inwardness. But when he becomes sober let him recite again his prayers with inwardness. While under the influence of drink let him not pray. But if he has prayed, his prayer is acceptable. Who is regarded as being drunk? One who cannot speak before a king. But one under the influence of drink is able to speak before a king and does not blunder, but even if this be the case, if he has drunk a quarter of wine, let him not pray until the wine wears off. And so one does not rise to pray out of laughter,<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">/13/ Berakoth 31a.</i> in French <i>rieur</i>, or out of lightheadedness or scoffing, or out of conversation, or out of strife, or out of anger, only out of the study of the Law, and such law that he does not have to investigate, namely, defined laws.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">/14/ <i>Ibid.</i> See also, “Decided laws which admit of no discussion,” in Berakoth 31a, <i>Babylonian Talmud in English,</i> ed. Isidore Epstein (36 Vols.; London: Soncino Press, 1935-1953), I, 188.</i> If he has been travelling by ship, or has been in a place of danger, in a place where there are hordes of wild beasts and robbers, and the hour of prayer has arrived,<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">/15/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 29b.</i> he recites one prayer and this is it: ‟The needs of Thy people Israel are great and they are impatient; may it be Thy will God, our God and God of our fathers, that You assign to each and everyone enough for his maintenance and to each individual enough for his requirements, and that which is best in Thy sight do. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hears prayer.” And he recites it as he goes, and if he is able to remain stationary he stands, and when he reaches a settlement and his mind is set at ease he repeats the prayer according to the institution of the Eighteen Benedictions. Of eight things must the person who prays be circumspect<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">/16/ Maimonides, Hilkhoth Tefillah, 1:1.</i>—and do them. And if he has been pressed or overcome or if he has transgressed and has not performed them they do not hinder the matter, and these are they: standing, facing the Holy Temple, preparation of the body, modulating the voice, arranging the attire, preparation of the place, kneeling and prostration. ‟Standing,” how so?<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">/17/ Berakoth 30a.</i> One does not pray except while standing. If he has been seated in a ship or wagon, if he is able to stand let him stand, if not, let him sit in his place and pray. One who is sick prays even though sitting, and this applies only when he is able to direct his mind. Similarly the thirsty and the hungry are classified as being ill. If it is possible for them to direct their mind, let them pray; if not, they should not pray until they eat and drink. If he has been riding on an animal, even though there is someone to hold his animal until he complete his prayer, let him not descend but rather sit in his place and pray in order that his mind be at ease. ‟Facing the Holy Temple,” how so?<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">/18/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> If he has been standing outside the Holy Land, he turns his countenance towards the land of Israel and prays. If he has been standing in the Holy Land he directs his countenance towards the Holy of Holies. A blind person or one who cannot tell directions or one travelling on a ship, let him direct his heart towards the Divine Presence and pray. ‟Preparation of the body,” how so? If he has been in the midst of prayer he must align his feet one beside the other.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">/19/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 10b.</i> He casts his eyes downward and directs his heart as if looking earthward, and let his heart be turned upward as if he were standing in heaven. And let him place his hands as though bound upon his heart, the right upon the left, and stand as a slave before his master in fear and trembling. Let him not place his hands upon his loins. ‟Adjusting one’s attire,” how so?<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">/20/ Shabbath 10a.</i> He adjusts his clothing at the outset, straightens himself and adorns himself, as it is written, ‟Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness” (Ps. 29:2). Let him not stand in prayer with his purse, nor with a bare head, nor with exposed feet, if the custom of people of that place is not to stand before a superior except with shoes. While praying it is prohibited to take hold of a Scroll of the Law or phylacteries, because his mind is engaged. Let him not hold money or an object in his hand. But during the Festival he prays with his palm branch in his hand because that is the commandment of the day. The custom of the sages and their students was not to pray except when fully dressed.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">/21/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> ‟Preparation of the place,” how so?<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">/22/ Berakoth 10b.</i> Let him stand in a low place and pray. Let him turn his face to the walls. He should open the windows or the doors towards Jerusalem to pray towards them, for thus do we find in the case of Daniel, ‟His windows were open in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem” (Dan. 6:11). He establishes a place for prayer. One does not pray in a ruin, neither behind the synagogue, only if he directs his countenance towards the synagogue. It is prohibited to sit beside one who stands in prayer or to pass before him unless he is removed from him four cubits. He should not stand in a place higher than three handbreadths or more and pray, neither on a bed, a bench or on a chair. If he has been standing in an elevated edifice and it is four cubits in length by four cubits in width, which are the dimensions of a house, it is considered a garret and it is permissible to pray. Thus if it is surrounded with a partition on all sides, even though it lacks four cubits, it is permissible to pray there. ‟Modulating the voice,” how so?<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">/23/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 31a.</i>He should not raise his voice in prayer, and should not pray only in his heart but articulate the words with his lips, sounding it to his ear. He should not cause his voice to be heard except if he has been sick or unable to direct his mind until it causes his voice to be heard; then it is permissible, except that he not be in public, so as not to disturb the thought of others hearing his voice. ‟Bending the knee,” how so?<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">/24/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 34a.</i> He who prays should bend the knee five times; with the first blessing at its beginning and end; and at <i>Modim</i> beginning and end; and when he finishes the prayer he bows and prostrates himself taking three steps backwards.<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">/25/ <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed. H. Freedman and M. Simon (10 Vols.; London: Soncino Press, 1939), Esther, IX, 20.</i> When he concludes the prayer, let him bow to the left which is the right of the Holy One, blessed be He, then to the right, and then lift his head from bowing. And when he bends the knee, he bends with ‟blessed,” and when he assumes his upright position he does so with the ‟Name.”<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">/26/ Berakoth 12a.</i> In all of these bowings he is required to bend until all the vertebrae of the spine seem to be loosened. Let him make himself as a bow, and if he has bent a bit more and caused himself pain and it appears that he is bending with all his might there is no need to be apprehensive.<br/>‟Prostration,” how so?<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">/27/ Berakoth 34b.</i>After he raises himself and his head,<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">/28/ This is the preferred reading. The original read: “He sits on the right and falls on his face” (see Perush).</i> he sits down and falls on his face to the right and prays with all the supplication that he desires. It is prohibited to prostrate oneself on stones except in the Holy Temple, as it is explained in the tractate Abodah Zarah.<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">/29/ This should read “in the laws of idolatry,” referring to Maimonides, Hilkhoth Tefillah, 5:14.</i> And a worthy man is not permitted to fall on his face except if he is convinced that he is as worthy as Joshua;<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">/30/ Taanith 14b.</i> he rather lies down on his face but does not conceal his face in the soil. It is permissible for a person to pray in one place and fall on his face in another. One who prays with the congregation let him not extend his prayer more than necessary, but he may do so privately. And if he desires to recite after his prayers even the Order of the Confessional for the Day of Atonement, let him do so. Also if he has wished to add to each prayer of the ‟middle benedictions,” supplications of similar content, let him add them.<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">/31/ Abodah Zarah 8a.</i> If he has been ill or in need of sustenance, let him make additions according to his verbal ability,<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">/32/ Berakoth 34a.</i> but he should not supplicate in the first three benedictions or in the last three benedictions. One is prohibited to taste anything or do any work after dawn, until he prays.<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">/33/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 14a.</i><br/>‟Mutual greeting of scholars,” how so?<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">/34/ The Perush states that the words are missing and it should read “and so it is prohibited to extend greetings to a friend before a prayer except in a case where he met him in the street and then it is permissable.”</i> The greeter says, ‟A good morning to you,” and the one greeted replies, ‟A very good morning to you and may it last forever.” The one who replies doubles the greeting.<br/>The prayers were instituted in place of the ‟Daily Offerings”<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">/35/ Berakoth 26b.</i> as it is said, ‟Shall ye observe to offer unto Me in its due season” (Deut. 28:2). From this they instituted the ‟Stations,” that they should stand watch over them.<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">/36/ Taanith 27a.</i> Therefore a man should stand at the time that he recites the Eighteen Benedictions. One is obligated to answer ‟Amen” to each blessing, as it is written ‟Open ye the gates that the righteous nation that keepeth faithfulness may enter in” (Isa. 26:2), i.e., (the faithful) that say ‟Amen.”<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">/37/ Shabbath 119b.</i>And greater is the merit of the one who answers ‟Amen” than he who blesses, because he affirms the blessings of the one who recites them. Also the one who blesses mentions only one Name, the one who answers ‟Amen” invokes two Names because ‟Amen” (91) totals the numerical value of <i>yod he vav he</i> (26) and <i>aleph daleth nun yod</i> (65).<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">/38/ <i>Tikkune Zohar,</i> ed. Shamaryahu Zuckerman (Wilna: Fin and Rosenkranz Publisher, 1867), Chapter XVIII, p. 67.</i> And one must direct his heart towards heaven when answering ‟Amen,” which is the abbreviation of <i>El Melekh Nehman</i>.<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">/39/ Shabbath 119b.</i> Talking and behaving light-headedly <sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">/40/ Megillah 28a.</i> is prohibited in the synagogue while standing before our King, Master of all the earth, blessed be His name. And woe unto the wicked who behave light-headedly, upon whom there is no fear of the Almighty; and there is neither fear nor reverence on their countenance and they will not discern or accept an example. ‟For pass over to the isles of the Kittites, and see, and consider diligently” that in all those lands the kings bend on their knees in their houses of prayer and they stand in awe, reverence and trembling and their hands spread out to their gods made by human hands which neither see nor hear. We who stand before the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, eternal exalted and lifted up, blessed be His name and His fame be exalted, He to whom all praises are due, all the more must we stand before Him with awe and reverence, with fear and trembling. Concerning those who sit in the House of Prayer and appear to be exhausted and are unable to stand, concerning them the verse says, ‟Yet you did not call upon Me, O Jacob, but you have been weary of me, O Israel” (Isa. 43:22). All day he is not tired but during prayer he is tired.<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">/41/ <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed. Soncino, Lamentations, VIII, 13.</i> The entire day he stands in the market before the officer, or before some scoffer and he is not weary, but during prayer he is unable to stand.<br/>If one is praying and a prayer book has fallen before him to earth, if his mind is distracted from concentrating, and he is unable to pray with devotion, let him pick it up and pray with devotion. But before picking it up let him conclude the benediction which he has already begun. And if he is able to direct his mind let him not pick up the book which is on the ground, for he who prays with devotion shares in the world to come. Let a man always rise to attend the synagogue in order to merit being counted among the first ten, for even if a hundred come after him he is given reward equivalent to all of them.<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">/42/ Berakoth 47b.</i> A man who lives in a village and does not have ten people with whom to recite divine offices,<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">/43/ Such prayers that require the presence of a quorum, or minyan, which consists of a minimum of ten males over the age of thirteen.</i> or lives in a place where there is a congregation and he has come late, after they have recited, ‟May His great name”;<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">/44/ Eleazar ben Judah of Worms, <i>Sefer Rokeah</i> (Zalkwo: 1806), Chapter CCCLXII, p. 81.</i> let him say, ‟Let the power of the Lord be great according as Thou hast spoken, saying” (Num. 14:17), ‟Thus will I magnify Myself, and sanctify Myself and I will make Myself known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the Lord” (Ezek. 38:23), ‟Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and forever” (Ps. 113:2).<br/>Let a man not leave the synagogue until they complete the entire prayer service, except for the privy or to expectorate. In the evening close to prayer let a man not take a child to his bosom lest he soil his garments. Even if he wash them in water, they will not be as clean as before. Moreover, it is possible that while searching after the water the hour for <i>Minha</i> will have passed, or between and betwixt they will have recited the <i>Kaddish</i> with him being unable to respond with the ‟Amen.” Moreover, perhaps the child will cry when he wishes to set him down and he will take pity on him and would not defer to the honor of his Owner and he will not go at all to the House of Assembly. ‟Create me a clean heart, O God,” (Ps. 51:12) i.e., a man should not imagine an indecent or repulsive thought during prayer. Let him not touch these (indecent and repulsive) things during prayer. Let him not recite <i>Modim</i><sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">/45/ <i>Daily Prayerbook,</i> trans. Dr. Joseph Hertz (rev. ed.; New York: Bloch Publishing Co., 1948), p. 151, “We give thanks.”</i> if there is saliva in his mouth. Let him not pray until the saliva is eliminated from his mouth. And if he has not recited the benedictions of <i>Ovos</i><sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">/46/ Berakoth 34b. This refers to the section of the “Eighteen Benedictions,” which begins, “Praised be thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob.” See <i>Daily Prayer Book,</i> ed. Hertz, p. 130.</i> with devotion until <i>Mogen Abraham</i>, let him repeat it and pray again. And so with the recitation of <i>Shema</i> if he has not recited the first verse with devotion, let him repeat it in a whisper but let him not recite it in a loud voice, for it would appear as though two powers govern the universe.<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote"">/47/ Berakoth 33b. It would seem that he is addressing two divinities.</i> A person who is unable to pray with devotion without a prayer book in which the prayer is written, or a person sated and unable to concentrate on the Blessings of Grace, let him read it from a book wherein the Blessings of Grace are inscribed. If he has not prayed with devotion, then when they pray quietly let him direct his heart with the reader and let him say each word with him. If you wonder about those who stammer in their speech and pronounce <i>het</i> as <i>heh</i> and <i>shin</i> as <i>samekh</i> and <i>kuf</i> as <i>teth</i> and <i>raish</i> as <i>daleth</i>, as to how they pray or how they read in the Torah and recite matters of holiness; when they reach the verse (Ps. 33:20), <i>Nafshaynu Hikhtha</i>, are they not revilers and blasphemers?<sup>48</sup><i class=""footnote"">/48/ Megillah 24b.</i> Do not wonder about this matter, for our Creator, who searches hearts, does not seek anything but the heart of man that it be whole with Him, and although he cannot speak properly it is nevertheless as if he recites it properly. And so to those who read the ‟Verses of Praise”<sup>49</sup><i class=""footnote"">/49/ A group of Psalms read at the beginning of the morning service. See <i>Daily Prayer Book,</i> ed. Hertz, p. 50.</i> in a loud voice and with melodious song and do not know the verses and recite them with error, their prayers and songs are accepted as savory odors. And also the Holy One, blessed be He, rejoices over him greatly and says, ‟How much he sings before Me according to his thinking.” Concerning this it is said, ‟And His banner over me is love” (Cant. 2:4). His faithlessness to me is love. ‟His mouth trespasseth not in judgement” (Prov. 16:10); we translate, ‟He does not deceive with his mouth.” It happened with a priest who with hands outstretched blessing the people said, <i>Yishmadkho</i> ‟let him destroy you.” There was a scholar present who removed him from before the ark, because he did not know how to pronounce the letters in the Priestly Benediction. It was shown through heaven to this scholar that if he did not restore him he would be punished because of the matter. He who prays should focus his eyes downward and his heart upward<sup>50</sup><i class=""footnote"">/50/ Yebamoth 105b.</i> in order to fulfill those two passages, ‟And Mine eyes and Mine heart shall be there perpetually” (I Kings 9:3), ‟Let us lift our heart and our hands unto God in the heavens” (Lam. 3:41).

Sefer Chasidim 19,"Twenty-four things interfere with repentance.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Maimonides, Hilkhoth Teshuvah, 4:1.</i> These are they: (1) gossiping evil, (2) slandering, (3) anger, (4) thinking evil, (5) fraternizing with the wicked, (6) eating at a table a meal that does not even suffice for the host, (7) staring at lewdness, (8) dividing spoils with a thief, (9) saying, ‟I will sin and the Day of Atonement will atone,” (10) disregarding one’s teachers, (11) cursing the community, (12) withholding the community from performing a meritorious deed is also included in this sin, (13) deflecting one’s friend from a meritorious deed to an act of transgression, (14) making use of the poor man’s pledge, (15) accepting bribes to pervert the law, (16) finding a lost object and not announcing it publicly so that it can be returned to its rightful owners, (17) seeing one’s son going out to a bad environment and not reprimanding him, (18) eating the plunder of the poor and widows, (19) separating oneself from the community, (20) transgressing the words of the sages, (21) honoring oneself at the expense of a friend’s disgrace, (22) suspecting the innocent, (23) despising reproof, (24) scorning the commandments. All these twenty-four things withhold repentance. Repentance is not withheld if he has repented of them,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Repented of the twenty-four items listed here.</i> for he is then a penitent and has a share in the world to come.<br/>And these things are differentiated in their various aspects. They are not all equal in punishment or with regard to repentance. There are aspects of them that close the path of repentance before their doers: ‟One who separates himself from the path of the community,” that at the time that they do penance he will not be with them, and he will not share with them in the good deeds that they perform; ‟One who contests the words of the sages,” because argument causes him to separate from them and he does not know repentance; ‟one who disregards his teachers,” because this causes him to be banished from the world, and in the time that he is being driven from the world he will not find a teacher to show him the path of truth;<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Joseph Albo, <i>Sefer ha-Ikkarim</i> (Book of Principles), ed. Isaac Husik (5 Vols.; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1946), I, 99.</i> ‟One who mocks the commandments,” since they are despised in his eyes he will never pursue them, will not love them and will not perform them; ‟One who abhors reproof,” since he despises his reprover he will never find a reprover to lead him in the good path. Reproofs cause repentance, for at the time that they let the man know of his sin and shame him he then regrets his actions<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ “His actions,” is the preferred reading.</i> and returns (to God) in repentance. And so we find with Moses when he would admonish Israel he would remind them of all their transgressions, ‟Ye have been rebellious” (Deut. 9:7), in order to cause them to repent, and (in this manner) all of the prophets reproved Israel. Therefore it is necessary to set up in each and all of Israel’s communities a person, an elder, wise and God-fearing from his youth onward and beloved to the people of his city, to reprove them and return them (to God) in repentance. And this one despises reproof and does not listen to his words therefore he will remain in his sins, which in his eyes are good. There are things which are great transgressions and him who does one of them the Holy One, blessed be He, does not let repent because of the gravity of his sin. These are they: one who leads the community astray and included in this perversity is one who restrains the community from performing a meritorious act; one who leads his neighbor from a good to an evil path, such as an instigator and seducer. One who sees his son conducting an evil life and does not reprimand him and his son is still in his care. For if he were to reprimand him, he would mend his ways; this is therefore tantamount to causing him to sin. Included in this perversion is each one who has the power to rebuke others, both the community and individuals, and has not done so;<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Shabbath 54b.</i> it is as though he placed the snare with his own hands; also he who says, ‟I will sin and repent,” ‟I will sin and the Day of Atonement will atone.” There are some things for which he who does them is unable to do complete penance, because they are between him and his fellowman; for example, when he does not know the person against whom he has sinned in order to ask for his forgiveness or, if he has stolen, to whom to make restitution. These<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ In the text, “he does not know” is lacking.</i> are they :one who curses the community and has not cursed a specific individual, to be able to approach him, appease him and ask of him forgiveness; one who shares with a thief, because he does not know from whom the theft was taken because he<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ “The thief.”</i> steals from all people and brings it to him and he accepts it therefore he doesn’t know to whom to make restitution, moreover, he strengthens the hands of the thief and causes him to sin; one who finds a lost object and does not proclaim it in order to return it to the owners, after a while when he does make penance he does not know to whom to return it; one who eats the loot taken from poor people, orphans and widows, these unfortunate people are not known and wander from city to city and there is no one that knows them to know to whom to return it; he who accepts a bribe to pervert justice, he does not know the extent of the perversion and what loss is involved in order to make a proper restitution moreover, he strengthens the hand of the pervert and causes him to sin.<br/>These are very bad things and he who does them in all probability will not return (to God) because they are simple in the eyes of most people and it appears to them that it is no perversion but it is a decisive sin and perversion. These are they: one who eats at the table a meal that does not even suffice for the host, which is a great sin but he who eats thinks in his heart, ‟What is my sin, I ate only with his permission”; he who uses the pledge of the poor man, for instance he loans to the poor man on his ax and the creditor chops wood without the poor man’s permission and says, ‟What is my sin if I have chopped with it, he loses nothing thereby.”<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Baba Metzia 82b.</i> One who stares at lewdness, thinks in his heart, ‟What is my transgression, wherein is my sin, if I did look at my kinsman have I then fornicated with her?” He does not know or understand that he causes sin to the person involved, as it is written, ‟That ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye used to go astray” (Num. 15:39). And in the book of Ben Sira he says, ‟Avert your eyes from a beautiful woman.”<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ Yebamoth 63b; Ben Sira 9:5.</i><br/>The rabbis commented on the verse, ‟He shutteth his eyes from looking on evil” (Isa. 33:15), that he closes his eyes from looking at women.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ Baba Bathra 57b.</i> A woman’s leg is a sexual incitement.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">/11/ Berakoth 24a.</i> The voice of a woman is indecency.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">/12/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> As our sages have said, ‟He who stares at the small finger of a woman is as if staring at the pudenda.”<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">/13/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> They also have said, ‟Even at the colored clothing of a woman stretched out on the wall, if he recognizes the owner he is prohibited from looking.”<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">/14/ Abodah Zarah 20b.</i><br/>He who honors himself through the shame of his neighbor says in his heart he is not sinning in that he does not embarrass him and did not bring him to his shame. In what manner does he do this? He compares his deeds with his neighbor’s wisdom, and his wisdom with the deeds of his friend, in order that it may appear therefrom that he is honored and his friend disgraced.<br/>To him ‟who suspects the innocent,” it appears that he is not sinning, but he needs to learn from Moses, our teacher, who spoke evil and suspected the innocent in that he said, ‟But behold they will not believe me” (Exod. 4:1), (and) immediately he was stricken with leprosy.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">/15/ Shabbath 97a.</i> There are five things to which he who does them will remain addicted and from which he will find it difficult to separate himself. Therefore a man must beware of them and remove himself in order not to cleave to them, for they are extremely bad. And these are they: talking evil, going about tale-bearing, anger, thinking evil and associating with a wicked person because he learns from his ways, and they are marked in his heart, ‟ But the companion of fools shall smart for it” (Prov. 13:20).<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">/16/ <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed.

Sefer Chasidim 20,"Every commandment of the Law, both positive and negative, if a man transgresses one of them through error or deliberately, if he repents and returns from his sins he is enjoined to confess before God, may His name be exalted, as it is written, ‟When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to commit a trespass … then they shall confess their sin” (Num. 5:6). This is a verbal confession and it involves a positive commandment. In what manner does one confess? He says, ‟I pray, O Lord, I have sinned, I have done perversely, I have transgressed before Thee, such and such have I done, and behold I am sorry, I am ashamed of my actions and I will never return to this thing.”<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Maimonides, Hilkhoth Teshuvah, 1:1.</i> This is the essence of the confession. And he who adds to his confession and elaborates in the matter is all the more praiseworthy.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Yoma, 84b.</i> And so sinners and the guilty at the time that they bring sacrifices for their sins and for their errors are not forgiven until they do penance and make a verbal confession, as it is written, ‟And he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned” (Lev. 5:5). And so all those under sentence of death by the court and those subject to lashes, their death and flagellation does not obtain forgiveness for them unless they do penance and confess.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Sanhedrin 43b.</i> And so he who wounds his neighbor or does damage to his neighbor even though he has paid him that which was due him is not atoned for until he confesses and returns from ever doing this again, as it is written, ‟Any sin that men commit” (Num. 5:6).<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ <i>Yalkut Shimoni,</i> ed. Horeb, Numbers, par. 701, p. 444.</i> The goat that is to be sent away<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Lit “The goat to be sent away.” The scapegoat used for the Yom Kippur ritual sent into the wilderness carrying the sins of the people. (See Leviticus 16:8.)</i> atones for all transgressions in the Torah, light ones and more serious ones, both if the person transgressed in error and if he transgressed deliberately, both if it was made known to him or not made known to him, all is expiated for by the goat that is sent away and this all applies only when he does penance. But if he has not done penance the goat does not atone except for the light ones.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ J. T. Shebuoth 1:6.</i> And which are the light ones and which are the more serious ones? The more serious ones are those for which one is guilty of the death penalty or of excision (from Israel). A needless oath and a false oath, even though excision is not applicable, are considered among the more serious ones. And all other positive commandments and negative commandments which do not involve excision are regarded as light ones. And in our day when the Holy Temple no longer exists and we have no atonement through the altar there is nothing left but penance. Penance atones for all transgressions. Even if a man has been wicked all his days and has done penance at the end, his wickedness is not counted, as it is written, ‟And as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not stumble thereby in the day thereby he turneth from his wickedness” (Ezek. 33:12).<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Kiddushin 40b.</i> And the gravity of the Day of Atonement atones for penitents, as it is written, ‟For on this day shall atonement be made for you” (Lev. 16:30).<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Yoma 85b.</i> Even though repentance atones and the gravity of the Day of Atonement atones, there are transgressions which obtain forgiveness only after a time.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 86a.</i> How so? A man has transgressed a positive commandment not involving excision and has done penance he does not go away from there until he is forgiven. Concerning these (such transgressors) it is said, ‟Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings” (Jer. 3:22). If a man has transgressed a negative commandment which does not involve excision and capital punishment and has repented, the repentance suspends judgement and the Day of Atonement atones. Concerning this it is said, ‟For on this day shall atonement be made” (Lev. 16:30). If he has transgressed in a matter involving excision and capital punishment and has done penance, penance and the Day of Atonement suspend judgement and the tribulations that visit him conclude the expiation, and he never does obtain full forgiveness until tribulation comes upon him. Concerning them (such transgressors) Scripture says, ‟Then will I visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with strokes” (Ps. 89:33). When does this apply? Only when he did not profane the Name when he transgressed, for example, he committed the transgression in secret (is expiation possible), but profaning the Name publicly, even though he has done penance and the Day of Atonement has arrived and he stands yet within his penance and tribulation has visited him, not even all of these are able to cleanse his wrong so as to obtain (for him) full forgiveness, except that he die. Repentance, the Day of Atonement and tribulations, these three only suspend judgement but death cleanses and atones, as it is said, ‟And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in mine ears” (Isa. 22:14).<br/>What is complete penance? (It is illustrated by) one to whom a transgression has presented itself which he has already transgressed and he has the opportunity to do it again but has withdrawn and has not done it because of the penance and not because of fear or weakness. How so? Behold one who has cohabited illicitly with a woman and later has been left alone again with her and has had the opportunity to do it again, and he has been still steadfast in his love for her and has been able to do it, but has subdued his passion and has not transgressed, he is a complete penitent. Concerning this one Solomon said, ‟Remember then thy Creator in the days of thy youth” (Eccl. 12:1).<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ Abodah Zarah 19a.</i> And if he has not returned except in his old age and at the time when it is no longer possible because of his failing strength, to do that which he was able to do in his youth, even though this is not the best penance it avails, and he is regarded as a penitent. And even though he has transgressed all his life and at the end, at the time of his death, he has repented and he has died penitent, all of his transgressions are forgiven him,<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">/11/ Kiddushin 40b.</i> as it is said, ‟Before the sun and the light … are darkened” (Eccl. 12:2), which is the day of death, from which we can deduce that if he remembers his Creator before death he is forgiven. And what is this repentance? That the sinner forsake his sin and remove evil thoughts from his heart, and resolve in his heart to do it (the evil) no more, as it is said, ‟Let the wicked forsake his way” (Isa. 55:7). Let him repent and regret his previous sins, as it is written, ‟Surely after that I was turned I repented” (Jer. 31:18); and let him say, ‟I give testimony concerning myself before Him Who knows all hidden things, that I will not return to this sin ever; as it is written, ‟Neither will we call anymore the work of our hands our gods” (Hos. 14:4).<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">/12/ <i>The Zohar,</i> ed. Soncino, V, 334, 335.</i> And in keeping with the paths of repentance it would have been proper for him to cry continuously before God with weeping and supplications, do charity according to his ability, further himself greatly from the things wherein he sinned, change his name, that is to imply, that ‟I am another and not that man who did those evil things,” and he changes his actions for the good to rear himself in the upright path. He imposes exile upon himself because exile atones for transgression, it subdues him and causes him to become humble and meek. And it is most praiseworthy for the penitent to confess publicly and let his sin be known and reveal his sin that is between him and his neighbor to others, saying to them, ‟I have sinned against so and so and such and such have I done to him and this day I return and do penance.” And the proud who do not make known but conceal their sins, their repentance is not complete, as it is written, ‟He that covereth his transgression shall not prosper; but who so confesseth and forsaketh shall obtain mercy” (Prov. 28:13). In what case (who so confesseth … shall obtain mercy)? Only (in cases) concerning transgressions between man and man, but involving those between man and his Master, he does not need to publicize them. It is insolence on his part if he has revealed it to another; instead he returns to his Creator, blessed be He, and enumerates his sins before Him but confesses them before the congregation inexplicitly, (saying) ‟I have sinned.” It is best that he not reveal his transgressions, ‟Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned” (Ps. 32:1).<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">/13/ Rashi, Yoma 21a.<br>______</i>"
Sefer Chasidim 21,"The pious men of olden days were wont to write their transgressions on a tablet when they sinned in order to confess their sins,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ The previous chapter instructs him to enumerate his sins. This can be done if he records them. Hence the custom of the pious (Perush).</i> also in order to remember, regret and do penance. Because if he remembers his transgressions and that in the future he must give an accounting of them,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Another reason for recording them is to fulfill the demands of the verse.</i> he will do penance, therefore it is good to record them, to fulfill that which is written, ‟And my sin is ever before me” (Ps. 51:5). And he remembers the day of death, Gehenna, and the day of judgement and lastly the love of heaven which is the best.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Yoma 86b.</i> Let him write them cryptically in order that nobody sees them. The statement of the rabbis that one who declares his sins is called ‟impudent,” refers to one who enumerates his sins, who tells everyone wherein he sinned. But one is permitted to tell a humble and righteous individual one of his transgressions, that he may be able to teach him how to do penance. Or he should inquire of him inexplicitly, ‟ If a person has committed such a transgression and comes to repent, how does he do penance?” Even though penance and weeping are good for the person at all times, the days between the New Year and the Day of Atonement are better,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Rosh ha-Shanah 18a.</i> and they (penance and weeping) are immediately accepted, as it is written, ‟Seek ye the Lord while He may be found” (Isa. 55:6). This is said only concerning the individual, but with the community, as long as they are doing penance and crying with whole hearts, they are answered, as in a similar matter where it is written, ‟For what great nation is there, that hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is whensoever we call upon Him?” (Deut. 4:7) The Day of Atonement is the day of penance for each individual and the community, it is the time of remission and pardon for all Israel. Therefore, all are enjoined to do penance and to confess on the Day of Atonement. And the commandment concerning confession on the Day of Atonement is that it start while yet day before the individual eats or drinks lest he choke. Let him recite the confessional that is customary ‟But we have sinned,” and this is the quintessence of the Confessional. Transgressions, even though he has confessed them on the Day of Atonement and he is yet within a state of penance, them he confesses on another Day of Atonement, as it is written, ‟For I know my transgression: and my sin is ever before me” (Ps. 51:5).<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Yoma 86b.<br>______</i>"
Sefer Chasidim 22,"He who has sinned in a matter and others are suspected (of it), must say, ‟I am the one that has sinned,” in order that the world not sin because of him in suspecting the innocent.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Yoma 19b; Shabbath 149b.</i> And if he be in the company of people and something improper is done and it is not known who is the sinner, he must say, ‟I am the one that has sinned,” even though he did not sin. For through his confession the sinner will not be shamed, as it happened with Rabbi Meir, ‟It happened with a certain woman who came to the academy of Rabbi Meir that she said to them, ‟One of you betrothed me with intercourse.” Rabbi Meir stood up and wrote a divorce document and gave it to her and so did all.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Sanhedrin 11a.</i> And he who confesses for others is able to say, ‟We have sinned,” and to include himself with them because all Israelites are guarantors for each other.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Shebuoth 39a.</i> And if he saw people sinning and did not reprove them he should confess even though he did not sin.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Shabbath 54b.<br>______</i> And when he confesses let him recall all of his sins as they are.

Sefer Chasidim 23,"Repentance and the Day of Atonement atone only for transgressions between man and his Master,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Maimonides, Hilkhoth Teshuvah, 2:9.</i> for example, one who has eaten something prohibited or has indulged in prohibited cohabitation or the like. But for transgressions between man and his fellowman such as bruising or cursing or robbing and the like, one is never forgiven until he returns the thing that he owes, and appeases the other.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Yoma 85b.</i> Even though he has returned the money that he owes him, he must appease him and seek his forgiveness,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Baba Kamma 92a.</i> and even if he has enraged his friend only with words,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Yoma 87b.</i> he must pacify him and entreat him until he is forgiven.

Sefer Chasidim 27,"Do not say that one need not search his ways and repent but from transgressions which entail action, such as robbing, unchastity, stealing and the like. But as the individual must withdraw and repent of these, so must he search out evil thoughts and repent of them, such as anger, enmity, jealousy, mockery and pursuing gluttony and the like. Of all these he must repent. And these are more difficult than transgressions which possess action. For when a man is habituated in these, it is difficult to withdraw from them after he has become sunken and accustomed to acting. Concerning this it is said ‟Let the wicked forsake his ways” (Isa. 55:7)."

Sefer Chasidim 31,"At all times you should love your Creator with all your heart and all your soul and take counsel with your heart and a lesson from man who is but worms; if a person gives you ten gold pieces or more, how deeply engraved would his love be in your heart.

If an individual says, ‟I will transgress a commandment and with the gold and silver they give me I will fulfill the difficult commandments. With this I will support the poor, invite wayfarers, I will do very many favors.” These are all futile thoughts, for perhaps soon after the transgression he will die and not succeed to the gift. Moreover, if he should not die the money would soon be dissipated so that he dies in his sin. Come and see how much you should love your Creator who does wonderful kindnesses with you, He creates you from a decayed drop, He gives you a soul, draws you forth from the belly, then gives you a mouth with which to speak, a heart to understand, ears to hear the pure words of His mouth, which are refined as silver and pure gold. It is He who leads you on the face of earth, who gives sustenance to all, who causes death and gives life to all. In His hand are the souls of all the living. It is He who distributes your share of bread. What is there to say? for the mouth is unable to speak, the ear unable to hear, for to Him all praise is as silence, there is no end to the length of His days, His years will have no end, He is the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be His name and His fame. It is He who has created the heavens and earth, sea, and all that is therein. He is the provider of all, for His eyes are open upon all men’s paths recompensing each according to his ways and the fruit of his deeds, whether good or bad. Behold it is He who sets forth before men two paths, the path of life and the path of death and says to you, ‟Choose life” (Deut. 30:19).

Therefore it is good for man to remove himself from all appetites and direct his heart to love and fear the Lord with all his heart at all times and to revile the life of vanity. For we will not be able to humble ourselves and subdue our passion which thrusts us from the land of the living, except through subduing our heart and returning to our Maker in complete repentance, to serve Him and to do His will with a whole heart. Our sages have said, ‟Bread and salt shalt thou eat and water in measurement shall you drink <sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Aboth 6:4.</i> and beware of gazing at women which drives a person from the world.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 4:28.</i> Love humans<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 1:12.</i> and judge all people in the scale of merit.”<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 1:6.</i> And this is what the Torah has said, ‟ But in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor” (Lev. 19:15).

His reward is evil, and this is as it has been written after it, ‟Wherefore doth living man complain, a strong man because of his sins” (Lam. 3:39). Come and see how numerous are the afflictions, the fasts and the supplications entreated when his son or one of his loved ones is sick, for then his heart is bitter.

He who relates evil gossip is regarded as if he had denied God,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Arakhin 15a.</i> for it is written after that, they ‟who have said: ‛Our tongue will we make mighty: Our lips are with us: who is our lord over us?’” (Ps. 12:5). Gossip, which knows no limit, see how powerful it is, and let us take a lesson from the ‟spies.”<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ They were sent by Moses to search out the Holy Land. (See Numbers 13 and Deuteronomy 1:22.)</i> Even when one slanders wood and stones, which do not hear and see, there is concern for their shame, so much more when one slanders his neighbor who is created in the (divine) image and likeness, ‟What shall be given thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, Thou deceitful tongue” (Ps. 1:23). The Holy One, blessed be He has said to the tongue, ‟What shall I do to you? All of man’s limbs are from without, you are within. Moreover, I have made for you two walls, one of bone and one of flesh; of bone, the teeth; and of flesh, the lips.” ‟In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression” (Prov. 10:19). A man should always increase (his) silence <sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Maimonides, Hilkhoth Deoth, 2:4.</i> and not speak at all, except (to indulge) in the words of the wise or in matters necessary for the needs of his body. It has been said of Rav, the student of Rabenu (Judah) the Pious, that in all his days he never indulged in idle talk.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Yoma 19b.</i> All who indulge in ordinary talk transgress a positive commandment as it has been said, ‟And shalt talk of them (Deut. 6:7) and not in other matters.”<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> And (we know) that a prohibition which has been derived by implication from a positive command is a positive command.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Yebamoth 56b.</i> Others say, he violates both a prohibition and a positive command, as it is said, ‟all things toil to weariness; man cannot utter it …” (Eccl. 1:8). And even involving bodily needs, let his words not be excessive, but sparing, and concern only those matters which are deemed necessities.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Hagigah 5b.</i> And so with words of Torah let a man’s talk be brief and the content great. For so have the scholars said, ‟let a man always teach his students by way of the short method.” <sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Pesahim 3b.</i> But if his words are many and the content meagre, it is then foolishness, as it is written, ‟And a fool’s voice through a multitude of words” (Eccl. 5:2). A safeguard to wisdom is silence.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ Aboth 3:17.</i> Therefore let a man not be hasty in answering<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ Derekh Eretz Zuta, Chapter II.<br>______</i> nor speak excessively. Also let him teach his student with composure and quietness, without shouting or lengthiness, for ‟the words of the wise (are) spoken in quiet” (Eccl. 9:17)."
Sefer Chasidim 35,"He who speaks and is concerned only with his own words and does not consider God<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Lit “Searcher of kidneys.”</i> Who knows his thoughts, his very coming and going Who counts his steps and before Whose glory and power his words are laid, as it is written, ‟Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? Saith the Lord. Do not I fill heaven and earth? Saith the Lord” (Jer. 23:23); this man is not on a good path. For the nature of man should be to think of his Creator continually and to place Him before himself, as it is written, ‟ I have set the Lord always before me” (Ps. 16:8). When a man sits in solitude, wherever he may be, let him empty his mind of all vain matters and think only of his Creator, of His holiness and wonders and of His favors which He does for us each day. But when a despised man concentrates on idle things or hears vain matters, even though he does not intend to speak, immediately he turns his thoughts to idleness<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Shabbath 149a.</i> with loss to himself for each and every good thought which (rightfully) should be thought of his Creator’s holiness and of His fear so pure. He should be in that good, pure and exalted station to worship God for love and desire of His commands. And this is the grand worship that the ministering angels and the hosts of heaven, who declaim His holiness, employ as it is said, ‟Holy, holy, holy” (Isa. 6:3). Therefore one needs to be careful and not multiply idle talk lest he forget the Lord who is always before him, as the seeing before the blind (so is He) with His presence and strength in all places. And this blind man is one who does not see except through his vain thoughts and does not remember the Lord and removes himself from the standard of truth and fear of Him. For it (fear of God) is not found in his heart because of the hardness of his heart, which is calloused and distant from God, in his mind are found only vain thoughts. Therefore he is not present in the Divine Mind, only through difficulty and force. As the blind person cannot perceive or apprehend the person who is before him if he does not touch him or hear his voice, so too an individual cannot learn and bind God in his heart permanently unless he forsake transgression. For transgressions divide and darken fear of the Lord and change one’s countenance<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed. Horeb. Genesis, Chapter LXXIII, p. 158a.<br>______</i> and so he says, ‟But your iniquities have separated between you and your God” (Isa. 59:2)."
Sefer Chasidim 36,"In the fullness of silence there is reverence.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ <i>Shulhan Arukh,</i> “Orah Hayim,” 1:1, note Isserles.<br>______</i> He who fears God, obeys Him, sees Him, knows Him and searches for Him and is silent because of his fear, is the one who adds to (His) reverence. But if he heightens and raises his voice he diminishes reverence, for he forgets that he stands before God as a blind man who stands before a king. He multiplies words without fearing him, because he does not see whom to fear. He who increases silence because of reverence will not soon come to sin."
Sefer Chasidim 37,"‟The fear of the Lord is clean” (Ps. 19:10). There is no equivocation. A person who finds an occasion to sin (in a situation) where there is no cause to fear others or risk of being shamed and does not permit himself to sin because of fear of God, reflects the essence of reverence. And if he has done so many times, but once succumbed to his evil inclination and did sin, he does not forfeit his other merits. Let neither his hands nor heart weaken from continuing to do good.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Shabbath 31b.<br>______</i> But if he regrets and is sorry for his previous deeds he receives no reward for his troubles in subduing his evil inclination initially. Concerning this it is said, ‟But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity” (Ezek. 18:24) none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered."
Sefer Chasidim 38,"‟Keep thy tongue from evil” (Ps. 34:14) when you reprove your neighbor guard your money.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ The translation is dubious.</i> He whose words exceed his wisdom, his words will be upon him. He whose wisdom exceeds his words, let his words be with him.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Gabirol, <i>Choice of Pearls,</i> ed. Phillipawski, p. 17.</i> This means, he whose words and reproofs of others exceed his understanding, that is to say, he is neither wise nor understanding enough to do as he says and his understanding does not prevail upon him to act in accord with his good words, his words will disgrace him. For listeners will say to everyone, ‟These virtues for which he reproves us, he himself lacks; he preaches well but does not act as well.”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Baba Metzia 107b.<br>______</i> But one whose wisdom exceeds his words, who does not reprove excessively, but only according to the dictates of reason, wisdom, conduct and the loftiest virtues which are within him, his words will be with him, that is to say, the virtues for which he reproves others will be for him an honor and adornment. Listeners will say, ‟All this wisdom and discipline of which he speaks can all be found in him.” This is to teach you that silence is better than excessive talk. For the increase of silence redowns to one’s honor and grace, but excessive talk is a disgrace and shame. Of necessity, he who studies the book of Hasiduth and wisdom will try to act to the extent that he is able to understand, and will not aspire to understand merely to know a book. Merely to relate wisdom serves no purpose for the one who does so, it does not endure except with the one who absorbs it and only then is it of use to the one who relates it. Another explanation of ‟his words exceed his understanding,” is that he says more than is appropriate for him in light of his (own limited) wisdom and understanding. Solomon has said, ‟Overbearing speech becometh not a churl” (Prov. 17:7), then his words will rule over him and he will be caught in their hands. ‟He whose understanding exceeds his words,” i.e., that his wisdom is greater and in excess of his words, is virtuous. From his abundant wisdom he governs his spirit and does not bring words forth except in keeping with his judgement and understanding. His words will be heard, that is to say, they are his and in his possesssion, as ‟My beloved is mine and I am his” (Cant. 2:16)."
Sefer Chasidim 39,"‟A time to keep silence and a time to speak” (Eccl. 3:7) (refers to) when they revile, curse him and say ignoble things (about him), there is (then) to be no reply. ‟And a time to speak,” also refers to when they speak in matters of Law, then is not a time to keep silent.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Hullin 89a.</i> (Another interpretation) also ‟A time to keep silence,” is not to reprimand those whom you know will not accept reproof in the slightest matter.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ This is the preferred reading. Words “those whom you know” are not in text<br>______</i> For it is better that they act inadvertently rather than transgress willfully. ‟And a time to speak,” (refers to) when you are able to protest and your words are heard."
Sefer Chasidim 40,"‟May, but for Thy sake are we killed all the day” (Ps. 44:23). These are people who suffer insult and shame because of the commandments. For when one tells a person it is foolish to fulfill the commandments of fringes and phylacteries and the like, his blood spills as water because of the shame. Scripture regards this as if he had been murdered because of it. One who shames another is regarded as a murderer<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Baba Metzia 58b.</i> and it (sin) withholds him from performing a meritorious deed. This is what Scripture has said, ‟That make a man an offender by words” (Isa. 29:21) and it has been said, ‟Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach” (Ps. 69:8). ‟Still greater is the effect of shame,” our sages have said, ‟in the case of one who commits a sin and is put to shame by it, he is pardoned for all his transgressions.”<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Berakoth 12b.<br>______</i> For it is said, ‟That thou mayest remember and be confounded and never open thy mouth anymore because of thy shame when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord, God” (Ezek. 16:63)."
Sefer Chasidim 41,"If not for ‟shame,” which God created, no one would be free of transgression. Proof of this is that it is more common to murder a person openly than to sleep openly with a woman, even (one’s) own wife. For anger is found in each person, the great, small and elderly alike; but the evil inclination is found only in youths, but not in the small, elderly or the weak. And those youths whose evil inclination overwhelms them are not let off therefrom except because of shame.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Kiddushin 80b.</i> Therefore an individual cannot boast if he has done good and has not sinned since in his youth he was restrained by his parents or by his shame; therefore even if in later life he avoids sin, let him not boast, since he had initially recoiled from sin because of shame."
Sefer Chasidim 42,"Repentance needs four things;<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Saadiah Gaon, <i>The Book of Beliefs and Opinions,</i> trans. Samuel Rosenblatt (4th printing; New Haven, Conn: Yale University Press, 1958), Treatise V, Cahpter V, p. 220.</i> first that he repent for each and every sin, transgression and offense. Secondly, that he forsake them. Thirdly, that he confess them in his heart. Fourthly, that he take upon himself with a whole heart, and resolve in his heart that he will not return to do them (sins) again, lest he appear as one undergoing purification with an unclean creature in his hand.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Taanith 16a.</i> For repentance is of no avail to him until he casts the creature from his hand. Also he needs to single out the sin, as it is written, ‟O, this people have sinned a great sin and have made them a god of gold” (Exod. 32:31). And so should he confess, ‟I pray Thee, O God, I have sinned, I have done perversely, I have transgressed before Thee, I have done such and such, I am sorry I am ashamed of my deeds. And I give witness concerning myself, He who knows all hidden secrets, that I am resolved in my heart not to return to do this again.”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ <i>Pesikta d’Rav Kahana</i>, ed.

Surely after that I was turned, I repented, and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh; I was ashamed, yea, even confounded because I did bear the reproach of my youth” (Jer. 31:17)."

Sefer Chasidim 44,"Four groups do not receive the Divine Presence:<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Sotah 42a.</i> a group of liars; a group of hypocrites; a group of gossipers; a group of scoffers; and all are referred to in Scripture. ‟A group of liars” (is denied the Divine Presence because it is stated) ‟He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before Mine eyes” (Ps. 101:7). And also in the wars of Ahab, when he came and asked the prophets if he should go out and do battle, the spirit of Naboth came before God, and he said: ‟I will go forth and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said: etc…. ‘Go forth’” (I Kings 22:22). And our scholars explain this to mean, ‟Go forth from my precincts.”<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Sanhedrin 102b.</i> ‟Hypocrites” (are denied His presence as it is written), ‟A hypocrite cannot come before Him” (Job 13:16). ‟Those who relate evil gossip” (are denied His presence), for it is said, ‟For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; Evil shall not sojourn with Thee” (Ps. 5:5). Evil (doers) shall not sojourn with you nor enter your precincts. ‟Scoffers” (are denied His presence) ‟The boasters shall not stand in Thy sight” (Ps. 5:6). People who are scoffers confound the world. ‟Evil gossip,” (includes also that which is) intended to dishonor his neighbor, even though it be true.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Maimonides, Commentary on Aboth, Chapter I, p. 16.</i> Even if it becomes a (popular) by-word, it is ignoble to indulge in its use. If one has spread an evil report about his neighbor or has disgraced him with reviling matters of which he had never been suspected and which no one had anticipated (but which were apparently true), the sin of the person who has revealed it is not atoned for, because he cannot set aright that which he has perverted, nor undo the disgrace caused his neighbor, and this is what Solomon said in his wisdom, ‟Lest he that heareth it revile thee” (Prov. 25:10). And so is it taught in the Jerusalem Talmud,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ J. T. Baba Kamma 8:7.</i> ‟He who sins against his neighbor, and then repeatedly goes and asks for his pardon, but his neighbor does not respond, let him form lines of people and pacify him before them. This is what is said, ‟He cometh before men and saith, ‘I have sinned’ against so and so and behold I repent.” And if he does so, he redeems his soul from death, for it is written after that, ‟So He redeemeth his soul from going into the pit” (Job 33:28). Rabbi Jose said, ‟This is said concerning one who does not spread evil reports about his neighbor, but if he does there is absolutely no forgiveness.” If he inflicts pain on an individual it is as though he inflicts pain on the entire world, for everything that is in the world is in man.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> (Berlin: Horeb Publishers, 1924), Pekuday, p. 344.</i> If he spits before him but the spittle does not reach him, he is free from judgement in human law, but guilty under divine law.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Baba Kamma 90a and 91a.</i> Even if he inflicts a small measure of pain he will be punished at the hands of the Lord for each and every hurt which he inflicts upon his neighbor, for it is said, ‟That for all these things God will bring thee into judgement (Eccl. 11:9) concerning every hidden thing” (Eccl. 12:14). And our rabbis elucidate,<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Hagigah 5a.</i> ‟What is meant with ‘concerning every hidden thing’?” This refers to one who kills vermin before his neighbor and disgusts him thereby, others say it refers to one who spits. Therefore all the God-fearing and righteous through whom the Holy One, blessed be He, does not cause any stumbling, let them be cautious to forgive immediately those who kill vermin or spit or do anything repulsive so that there be no stumbling through them (the righteous ).<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Megillah 28a.</i> It is reported of a certain pious man that he covered all the spittle that he found in a place where he knew the offender to be a Jew and would forgive him (the offender). He covered it so that another would not come, see and be disgusted by it, and not pardon the offender, with the result that the offender stumbles thereby. And it is good to follow this procedure.<br/>‟Whether it be good or whether it be evil” (Eccl. 12:14), this ending passage they interpret to mean one who gives charity to the poor publicly.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ Hagigah 5a.</i> For this deed he stands in judgement because he embarasses the recipient. Also, one who gives charity to a woman privately, brings upon himself suspicion, for it is said, ‟Then ye shall be clear before the Lord and before Israel” (Num. 32:22). Moreover, he causes those who suspect him to stumble and be punished because of him, because those who suspect the innocent are flogged.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ Yoma 19b.

For it is impossible to become wise in learning while he is sick or aches in one of his limbs. And when he has a son let him engage in teaching him, perhaps he will become a scholar in Israel.

Similarly, if he merits and remains unconcerned with the pleasures of his body, wealth, or honor, they (heavenly powers) reward him with the very matter which he foregoes. For the king Solomon did not ask for his own perfection either in matters of wealth or ambition, but only in wisdom and understanding, to do his Creator’s will,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ I Kings 3:11.</i> and the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him both, even that for which he did not ask.

Take a lesson from those who guard a king of flesh and blood or one of his chamberlains, he does not raise his eyes because of fear of the king or the chamberlain who is before him; all the more we who stand before the Divine Glory which is constantly before us, should not lift up our eyes.

Sefer Chasidim 58,"‟I will wash my hands in innocency” (Ps. 26:6). He who prays must wash his hands with water<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Berakoth 15a.</i> and recite the blessing for the washing of the hands (one opinion) on account of the vessel which is called <i>antil</i><sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Antlia (Latin)—a machine for drawing water.</i> in the language of our scholars; (another opinion) because he must raise his hands after the washing, corresponding to the expression ‟and he bore them and he carried them” (Isa. 3:69). And in the same manner that he must wash his hands for prayer so must he wash his hands to eat bread,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Hullin 105a.</i> but not so for fruit.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Hagigah 18b.</i> He must dry them well. But he who eats without drying is regarded as if eating unclean bread.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Sotah 4b.</i> It is prohibited to treat the washing of the hands lightly <sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Berakoth 19a.</i> but he washes with plenty of water thoroughly.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ The Perush suggests this reading.</i> And everyone who is circumspect is immediately rewarded in that he becomes rich like Rabbi Hisda, for Rabbi Hisda said, ‟I carry a full hand of water and it gives me a full hand of good.”<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Shabbath 62b.</i> Both for urinating and defecating one recites the blessing ‟on the washing of the hands”<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ <i>Tur</i>, “Orah Hayim,” 7, comment of the Beth Yosef.</i> and ‟who created.” He who has just defecated or urinated and wishes to eat must wash twice. He does not discharge his obligation with one washing, for the recital of the blessing ‟who created” is an interruption constituting a diversion of attention. And he who cleanses his hands with pebbles or rakings recites the blessing ‟on the ‛cleansing’ of the hands.”<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ <i>Shulhan Arukh,</i> “Orah Hayim,” 4:22.</i> In order to eat, he cannot do otherwise but wash them in water.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">/11/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 163:1.</i> Everything that is considered as interposing in the case of ‟immersion,” interposes in the washing of the hands.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">/12/ Hullin 106b.</i> It is fitting that he have coarse flour on hand in a vessel so that if he touches fat or blood or any other prohibited matter, he can remove all the dirt immediately, with the flour, otherwise if he touches any vessel or food it might adhere and he will eat it.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">/13/ <i>Shulhan Arukh,</i> “Orah Hayim,” 157; see Mogen Avraham, note 3.</i> A man should not allow his nails to grow long lest mud gather (in them) and the scholars said, ‟Mud and dough beneath the nails, even against the flesh, interpose in washing,<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">/14/ Mikwaoth 9:2.</i> moreover, tallow or prohibited matter might enter therein and lead him to sin.” It happened that one saw in a dream a deceased righteous man and his face was pale, he said to him, ‟Why is your face pale?” and he replied, ‟Because my fingernails were long and tallow entered beneath them and I ate warm things without cleaning my fingernails,<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">/15/ Moses Premzel, <i>Mateh Mosheh</i> (Warsaw: N.

He who eats and his hands are soiled from eating, and wishes to drink wine, let him wipe his hands and bless the wine and drink, for it is said, ‟Lift up your hands to the sanctuary, And bless ye the Lord” (Ps. 134:2)."
Sefer Chasidim 59,"‟For there is no enchantment with Jacob” (Num. 23:23). Our Creator commanded us, ‟neither shall ye practice divination” (Lev. 19:26).

Not eating eggs refers to the rest of the week.</i> if someone is sick in the house or gave birth within nine days, and many such things that the mouth cannot speak of wherein they transgress the commands of our King. And there is another form of divination quite prevalently practised. Standing and looking into the fire and seeing burning coals, they say, ‟We will have a guest,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Toseftah, Shabbath 7:2.</i> however, if you extinguish it with water the guest will fall into the water,” and there is no divination graver than this. And the contention that this is true and firm and that numerous people have proven it, is but Satan’s doing, it is he who leads them astray. When Satan sees this one divining, and saying, ‟The guest will fall into the water,” then Satan says, ‟I will go and throw the guest into the water in order to deceive him that this be a sign to him to divine for ever.”<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Abodah Zarah 55a.</i> And woe unto those who do so, for they transgress numerous prohibitions such as, ‟Neither shall ye practice divination” (Lev. 19:26).<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ These are negative commandments.</i> ‟There shall not be found among you etc…. one that useth divination” (Deut. 18:10). ‟Neither shall ye walk in their statutes” (Lev. 18:3). Moreover, they render false the testimony of the Torah, ‟For there is no enchantment with Jacob” (Num. 23:23). Those who vow when a headache occurs never to eat from the head of an animal, or when they suffer with their intestines never to eat intestines, follow the customs of the Amorite.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Daath Zekenim Baale Tosafoth, Genesis 32:33.</i> Trust only in the Holy One, blessed be He, and He will cure you. Also we need not be apprehensive about a sign, except in the way our scholars intended (directed us) as in the case where they said, ‟On New Year’s let them eat of the head of a ram, because of the thought, ‛Let it be the <i>head</i> of a good year,’ also of various sweets because of ‛a sweet year,’ ‛let him raise a cock,’ also let him ‛kindle a light in the house that the wind does not extinguish.’”<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Horayoth 12a.</i> Those people that need to fulfill a command such as start the studies of their children, or some such other command, but say, ‟let us wait until the new month,” even though this is not divining it is not good, for who knows whether he will live or die within the month, with the result that he may die and not fulfill the command. The best procedure is to perform a meritorious deed when it presents itself and not postpone it, thus our scholars expounded,<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Rashi, Yoma 33b.</i> ‟And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread” (Exod. 12:17). Do not say <i>matzos</i>, unleavened bread, but <i>mitzvos</i>, commandments, which is to say, if a meritorious deed presents itself to you, do not allow it to become sour but perform it immediately.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ The two words share five letters in common. Adding a <i>vav</i> to the word <i>matzos</i> (unleavened bread) gives us a new Hebrew word meaning “commandments.”<br>______</i> And if he intended to perform a meritorious deed but was accidentally prevented from doing so Scripture credits him as if he had performed<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ Kiddushin 48a.</i> it, for it is said, ‟And that thought upon His name” (Mal. 3:16). The Holy One, blessed be He, equates a good thought with action."
Sefer Chasidim 60,"It is written at the end of Hosea, ‟Return, O Israel, unto the Lord thy God” (Hos. 14:2). Repentance is great in that it reaches the Throne of Glory for it is said, ‟Unto the Lord.”<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Yoma 86a.</i> And it is one of those matters that had preceded the creation of the world.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Pesahim 54a.</i> It is equal in importance to all the sacrifices for it is said, ‟The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit” (Ps. 51:19).

Sefer Chasidim 61,"It is written in Ecclesiastes, ‟Better is a handful of quietness, than both the hands full of labor and striving after wind” (Eccl. 4:6). It is of satisfaction to their Creator that ‟a full hand” is better, i.e., when a man gives to the poor and the God-fearing who declined in their wealth; ‟than both the hands full,” i.e., to the poor that are not worthy but are filled with troublesomeness and bad spirit. Moreover, it is considered a sin on his part<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Baba Kamma 16b.</i> if he gives to sinners, giving them the harlot’s hire (and) strengthening the cause of rebels in the world against the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore a man should always pray that the Holy One, blessed be He, prepare for him worthy people.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ <i>The Zohar,</i> ed. Soncino, I, 334.</i> Another interpretation, ‟better is a handful of quiet” (is to give) charity with a good spirit and without anger, than ‟hands full” (of charity) which he gives grudgingly and with a bad heart, as it is written, ‟and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him” (Deut. 15:10). Yet another interpretation, it is better for a man to support one person, if he has only enough to support one soul properly, than to give to five insufficiently. This results in ‟hands full of labor” because each one still lacks.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Peah 8:5.</i> But if others are also contributing to each of these it is good for him to do likewise.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Maimonides, Commentary on Aboth, Chapter III, p. 15.</i> Concerning this it is said, ‟He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy” (Ps. 12:9).<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Meaning to give to many poor.

Sefer Chasidim 62,"‟Happy is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in His commandments” (Ps. 112:1). Our rabbis expounded, happy is he who repents when he is a man,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Abodah Zarah 19a.</i> that is to say, when he is in his youth and strength, when his passion seizes him and he overwhelms it. ‟That delighteth greatly in His commands” and not in the reward for his commands.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ <i>Ibid.</i></i> And thus is it taught, ‟Be not as slaves who serve the master in order to receive fare and reward.”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Aboth 1:3.</i> Let a man always think himself rewarded and put to his heart these thoughts, ‟if only in all my days I were able to correct the perversities which I committed.

The original seems to convey a more cogent line of argument.</i> For others will be recipients of a false report and they will believe him. What will they do? They will relate to the other man the evil talk that this one spread about him, and he too will come to quarrel with him. The result is that the quarrel comes about through you because you did not listen to him. But if he tells others because he intends to spread an evil report about him, neither oblige nor listen to him. Rebuke him and dismiss him with anger. Go to them, to whom he had spoken and say, ‟Do not believe him, he speaks falsely about his neighbor.” And when you speak about a man or woman don’t relate the bad, tell about their good deeds. Do not praise a man in the presence of his enemy,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Tosafoth, Abodah Zarah, Chapter I.</i> because he cannot bear to hear a good thing about him. As a result he will relate about him that which is shameful saying, ‟Why do you praise him because he did such and such, but did he not do such and such?” <sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Maimonides, Hilkhoth Deoth, 7:4.</i>Let him not praise a rich man before another rich man, nor a scribe before another scribe (similarly) or anyone who is in a like pursuit.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed.

He is not envious of him but rather increases his wisdom saying, ‟I will do as he does.”<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Baba Bathra 21a.</i> And thus is it written, ‟Would that all the Lord’s people were prophets” (Num. 11:29).

Perhaps he speaks about him so because of the profit which the neighbor invites him to share. And so if you hear a man invoke God’s name, for example, he wishes to relate what the Holy One, blessed be He, did for him for the good, namely such and such, do not jump and interrupt him. He may become silent in order to listen to your words and will speak no further about his matters.

Sefer Chasidim 123,"There are two thoughts that are man’s day and night, thoughts about women, and thoughts about money,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Baba Bathra 164a.</i> and because of them he gives his life. There are other thoughts, envy, enmity, haughtiness, the appetites, the enjoyment of his children, the yearning for sons and women, the entertainment of friends, strolls and the most current banal matters.

Another possible meaning is that one should love God no matter what treatment he metes out, good or evil.</i> If wealth is taken from you, do not think after it, everything is for the good. Thus it has been said, “Also unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy for Thou renderest to every man according to his work” (Ps. 62:13). Do not read, “according to his work” but “from his work.” If he has children He takes away his children, if he is wealthy He takes away his wealth during his lifetime, but this is a great kindness for He punishes him in this world of vanity, in order to bring him to the world to come.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Erubin 22a.<br>______</i> Another interpretation of “with all thy might,” with all the depth of your thoughts as “Thy thoughts are very deep” (Ps. 92:6)."

He prays that the Holy One, blessed be He, should ordain for him a good wife, “But a prudent wife is from the Lord” (Prov. 19:14). The custom of the world is that a man follows after a woman, as it is said about Ahab, “Whom Jezebel, his wife, stirred up” (I Kings 21:25). It happened with a certain pious man who married a completely righteous woman but in time he gave her a divorce. He then went and married a wicked woman, a daughter of iniquity, and his former wife married a completely evil man. As a result, the pious man left his virtues and became transformed through the advice of his evil wife; the wicked man, through his wife, repented of his wickedness and became a completely pious man. Therefore every God-fearing man will not take advice from his wife involving the performance of commandments <sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Baba Metzia 59a.</i>because her eye is grudging, even if she is God-fearing. Pray tell, who is greater in fear of God than Sarah, our mother, yet in spite of it all when Abraham said to her, “Make quickly three measures of fine meal” (Gen. 18:6) she prepared to use coarse meal, until he told her fine meal.

(And so) many sinners were thus punished. Take a lesson from a man who breaks the fence (law) of a king of flesh and blood, his sentence is death. How much more is he doomed when he breaks the fence (law) of the King of the World who appoints him as watchman.

Similarly, when the angels said to Balaam, “Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass” (Num. 22:32), why did he not reply “What transgression is it that I hit my ass.” Even the prohibition not to cause pain to a live thing does not apply. She did not buckle because of the load (but because of an angel that blocked the road). Also when she squeezed his leg why should he not hit her? Because he should have reflected, “Perhaps it is without the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, that I curse them. He permitted (me) only to reveal to them the future, for it is said, ‘If the men are come to call thee’ (Num. 22:20), you should tell them of the future.” The Holy One, blessed be He, saw that he (Balaam) would rejoice if he were allowed to curse Israel, and this is what is said, “I have sinned for I know not that thou (angel) stoodest in the way against me” (Num. 22:34). (And yet) on the contrary the reverse stands to reason, because he did not know that he (the angel) stood opposite him he did not sin. However, he said thus, “I sinned because I did not take the pains to know, I did not examine and search into the roots of the (my) transgression.” From this we learn that a man should be deliberate in the fear of the Lord since he is punished because of his ignorance. He must know and investigate, for in the presence of the Ruler you will not be able to plead inadvertence, as Shimei was unable to say to Solomon, “ I forgot that I went out to the river Kidron.”<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ I Kings 2:40.</i> It is for this reason that I said I will write a book for those that fear God lest they think that they are being punished without cause. Heaven forfend, attributing evil to God “For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness” (Ps. 5:5), and it is written “Warn them from Me. When I say unto the wicked: O’ wicked man thou shalt surely die, and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn … the righteous he shall surely live… but thou hast delivered thy soul” (Ezek. 33:7-9). The seven warnings correspond to the (seven) abominations of the heart: “There are six things that the Lord hateth, Yea seven which are an abomination unto Him” (Prov. 6:16); and to, “Seven times more for your sins” (Lev. 26:18). “But thou hast delivered thy soul” (Ezek. 33:9), mark that he does not say “thou hast ‘merited’” or “vindicated” but rather, “thy soul hast thou ‘delivered.’” From this we learn that anyone who has a friend that is being punished and he does not warn him and say to his friend “do not do so,” all the punishment visited upon his friend is attributed to him as if he personally killed his friend, because he should have warned him but he did not.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Shabbath 55a.</i> Moreover, we exact from him the blood of his friend, concerning him it is said, “His blood will I require at thy hand” (Ezek. 33:8). For this reason have I prepared this Book of Reverence so that those who fear the word of God be circumspect. And furthermore my son be admonished,<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Ecclesiastes 12:12.<br>______</i> (beforewarned) if I have been mistaken let the wise man set it aright and understand in order to fear God all of the days in truth."

Sefer Chasidim 155,"The beginning of wisdom is fear of God.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ (Perush.) This is the preferred sequence. In the original text the first verse “the beginning of wisdom” appears later.</i> This is the foundation for God-fearing men. When you set out to do anything think (of it as) if another person were doing it and asked for your advice: what would you say to him? So did the rabbis say, “That which also honors him in the sight of mankind.” <sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Aboth 2:1.</i>As you advise others so do for yourself. The beginning of wisdom is to acquire wisdom. When your son reaches the age of learning, acquire for him a teacher who is a scholar, and God-fearing, for it is written “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge” (Prov. 1:7). This is to introduce him to the fear of the Lord. In addition, from all firstlings give Him, “The first of all the first fruits of everything, and every heave offering of everything” (Ezek. 44:30). So too, give Him the beginning of the day and night (in which) to bless Him for that which man enjoys day and night.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ J. T. Yoma 1:1, also <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed. Horeb, Leviticus, Chapter XXVI, p. 69.</i> Thus does he say, “When I behold the heavens the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast established” (Ps. 8:4). It is He who brings on the evening twilight and forms light when you arouse from your sleep and awaken. She<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ “She” refers to Torah.</i> will speak to you, and when you open your eyes put upon your heart your tasks and needs,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ This is a paraphrase of Proverbs 6:22.</i> but prior to setting yourself aright there is fear of the Lord, as it is written “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge” (Prov. 1:7). How so? When a man leaves prison he is obliged to thank the Holy One, blessed be He, and inasmuch as there is no greater imprisonment than sleep,<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ Berakoth 60b.</i> he must bless the Holy One, blessed be He, because prior to awakening there was no power to do anything nor mastery over body. Bless Him for every limb with which you perform your work which was previously immobilized but is now useful. And concerning the hands which were initially in a state of uncleanliness with the spirit of uncleanliness prevailing over them,<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Yoma 77b.</i> in order that you not be harmed, wash your hands. Similarly do not put your hands to your eyes until you wash them. Our scholars instituted blessings for every activity. It happened with a certain pious man who recited a blessing for each and every limb and Scripture supported him “My heart and my flesh sing for joy unto the living God” (Ps. 84:3). And it is written, “All my bones shall say, Lord who is like unto Thee” (Ps. 35:10), and he prayed for all of the limbs that were created part of him that they serve Him who created them for His glory and that they not sin against Him. For the Holy One, blessed be He, puts into the heart of the good that they (do) not sin against Him, nor that sin be brought about through them, for it is said, “There shall no mischief befall the righteous” (Prov. 12:21).<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">/8/ Yebamoth 120a.</i> Good and evil inclinations can serve beneficent ends with the righteous. He sees how the wicked with deliberate cunning seek to fulfill their lusts even but for a moment, and because of their appetites they often place their lives in danger for (this) momentary fulfillment, as in the case of robbers, thieves, and adulterers, who do so, all for the sake of questionable results.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ They don’t know if they will succeed.</i> But I have all the more need to be cunning because of the Holy One, blessed be He, who grants to His loved ones their desires in the hereafter and for eternity supreme joys far beyond the voluptuous indulgences of the wicked.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ This is the preferred reading. (See Mekor Hesed, note 10.)</i> If man’s good inclination overpowers him to do good, as the evil inclination bends him toward the lusts of his flesh and his ambitions, then with ingenious cunning he would seek to fulfill the desires of heaven. That person who has the ability to do everything that his heart desires, and it is possible for him to do it without risk of shame, he need not be so cunning in the matter. But where the power is not within him to do that which the heart desires, because of so and so and because of someone in such a matter, then he must be cunning so as to make the desires of his heart such that this other matter does not harm him. Since all of these matters involve depth of wisdom and great exertions which are found in those who lust, and are jealous and pursue honor, (therefore) he who fears the word of God sees how they search and lurk to fulfill their lusts which are momentary and questionable of achieving, and they hurl their souls from the distance, so much the more (let him apply this tenacity to himself) myself.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">/11/ “I need to be cunning.”</i> “But I will be hallowed among the children of Israel” (Lev. 22:32) refers to those who are slain in Sanctification of the Name,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">/12/ <i>Sifra,</i> ed. Weiss, p. 99b.</i> for it is said “Nay but for Thy sake are we killed all the day” (Ps. 44:23). Behold, the evil inclination is good for man, for if there is no evil inclination to govern man, of what significance is the reward which he receives for doing good.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">/13/ Baba Kamma 38a.</i> Now that his evil inclination overwhelms him and he subdues it because of the Holy One, blessed be He, he receives the good reward. For those that are evil the good inclination is bad, because if they did not taste the good inclination they would have been able to say we did not know the value of the good inclination. If anything presents itself to you in accord with the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, but because of shame you desist from doing it and the matter seems awkward to you or if your evil inclination overpowers you to transgress or to act,<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">/14/ Used here in the sense “to act wrongly.”</i> reflect accordingly. If you were living at a time of religious persecution, you would have been visited by all afflictions, even death, for the sake of the Creator, for it is said, “Therefore do the maidens love thee” (Cant. 1:3).<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">/15/ <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed. Horeb, Song of Songs, Chapter I, p. 11.</i> If they wanted to kill you or inflict punishment upon you to the extent that death would be preferable to life, you would endure them, all the more in this matter which is not so great, where your evil inclination overpowers you. And the person that overwhelms his evil inclination receives greater reward than for a hundred commandments where his evil inclination did not incite, overwhelm or compel him to sin. For they said, there is no reward for meritorious deeds that they shall perform in the hereafter.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">/16/ For there is no evil inclinations.</i><br/>“Before the evil days come” (Eccl. 12:1). These are the years of old age<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">/17/ <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed. Horeb, Ecclesiastes, Chapter XII, p. 128.</i> and the weariness of years of which you say, “I have no pleasure in them” (Eccl. 12:1), which are the days of the Messiah which have neither merit nor guilt It is therefore better to do that thing wherein the evil inclination overpowers him<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">/18/ Baba Metzia 32b.</i> but he subdues his inclination because of the Creator, rather than commandments wherein the evil inclination does not assert itself. You shall not say behold the commandments are of equal weight, the light ones as the more serious ones. He carries greater sin in a hundred commandments where the inclination does not bother him and he transgresses, than in those commandments where the inclination opposes him.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">/19/ Menahoth 43b.</i> This is a parable to a king of flesh and blood who commands his servants to go to a certain place. One comes and says to his (the king’s) servant, “do not go to that place where the king sends you, and I will give you a pound of gold,” the servant accepts and does not go. The other does not go because one promises to give to him two pennies. Behold this one accepts but two pennies his punishment is greater, because he voids the will of the king in a small matter. Similarly, this one who sins in a matter where his evil inclination does not overpower him his punishment is greater. Anything that comes to your hand to do and you do not do because of the shame, lest they call you “pious fool,” consider yourself as if living during time of religious persecution; you would (suffer death) over a light transgression even a shoestrap,<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">/20/ Sanhedrin 74a.<br>/21/ Toseftah, Baba Kamma, Chapter VII.</i> (therefore say) all the more that I will subdue my passion which is given into my hand. If you stole learning it will suffice for you. And if the shame embarrasses you, behold it is for you as an atoning sacrifice.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">/22/ Berakoth 12b.</i> Better that you be embarrassed before a hundred and not be embarrassed before tens of thousands after death.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">/23/ Kiddushin 81a.</i> And so he who withholds himself from a meritorious deed because of shame whether in a positive commandment or in a prohibitory commandment, he will be shamed publicly after his death in their presence and perhaps even in his lifetime, as with Zedekiah who said, “Lest they deliver me into their hand and they mock me” (Jer. 38:19), he did not submit to the Lord and they blinded him.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">/24/ II Kings 25:7.</i><br/>Consider the two letters <i>kof kof,</i> “For every boot stamped …”<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">/25/ The letter appears both in the verse from Isaiah and in the verse from Deuteronomy. The letter <i>kof</i> has two forms, one is a final letter used at the end of a word, the other is for initial and medial use. The <i>kof</i> in the verse from Isaiah begins the quotation and is the initial letter for the word “all.” The <i>kof</i> in medial form appears in the last word which concludes the quotation from Deuteronomy. Here again the word is “all.”</i> (Isa. 9:4) for the entire world is judged measure for measure for it is said, “because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the Lord shall send against thee in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things” (Deut. 28:47). And all who have mercy on the cruel show no mercy to the merciful. A man who is obliged to have mercy upon others, such as his sons, his daughters, his brother and his near ones, and they are in need and he is able to feed them but does not, behold everything that he possesses will come into the hands of others and he will receive for this neither merit nor credit.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">/26/ i.e., into the hands of his sons, daughters, and relatives.</i> Even if he supports others, but knows that his father, mother and brothers are poor and does not support them, in the end these others that he supports will deal cruelly and mercilessly with him; they will become his enemies and not consider it as a favor the kindness that he did with them. For there is a matter for which a person receives no merit if he does it, but if he does not do it, it is regarded as evil. For instance a man and his wife who love their children and they possess the means for their support and have mercy upon them, behold this is no merit or righteousness<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">/27/ Ketuboth 50a.</i> because out of love they do this for them, as in the case of dogs, bears and all animals who put their lives in danger to bring prey to their offspring.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">/28/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 49a.<br>______</i> If parents do not support their children or if they strike them unnecessarily or show no mercy to them or never admonish them and their offspring have nothing, the parent’s transgression is grave. Therefore a father who does favors for some of his children and reviles others and does no good for them, him that he loathes will be his heir."
Sefer Chasidim 156,"If you see three generations or more, one after the other, all scholars, but then their children are illiterate, do not say that the words of the scholars are voided because they said, “‘Thy words shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed’ (Isa. 59:21), thereafter Torah will no longer cease from among them.” <sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Baba Metziah 85a.</i> Behold they have become wedded to a family whose destiny is not to have scholars in its midst,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed.

And if you see that in the fourth generation the God-fearing and pious cease, it is then apparent that they intermarried with those to whom they were not suited, for instance he is not God-fearing or pious, therefore the generation is such. Therefore let a man seek favor each day for himself, his children and grandchildren, that they be joined to a partner who is God-fearing, possesses Torah and deeds of loving kindness,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ These three virtues correspond to the “three fold chord” of the verse.</i> for it is said concerning these three “and the threefold cord is not quickly broken.” For the three words, Torah, fearing and loving kindness are all equal numerically, (fear is equal to Torah, and Torah is equal to loving kindness)<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ Although found in the text it is repetitive, nevertheless we left it but in parenthesis.</i> for concerning “fear” it is written “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do thereafter” (Ps. 111:10).

Behold “fear” is prior to “all they that do thereafter” i.e., “The fear” of God and “love …” “to walk in all His ways” (Deut. 10:12). “A good understanding have all they that do thereafter” (Ps. 111:10), “That ye may make all that ye do to prosper” (Deut. 29:8)."

Moreover, “eighteen fears” correspond to the eighteen points<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Hullin 42a.</i> upon which life is dependent, for if you fear the Holy One, blessed be He, He will guard your life and this is as it is said, “The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death” (Prov. 14:27). When Abraham wished to take the life of his son Isaac, he was then called God-fearing, for it is said, “for now I know that Thou art a God-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son” (Gen. 22:12). The “eighteen fears” correspond to the Eighteen Benedictions of the Silent Prayer. And if you say, what of the verse, “A wise man feareth and departeth from evil but the fool behaveth overbearingly and is confident” (Prov. 14:16) where the blessing of the Lord does not occur, there is, however, the blessing against the heretics.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ “Fear” in Proverbs stands in apposition to the blessing against the heretics in the “Eighteen Benedictions.” This makes for Nineteen Benedictions! See Daily Prayer Book, ed. Hertz, p. 143.</i> (And if you ask what of the verse) “Who so despiseth the word shall suffer thereby; But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded” (Prov. 13:13), (it is) in apposition to the first blessing of the Eighteen Benedictions which commences with “Blessed be He.” Why are these “eighteen fears” made to correspond with the Eighteen Benedictions, for when a man prays, he must stand in fear,<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">/7/ Berakoth 30b.<br>/8/ <i>Ibid.</i>, 29b.</i> for it is said “Serve the Lord with fear, And rejoice with trembling” (Ps. 2:11), and it is written “They shall fear Thee while the sun endureth” (Ps. 72:5), which our Rabbis explained (to mean) “pray at the setting of the sun.” Moreover, why as against (in apposition to) “Fear of the Lord” does it state “Blessed is the Lord,” (it is to say) that he should not run in prayer as if (to show) he is happy that he is finished. But with every word and everything that he says let him concentrate to put devotedness into his heart. One should consider, if there is a matter to entreat and ask for of a king of flesh and blood, would he favor you or countenance you if you hurry your words before him? Let alone would he not do your bidding, but he will say that you can mean only to mock, and he would drive you away. Do not regard the Crowner of kings less than the kings who are beneath Him. If you come to praise and adore Him, consider this for a moment, if you were to hear a sweet voice and song of praise rushed and hurried without intonation, how acceptable would it be? Therefore it (prayer) is not to be done hurriedly, but with deliberation and a sweet and loud voice, for it is said “And many shouted aloud for joy” (Ezra 3:12). It is said<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">/9/ J. T. Berakoth 1:1.</i> that when they walked in the temple court they walked heel to toe so that the worship of the Lord not appear as a burden. Concerning this it is said “And their course is evil and their force is not right” (Jer. 23:10). Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, created the cock’s crowing that we learn a lesson from him, for it is said, “And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven” (Job 35:11). You would not be proper if you spoke before a king of flesh and blood, and your words were hurried, and if you sang for your pleasure you would prolong your voice, how then can you hurry before the supreme King of kings. You should therefore bless Him with your voice, and not make it as a chore that issues from your mouth. It is only right that when you utter words of supplication you say them in an entreating manner, for it is said “The poor useth entreaties” (Prov. 18:23). When a man entreats a ruler he does not hurry his words but on each matter he concentrates so as not to be mistaken with his words. Before he entreats a ruler or king he sets forth his petition orderly<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">/10/ Rosh ha-Shanah 35a.</i> that he not falter nor forget nor skip a letter. So should you do, for it is written, “Will thy riches avail, that are without stint” (Job 36:19), and he says further, “Take with you words” (Hos. 14:3). When you recite blessings and praises, make it as though you stand before a king and he says to you, “Let me hear your voice.” Do not hurry your words and do not be anxious to speak. If you need sustenance, do not put your heart only to that blessing such as the blessing of “years.”<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">/11/ <i>Daily Prayer Book,</i> ed. Hertz, p. 141.</i> If you have an illness do not set your heart only to the blessing for “illness,”<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">/12/ <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 140.</i> because they (will) say about you on high, “This individual imagines that he has need only of this.”<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">/13/ Erubin 65a.</i> Therefore let him (a person) be devoted in all the blessings. For behold the “eighteen fears of God” should be before him and he should be reverent of all the blessings. Do not direct your thoughts only to the supplications, for the essence of devotion is for the blessings and praises. They therefore said,<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">/14/ Berakoth 34b.</i> let him direct his heart toward all of them. If it is impossible let him direct himself to the blessing of <i>Ovos</i> or toward the blessing of “thanksgiving.”<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">/15/ <i>Daily Prayer Book,</i> ed. Hertz, p. 148.</i> For if you direct yourself only to the (personal) entreaties there will be a hindrance from above,<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">/16/ Sanhedrin 44b.</i> it will be said that it is not proper to accept his prayer, for with the honor of the Lord he is not concerned to seek Him with devotedness and with supplication. How can we do his will if he is concerned only with his own welfare and not in adoration. Therefore it is good to pray and to direct oneself with joy and honor to the Holy One, blessed be He, to pray with devotion and not to speak to anyone before completing the service but recite those things that initially subdue the heart with mercy. And when you pray add in each and every blessing your request in keeping with the nature of the prayer <sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">/17/ Berakoth 29b.</i> for they do best to prepare the heart. If you cannot add because the congregation already finished (the prayer), add in only one or two in order that you do not hurry in another blessing. You may add as we have outlined in the Order of Supplication.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">/18/ See <i>S. H. Bologna,</i> Section 171.</i> If you cannot add, search out for yourself other melodies and when you pray recite them (the prayers) in that melody which is pleasing and sweet in your eyes, in that melody recite your prayers and recite your prayers with devotion and let your heart be drawn after that which comes out of your mouth. For a matter of request and entreaty select a melody which prepares the heart. For praise, a melody which rejoices the heart, in order that your mouth brims with love and joy for Him who sees your heart. And you are to praise Him with broad love and rejoicing. All of those things prepare the heart.<br/><i>Lamed,</i> why is this letter called <i>lamed?</i> Because of the verse “That thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always”<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">/19/ The Hebrew word “to learn” shares a common root with the letter <i>Lamed.</i></i> (Deut. 14:23). For this reason David indicated with the letter <i>lamed</i> the teaching of fear “Come, ye children, harken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord” (Ps. 34:12). Why does he say “children”? Because one who studies in childhood is not like one who learns in his old age. A son whose father led him in good deeds from his early years onward is like one who is accustomed to travel in a wilderness and is trained to find his way to the city. Similarly, he is like one who is accustomed to go by ship on the sea and knows how to direct the ship to the desired harbor. But he who does not know how to go, will go hither and yon, for it is said, “For he knoweth not how to go to the city” (Ecc. 10:15). And again, one who learns in his early years is likened to the sun, moon, stars, and zodiac, for they go in an upright path as it is said, “But they that love Him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might” (Judg. 5:31). And this is as it is said, “But unto you that fear My name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings” (Mal. 3:20). Therefore it is said, “Come, ye children, etc.… I will teach you the fear of the Lord” (Ps. 34:12). This is the teaching of the secret of fear. The letter <i>lamed</i> is larger than all the letters,<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">/20/ Height-wise, <i>lamed</i> is taller than all other letters.<br>______</i> for the discipline of fear is greater than all, for it is said, “O, that they had such a part as this always, to fear Me etc.…” (Deut. 5:26). Behold before him is the greatest of all, therefore <i>lamed</i> is greater than all the letters and its name is greater than all and it is written, “Happy is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in His commandments” (Ps. 1:12)."
Sefer Chasidim 159,"“Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars” (Prov. 9:1). These seven passages in Scripture have coupled in them wisdom and reverence.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Each contains references to wisdom and God-fearing.</i> And these are them, “And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord” (Isa. 11:2). “And the stability of thy times shall be a hoard of salvation—wisdom and knowledge, and the fear of the Lord which is His treasure” (Isa. 33:6). “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, a good understanding have all they that do thereafter” (Ps. 111:10). “And unto man He said: ‘Behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding’” (Job 28:28). “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but the foolish despise wisdom and discipline” (Prov. 1:7). “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the All-holy is understanding” (Prov. 9:10). “The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor goeth humility” (Prov. 15:33). Behold there are seven passages relating to wisdom and reverence for the Lord corresponding to the seven matters that are evil for the soul and draw her to sins, for it is said, “There are six things which the Lord hateth, Yea, seven which are an abomination unto Him” (Prov. 6:16). Moreover, the seven correspond to seeing, hearing, speaking, working with one’s hands, going on one’s feet, cohabiting, plotting evil in one’s heart. They also correspond to seven movements in man: standing on one foot; moving hands and feet; standing on knees; sitting and lying in four positions: i.e., on two sides (left and right), leaning on the head or on the face. Another interpretation of “seven organs,” (is that it applies to) eyes, ears, a mouth to bring forth words, a throat to bring in food and drink, hands, feet, genitals, these are “She hath hewn out her seven pillars.” “Hath builded her house” (Prov. 9:1), for all of them (organs) depend upon the chamber of the heart <sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ J. T. Terumoth 8:4.</i> which leads wisdom to contain and restrain his spirit in the fear of God. Concerning the seven transgressions wherein I wrote that the heart is their master, there are corresponding to them seven groups which receive the Divine Presence.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed. Horeb, Leviticus, Chapter XXX, p. 81a.<br>______</i>"
Sefer Chasidim 160,"If you were put to a test and you kept yourself from sinning, do not boast of it saying, “I withstood the test.”<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ <i>Midrash Rabbah</i>, ed. Horeb, Genesis, Chapter LII, p. 110.</i> Perhaps your forefathers came to the same test and did not sin and they asked of the Holy One, blessed be He, that when their sons come to the same test they be given the power to keep from sinning,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> ed. Horeb, Leviticus, Chapter XXXII, p. 88.</i> for it is said, “God will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt offering my son etc.… and Abraham called the name of that place Adonaijireh”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ See Perush.</i> (Gen. 22:8-15). His children will be slaughtered in Sanctification of the Name and burnt like Isaac.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ And do not sin.</i> You should bless the Holy One because he strengthened you over your inclination, and gave you a heart to be victorious over your evil inclination,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Kiddushin 30b.<br>______</i> for it is said, “God left him to try him” (II Chron. 32:31). “Left him,” from this it is apparent that all is in His hand. For this reason David entreated Him, for it is said, “Make one my heart to fear Thy name” (Ps. 86:11), and it is written, “And renew a steadfast spirit within me” (Ps. 51:12)."
Sefer Chasidim 161,"If you withstood a great test still do not be confident of yourself until the day of death,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">/1/ Aboth 2:5.</i> to say, “Since I did not sin in this great matter, I will no longer sin.” Because the evil inclination today is not the same as yesterday, therefore perhaps in the very same matter (test) tomorrow you will be unable to endure. Behold David did not sin with Abigail<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">/2/ Megillah 14b.</i> but he sinned with Bathsheba, David did not sin with his pursuers who sought to kill him<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">/3/ Berakoth 62b.</i> and did not raise his hand upon the annointed of God and did not give permission to Avishai to strike him,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">/4/ He allowed no one to strike Saul.</i> but in the end he did sin with Uriah, who sought his (David’s) wellbeing.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">/5/ Shabbath 56a.</i> But if you say, “I can believe in myself since I was rescued from a great transgression,” then you hold yourself more righteous than those on high. Not only that, but you regard yourself and your wisdom superior to Him who created you, for it is said, “Behold, He putteth no trust in His holy ones” (Job 15:15), “And His angels He chargeth with folly” (Job 4:18). If the Holy One, blessed be He, who knows what the future will be, does not trust His angels and His holy ones, you, with your thoughts changing from good to evil all the more that you should not be confident in yourself, and thus it is said, “Happy is the man that feareth always” (Prov. 28:14) that he not sin. “Lamed,” signifies “Your heart, fill it with understanding,”<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">/6/ The <i>lamed</i> is used as an acrostic. The “l,” “m” and “d” serve as the first letters for each of the three words that comprise the passage.</i> to know the fear of the Lord, and it is written, “ Teach me good discernment and knowledge … teach me Thy statutes” (Ps. 119:66-68)."
