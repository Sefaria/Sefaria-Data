<p align="blockquote">In the name of God who commands</p>
<p align="blockquote">that a fire offering be brought before him.</p>
<p align="blockquote">I begin to explain the book</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>And The Lord Called Unto Moses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>1. AND THE LORD CALLED. We find two reasons for the covenant made with an individual.<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> It is also possible for one commandment to have many reasons. The commandment regarding the burnt offering and the sacrifice<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> are examples of the latter, for when the officiant offers each part<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> in its proper time, then the part<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> which has a part<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> in the world to come is saved.<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> Therefore the meaning of <italic>le-khapper</italic> (to make atonement) (v. 4) is to give ransom. The opening of the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic><sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> Scripture therefore reads, <italic>lest He</italic><sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> <italic>fall upon us with pestilence</italic><sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> (Ex. 5:3). There is also a secret<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup> regarding the future in the burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup> One can also learn from each sacrifice the secret of nature.<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup> The purpose of the sin offering<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup> and the unleavened bread<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> is to sustain the teachers of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reason <italic>And the Lord called unto Moses</italic> follows <italic>And Moses was not able to enter</italic><sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup> (Ex. 40:35) is that the Glory<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup> called to Moses from the tent of meeting and told him to come there, and there He would speak with him.<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> The Glory was on the other side of the curtain<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup> and Moses entered there.<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> The latter is clearly stated in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>and the similitude of the Lord doth he behold</italic> (Num. 12:8).</p>
<p>The reason Scripture mentions the sacrifices before the commandments<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup> is that God&#x2019;s presence will return to its place<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> if Israel does not keep the law of the burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup> The latter came to pass.<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup> Far be it from God to require a burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> Scripture clearly states, <italic>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee&#x2026;</italic>(Ps. 50:12).<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup> On the contrary, it<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> has a secret meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. OF YOU. The word <italic>mikkem</italic> (of you) is placed at the end of the clause.<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> The clause should be read as if written, <italic>adam mikkem ki yakriv</italic> (when any man of you bringeth an offering). There are many such examples.<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> On the other hand, the word <italic>mikkem</italic> might mean from your property.<sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> The term <italic>mikkem</italic> might also hint that one is not permitted to bring an offering that is stolen,<sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup> for Scripture states, <italic>I hate robbery with iniquity</italic> (Is. 61:8).<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF THE CATTLE. Shall the sacrifice be. This<sup><xref rid="fn37">37</xref></sup> is a general term. Scripture then gives the particulars and states, <italic>even of the herd</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn38">38</xref></sup> <italic>or of the flock</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup> The flock refers to the species of the sheep and the goat. <italic>Your offering</italic><sup><xref rid="fn40">40</xref></sup> is also a general term.</p>
<p>3. IF HIS OFFERING BE A BURNT&#x2013;OFFERING. This<sup><xref rid="fn41">41</xref></sup> is a particular. The term <italic>olah</italic> (burnt offering) is self-explanatory.<sup><xref rid="fn42">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF THE HERD. Fully grown or young but more than eight days.<sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup> The burnt offering is brought from the choicest animals because it is entirely for God. The male is chosen above the female. Therefore a female animal is not brought for a burnt offering.</p>
<p>WITHOUT BLEMISH. <italic>Tammim</italic> means without blemish.<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> After stating <italic>he shall offer it</italic>, Scripture goes on to explain the place where the celebrant is to bring it. It states that he is to enter into the courtyard of the tent of meeting.<sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>BEFORE THE LORD. This is to be understood as connected to <italic>he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn46">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT HE MAY BE ACCEPTED<sup><xref rid="fn47">47</xref></sup> BEFORE THE LORD. He shall offer it willingly, not by coercion.</p>
<p>4. AND HE SHALL LAY HIS HAND. It would appear from the plain meaning of the text that the celebrant lays one hand<sup><xref rid="fn48">48</xref></sup> on the animal about to be sacrificed, for the manner of the scapegoat<sup><xref rid="fn49">49</xref></sup> is unlike all sacrifices.<sup><xref rid="fn50">50</xref></sup> Scripture therefore changed [the manner of the laying of the hands with regard to it].<sup><xref rid="fn51">51</xref></sup> However, we find that the sages who transmitted the laws to us stated that all &#x201C;laying&#x201D; is done with two hands.<sup><xref rid="fn52">52</xref></sup> We rely on them.</p>
<p>The body<sup><xref rid="fn53">53</xref></sup> which is offered to atone for that which comes (<italic>ha-olah</italic>) into the mind<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup> is called an <italic>olah</italic> (burnt offering). The sacrifices brought for sins and guilt are also called <italic>chattat</italic> (sin offering) and <italic>asham</italic> (guilt offering).<sup><xref rid="fn55">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND IT SHALL BE ACCEPTED<sup><xref rid="fn56">56</xref></sup> FOR HIM. He will obtain favor from God.</p>
<p>TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HIM.<sup><xref rid="fn57">57</xref></sup> To serve as a ransom for the punishment due him.</p>
<p>5. BEFORE THE LORD. Like the burnt offering of the flock, on the side of the altar northward, opposite the table.<sup><xref rid="fn58">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>and he shall kill</italic> is that the <italic>kohen</italic> shall kill. One slaughters<sup><xref rid="fn59">59</xref></sup> and many dash the blood.<sup><xref rid="fn60">60</xref></sup> Scripture clearly states this i.e., <italic>and Aaron&#x2019;s sons delivered unto him the blood</italic> (Lev. 9:12).</p>
<p>Scripture states, <italic>that is at the door of the tent of meeting</italic> because it wants to exclude the altar of incense.<sup><xref rid="fn61">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND HE SHALL FLAY. A <italic>kohen</italic> or a Levite accompanies him.<sup><xref rid="fn62">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND THE SONS OF AARON THE PRIEST. Levites shall not approach.<sup><xref rid="fn63">63</xref></sup> This commandment was given to the <italic>kohanim</italic>. Not less than two<sup><xref rid="fn64">64</xref></sup> are required.<sup><xref rid="fn65">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND THE SUET. Many wise men of the generation explain that the word <italic>pader</italic> (suet) refers to the carcass. However, in my opinion the <italic>pader</italic> refers to the fat. Our verse is to be understood as follows: <italic>And Aaron&#x2019;s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces</italic>, that is, the pieces of the carcass;<sup><xref rid="fn66">66</xref></sup> <italic>and the head, and the suet</italic>, that is, the fat. A connective <italic>vav</italic> is missing from the word <italic>ha-rosh</italic> (and the head).<sup><xref rid="fn67">67</xref></sup> This is in keeping with the style of the language.<sup><xref rid="fn68">68</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>odem pitidah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn69">69</xref></sup> <italic>u-vareket</italic> (carnelian, topaz, and smargd) (Ex. 28:17).</p>
<p><italic>And he shall cut it into its pieces</italic> (v. 12)<sup><xref rid="fn70">70</xref></sup> and along with the pieces, its head and its suet.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <italic>et ha-rosh</italic> (and the head) might mean with the head.<sup><xref rid="fn71">71</xref></sup> There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn72">72</xref></sup> The proof of this<sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup> is: <italic>Moses made the head, and the pieces, and the suet smoke</italic> (Lev. 8:20).</p>
<p>SHALL LAY THE PIECES. Scripture reads <italic>ve-arekhu</italic> (shall lay)<sup><xref rid="fn74">74</xref></sup> because it speaks of a bullock, a large animal.<sup><xref rid="fn75">75</xref></sup> Regarding a sheep,<sup><xref rid="fn76">76</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>and the priest shall lay</italic><sup><xref rid="fn77">77</xref></sup> <italic>them</italic> (v. 12).</p>
<p>9. SHALL HE WASH WITH WATER. A <italic>kohen</italic> or a Levite. Scripture therefore has to add the word <italic>kohen</italic> to <italic>shall make the whole smoke</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn78">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>A BURNT-OFFERING. The word <italic>isheh</italic> (burnt offering) is an adjective. It means a fire offering. It describes the word <italic>hakol</italic> (the whole).<sup><xref rid="fn79">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>A SWEET SAVOUR. The word <italic>nicho&#x2019;ach</italic> (a sweet savour) is self-explanatory.<sup><xref rid="fn80">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. ON THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR. On the outside.<sup><xref rid="fn81">81</xref></sup> Similarly [<italic>Even mount Zion</italic>], <italic>the uttermost part</italic> (yarkete) <italic>of the north</italic><sup><xref rid="fn82">82</xref></sup> (Ps. 48:3). For many err and say that the tower of Zion<sup><xref rid="fn83">83</xref></sup> was in the midst of Jerusalem.<sup><xref rid="fn84">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. TURTLE-DOVES. Fully grown, not young.</p>
<p>YOUNG PIGEONS. Scripture reads <italic>bene yonah</italic> (young pigeons) because it wants to exclude fully grown pigeons. It therefore does not say <italic>yonim</italic> (pigeons).<sup><xref rid="fn85">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. PINCH. The word <italic>malak</italic> (pinch) has no brother in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn86">86</xref></sup> We know the laws of &#x201C;pinching&#x201D; from our tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn87">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE BLOOD THEREOF SHALL BE DRAINED OUT. <italic>Ve-nimtzah</italic> (shall be drained out) is a <italic>nifal</italic>. It is related to the word <italic>matzit</italic> (drained) (Is. 51:17).</p>
<p>16. ITS CROP. The meaning of <italic>murato</italic> (its crop) is known.<sup><xref rid="fn88">88</xref></sup> The word <italic>more&#x2019;ah</italic> (filthy) in <italic>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted</italic> (Zeph. 3:1) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn89">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH THE FEATHERS THEREOF. The meaning of <italic>be-not-zatah</italic> is, with the feathers thereof.<sup><xref rid="fn90">90</xref></sup> The word <italic>notzah</italic> (feathers) in <italic>Full of feathers</italic> (Ezek. 17:3) is similar.</p>
<p>BESIDE THE ALTAR. On the outside.<sup><xref rid="fn91">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>ON THE EAST PART. For it is far from the place of the Glory.<sup><xref rid="fn92">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THE PLACE OF THE ASHES. They shall also place it there.<sup><xref rid="fn93">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND HE SHALL REND IT. The word <italic>ve-shissa</italic> (and he shall rend it) is related to <italic>ve-shosa&#x2019;at shesa</italic> (and is wholly cloven) (Lev. 11:3). The meaning of <italic>shissa</italic> is split.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. This poem is omitted in the printed editions of I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Hebrew, <italic>berit yachid</italic>. The reference is to the covenant of circumcision that God made with Abraham (Gen. 17:9). The commentaries on I.E. differ as to what these two reasons are. Scripture tells us that circumcision is a sign that the Lord will be God to Abraham and his seed after him (Gen. 17:7). I.E. believes that circumcision is also a sign not to act promiscuously. I.E. writes, &#x201C;The excision of the foreskin of the flesh is a sign of the covenant between man and his creator not to defile one&#x2019;s soul by engaging in an act of sexual intercourse that is not in accordance with the way of truth&#x201D; (<italic>Yesod Morah</italic>, (Strickman translation, p. 102).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> The other sacrifices.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4"><sup>4</sup> Of the sacrifice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5"><sup>5</sup> The person. The individual Jew is a part of the people of Israel and of the human species. Hence I.E. refers to the individual as a part.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6"><sup>6</sup> A portion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn7"><sup>7</sup> According to I.E. the sacrificial animal serves as a substitute for the celebrant. &#x201C;All these acts are performed in order that when they are done, a person should realize that he has sinned against his God&#x2026;and that his blood should really be spilled and his body burned, were it not for the loving-kindness of the Creator, Who took from him a substitute and a ransom, namely, this offering, so that its blood should be in place of his blood, its life in place of his life, and that the chief limbs of the offering should be in place of the chief parts of his body&#x201D; (Nachmanides, Chavel translation, Lev. 1:9, p. 21).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn8"><sup>8</sup> Ex. 30:11-16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn9"><sup>9</sup> That <italic>le-khapper</italic> means to offer a ransom, for we read there that each male Israelite was to give a half shekel as a ransom for his soul (<italic>kofer nefesh</italic>) (Ex. 30:12). Scripture goes on to say, <italic>that there be no plague among them</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn10"><sup>10</sup> God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn11"><sup>11</sup> If we do not sacrifice to God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn12"><sup>12</sup> In addition to the one just given.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn13"><sup>13</sup> When accepted by God, it ensures one&#x2019;s future (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn14"><sup>14</sup> The sacrifices inspire the celebrant. His mind is opened to study the secrets of nature.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn15"><sup>15</sup> Whose flesh was eaten by the <italic>kohanim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn16"><sup>16</sup> From a thanksgiving offering (Lev. 7:14) or a meal offering (Lev. 2:3; 7:9). Our text reads <italic>ve-ha-matzot. Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 and some editions read <italic>veha-manot</italic> (and the portions), i.e., the portions of the sacrifices which are to be eaten by the <italic>kohanim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn17"><sup>17</sup> The <italic>kohanim</italic>, who teach Torah to the Jewish people. See Lev. 33:10; Mal. 2:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn18"><sup>18</sup> The sanctuary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn19"><sup>19</sup> God&#x2019;s glory.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn20"><sup>20</sup> The end of the Book of Exodus tells that when the construction of the tabernacle was concluded, Moses could not enter the tabernacle because God&#x2019;s glory filled it. (Ex. 40:35). Leviticus picks up where Exodus leaves off and tells us at its opening, <italic>And the Lord called unto Moses</italic>; that is, God invited Moses to the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn21"><sup>21</sup> The <italic>parochet</italic> which separated the Holy of Holies from the holy. The Glory was in the Holy of Holies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn22"><sup>22</sup> Into the Holy of Holies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn23"><sup>23</sup> Ex. 25:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn24"><sup>24</sup> The Book of Leviticus opens with the laws dealing with sacrifices and then goes on to legislate laws of purity, prohibited sexual relations, interpersonal relations, etc. I.E. raises the question why the laws dealing with the sacrifices are given priority.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn25"><sup>25</sup> In heaven. See Hos. 5:15, <italic>I</italic> (God) <italic>will go and return to My place</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn26"><sup>26</sup> Hebrew, <italic>olah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn27"><sup>27</sup> The destruction of the temples, which resulted in the cessation of the burnt offering, signified the removal of the manifestation of God&#x2019;s presence over Israel (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn28"><sup>28</sup> For His own purposes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn29"><sup>29</sup>The verse continues, <italic>For the world is mine&#x2026;Do I eat the flesh of hulls or drink the blood of goats?</italic> These two verses completely dispel the idea that the sacrifices were food for God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn30"><sup>30</sup> The burnt offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn31"><sup>31</sup> According to I.E. the burnt offering causes &#x201C;a power from on high to rest on man,&#x201D; Gen. 8:21 (Vol. 1, p. 119).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn32"><sup>32</sup> Our clause reads, <italic>adam ki yakriv mikkem</italic>. The latter literally reads, when any man bringeth an offering of you. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn33"><sup>33</sup> Where a word placed at the end of clause should be read as if placed earlier.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn34"><sup>34</sup> In other words, <italic>mikkem</italic> (of you) means of your property. In this case the word <italic>mikkem</italic> does not have to be moved, for the meaning of <italic>the clause</italic> is, when any man bringeth an offering of your (that is, his) property.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn35"><sup>35</sup> In this case our verse is to be read as follows: When any man bringeth an offering of you, that is, it shall be of yours. It shall belong to you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn36"><sup>36</sup> Hebrew, <italic>be-olah. Be-elah</italic> may be rendered iniquity or burnt offering. I.E. translates it as burnt offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn37"><sup>37</sup> Cattle. Hebrew, <italic>behemah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn38"><sup>38</sup> Hebrew, <italic>bakar</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn39"><sup>39</sup> Hebrew, <italic>tzon</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn40"><sup>40</sup> Which concludes our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn41"><sup>41</sup> The term <italic>burnt offering</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn42"><sup>42</sup> It comes from the root <italic>ayin, lamed</italic>, <italic>heh</italic>, which means to go up. The term <italic>olah</italic> is thus connected in meaning to the word <italic>oleh</italic> (going up).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn43"><sup>43</sup> An animal younger than eight days is unfit to be brought as a sacrifice. See Lev. 22:27.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn44"><sup>44</sup> The word <italic>tammim</italic> literally means whole. This might be taken to mean not missing an organ. Hence I.E. comments that whole means without blemish.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn45"><sup>45</sup> <italic>The door of the tent of meeting</italic> was located in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn46"><sup>46</sup> Our verse is to be understood as follows: he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting before the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn47"><sup>47</sup> Hebrew, <italic>li-retozno</italic>. I.E. renders this as, of his own free will. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn48"><sup>48</sup> For Scripture reads <italic>yado</italic> (his hand).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn49"><sup>49</sup> Literally, the goat which is sent, the scapegoat which is sent into the wilderness on Yom Kippur. Scripture explicitly tells us that two hands are to be laid on the scapegoat. See Lev. 16:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn50"><sup>50</sup> The scapegoat is not treated as all other sacrifices. Its blood is not sprinkled on the altar, and none of its flesh is offered on the altar. It is sent away into the wilderness. Hence we cannot generalize from it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn51"><sup>51</sup> Unlike other sacrifices, it requires the laying of two hands.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn52"><sup>52</sup> Whenever Scripture speaks of laying the hand it refers to the laying of two hands.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn53"><sup>53</sup> The body of the animal which serves as a sacrifice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn54"><sup>54</sup> According to the sage, Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai, the burnt offering is brought to atone for improper thoughts. See <italic>Va-Yikrah Rabba</italic> 7:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn55"><sup>55</sup> Their names also explain the reason for these sacrifices.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn56"><sup>56</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ve-nirtzeh</italic> (literally, he will be favored). Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn57"><sup>57</sup> Hebrew, <italic>le-khapper alav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn58"><sup>58</sup> The table of showbread. The latter was placed in the northern part of the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn59"><sup>59</sup> <italic>Ve-shachat</italic> (and he shall kill) is in the singular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn60"><sup>60</sup> <italic>Ve-zareku</italic> (and dash) is in the plural and thus refers to Aaron&#x2019;s sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn61"><sup>61</sup> Which was inside the tent of meeting.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn62"><sup>62</sup> In order to assist him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn63"><sup>63</sup> To perform the service described in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn64"><sup>64</sup> <italic>Kohanim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn65"><sup>65</sup> For the verse speaks of sons of Aaron.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn66"><sup>66</sup> It is possible to read our verse as follows: And Aaron&#x2019;s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the suet. In other words, <italic>the pieces</italic> refers to the head and the suet. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn67"><sup>67</sup> <italic>Ha-rosh</italic> (literally, the head) is to be read as if written <italic>ve-ha-rosh</italic> (and the head). In other words, our verse is to be read as follows: And Aaron&#x2019;s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, and the head, and the suet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn68"><sup>68</sup> Scripture occasionally omits the connective <italic>vav</italic>. However, the text is to be understood as if it were present.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn69"><sup>69</sup> <italic>Pitidah</italic> is to be read as if written <italic>u-pitidah</italic> (and carnelian). See I.E. on Ex. 1:4 (Vol. 2, p. 6).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn70"><sup>70</sup> <italic>And cut it</italic> (the burnt offering) into its pieces. I.E. points out that a parallel verse literally reads, <italic>And he shall cut it into its pieces and its head</italic> (ve-et rosho) <italic>and its suet</italic> (v. 12). We thus see that <italic>its pieces</italic> refers <italic>to the</italic> carcass <italic>of</italic> the animal, not to its head and suet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn71"><sup>71</sup> In this case a connective <italic>vav</italic> need not be placed before <italic>ha-rosh</italic>, for the meaning of our verse is: And Aaron&#x2019;s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, with the head and the suet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn72"><sup>72</sup> Where <italic>et</italic> has the meaning of with. See I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 27).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn73"><sup>73</sup> That <italic>the pieces</italic> do not include the head and the suet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn74"><sup>74</sup> <italic>Ve-arekhu</italic> (shall lay) is a plural. It literally means, and they shall lay.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn75"><sup>75</sup> And it requires more than one person to handle it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn76"><sup>76</sup> Which is a small animal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn77"><sup>77</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ve-arakh</italic>, which is in the singular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn78"><sup>78</sup> For only the <italic>kohen</italic> may perform this work.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn79"><sup>79</sup> All of it shall be offered as a burnt offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn80"><sup>80</sup> It is obviously related to the word <italic>menuchah</italic> (rest). See I.E. on Gen. 5:8 (Vol. 1, p. 118). He explains <italic>nicho&#x2019;ach</italic> as meaning that the sacrifice assuages God&#x2019;s anger, or that it causes a power from on high to rest on man.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn81"><sup>81</sup> In other words, <italic>yerakh</italic> which literally means side of, at times can mean beyond the side.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn82"><sup>82</sup> The northern part of Jerusalem. The verse literally reads, <italic>Even mount Zion, the side of the north</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn83"><sup>83</sup> Which was located on Mount Zion. See Ps. 48:13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn84"><sup>84</sup> <italic>The side</italic> means on the outside, next to.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 2</title>
<p>1. AND WHEN ANY ONE BRINGETH. The word <italic>nefesh</italic> (anyone) means a person. Scripture mentions <italic>nefesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn94">1</xref></sup> because the meal offering is a free will offering and <italic>nefesh</italic> is called &#x201C;willing.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn95">2</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And let a willing spirit uphold me</italic> (Ps. 51:14).<sup><xref rid="fn96">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>FINE FLOUR. The meaning of <italic>solet</italic> (fine flour) is pure wheat flour. It is the same as that which is called <italic>samid</italic> in Arabic. Look, it is not fitting that a meal offering brought to the Most High come from anything than which nothing better exists.<sup><xref rid="fn97">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND HE SHALL TAKE. <italic>Ve-kamatz</italic> (and he shall take) is related to the word <italic>li-kematzim</italic> (in heaps) (Gen. 41:47).<sup><xref rid="fn98">5</xref></sup> Our sages explained that <italic>melo kumtzo</italic> means a handful.<sup><xref rid="fn99">6</xref></sup> Their words are true.</p>
<p>OF THE FINE FLOUR THEREOF. A little of it, and so too of the oil. However, he shall burn all of the frankincense.</p>
<p>THE MEMORIAL-PART THEREOF. The <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>azkaratah</italic> (the memorial part thereof) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn100">7</xref></sup> <italic>Azkaratah</italic> is so called because the meal offering by the celebrant serves as a memorial before God.<sup><xref rid="fn101">8</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>azkaratah</italic> means its scent. It is like scent of the incense.<sup><xref rid="fn102">9</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>The scent thereof</italic> (zikhro) <italic>shall be as the wine of Lebanon</italic> (Hos. 14:8).</p>
<p>3. SHALL BE AARON&#x2019;S AND HIS SONS&#x2019;. And to all <italic>kohanim</italic> equally.<sup><xref rid="fn103">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. UNLEAVENED CAKES. The word <italic>challot</italic> (cakes) means thick cakes.<sup><xref rid="fn104">11</xref></sup> Others connect <italic>challot</italic> to the Rabbinic term <italic>chalilah</italic> (circle).<sup><xref rid="fn105">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A GRIDDLE. <italic>Machavat</italic> (griddle) refers to a plate covered with a plate.<sup><xref rid="fn106">13</xref></sup> Its <italic>tav</italic> is in place of a <italic>heh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn107">14</xref></sup> like the <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>ve-shavat</italic> (it shall return) in <italic>then it shall return to the prince</italic> (Ezek. 46:17).<sup><xref rid="fn108">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THE STEWING-PAN. <italic>Marcheshet</italic> (the stewing pan) means fried.<sup><xref rid="fn109">16</xref></sup> Some connect the word <italic>marcheshet</italic> to <italic>rachash</italic> (speaks) in <italic>My heart speaks</italic> (Ps. 45:2).<sup><xref rid="fn110">17</xref></sup> <italic>Marcheshet</italic> is so called because it emits sounds.<sup><xref rid="fn111">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AARON&#x2019;S AND HIS SONS&#x2019;. After him.<sup><xref rid="fn112">19</xref></sup> That is, to the <italic>kohen</italic> who places it upon the fire, for Scripture states so with regard to the two meal offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn113">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. LEAVEN. <italic>Se&#x2019;or</italic> refers to leaven. It is the same case with honey. Some say that our verse speaks of date honey. The same is true whenever Scripture speaks of a <italic>land flowing with milk and honey</italic>. There is what appears to be proof of their opinion in the Book of Ezra.<sup><xref rid="fn114">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AS AN OFFERING OF FIRST-FRUITS YE MAY BRING THEM UNTO THE LORD. As the two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah which were waved before God on the festival of Shavu&#x2019;ot (Lev. 23:17). The meaning of <italic>unto the Lord</italic> is, even though they are holy <italic>unto the Lord</italic> they are food for the <italic>kohen</italic>.</p>
<p>13. THE COVENANT OF THY GOD. God caused you to enter the covenant and made you swear that you would not offer anything which is unsalted and inedible, for that is an insult.<sup><xref rid="fn115">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND IF THOU BRING A MEAL-OFFERING OF FIRSTFRUITS.<sup><xref rid="fn116">23</xref></sup> Many say that the word <italic>im</italic> (if) indicates an obligation.<sup><xref rid="fn117">24</xref></sup> I believe that there is no need for this explanation, for there is an obligation to bring the first<sup><xref rid="fn118">25</xref></sup> of the grain<sup><xref rid="fn119">26</xref></sup> and not the first grain. One who wishes to bring a meal offering from the first grain<sup><xref rid="fn120">27</xref></sup> as a free will offering may do so.<sup><xref rid="fn121">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>CORN IN THE EAR. <italic>Aviv</italic> (com in the ear) is so called because it is first.<sup><xref rid="fn122">29</xref></sup> It is related to the word <italic>av</italic> (father).<sup><xref rid="fn123">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>GROATS. The meaning of <italic>geres</italic> (groats) is known. It is close to being related to the word <italic>garesah</italic> (breaketh) in <italic>My soul breaketh</italic> (Ps. 119:20).<sup><xref rid="fn124">31</xref></sup> The latter is so even though the word <italic>garesah</italic> is spelled with a <italic>samekh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn125">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>FRESH EAR. The word <italic>karmel</italic> (fresh ear) is related to the word <italic>karmel</italic> (fresh ears) in <italic>and fresh ears of corn in his sack</italic> (II Kings 4:42).</p>
<ftnote id="fn94"><sup>1</sup> Scripture here refers to a person by the term <italic>nefesh</italic>. However, in chapter 1, it refers to a person by the term <italic>adam</italic> (man). See Lev. 1:2. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn95"><sup>2</sup> <italic>Nefesh</italic> also means spirit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn96"><sup>3</sup> Thus the deeper meaning of our verse is, when a willing spirit brings a free will offering unto the Lord. For another interpretation of why Scripture here employs the term <italic>nefesh</italic> and not <italic>adam</italic> see Rashi on verse 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn97"><sup>4</sup> In other words, it is unfit that a meal offering brought to the Most High come from anything but the best.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn98"><sup>5</sup> According to this interpretation, <italic>ve-kamatz</italic> (and he shall take) means and he shall gather.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn99"><sup>6</sup> See <italic>Menachot</italic> 9a, 18b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn100"><sup>7</sup> According to this opinion <italic>azkaratah</italic> comes from the root <italic>zayin, kaf, resh</italic>. The <italic>alef</italic> serves no purpose.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn101"><sup>8</sup> In other words, <italic>azkaratah</italic> means <italic>the memorial part thereof</italic>. God recalls the celebrant because of his meal offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn102"><sup>9</sup> The portion of the meal offering offered on the altar is similar to the incense offered on the altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn103"><sup>10</sup> Unlike the meal offerings that are baked in the oven which belong to the priest who offers them (Lev. 7:9), a meal offering mingled with oil is shared by all the <italic>kohanim</italic> (Lev. 7:10) (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn104"><sup>11</sup> Thus <italic>challot matzot</italic> (unleavened cakes) means thick unleavened cakes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn105"><sup>12</sup> They say that <italic>challot</italic> means rounded cakes. See <italic>Sukkah</italic> 5:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn106"><sup>13</sup> It refers to a pan with a cover.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn107"><sup>14</sup> A variant of <italic>machavah. Machavah</italic> comes from the root <italic>chet, bet, heh</italic>, meaning to hide. A <italic>machavah</italic> is a utensil in which the food is hidden (Weiser), i.e., covered.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn108"><sup>15</sup> The <italic>tav of ve-shavat</italic> is in place of a <italic>heh</italic>, for <italic>ve-shavat</italic> is a variant of <italic>ve</italic><italic>shavah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn109"><sup>16</sup> Contra other commentaries, I.E. does not believe that <italic>marcheshet</italic> (stewing pan) describes a utensil. It refers to a type of meal offering. I.E. renders our clause: And if your offering be a fried meal offering (<italic>minchah marcheshet</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn110"><sup>17</sup> Translated according to I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn111"><sup>18</sup> When an oil-saturated mixture is fried, it emits sounds.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn112"><sup>19</sup> The generations that followed Aaron.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn113"><sup>20</sup> The meal offering baked on a griddle and the one baked in an oven.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn114"><sup>21</sup> The reference is probably to II Chron. 31:5, <italic>viz., the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of corn, wine and oil, and honey, and all the increase of the field</italic>. The latter seems to place honey among the produce of the field. Others say that the reference is to Neh. 10:36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn115"><sup>22</sup> To God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn116"><sup>23</sup> Hebrew, <italic>bikkurim</italic>. To be understood here as the first grain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn117"><sup>24</sup> They render <italic>and if thou bring a meal-offering of first-fruits</italic> as when you bring a meal offering of the first grain. See Rashi: &#x201C;<italic>Im</italic> here has the meaning of <italic>ki</italic> (when), for this offering is not optional.&#x201D; Rashi believes that our verse deals with the <italic>omer</italic> (measure) of barley offered on the second day of Passover. This offering was obligatory. It was offered from the very first of the harvest. See Lev. 23:9-14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn118"><sup>25</sup> The very first.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn119"><sup>26</sup> See Deut. 26:1-11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn120"><sup>27</sup> From the first grain harvest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn121"><sup>28</sup> However, he is not obligated to do so.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn123"><sup>30</sup> The father comes before the son.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn124"><sup>31</sup> According to I.E. <italic>geres</italic> means broken grain. See Rashi: <italic>&#x201C;geres</italic> means breaking or grinding.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<p>1. PEACE-OFFERINGS. The term <italic>shelamim</italic> (peace offerings) is self-explanatory.<sup><xref rid="fn126">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. BY THE LOINS. The meaning of the term <italic>kesalim</italic> (loins) is known. It is related to the word <italic>kesilehem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn127">2</xref></sup> (constellations thereof) in <italic>and the constellations thereof</italic> (Is<italic></italic>. 13:10).<sup><xref rid="fn128">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>HARD BY THE KIDNEYS. The term <italic>al</italic> (hard by) means with,<sup><xref rid="fn129">4</xref></sup> as in <italic>And they came, both men with</italic> (al) <italic>women</italic> (Ex. 35:22).<sup><xref rid="fn130">5</xref></sup> <italic>Kelayot</italic> (kidneys) are so called because they are the source of lust and sex. The word <italic>kelayot</italic> is related to the word <italic>kaletah</italic> (pineth) in <italic>My soul yearneth, yea, even pineth</italic> (Ps. 84:3).</p>
<p>9. THE FAT THEREOF, THE FAT TAIL ENTIRE. The meaning of <italic>chelbo ha-alyah temimah</italic> (the fat thereof, the fat tail entire) is, the fat as it is,<sup><xref rid="fn131">6</xref></sup> for the tail is called fat.<sup><xref rid="fn132">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Sadducees, as I will explain to you in the next Torah portion,<sup><xref rid="fn133">8</xref></sup> err. The Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn134">9</xref></sup> also errs, for he says that <italic>chelbo haalyah</italic> is to be interpreted as the fat thereof and the tail.<sup><xref rid="fn135">10</xref></sup> The latter is contrary to the rules of grammar, for<sup><xref rid="fn136">11</xref></sup> the phrase should have read <italic>chelbo ve-alyato</italic> (its fat and its tail) or <italic>hachelev ve-ha-alyah</italic> (and its tail and its fat).</p>
<p>THE RUMP-BONE. The meaning of <italic>atzeh</italic> (rump-bone) is known from its context. It has no brother.<sup><xref rid="fn137">12</xref></sup> There is a commentator who far-fetchedly connected it to the word <italic>etz</italic> (tree).<sup><xref rid="fn138">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THE FOOD<sup><xref rid="fn139">14</xref></sup> OF THE OFFERING MADE BY FIRE. I have previously explained that the meaning of <italic>lechem</italic> is food.<sup><xref rid="fn140">15</xref></sup> It is found in reference to fruit<sup><xref rid="fn141">16</xref></sup> and meat.<sup><xref rid="fn142">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND IF HIS OFFERING BE A GOAT. Any animal classified as a goat, be it male or female,<sup><xref rid="fn143">18</xref></sup> as is the case with a sheep.<sup><xref rid="fn144">19</xref></sup> Scripture does not mention the fat tail with regard to the herd. It only mentions it with regard to the lamb because the tail of a goat or a bull is small. Furthermore, the lambs in the Land of Israel have a large tail.<sup><xref rid="fn145">20</xref></sup> The latter is well known.<sup><xref rid="fn146">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. ALL THE FAT IS THE LORD&#x2019;S. This is a general statement. Now, since the fat and the blood belong to God, they are prohibited to you. I will expostulate at length on the phrase <italic>a perpetual statute</italic> in the next Torah portion.</p>
<ftnote id="fn126"><sup>1</sup> It is related to the word <italic>shalom</italic> (peace). Unlike other sacrifices, <italic>shelamim</italic> are not offered for sin but rather for the continued peaceful existence of the celebrant. See I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary on Ex. 29:27.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn127"><sup>2</sup> According to I.E. the literal meaning of <italic>kesilehem</italic> is, their flanks.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn128"><sup>3</sup> According to I.E. the reference is to the stars that flank the heavenly north and south poles. This was the current knowledge of astronomy in those days. See I.E. on Is. 13:10.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 4</title>
<p>2. IF ANY ONE SHALL SIN. By inadvertently transgressing one of the negative commandments, the penalty for which is excision<sup><xref rid="fn147">1</xref></sup> or flogging [for a deliberate act].<sup><xref rid="fn148">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>nefesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn149">3</xref></sup> (any one) takes in Israelites and strangers,<sup><xref rid="fn150">4</xref></sup> for it is so stated.<sup><xref rid="fn151">5</xref></sup> Scripture then goes into detail.<sup><xref rid="fn152">6</xref></sup> It begins with the <italic>kohen gadol</italic>, the anointed <italic>kohen</italic>.</p>
<p>3. TO BRING GUILT ON THE PEOPLE. The <italic>kohen gadol</italic> taught incorrectly and the people were guilty, all of them having acted inadvertently.<sup><xref rid="fn153">7</xref></sup> On the other hand, the meaning of <italic>leashmat ha-am</italic> (to bring guilt on the people) might be, because of the guilt of all of the people.<sup><xref rid="fn154">8</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn155">9</xref></sup> is mentioned here<sup><xref rid="fn156">10</xref></sup> because the <italic>kohen</italic> is the bearer of the Torah and he is very careful and holy unto God.<sup><xref rid="fn157">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR HIS SIN. <italic>Al chattato</italic> (for his sin) means because of his sin.<sup><xref rid="fn158">12</xref></sup> Since the <italic>kohen gadol</italic> is great he must offer a bullock, which is the largest animal of all that are offered on the altar.</p>
<p>6. AND THE PRIEST SHALL DIP. The anointed <italic>kohen</italic> himself. You will find the reason for <italic>seven times</italic> in the Torah portion <italic>Va-Yar Balak</italic> (Num. 22:2-25:9).<sup><xref rid="fn159">13</xref></sup> The <italic>kohen gadol</italic> sprinkles some of the blood of the sin offering in front of the veil of the sanctuary<sup><xref rid="fn160">14</xref></sup> and on the incense altar<sup><xref rid="fn161">15</xref></sup> because of his exalted status.<sup><xref rid="fn162">16</xref></sup> The <italic>kohen gadol</italic> burns the entire bullock, aside from the various fats,<sup><xref rid="fn163">17</xref></sup> outside [of the camp]<sup><xref rid="fn164">18</xref></sup> because it is not a burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn165">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. WHERE THE ASHES ARE POURED OUT. It should be burned in the place where the ashes of the altar are found.<sup><xref rid="fn166">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. WHEN THE SIN WHEREIN THEY HAVE SINNED IS KNOWN. The same law,<sup><xref rid="fn167">21</xref></sup> even though it is not mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn168">22</xref></sup> applies to the <italic>kohen gadol</italic>, for if the sin not be known to the <italic>kohen gadol</italic>, then he does not bring a sin offering. Others say that the <italic>kohen gadol</italic> shall bring this sacrifice<sup><xref rid="fn169">23</xref></sup> every year because he may have sinned.<sup><xref rid="fn170">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture mentions <italic>the sin&#x2026;is known</italic> with regard to the whole congregation of Israel, for it is possible that the <italic>kohen</italic> will inform them. However, there is no one to inform the <italic>kohen;</italic> he informs himself.<sup><xref rid="fn171">25</xref></sup> The sin offering of the congregation is the same as that of the <italic>kohen gadol</italic> in all details. The <italic>kohen gadol</italic> is thus equivalent to all of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn172">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THE ELDERS OF THE CONGREGATION. The elders are the leaders. They will lay their hands<sup><xref rid="fn173">27</xref></sup> on their behalf and on behalf of all of Israel, for it is impossible for all of Israel to place their hands.<sup><xref rid="fn174">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. IT IS THE SIN-OFFERING. The bullock.<sup><xref rid="fn175">29</xref></sup> If Israel errs and they do not do one of the positive commandments, then they shall bring a bullock as a burnt offering and a he-goat as a sin offering.<sup><xref rid="fn176">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. WHEN A RULER SINNETH. The words are inverted.<sup><xref rid="fn177">31</xref></sup> Our verse should be read as if written, when the sinner is the ruler.<sup><xref rid="fn178">32</xref></sup> It is connected to that which is written above,<sup><xref rid="fn179">33</xref></sup> that is, <italic>And if the whole congregation of Israel&#x2026;</italic> (v. 13). Our verse, as it were, states, and if the one who sins is the ruler of a tribe or the ruler of a father&#x2019;s house.</p>
<p>23. IF HIS SIN&#x2026;BE KNOWN TO HIM.<sup><xref rid="fn180">34</xref></sup> Scripture employs an abridged style.<sup><xref rid="fn181">35</xref></sup> It is similar to the verse dealing with the <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn182">36</xref></sup> Its meaning is, if the ruler knows on his own that he has sinned or someone else who has seen him<sup><xref rid="fn183">37</xref></sup> makes it known to him.<sup><xref rid="fn184">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following is the grammatical explanation of <italic>hoda elav</italic> (be known to him): <italic>Hoda</italic> (be known) is a verb<sup><xref rid="fn185">39</xref></sup> in the perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn186">40</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ve-hetzar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn187">41</xref></sup> <italic>lekha</italic> (and he shall besiege thee) (Deut. 28:52).

<p>The ruler offers a he-goat as a sacrifice in keeping with <italic>The greyhound</italic>; <italic>the he-goat also</italic> (Prov. 30:31).<sup><xref rid="fn194">48</xref></sup> The latter is in accordance with the interpretation of the Gaon in the Book of Proverbs.

<p>The <italic>kohanim</italic>, as is stated in Scripture,<sup><xref rid="fn196">50</xref></sup> eat of the ruler&#x2019;s sin offering to atone for the ruler. The <italic>kohen gadol</italic> does not eat of his sin offering.<sup><xref rid="fn197">51</xref></sup></p>

<p>[35. AS THE FAT OF THE LAMB IS TAKEN AWAY.] Scripture states the aforementioned because it wants to indicate that one is to offer the fat tail,<sup><xref rid="fn201">55</xref></sup> for a she-goat has no fat tail.<sup><xref rid="fn202">56</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn155"><sup>9</sup> The phrase <italic>le-ashmat ha-am</italic> (to bring guilt on the people). According to this interpretation our verse reads: If the appointed priest shall sin because of the people&#x2019;s guilt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn156"><sup>10</sup> After the word <italic>yechete</italic> (shall sin). In other words, <italic>le-ashmat ha-am</italic> (to bring guilt on the people) qualifies <italic>yechete</italic> (shall sin).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn157"><sup>11</sup> He himself would not sin inadvertently.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn158"><sup>12</sup> <italic>Al chattato</italic> (for his sin) literally means on his sin. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn174"><sup>28</sup> On the head of the bullock.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn175"><sup>29</sup> The verse reads, <italic>chattat ha-kahal hu. Hu</italic> is in the masculine. Hence it refers to the bullock, not to the sin offering. Thus our text is to be understood as follows: The bullock is the sin offering of the assembly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn176"><sup>30</sup> Our text tells us that if the congregation sins in error they then bring a bullock as a sin offering. However, Num. 15:22-24 tells us that if the congregation sins in error they shall bring a bullock as a burnt offering and a he-goat as a sin offering. Hence I.E. points out that our text deals with the violation of a negative precept while Numbers deals with the violation of a positive precept, for the text reads, <italic>and do any of the things which the Lord hath commanded not to be done</italic> while Num. 15:22 reads, <italic>and not observe all these commandments</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn177"><sup>31</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>asher nasi yechete</italic> (when a ruler sinneth).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn178"><sup>32</sup> In other words, our text should be interpreted as if written, <italic>asher yechete nasi</italic>. I.E. interprets thus because he believes that <italic>asher</italic> (when) is connected to the verb (<italic>yechete</italic>), not to the noun (<italic>nasi</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn179"><sup>33</sup> Hence our verse does not open with <italic>ve-im</italic> (and if) but with <italic>asher</italic> (the one who).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn193"><sup>47</sup> Which is a <italic>hofal</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn194"><sup>48</sup> The complete verse reads: <italic>The greyhound; the he-goat also; And the king, against whom there is no rising up</italic>. The verse speaks of those who walk haughtily. The he-goat walks with its head held high, as does the king. Hence a goat was chosen as the animal to be offered by the ruler (the king) as a sin offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn195"><sup>49</sup> In contrast to the blood of the bullock brought by the <italic>kohen gadol</italic> and the congregation.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn200"><sup>54</sup> When one brings a goat as a sin offering, he brings a she-goat. Similarly, when one chooses to bring a lamb as a sin offering he must bring a female.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 5</title>
<p>1. AND IF ANY ONE SIN, IN THAT HE HEARETH THE VOICE OF ADJURATION. <italic>Alah</italic> (adjuration) refers to a curse. Similarly <italic>alit</italic> (thou didst utter a curse)<sup><xref rid="fn203">1</xref></sup> in <italic>about which thou didst utter a curse</italic> (Jud. 17:2). Scripture employs an abridged style.<sup><xref rid="fn204">2</xref></sup> Scripture warns that the witness is obligated to testify, for if he does not testify then he is liable for punishment from God, for he bears his iniquity. If he forgets and does not testify and then reminds himself [then he brings a guilt offering].</p>
<p>2. OR IF ANY ONE TOUCH ANY UNCLEAN THING. [WHETHER IT BE THE CARCASS OF AN UNCLEAN BEAST.] The reference is to the carcass of any of the four mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn205">3</xref></sup> namely, the swine<sup><xref rid="fn206">4</xref></sup> and his compatriots.<sup><xref rid="fn207">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR THE CARCASS OF UNCLEAN CATTLE. Unclean for food such as horses or asses.<sup><xref rid="fn208">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>4. UTTER CLEARLY WITH AN OATH. <italic>Le-vatte visefatayim</italic> (utter clearly) means to utter with the lips.<sup><xref rid="fn216">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO DO EVIL. To a guilty person,<sup><xref rid="fn217">15</xref></sup> or, as the Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn218">16</xref></sup> explains, to fast.<sup><xref rid="fn219">17</xref></sup> Scripture mentions these sins<sup><xref rid="fn220">18</xref></sup> because the violator is obligated to confess these sins. He is not obligated to confess before the <italic>kohen</italic> for other sins which consist of the violation of negative commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn221">19</xref></sup> The sacrifice is the same.<sup><xref rid="fn222">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND IF HIS MEANS<sup><xref rid="fn223">21</xref></sup> SUFFICE NOT.<sup><xref rid="fn224">22</xref></sup> For all manner of work is done by the hand. It is the means by which one acquires. The clause<sup><xref rid="fn225">23</xref></sup> alludes to one who does not have the means.<sup><xref rid="fn226">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>ONE FOR A SIN-OFFERING, AND THE OTHER FOR A BURNT-OFFERING. Rabbi Isaac<sup><xref rid="fn227">25</xref></sup> says the reason that one bird is brought for a burnt offering is that an unseemly thought may have entered his mind because his means do not suffice.<sup><xref rid="fn228">26</xref></sup> However, I believe that the bird brought as an offering corresponds to the organs of the sacrifice offered on the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn229">27</xref></sup> The second bird is a sin offering, as the law requires.<sup><xref rid="fn230">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THE TENTH PART OF AN EPHAH. The amount of food a person eats in one day.<sup><xref rid="fn231">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. COMMIT A TRESPASS. The reference is to something which covered the offender.<sup><xref rid="fn232">30</xref></sup> <italic>Timol ma&#x2019;al</italic> (commit a trespass) is related to the word <italic>me&#x2019;il</italic> (garment).<sup><xref rid="fn233">31</xref></sup> The reason why he shall bring a ram<sup><xref rid="fn234">32</xref></sup> worth silver shekels<sup><xref rid="fn235">33</xref></sup> is that he sinned against that which is sanctified to God. The minimum of the plural <italic>shekalim</italic> (shekels) is two.</p>
<p>16. HE SHALL MAKE RESTITUTION. He shall make restitution for sinning by using a holy object and add a fifth.<sup><xref rid="fn236">34</xref></sup> This is a guilt offering brought by one who errs at first and then becomes cognizant of his sin.</p>
<p>17. AND IF ANY ONE SIN.<sup><xref rid="fn237">35</xref></sup> And violates one of the negative commandments and does not know that what he did is prohibited,<sup><xref rid="fn238">36</xref></sup> he shall bring a ram.<sup><xref rid="fn239">37</xref></sup> Many believe<sup><xref rid="fn240">38</xref></sup> that the ram is brought as a &#x201C;doubt guilt offering.&#x201D; He brings a ram if he does not know whether he violated the law or not.<sup><xref rid="fn241">39</xref></sup> A sin offering is brought if he did not know that he sinned and then became aware of it. Observe,<sup><xref rid="fn242">40</xref></sup> a sin offering is brought if he did not know that a certain act is prohibited until he was informed of it. A guilt offering is brought if he knew that it is prohibited but forgot, and then reminded himself. On the other hand, our verse might be speaking of a &#x201C;doubt guilt offering.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn243">41</xref></sup></p>

<p>19. HE IS CERTAINLY GUILTY BEFORE THE LORD. This explains why it is called a guilt offering. It is so called because he is guilty.<sup><xref rid="fn244">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND COMMIT A TRESPASS AGAINST THE LORD. By violating one of the negative precepts governing the relationship between a man and his neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn245">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN A MATTER OF DEPOSIT.<sup><xref rid="fn246">44</xref></sup> Partnership. He joined hands with him.</p>
<p>OR OF ROBBERY.<sup><xref rid="fn247">45</xref></sup> Involving force. Compare, <italic>and plucked</italic> (va-yigzol)<sup><xref rid="fn248">46</xref></sup> <italic>the spear out of the Egyptian&#x2019;s hand</italic> (I Chron. 11:23).</p>
<p>OR HAVE OPPRESSED. In secret.<sup><xref rid="fn249">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>HIS NEIGHBOR. <italic>Amito</italic> means his neighbor. It most probably means the one who is beside him.<sup><xref rid="fn250">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND SWEAR TO A LIE. The meaning of <italic>ve-nishba al shaker</italic> (and swear to a lie) is, or swear to a lie<sup><xref rid="fn251">49</xref></sup> regarding money that one seeks from him. The fact that Scripture states, <italic>or any thing about which he has sworn falsely</italic> (v. 24)<sup><xref rid="fn252">50</xref></sup> is proof of this.</p>
<p>The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>va-hennah</italic> (therein) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn253">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. IN FULL. <italic>Be-rosho</italic> (in full)<sup><xref rid="fn254">52</xref></sup> means in itself,<sup><xref rid="fn255">53</xref></sup> or its worth.</p>
<p>THE FIFTH PART. The minimum of a plural is two. Thus <italic>chamishitav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn256">54</xref></sup> (the fifth part) means two fifths. I will explain it later.<sup><xref rid="fn257">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THE DAY OF HIS BEING GUILTY. Its meaning is, in the day that he turns away from his guilt<sup><xref rid="fn258">56</xref></sup> he shall bring a ram.</p>
<p>25. ACCORDING TO THY VALUATION. As the first one.<sup><xref rid="fn259">57</xref></sup> Scripture adds fifths<sup><xref rid="fn260">58</xref></sup> because this guilt offering is brought for a deliberate sin. There is an individual opinion that this guilt offering is also<sup><xref rid="fn261">59</xref></sup> a &#x201C;doubt-offering.&#x201D;</p>
<p>26. TO BE GUILTY THEREBY. <italic>Ashmah</italic> (guilty) is a noun in the <italic>kal</italic>. Scripture employs it in place of the infinite.<sup><xref rid="fn262">60</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn203"><sup>1</sup> <italic>Alit</italic> is the verbal form of <italic>alah</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn218"><sup>16</sup> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn219"><sup>17</sup> In other words, to do evil means to do evil to himself. See Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn220"><sup>18</sup> The point is: Scripture stated earlier that if one sins, he has to bring a sin offering (Lev. 4:27-35). It now lists a number of sins, i.e., refusing to testify, breaking an oath, coming into contact with that which is sacred when one is unclean. It then goes on to say that one who violates the latter brings the same sacrifice as those mentioned earlier in Lev: 4:27-35. The question thus arises: Why list these sins when they are apparently dealt with in Lev. 4:27-35?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn221"><sup>19</sup> In other words, the sins alluded to in Lev. 4:27-35.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn227"><sup>25</sup> According to Weiser the reference is to Rabbi Isaac Gaon of Sura.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn228"><sup>26</sup> He might have been angry at God for his poverty. According to I.E. an <italic>olah</italic>, a burnt offering, is offered in atonement for improper thoughts. See I.E. on Lev. 1:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn229"><sup>27</sup> See Lev. 3:9,10; 14:5. The bird brought as a burnt offering takes the place of the organs of the lamb or goat brought to the altar.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn231"><sup>29</sup> See Ex. 16:36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn232"><sup>30</sup> The offender is compared to a person who covers himself with a garment which does not belong to him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn233"><sup>31</sup> Thus, <italic>timol ma&#x2019;al</italic> literally means to garment a garment that is, to cover oneself with a garment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn234"><sup>32</sup> And not a lamb or goat, which is a less expensive offering.</ftnote>

Afterwards, however he was informed that one of these was forbidden fat, and he does not know whether he has eaten the forbidden fat.

<h1>TSAV</h1>
<p>2. IT IS THAT WHICH GOETH UP. The burnt offering is called an <italic>olah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn263">1</xref></sup> because it is entirely consumed (<italic>olah</italic>) on the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn264">2</xref></sup> Scripture here hints that the <italic>olah</italic> should not be offered at night but rather that it shall be on its firewood until the morning.<sup><xref rid="fn265">3</xref></sup> The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>mokedah</italic> (its firewood)<sup><xref rid="fn266">4</xref></sup> is superfluous. On the other hand, <italic>moked</italic> and <italic>mokedah</italic> may be two nouns.<sup><xref rid="fn267">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE FIRE OF THE ALTAR SHALL BE KEPT BURNING THEREBY.<sup><xref rid="fn268">6</xref></sup> Not outside.</p>
<p>3. HIS LINEN GARMENT. The word <italic>middo</italic> means a garment.<sup><xref rid="fn269">7</xref></sup> The wise men<sup><xref rid="fn270">8</xref></sup> said that it is a garment in keeping with his size.<sup><xref rid="fn271">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>UPON HIS FLESH. Flesh alludes to the genitals. Similarly <italic>an issue out of his flesh</italic> (Lev. 15:2).</p>
<p>WHERETO THE FIRE HATH CONSUMED. Which remains from what the fire consumes.</p>
<p>BESIDE THE ALTAR. Outside of the eastern side.<sup><xref rid="fn272">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THE FIRE UPON THE ALTAR SHALL BE KEPT BURNING THEREBY. Scripture repeats itself<sup><xref rid="fn273">11</xref></sup> in order to add it shall not go out during the day.<sup><xref rid="fn274">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>ba-boker ba-boker</italic> is, every morning.<sup><xref rid="fn275">13</xref></sup> The <italic>kohen</italic> shall first offer the burnt offering and then the organs<sup><xref rid="fn276">14</xref></sup> of the peace offering.<sup><xref rid="fn277">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. FIRE SHALL BE KEPT BURNING UPON THE ALTAR CONTINUALLY. This verse<sup><xref rid="fn278">16</xref></sup> was written in order to add the word <italic>continually</italic>.</p>
<p>7. SHALL OFFER IT. <italic>Hakrev</italic> (shall offer) is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn279">17</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>hakrev otah bene aharon</italic> is, the sons of Aaron shall offer it. This means that one of the sons of Aaron shall offer it. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>And he shall take up there-from</italic> (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn280">18</xref></sup> This section<sup><xref rid="fn281">19</xref></sup> adds to that which is written in the portion <italic>Va-Yikra</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn282">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. IT SHALL BE EATEN WITHOUT LEAVEN IN A HOLY PLACE. Note, Scripture adds two commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn283">21</xref></sup> <italic>Every male</italic> (v. 11)<sup><xref rid="fn284">22</xref></sup> is a third.<sup><xref rid="fn285">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>[10. IT SHALL NOT BE BAKED WITH LEAVEN.]<sup><xref rid="fn286">24</xref></sup> This is the principal rule regarding the Passover <italic>matzot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn287">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>AS THE SIN-OFFERING, AND AS THE GUILT-OFFERING.<sup><xref rid="fn288">26</xref></sup> So too the meal offering.<sup><xref rid="fn289">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. WHATSOEVER TOUCHETH THEM SHALL BE HOLY. Whatever touches the meal offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering shall be holy unto God.<sup><xref rid="fn290">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. THIS IS THE OFFERING OF AARON. Or one of his sons who takes his place.</p>
<p>IN THE DAY WHEN&#x2026;ANOINTED. When the anointing oil is poured upon his head. Some say that the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>be-yom</italic> (in the day) is in place of a <italic>mem</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn291">29</xref></sup> Its meaning is, from the day that he is anointed he has to regularly bring his meal offering.<sup><xref rid="fn292">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. WHEN IT IS SOAKED. <italic>Murbekhet</italic> (when it is soaked) has no brother.<sup><xref rid="fn293">31</xref></sup> Some say it means soft.<sup><xref rid="fn294">32</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>murbekhet</italic> means quickly. The <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn295">33</xref></sup> of <italic>tevi&#x2019;ennah</italic> (thou shalt bring it) is directed at Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn296">34</xref></sup> Similarly the <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>takriv</italic> (thou shalt offer).<sup><xref rid="fn297">35</xref></sup> I believe that this is also true of the <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>tufine</italic> (in broken pieces).<sup><xref rid="fn298">36</xref></sup> It means to fix.<sup><xref rid="fn299">37</xref></sup> It has no neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn300">38</xref></sup> The ancients<sup><xref rid="fn301">39</xref></sup> said that <italic>tufine</italic> is a combination of the two words, <italic>te&#x2019;afeh</italic> and <italic>na</italic> (it shall be baked raw).<sup><xref rid="fn302">40</xref></sup> Rabbi Jonah the grammarian<sup><xref rid="fn303">41</xref></sup> says that <italic>tufine</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>dukhifat</italic> (hoopoe) (Lev. 11:19).<sup><xref rid="fn304">42</xref></sup> This is a distorted form.<sup><xref rid="fn305">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. WHOLLY. The word <italic>kalil</italic> means wholly. It shall be wholly sacrificed unto God.</p>
<p>16. IT SHALL NOT BE EATEN. As all the meal offerings are, for how can a <italic>kohen</italic> eat his meal or sin offering.<sup><xref rid="fn306">44</xref></sup> The place of the slaughter of all the sin offerings was in the north.<sup><xref rid="fn307">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. IT IS MOST HOLY. It is like one of the other holy things.<sup><xref rid="fn308">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THE PRIEST THAT OFFERETH IT FOR SIN. <italic>Ha-kohen ha-mechatte</italic> (the priest that offereth it for sin) means the <italic>kohen</italic> who sprinkles the blood. <italic>Ha-kohen ha-mechatte</italic> is another way of saying the <italic>kohen</italic> that removes the sin of the sinner.<sup><xref rid="fn309">47</xref></sup> Many of the commentaries say that <italic>ha-mechatte</italic> means who washes or cleans. The word <italic>techatteni</italic> (purge me) in <italic>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean</italic> (Ps. 51:9) is similar.</p>
<p>20. WHATSOEVER SHALL TOUCH. Whatsoever shall touch the flesh of the sin offering will be holy unto God, and the <italic>kohen</italic> shall eat it. The portion of the <italic>kohen</italic> who sprinkles the blood of the sin offering is therefore<sup><xref rid="fn310">48</xref></sup> like<sup><xref rid="fn311">49</xref></sup> the portion of all his brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn312">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>IS SPRINKLED. Rabbi Mosheh Ha-Kohen says that <italic>yizzeh</italic> (is sprinkled)<sup><xref rid="fn313">51</xref></sup> is similar to the word <italic>yitteh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn314">52</xref></sup> (shall&#x2026;bend) (Job 15:29).<sup><xref rid="fn315">53</xref></sup> It is a <italic>kal</italic>. When the <italic>yod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn316">54</xref></sup> is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> it is a <italic>hifil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn317">55</xref></sup> The swallowed letter<sup><xref rid="fn318">56</xref></sup> is a <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn319">57</xref></sup> We similarly find the word <italic>va-yiz</italic> (and&#x2026;was sprinkled) in <italic>and some of her blood was sprinkled</italic> (II Kings 9:33) vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>, and <italic>vayaz</italic> with a <italic>pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn320">58</xref></sup> However, the word <italic>natah</italic> (turned) is vocalized with a <italic>tzereh</italic> in the <italic>kal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn321">59</xref></sup> We similarly find <italic>ve-yez nitzcham</italic> (and their lifeblood is dashed) (Is. 63:3).<sup><xref rid="fn322">60</xref></sup> He explained it very well.<sup><xref rid="fn323">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Lord commanded that the place where some of the blood of the sin offering fell on the garment be washed because the sin offering is holy.</p>
<p>[IN A HOLY PLACE.] The reference is to the courtyard of the tent of meeting, for there is a difference between holy and clean.<sup><xref rid="fn324">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT WHEREON IT WAS SPRINKLED.<sup><xref rid="fn325">63</xref></sup> The word &#x201C;place&#x201D; or the word &#x201C;or&#x201D; is missing.<sup><xref rid="fn326">64</xref></sup> It means: Or if someone shall sprinkle upon it, that is, upon the flesh, then the <italic>kohen</italic> shall wash the flesh and then eat it. On the other hand, its meaning might be, the place where the blood is sprinkled shall be washed. In this case the word <italic>beged</italic> (garment) is both masculine and feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn327">65</xref></sup> The word <italic>yado</italic> (his hand) in <italic>even as his hand can afford</italic> (Lev. 14:31)<sup><xref rid="fn328">66</xref></sup> is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn329">67</xref></sup> The <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn330">68</xref></sup> of <italic>tekhabbes</italic> (thou shalt wash) is directed to the <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn331">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. WHEREIN IT IS SODDEN. <italic>Bushalah</italic> (sodden), <italic>morak</italic> (scoured), and <italic>shuttaf</italic> (rinsed) are all <italic>pu&#x2019;als. Morak</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>cholam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn332">70</xref></sup> because of the <italic>resh</italic> which, except in a few places,<sup><xref rid="fn333">71</xref></sup> does not receive a <italic>dagesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn334">72</xref></sup> <italic>Morak</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>zorak</italic> (dashed)<sup><xref rid="fn335">73</xref></sup> in <italic>was not dashed against him</italic> (Num. 19:13). <italic>Morak</italic> is related to the word <italic>mirku</italic> (furbish) in <italic>Furbish the spears</italic> (<italic>Jer</italic>. 46:4), for the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>morak</italic> is a root letter.</p>
<p>[22. IT IS MOST HOLY.] Scripture states <italic>it is most holy</italic> with regard to every male<sup><xref rid="fn336">74</xref></sup> because only the perfect may eat from a sin offering whose organs are offered and is brought for atonement for sins.<sup><xref rid="fn337">75</xref></sup> Males are more perfect<sup><xref rid="fn338">76</xref></sup> than females.<sup><xref rid="fn339">77</xref></sup> Even a small child is called a male.<sup><xref rid="fn340">78</xref></sup> A male who is thirteen years old [is considered an adult] as our fathers have transmitted.</p>
<p>23. AND NO SIN-OFFERING, WHEREOF ANY OF THE BLOOD IS BROUGHT INTO&#x2026;THE HOLY PLACE. Note, the place of the &#x201C;veil&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn341">79</xref></sup> is called holy,<sup><xref rid="fn342">80</xref></sup> for the courtyard,<sup><xref rid="fn343">81</xref></sup> even though it is holy, is not holy in comparison to the tent of meeting.<sup><xref rid="fn344">82</xref></sup> Observe, the inside of the curtain is called holy in comparison to the tent of meeting. Compare, <italic>Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place</italic> (Lev. 16:3).<sup><xref rid="fn345">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sin offering spoken of in our verse is the sin offering of the <italic>kohen gadol</italic> or of the congregation.<sup><xref rid="fn346">84</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn263"><sup>1</sup> The word <italic>olah</italic> means goes up. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn264"><sup>2</sup> For another interpretation of the term <italic>olah</italic>, see I.E. on Lev 1:4. According to Meijler this interpretation complements the one on Lev. 1:4. That is, the <italic>olah</italic> goes up on the altar to atone for that which enters (goes up on) one&#x2019;s mind.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn265"><sup>3</sup> For Scripture states that the <italic>olah</italic> shall remain on the firewood all night, not that it should be brought upon the firewood at night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn266"><sup>4</sup> <italic>Mokedah</italic> is a variant of <italic>moked</italic> (fire). Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation. It should be noted that I.E. renders <italic>mokedah</italic> &#x201C;fire&#x201D; (firewood), not its fire (or firewood), for there is no <italic>mappik</italic> in the <italic>heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn267"><sup>5</sup> Both meaning firewood.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn268"><sup>6</sup> Hebrew, <italic>bo</italic> (on it). According to I.E. our clause should be rendered: And the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it (the altar). Hence his interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn269"><sup>7</sup> Not his garment. In other words, the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>middo</italic> is not a pronominal suffix. It is rather superfluous. See the word <italic>beno</italic> (son of) (Num. 24:3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn270"><sup>8</sup> The sages of the Talmud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn271"><sup>9</sup> See <italic>Yoma</italic> 23:2. The word <italic>middah</italic> means a measure. According to the rabbis <italic>middo</italic> means his measure. Also see Rashi: &#x201C;This is what is elsewhere termed the <italic>ketonet</italic>; and why then is it here called <italic>middo</italic>? To intimate that it (the <italic>ketonet</italic>) must be made to his measure.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn272"><sup>10</sup> Near the eastern side of the altar. See Lev. 1:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn273"><sup>11</sup> <italic>And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby</italic> repeats what was stated in verse 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn274"><sup>12</sup> Repetition indicates continuity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn275"><sup>13</sup> Again, the repetition indicates continuity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn276"><sup>14</sup> The organs which Scripture states are to be offered. See Lev. 3:3,4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn277"><sup>15</sup> For our verse states, <italic>and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it</italic>, and afterwards goes on to say, <italic>and shall make smoke thereon the fat of the peace-offerings</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn278"><sup>16</sup> Which once again states, <italic>fire shall be kept burning upon the altar</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn279"><sup>17</sup> <italic>Hakrev</italic> might be taken to be an imperative.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn280"><sup>18</sup> Since the reference is to one of the sons of Aaron, Scripture employs the singular in verse 8, <italic>And he shall take up there-from</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn281"><sup>19</sup> Verses 7-11, which deal with the laws of the meal offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn282"><sup>20</sup> Lev. 2:1-16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn283"><sup>21</sup> Our verse contains two precepts not found in Lev. 2:1-16. The two commandments are: It must be eaten as unleavened bread; and it shall be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn284"><sup>22</sup> Only males may eat of the burnt offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn285"><sup>23</sup> Commandment added here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn286"><sup>24</sup> Hebrew, <italic>lo te&#x2019;afeh chametz</italic>. I.E. renders this as it shall not be baked as leavened bread.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn287"><sup>25</sup> The <italic>matzot</italic> eaten on Passover must be unleavened. So too the <italic>matzot</italic> made out of the meal offering.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn309"><sup>47</sup> The word <italic>mechatte</italic> literally means &#x201C;removes sins.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn310"><sup>48</sup> For the sprinkling &#x201C;removes&#x201D; the sin from the sinner. This comment relates to the previous verse.

The verse literally reads: And when (<italic>asher</italic>) there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, that (<italic>asher</italic>) it is sprinkled upon it, you shall wash in a holy place. The aforementioned is repetitious and ambiguous. I.E. suggests two possible interpretations. One, our verse is to be interpreted: And when (<italic>asher</italic>) there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, or if one (<italic>asher</italic>) sprinkles upon it (the flesh of the sin offering), you shall wash it in a holy place. Two: And when (<italic>asher</italic>) there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, the place where (<italic>makom asher</italic>) something is sprinkled upon it (the garment), you shall wash in a holy place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn327"><sup>65</sup> The word <italic>beged</italic> (garment) is usually masculine. The word <italic>aleha</italic> (it) is feminine. Thus if &#x201C;it&#x201D; refers to <italic>beged</italic> (garment) then <italic>beged</italic> is also a feminine noun.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 7</title>
<p>1. AND THIS IS THE LAW OF THE GUILT-OFFERING. I have previously<sup><xref rid="fn347">1</xref></sup> explained to you the difference between a sin offering<sup><xref rid="fn348">2</xref></sup> and a guilt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn349">3</xref></sup> [There is a difference between the two] even though Scripture employs the term guilt when referring to a sin offering<sup><xref rid="fn350">4</xref></sup> and the word sin when referring to a guilt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn351">5</xref></sup> Scripture records this section<sup><xref rid="fn352">6</xref></sup> because it wants to make mention of the fat,<sup><xref rid="fn353">7</xref></sup> to which no reference is made when Scripture earlier records the law of the sin offering.<sup><xref rid="fn354">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. ANY MAN&#x2019;S BURNT-OFFERING. The word <italic>olat</italic> (burnt offering) is penultimately accented<sup><xref rid="fn355">9</xref></sup> in accordance with the rules of Hebrew grammar.<sup><xref rid="fn356">10</xref></sup> It is so accented because the word that follows<sup><xref rid="fn357">11</xref></sup> has the accent on the first part of the word.</p>
<p>Scripture reads <italic>to himself</italic> even though it earlier stated <italic>even the priest</italic><sup><xref rid="fn358">12</xref></sup> because it wants to further explain that the skin not be given to another <italic>kohen</italic>.</p>
<p>9. AND ALL THAT IS DRESSED. The word <italic>na&#x2019;asah</italic> (dressed) is an adjective<sup><xref rid="fn359">13</xref></sup> in the feminine. It is like the word <italic>nirah</italic> (seen) in <italic>there was no stone seen</italic> (I Kings 6:18). The masculine form of the word is found in <italic>Now that which was prepared</italic> (na&#x2019;aseh) (Neh. 5:18).</p>
<p>10. OR DRY. As in the case of the &#x201C;descending&#x201D; meal offering<sup><xref rid="fn360">14</xref></sup> and a meal offering brought about because of jealousy.<sup><xref rid="fn361">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. IF HE OFFER IT FOR A THANKSGIVING. Its meaning is, if he offers it because he wants to give thanks to God for escaping from some trouble.</p>
<p>UNLEAVENED CAKE.<sup><xref rid="fn362">16</xref></sup> As many as he desires.<sup><xref rid="fn363">17</xref></sup> However, he cannot bring fewer than two.<sup><xref rid="fn364">18</xref></sup> The same applies to the unleavened wafers.<sup><xref rid="fn365">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>SOAKED. I believe that the best interpretation of <italic>solet murbekhet</italic> (fine flour soaked) is chosen flour. The unleavened cakes<sup><xref rid="fn366">20</xref></sup> and the wafers<sup><xref rid="fn367">21</xref></sup> were baked. The cakes made from chosen flour were not so treated.<sup><xref rid="fn368">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. WITH CAKES. The meaning of <italic>al challot</italic> is with cakes.<sup><xref rid="fn369">23</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>And they came, both men and</italic> (al) <italic>women</italic> (Ex. 35:22).<sup><xref rid="fn370">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND OF IT HE SHALL PRESENT ONE OUT OF EACH OFFERING. Note, there had to be a minimum of four unleavened cakes.<sup><xref rid="fn371">25</xref></sup> However, in truth there were ten.<sup><xref rid="fn372">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. SHALL BE EATEN ON THE DAY OF HIS OFFERING. The one who offers the sacrifice, his family, and all who are clean shall eat it, for the peace offerings are also holy<sup><xref rid="fn373">27</xref></sup> even though they are lesser holy offerings.</p>
<p>16. A VOW. A vow uttered by the lips when in trouble.</p>
<p>OR A FREEWILL-OFFERING. His sprit moved him to bring a sacrifice to God, not because he had made a vow, or for thanksgiving.</p>
<p>ON THE DAY THAT HE OFFERETH HIS SACRIFICE. The word <italic>hakrivo</italic> is an infinitive<sup><xref rid="fn374">28</xref></sup> in the <italic>hifil</italic>.</p>
<p>[AND ON THE MORROW.] On the morrow of that day.<sup><xref rid="fn375">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THAT WHICH REMAINETH.] The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-ha-notar</italic> (that which remaineth)<sup><xref rid="fn376">30</xref></sup> has the same meaning as an unaspirated <italic>fa</italic> in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn377">31</xref></sup> The same applies to the <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>va-ya&#x2019;azov</italic> (left) in <italic>left his servants</italic> (Ex. 9:21)<sup><xref rid="fn378">32</xref></sup> and the <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>ve-ha-aretz</italic> (now the earth) in <italic>Now the earth was unformed and void</italic> (Gen. 1:2).<sup><xref rid="fn379">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. SHALL BE BURNT WITH FIRE. Like the parts of a sacrifice which Scripture designates for burning. However, it should not be burned on the altar.</p>
<p>18. [NEITHER SHALL IT BE IMPUTED UNTO HIM THAT OFFERETH IT.] Its meaning is, since Scripture designates that specific parts of the sacrifice be offered to God, all that remains of the animal is holy. Similarly the stones of the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn380">34</xref></sup> Since they are holy, it is unfit that anything that remains from them be used in a non-sacred way. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>of unhewn stones</italic> (Deut. 27:6).<sup><xref rid="fn381">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>ABHORRED. The word <italic>piggul</italic> (abhorred) is to be rendered as the Aramaic translator does.<sup><xref rid="fn382">36</xref></sup> Similarly the word <italic>piggulim</italic> (abominable things) in <italic>And broth of abominable things is in their vessels</italic> (Is. 65:4).</p>
<p>Some ask, &#x201C;Since the sweet savor ascended,<sup><xref rid="fn383">37</xref></sup> how can it not be accepted?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn384">38</xref></sup> The answer is that it depends on his intention. According to the law, the peace offerings must be holy. However that which is abhorred is not holy.<sup><xref rid="fn385">39</xref></sup> Furthermore,<sup><xref rid="fn386">40</xref></sup> the celebrant&#x2019;s gain<sup><xref rid="fn387">41</xref></sup> disappears in his loss<sup><xref rid="fn388">42</xref></sup> with regard to a peace offering. In the case of a vow offering, there is a new sin<sup><xref rid="fn389">43</xref></sup> corresponding to the first<sup><xref rid="fn390">44</xref></sup> if he does not fulfil his vow.<sup><xref rid="fn391">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHALL BEAR HIS INIQUITY. His punishment.<sup><xref rid="fn392">46</xref></sup> Scripture does not mention the punishment.<sup><xref rid="fn393">47</xref></sup> One who is unclean and eats sacred flesh is punished with <italic>karet</italic> (excision).<sup><xref rid="fn394">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>[20. HAVING HIS UNCLEANLINESS.] This means if his uncleanliness comes from his body, as in the case of a flux<sup><xref rid="fn395">49</xref></sup> or a leper.<sup><xref rid="fn396">50</xref></sup> Also because of uncleanliness caused by a nocturnal emission, as Scripture states, <italic>for he thought: Something</italic><sup><xref rid="fn397">51</xref></sup> <italic>hath befallen him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn398">52</xref></sup> (I Sam. 20:26). It also applies to uncleanliness that comes from contact with an outside source<sup><xref rid="fn399">53</xref></sup> such as a dead body, or a living person who experienced a flux or is a leper, or an unclean beast which may not be eaten, or a detestable thing from among the fowl and that which swarms.<sup><xref rid="fn400">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>A Sadducee<sup><xref rid="fn401">55</xref></sup> once came to me and asked, &#x201C;Does the Torah prohibit the fat tail?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn402">56</xref></sup> I answered that it is true that the fat tail is called &#x201C;fat&#x201D; (<italic>chelev</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn403">57</xref></sup> for the Torah states, <italic>the fat thereof, the fat tail entire</italic> (Lev. 3:9). However, while our sages prohibited all fat, they permitted the fat tail.<sup><xref rid="fn404">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Sadducee then replied, &#x201C;Does not the Torah prohibit all fat? Indeed it is written, <italic>that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood</italic> (Lev. 3:17). The latter is preceded by Scripture&#x2019;s statement, <italic>It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).&#x201D;</p>
<p>I once again answered him that this verse<sup><xref rid="fn405">59</xref></sup> relates to the peace offering. Also, the clause <italic>It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations</italic><sup><xref rid="fn406">60</xref></sup> does not provide complete proof, for we see that Scripture states, <italic>And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of your God</italic> (Lev. 23:14).<sup><xref rid="fn407">61</xref></sup> Now Scripture there writes, <italic>it is a statute for ever</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). Shall we then not eat bread in the Diaspora? For we have not brought the <italic>omer</italic> offering.<sup><xref rid="fn408">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>He, on his part, replied, &#x201C;<italic>Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat</italic> (v. 23).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn409">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>I again answered that this verse too refers to a peace offering. <italic>For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men present an offering</italic> (v. 25) is proof, for the latter excludes the fat of all flesh which is not offered as a peace offering, that is, all secular meat.<sup><xref rid="fn410">64</xref></sup> Scripture therefore states in our section, <italic>And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it</italic> (v. 24). It is known<sup><xref rid="fn411">65</xref></sup> that the flesh of that which dies of itself and that which is torn of beasts is prohibited. It is the flesh that is prohibited.<sup><xref rid="fn412">66</xref></sup> Now since the fat<sup><xref rid="fn413">67</xref></sup> is not offered on the altar, one might think that it is permitted. Hence Scripture warns,<sup><xref rid="fn414">68</xref></sup> <italic>but ye shall in no wise eat of it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn415">69</xref></sup> It is for this reason that Scripture does not mention the blood.<sup><xref rid="fn416">70</xref></sup> This section<sup><xref rid="fn417">71</xref></sup> was written in order to explain the punishment incurred by one who eats the fat of sacred flesh. The verse relating to <italic>any blood</italic> (v. 27) was similarly written to add that the blood of fowl is prohibited.<sup><xref rid="fn418">72</xref></sup> The fat of fowl is therefore permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn419">73</xref></sup> Scripture&#x2019;s statement in the Book of Deuteronomy (Deut. 1:1)<sup><xref rid="fn420">74</xref></sup> with regard to meat eaten out of desire, that is, non-sacred meat (Deut. 12:15-25), is total proof of what I say,<sup><xref rid="fn421">75</xref></sup> for Scripture states that non-sacred meat may be eaten in its entirety.<sup><xref rid="fn422">76</xref></sup> Only its blood is excluded in three places.<sup><xref rid="fn423">77</xref></sup> Fat is totally unmentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn424">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Sadducee&#x2019;s eyes opened and he uttered an oath with his lips to the effect that he will never rely on his judgment when it comes to explaining the commandments. He will rely only on the tradition transmitted by the Pharisees.<sup><xref rid="fn425">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. THE RIGHT THIGH. Is to be given to the <italic>kohen</italic> who sprinkles the blood, and the breast to all the <italic>kohanim</italic>.</p>
<p>35. THIS IS THE CONSECRATED PORTION. This is the reward of the consecration of Aaron or of the consecration of his sons. The word <italic>mishchat</italic> (consecrated portion) means leadership.<sup><xref rid="fn426">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. IN THE DAY THAT THEY WERE ANOINTED. <italic>Be-yom</italic> (in the day) is to be rendered, from the day.<sup><xref rid="fn427">81</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>ba-basar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn428">82</xref></sup> <italic>u-va-lachem</italic> (of the flesh and of the bread) (Lev. 8:32).</p>
<p>37. AND OF THE CONSECRATION-OFFERING. As written in the Torah portion <italic>And Thou Shalt Command</italic> (Ex. 27:20).</p>
<p>[38.] TO PRESENT THEIR OFFERINGS UNTO THE LORD, IN THE WILDERNESS OF SINAI. For Israel did not offer sacrifices until they came to Mount Sinai. I have previously shown you that the altar which Moses built after defeating Amalek was built in Horeb, which is Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn429">83</xref></sup> Israel camped there for a year minus ten days.<sup><xref rid="fn430">84</xref></sup> The latter is clearly stated in Scripture. They did not offer sacrifices in the wilderness, for the prophet clearly states, <italic>Did ye bring unto Me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel</italic>? (Amos 5:25). Israel similarly only offered the Passover sacrifice in Egypt, and for a second time at Mount Sinai,<sup><xref rid="fn431">85</xref></sup> for they had no cattle in the wilderness. They did not circumcise on the way after they journeyed from Mount Sinai. Most of them were thus uncircumcised.<sup><xref rid="fn432">86</xref></sup> Joshua circumcised them<sup><xref rid="fn433">87</xref></sup> so that they could partake of the Passover sacrifice.<sup><xref rid="fn434">88</xref></sup></p>

I.E. held that biblically speaking only the fat of an animal actually offered on the altar is prohibited. Other fat is prohibited by the rabbis. See I.E. on Deut. 12:15. The importance of I.E.&#x2019;s comment on this verse for understanding Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s approach to the <italic>halakhah</italic> is discussed in the introduction to this volume.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn405"><sup>59</sup> Lev. 3:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn406"><sup>60</sup> This clause may be taken to imply that the fat of animals not sacrificed is prohibited, for <italic>throughout the generations</italic> implies even in a time when the sanctuary no longer exists.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn407"><sup>61</sup> The <italic>omer</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn417"><sup>71</sup> Verses 20-25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn418"><sup>72</sup> Otherwise there would be no need for this verse, for Scripture earlier prohibited the blood of animals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn419"><sup>73</sup> Only the blood of fowl is spoken of in verse 27. Fat is not mentioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn420"><sup>74</sup> In other words, Scripture&#x2019;s statement in Deuteronomy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn421"><sup>75</sup> That only the fat of sacred meat is prohibited.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn422"><sup>76</sup> For there Scripture says that non-sacred meat may be eaten, <italic>as of the gazelle, and as of the hart</italic> (Deut. 12:15). The fat of the latter is permitted.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn424"><sup>78</sup> For it is permitted according to Torah law. However, the rabbis prohibited it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn425"><sup>79</sup> One of the leitmotifs of I.E.&#x2019;s commentary is that when it comes to religious practice we must rely on Rabbinic tradition. He offers the concession of the Karaite as proof of this position. See I.E.&#x2019;s introduction (Vol. I, pp. 3-10; 18,19).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn426"><sup>80</sup> According to I.E. our verse should be explained, this is Aaron&#x2019;s (or his sons&#x2019;) reward for holding the office of leadership, i.e., <italic>kohen</italic>.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 8</title>
<p>2. AND THE BULLOCK OF THE SIN-OFFERING. The word <italic>chattat</italic> (sin offering) has a <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn435">1</xref></sup> prefixed to it because the sin offering<sup><xref rid="fn436">2</xref></sup> is mentioned earlier.<sup><xref rid="fn437">3</xref></sup> The same applies to the <italic>heh</italic> prefixed to <italic>elim</italic> (rams) and <italic>matzot</italic> (unleavened bread).<sup><xref rid="fn438">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. ALL THE CONGREGATION. The heads of the tribes and the elders.</p>
<p>[7.] AND BOUND IT UNTO HIM.<sup><xref rid="fn439">5</xref></sup> The word <italic>va-yepod</italic> means and girded. Just as the golden plate (<italic>tzitz</italic>) (v. 9) is not the mitre (<italic>mitznefet</italic>) (<italic>Ibid</italic>.),<sup><xref rid="fn440">6</xref></sup> so <italic>the Urim and the Thummim</italic> (v. 8) are not the stones of the breastplate (Ex. 28:15-21).<sup><xref rid="fn441">7</xref></sup> Similarly, the Tablets were placed in the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn442">8</xref></sup> Scripture therefore reads, <italic>And in the breastplate he put in the Urim and the Thummim</italic> (v. 8).</p>
<p>6. AND MOSES BROUGHT AARON. To the laver (<italic>kiyyor</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn443">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WASHED THEM. By command.<sup><xref rid="fn444">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND MOSES TOOK THE ANOINTING OIL. It means that Moses had taken the oil<sup><xref rid="fn445">11</xref></sup> before the anointing of Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn446">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND MOSES BROUGHT AARON&#x2019;S SONS. Scripture notes this a second time<sup><xref rid="fn447">13</xref></sup> because it speaks at length.<sup><xref rid="fn448">14</xref></sup> On the other hand, this means that when Moses brought Aaron&#x2019;s sons he dressed them in tunics.<sup><xref rid="fn449">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>va-yalbishem</italic> (and clothed them) is a verb that governs two actions.<sup><xref rid="fn450">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND PURIFIED. I have previously explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn451">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SANCTIFIED IT. So that all the sins<sup><xref rid="fn452">18</xref></sup> may be atoned upon it.</p>
<p>16. AND HE TOOK ALL THE FAT THAT WAS UPON THE INWARDS. Scripture earlier stated, <italic>the fat that covereth the inwards</italic> (Lev. 7:3) Another verse states, <italic>the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards</italic> (Lev. 3:3). Note, the <italic>fat that covereth</italic> [<italic>the inwards</italic>] is substantial. However, the <italic>fat that is upon the inwards</italic> consists of a little from here and there.<sup><xref rid="fn453">19</xref></sup> That which <italic>covereth</italic> [<italic>the inwards</italic>] is also <italic>upon the inwards</italic>. Hence Scripture employed abridged terminology.<sup><xref rid="fn454">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. WERE BURNT<sup><xref rid="fn455">21</xref></sup> WITH FIRE. Some say by Moses himself.<sup><xref rid="fn456">22</xref></sup> Others say by the command of Moses. They offer as proof, <italic>as the Lord commanded Moses</italic> (v. 21).<sup><xref rid="fn457">23</xref></sup> However, this is no proof, for that is the style of the Hebrew language.<sup><xref rid="fn458">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND THE OTHER RAM WAS PRESENTED, THE RAM OF CONSECRATION, AND AARON AND HIS SONS LAID (VA-YISMEKHU) THEIR HANDS. The first verse reads, <italic>and Aaron and his sons laid</italic><sup><xref rid="fn459">25</xref></sup> (ve-samakh) (v. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn460">26</xref></sup> Note, contra a great grammarian who erred, there is no difference between <italic>ve-samakh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn461">27</xref></sup> <italic>aron u-vanav</italic> (and Aaron and his sons laid) (v. 14) and <italic>va-yismekhu aron u-vanav</italic> (and Aaron and his sons laid). The grammarian said that <italic>ve-samakh</italic> indicates that Aaron alone shall lay hands, and then his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn462">28</xref></sup> <italic>Vesamekhu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn463">29</xref></sup> means, and they shall all lay together.</p>
<p>23. RIGHT EAR. <italic>Ha-yemanit</italic> (right) is similar to <italic>ha-penimit</italic> (inner).<sup><xref rid="fn464">30</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>al tenukh</italic> (upon the tip) and <italic>bohen</italic> (toe) will be explained in the section <italic>This Shall Be the Law</italic> (Lev. 14:2).<sup><xref rid="fn465">31</xref></sup> Note, the blood<sup><xref rid="fn466">32</xref></sup> atones for Aaron&#x2019;s life. Similarly <italic>for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life</italic> (Lev. 17:11). This means the life in the blood shall atone.<sup><xref rid="fn467">33</xref></sup> Life is thus offered for life.<sup><xref rid="fn468">34</xref></sup> <italic>Then</italic> [Zipporah]&#x2026;<italic>cast it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn469">35</xref></sup> <italic>at his</italic><sup><xref rid="fn470">36</xref></sup> <italic>feet</italic> (Ex. 4:25) has a similar explanation.<sup><xref rid="fn471">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. ONE UNLEAVENED CAKE. The reference is to <italic>the one loaf</italic> (kikkar) <italic>of bread</italic> (Ex. 29:2s).<sup><xref rid="fn472">38</xref></sup> It is possible that the term <italic>kikkar</italic> (loaf) refers to weight.<sup><xref rid="fn473">39</xref></sup> It is not the same weight as that of a <italic>kikkar</italic> (talent) of gold or silver.<sup><xref rid="fn474">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND PLACED THEM ON THE FAT. Scripture does not mention the lobe<sup><xref rid="fn475">41</xref></sup> of the liver and the kidneys, for the lobe was small. The meaning of <italic>yoteret</italic> (lobe) is similar to the meaning of the word <italic>yitron</italic> (profit)<sup><xref rid="fn476">42</xref></sup> in <italic>What profit hath man</italic> (Eccles. 1:3).<sup><xref rid="fn477">43</xref></sup> The kidneys<sup><xref rid="fn478">44</xref></sup> are offered with their fat,<sup><xref rid="fn479">45</xref></sup> for Scripture would not refer to the kidneys as fat.<sup><xref rid="fn480">46</xref></sup> Only the fat tail is fat.<sup><xref rid="fn481">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND WAVED THEM. Moses waved Aaron and his sons<sup><xref rid="fn482">48</xref></sup> as Aaron waved the Levites.<sup><xref rid="fn483">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. BOIL THE FLESH. Aaron and his sons themselves were to boil the flesh, for <italic>and seethe its flesh</italic> (Ex. 29:31) is by command.<sup><xref rid="fn484">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. AND THAT WHICH REMAINETH OF THE FLESH AND OF THE BREAD. Until the morning,<sup><xref rid="fn485">51</xref></sup> for Scripture so states.<sup><xref rid="fn486">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. HE SHALL CONSECRATE YOU. The word <italic>ketz</italic> (end) was omitted.<sup><xref rid="fn487">53</xref></sup> Our verse should be read as if written, at the end of seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn488">54</xref></sup> On the other hand, its meaning might be, for a period of seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn489">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that <italic>And ye shall not go out&#x2026;seven days</italic><sup><xref rid="fn490">56</xref></sup> indicates that they went out at night<sup><xref rid="fn491">57</xref></sup> for their needs.<sup><xref rid="fn492">58</xref></sup> However, I believe that they went out during the day and night for their needs.<sup><xref rid="fn493">59</xref></sup> A great scholar<sup><xref rid="fn494">60</xref></sup> said that they dug a pit<sup><xref rid="fn495">61</xref></sup> in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.<sup><xref rid="fn496">62</xref></sup> However, this is farfetched.<sup><xref rid="fn497">63</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>And the children of Israel wept for Moses&#x2026;thirty days</italic> (Deut. 34:8), as if there was no moment that they did not weep.<sup><xref rid="fn498">64</xref></sup> Scripture clearly states that they shall sit at the door of the tent of meeting day and night (v. 35). Its meaning is that they shall not occupy themselves with any matter and they should not go to another place.<sup><xref rid="fn499">65</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>neither shall he go out of the sanctuary</italic> (Lev. 21:12), as I will explain.<sup><xref rid="fn500">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. AS HATH BEEN DONE THIS DAY.<sup><xref rid="fn501">67</xref></sup> This means, as Moses did on this day, so God commanded to be done during the seven days of consecration. Scripture should have read, as I<sup><xref rid="fn502">68</xref></sup> did.<sup><xref rid="fn503">69</xref></sup> However, such is the style of the holy tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn504">70</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Thus shall Ezekiel he unto you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn505">71</xref></sup> (Ezek. 24:24); <italic>and Jephthah, and Samuel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn506">72</xref></sup> (I Sam. 12:11). The fact that Scripture states, <italic>So the Lord hath commanded to do</italic> (v. 34); <italic>And thus shall you do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee; seven days</italic> (Ex. 29:35)<sup><xref rid="fn507">73</xref></sup> is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn508">74</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>And every day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn509">75</xref></sup> <italic>shalt thou</italic><sup><xref rid="fn510">76</xref></sup> <italic>offer the bullock of sin-offering</italic> (Ex. 29:36).<sup><xref rid="fn511">77</xref></sup> The latter is similar to <italic>two day by day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn512">78</xref></sup> <italic>for a continual burnt-offering</italic><sup><xref rid="fn513">79</xref></sup>(Num. 28:3).<sup><xref rid="fn514">80</xref></sup> Scripture there writes, <italic>and thou</italic><sup><xref rid="fn515">81</xref></sup> <italic>shalt do the purification</italic><sup><xref rid="fn516">82</xref></sup> <italic>upon the altar&#x2026;and thou shalt anoint it</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>) every day until the end of the days of consecration.<sup><xref rid="fn517">83</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>Seven days thou</italic><sup><xref rid="fn518">84</xref></sup> <italic>shalt make atonement for the altar</italic> (Ex. 29:37).<sup><xref rid="fn519">85</xref></sup> It does not mention<sup><xref rid="fn520">86</xref></sup> the two rams<sup><xref rid="fn521">87</xref></sup> because Scripture employed an abridged style.<sup><xref rid="fn522">88</xref></sup> Many are of the opinion that Moses was to offer a bullock of sin offering alone every day.<sup><xref rid="fn523">89</xref></sup> I believe that the reason Scripture mentions the bullock<sup><xref rid="fn524">90</xref></sup> is that the blood of the burnt offering ram was to be placed on Aaron and his sons,<sup><xref rid="fn525">91</xref></sup> and the second ram&#x2019;s flesh was to be eaten.<sup><xref rid="fn526">92</xref></sup> However, the sin offering bullock was to consecrate the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn527">93</xref></sup> Scripture clearly states, <italic>al hakippurim</italic> (beside the other offerings of atonement) (Ex. 29:36), the meaning of which is, for atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn528">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. AND AT THE DOOR OF THE TENT OF MEETING SHALL YE ABIDE. This is stated once again<sup><xref rid="fn529">95</xref></sup> in order to add, <italic>that ye die not</italic>.</p>
<p>I AM COMMANDED. <italic>Tzuvveti</italic> (I am commanded) is <italic>a pu&#x2019;al</italic>. Some say that the meaning of <italic>for so I am commanded</italic> is identical to <italic>according to all that I have commanded thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn530">96</xref></sup> (Ex. 29:35), even though Scripture does not state there that they are to abide at the front of the tent of meeting.<sup><xref rid="fn531">97</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn438"><sup>4</sup> The words <italic>elim</italic> (rams) and <italic>matzot</italic> (unleavened bread) have a <italic>heh</italic> prefixed to them because they refer to the rams and <italic>matzot</italic> mentioned in Ex. 29:1,2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn439"><sup>5</sup> This comment appears to be misplaced.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn440"><sup>6</sup> It is clear from verse 9 that the golden plate (<italic>tzitz</italic>) and the mitre (<italic>mitznefet</italic>) are not one and the same, for the verse states, <italic>and upon the mitre&#x2026;did he set the golden plate</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn441"><sup>7</sup> For Scripture states, <italic>And in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim</italic>. See I.E. on Ex. 28:5, Vol 2, pp. 591-598.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn442"><sup>8</sup> The relation of the breastplate to the <italic>Urim</italic> and the <italic>Thummim</italic> was like that of the ark to the tablets; that is, both served as receptacles.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn443"><sup>9</sup> See Ex. 30:17-21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn444"><sup>10</sup> Moses commanded that they be washed, or he commanded them to wash themselves. The point is Moses did not personally wash them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn445"><sup>11</sup> And anointed the tabernacle and its furniture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn446"><sup>12</sup> Scripture tells of the dressing of Aaron in the priestly vestments in verses 7-9. I.E. assumes that Aaron was anointed as soon as the garments were placed upon him (see Ex. 40:15). The Torah then goes on to tell of the anointing of the tabernacle and its furniture in verses 10-12. It then tells of the dressing of Aaron&#x2019;s sons (v. 13). However, Ex. 40:9-12 tells us that the anointing of the tabernacle took place before the anointing of Aaron. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn447"><sup>13</sup> After stating this in verse 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn448"><sup>14</sup> About other things. In other words, after stating in verse 6 that Moses brought Aaron and his sons to the laver, Scripture drops Aaron&#x2019;s sons and goes on to speak of Aaron and the tabernacle. Hence, now that it goes on to speak of Aaron&#x2019;s sons, it once again mentions that Moses brought Aaron and his sons to the laver and goes on to say what followed then.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn449"><sup>15</sup> In other words, <italic>va-yakrev</italic> here does not mean and brought. Rather it means when he brought. In this case there is no repetition in our verse.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn461"><sup>27</sup> This appears to be an error. I.E. should read <italic>va-yismokh</italic>, for he is referring to verse 14. <italic>Va-samakh</italic> is the reading in Ex. 29:10; 19 where the laws of the consecration were first given.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn473"><sup>39</sup> In this case Ex. 29:23 is to be rendered, the one <italic>kikkar</italic> of (un)leavened bread. This interpretation assumes that the term loaf would not be used in reference to unleavened bread.</ftnote>

The verse may be taken to read, for seven days shall consecrate you. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation (Meijler).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn488"><sup>54</sup> In other words, <italic>ki shivat yamim yemalle et yedkhem</italic> means at the end of seven days you will be consecrated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn489"><sup>55</sup> According to this interpretation the word <italic>zeman</italic> has been omitted from the last clause in our verse. In this case our verse reads, for you shall be consecrated for a period of seven days.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn497"><sup>63</sup> For they would not relieve themselves in the courtyard of the sanctuary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn498"><sup>64</sup> In other words, Deut. 34:8 is hyperbolical, for they obviously did not weep every moment of the thirty days.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn504"><sup>70</sup> Biblical characters occasionally refer to themselves in the third person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn505"><sup>71</sup> Ezekiel refers to himself in the third person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn506"><sup>72</sup> Samuel refers to himself in the third person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn507"><sup>73</sup> The complete verse reads: <italic>So the Lord hath commanded to do; And thus shall you do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee; seven days shalt thou consecrate them</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn508"><sup>74</sup> That &#x201C;As he did this day&#x201D; refers to Moses, for the verse states <italic>seven days shalt thou</italic> (Moses) <italic>consecrate them</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn509"><sup>75</sup> Hebrew, <italic>la-yom</italic> (literally, to the day).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn510"><sup>76</sup> Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn511"><sup>77</sup> This is additional proof that Moses himself performed the consecration ritual during the seven days of consecration.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn512"><sup>78</sup> Hebrew, <italic>la-yom</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn513"><sup>79</sup> The phrase a <italic>continual burnt-offering</italic> indicates that the word <italic>la-yom</italic>, which precedes it, means daily. Thus the term <italic>la-yom</italic> in Ex. 29:36 is to be rendered every day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn514"><sup>80</sup> In other words the meaning of <italic>la-yom</italic> in Ex. 29:35 is daily. We thus see that Moses offered the bullock of sin offering during the seven days of consecration.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn515"><sup>81</sup> Moses.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn520"><sup>86</sup> In Ex. 29:36. Ex. 29:36 states, <italic>and every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin-offering</italic>. It omits the two rams. Hence it appears that Moses did not perform the entire consecration service.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn521"><sup>87</sup> One of which served as a sin offering and one as a &#x201C;ram of consecration.&#x201D; See Ex: 29:1, 15-34; Lev. 8:2, 18-29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn522"><sup>88</sup> Actually, Moses offered these rams during the seven days of consecration.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn523"><sup>89</sup> For Scripture states, <italic>And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin-offering</italic> (Ex. 29:36). It does not mention the rams. This is the opinion of the Karaite Yefet (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn524"><sup>90</sup> Only in Ex. 29:36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn525"><sup>91</sup> This comment presents a problem. It was the blood of the second ram, the ram of consecration, that was placed on Aaron and his sons. See Ex. 29:1921; Lev. 8:22,23. It is possible that I.E. erred, for I.E. wrote many of his comments without a text of Scripture before him and he didn&#x2019;t always edit his works. On the other hand, it is possible that I.E. was of the opinion that the blood of both rams was placed on Aaron and his sons even though Scripture only mentions it with regard to the second ram. Weiser suggests that our reading is due to an error by a copyist. Rabbi Shemu&#x2019;el Tzartza believes that &#x201C;I believe, etc.&#x201D; is a gloss that found its way into I.E.&#x2019;s commentary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn526"><sup>92</sup> Ex. 29:32.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn527"><sup>93</sup> The two rams are not mentioned in Ex. 29:36 because the latter speaks only of consecrating the altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn528"><sup>94</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the bullock was offered on the altar to atone, i.e., to purify the altar in order to consecrate it, while the rams were part of the consecration ritual of Aaron and his sons. Hence Scripture did not speak of them in the verse which spoke of atoning on the altar.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 9</title>
<h1>SHEMINI</h1>
<p>1. AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE EIGHTH DAY. It would have appeared to us that the <italic>eighth day</italic> is the eighth day of Nisan, for the tabernacle was erected on the first day of the month.<sup><xref rid="fn532">1</xref></sup> However, the transmitters of tradition<sup><xref rid="fn533">2</xref></sup> said that the reference is to the first of Nisan.<sup><xref rid="fn534">3</xref></sup> Moses erected and took apart the tabernacle on each one of the seven days of consecration<sup><xref rid="fn535">4</xref></sup> to train and teach.<sup><xref rid="fn536">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT MOSES CALLED AARON AND HIS SONS. And they went out from the opening of the tent of meeting.<sup><xref rid="fn537">6</xref></sup> On the other hand, the congregation entered the courtyard.<sup><xref rid="fn538">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. A BULL-CALF.<sup><xref rid="fn539">8</xref></sup> During the seven days of consecration a bullock and also a ram were offered for a burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn540">9</xref></sup> Scripture does not mention whether the bull-calf was &#x201C;of the year.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn541">10</xref></sup> It appears to me that a bullock<sup><xref rid="fn542">11</xref></sup> and a bull-calf<sup><xref rid="fn543">12</xref></sup> are one and the same when the term &#x201C;year&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn544">13</xref></sup> is unmentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn545">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. WITHOUT BLEMISH. This refers to the bull-calf and the ram.<sup><xref rid="fn546">15</xref></sup> The bullocks of consecration<sup><xref rid="fn547">16</xref></sup> were to purify the altar. This bull-calf was to atone (<italic>le-khapper</italic>) for Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn548">17</xref></sup> I have already explained this word.<sup><xref rid="fn549">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>A HE-GOAT FOR A SIN-OFFERING. For the congregation. Also [for the congregation] a calf that has not reached the age of a complete year,<sup><xref rid="fn550">19</xref></sup> and a lamb for a burnt offering.</p>
<p>4. AND AN OX AND A RAM. Fully grown.<sup><xref rid="fn551">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND A MEAL-OFFERING. Of fine flour for each and every one.<sup><xref rid="fn552">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>[6. AND MOSES SAID.] <italic>Va-yomer mosheh</italic> (and Moses said) is to be understood in a manner similar to that of <italic>va-eshal otah</italic> (and I asked her) (Gen. 24:47). I have pointed out to you how the latter is to be interpreted.<sup><xref rid="fn553">22</xref></sup> The meaning of our clause is that Moses had already said to them, <italic>This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do</italic>, namely, that you offer a he-goat (v. 3), a calf (v. 3), a lamb (v. 3), and an ox and a ram (v. 4);<sup><xref rid="fn554">23</xref></sup> then the glory of God will then appear to them. The latter refers to the fire that came forth from the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn555">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THYSELF, AND FOR THE PEOPLE. There is a divine command that you make atonement for yourself and for all of the people. You will atone for yourself with a sin offering bullock. Afterwards you will atone for the congregation by offering the people&#x2019;s sacrifice, for a person cannot atone for another unless he has been purified from all sin.</p>
<p>8. WHICH WAS FOR HIMSELF. It came from his own property. So too the bullock of the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn556">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. THE BLOOD. He poured out the blood which remained.</p>
<p>10. BUT THE FAT. Which covered the innards, which was upon the innards, and which was on the kidneys.<sup><xref rid="fn557">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND&#x2026;DELIVERED UNTO HIM The word <italic>va-yamtzi&#x2019;u</italic> (and&#x2026;delivered unto him) is related to the word <italic>matza</italic> (found). Aaron found the blood when it was needed.<sup><xref rid="fn558">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THE PEOPLE&#x2019;S OFFERING WAS PRESENTED.<sup><xref rid="fn559">28</xref></sup> On the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn560">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND OFFERED IT FOR SIN, AS THE FIRST. This refers to the sin offering bull-calf.<sup><xref rid="fn561">30</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>va-yechattehu</italic> (and offered it for sin) is, to atone with it for the sin.<sup><xref rid="fn562">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND THEY PUT THE FAT. With the kidneys and the lobe of the liver, as I have shown you.<sup><xref rid="fn563">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND THE BREASTS. The breast of the ox and the breast of the ram.</p>
<p>AND THE RIGHT THIGH.<sup><xref rid="fn564">33</xref></sup> From this one and that one.<sup><xref rid="fn565">34</xref></sup> The word <italic>shok</italic> (thigh) is connected to the word <italic>ha-pe&#x2019;ah</italic> (corner), or <italic>ha-tazad</italic> (side).<sup><xref rid="fn566">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND AARON LIFTED UP HIS HANDS TOWARD<sup><xref rid="fn567">36</xref></sup> THE PEOPLE. Toward them.<sup><xref rid="fn568">37</xref></sup> From here our ancients transmitted to us the form taken by the &#x201C;raising of the hands.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn569">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE CAME DOWN. <italic>Va-yered</italic> (and he came down) is to be understood in accordance with what I have previously pointed out to you many times.<sup><xref rid="fn570">39</xref></sup> It means that Aaron had already come down<sup><xref rid="fn571">40</xref></sup> from offering the people&#x2019;s sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offering. Scripture reads came down because the altar was three cubits in height.<sup><xref rid="fn572">41</xref></sup> After this,<sup><xref rid="fn573">42</xref></sup> Moses and Aaron came to the tent of meeting. It is likely that they came to pray that a fire would come forth. When they came out<sup><xref rid="fn574">43</xref></sup> both of them blessed the people.</p>
<p>24. THE BURNT-OFFERING. The burnt offering of Aaron, the burnt offering of the people, and the continual burnt offering,<sup><xref rid="fn575">44</xref></sup> for Scripture states, <italic>beside the burnt-offering of the morning</italic> (Num. 28:23).<sup><xref rid="fn576">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE FAT. From the bull-calf and the ram of Aaron, and the he-goat, the ox, and the ram</p>
<p>THEY SHOUTED. <italic>Va-yaronnu</italic> (they shouted) means they raised their voices. Compare, <italic>rinnah</italic> (cry) in <italic>And there went a cry throughout the host</italic> (I Kings 22:36).</p>

<ftnote id="fn535"><sup>4</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 40:2 (Vol. 2, p. 754).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn536"><sup>5</sup> The <italic>kohanim</italic> how to do it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn537"><sup>6</sup> The <italic>kohanim</italic> left the opening of the tent of meeting where they had to stay during the seven days of consecration (Lev. 8:35) and went into the camp of Israel to meet the elders (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn538"><sup>7</sup> On the other hand, the elders may have entered the temple courtyard to meet the <italic>kohanim</italic>. During the seven days of consecration the <italic>kohanim</italic> and the elders were separated. On the eighth day Moses spoke to them as a group. Hence the two possibilities offered by I.E. as to how they met.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn539"><sup>8</sup> Hebrew, <italic>egel ben bakar</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn540"><sup>9</sup> See Lev. 8:2,14,18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn541"><sup>10</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ben shanah</italic>, which means less than a year old. Scripture reads, <italic>egel ben bakar</italic>. It does not read, <italic>egel ben shanah</italic> (a calf of the year).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn542"><sup>11</sup> Hebrew, <italic>par</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn543"><sup>12</sup> Hebrew, <italic>egel</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn544"><sup>13</sup> That is, &#x201C;of the year.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn545"><sup>14</sup> In other words, the terms <italic>egel</italic> and <italic>par</italic> refer to a bull over the age of one. Thus the bull offered during the seven days of consecration and the one offered on the eighth day were similar. They were both over a year old.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn546"><sup>15</sup> Hence Scripture employs the plural <italic>temimim</italic> (without blemish).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn547"><sup>16</sup> See Ex. 29:36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn548"><sup>17</sup> For any sin or sins that Aaron may possibly have committed. Some interpret for making the golden calf (Weiser). See <italic>Sifra</italic>, &#x201C;Let this calf come and atone for the making of the calf.&#x201D; However, I.E. explicitly rejects this interpretation in Ex. 31:18 (Vol. 2, p. 656).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn549"><sup>18</sup> The meaning of <italic>le-khapper</italic>. See I.E. on Lev. 1:4, <italic>&#x201C;Le-khapper alav</italic>: To serve as a ransom for the punishment due to him.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn550"><sup>19</sup> For Scripture reads, <italic>bene shanah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn551"><sup>20</sup> For Scripture reads, <italic>shor</italic> and <italic>ayil</italic>, not <italic>par</italic> and <italic>keves</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn552"><sup>21</sup> For each sacrifice. Scripture employs the singular <italic>minchah</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn553"><sup>22</sup> According to I.E. the meaning of <italic>va-eshal otah</italic> (and I asked her) is, I had already asked. See I.E. on Gen. 24:14 (Vol. 1, p. 236).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn554"><sup>23</sup> What is recorded in verse 6 occurred before that which is recorded in verse 5. In other words, Moses told the Israelites, <italic>This is the thing that the Lord commanded&#x2026;</italic> before Israel <italic>brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn555"><sup>24</sup> See verses 23 and 24.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn558"><sup>27</sup> In other words, <italic>va-yamtzi&#x2019;u</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic>, meaning, and they caused it to be found.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn559"><sup>28</sup> Hebrew, <italic>va-yakrev</italic> (literally, and he brought). Thus our clause literally reads, And he brought the people&#x2019;s offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn560"><sup>29</sup> In other words, our clause tells us in general terms that Aaron brought the people&#x2019;s offering on the altar. It then backtracks and describes the aforementioned in detail. Meijler suggests emending <italic>al</italic> to <italic>el</italic>. In this case I.E. reads, &#x201C;to the altar.&#x201D; In other words, Scripture first tells us that the people&#x2019;s offering was brought to the altar and then goes on to tell us how Aaron and his sons dealt with it</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn561"><sup>30</sup> In other words, <italic>as the first</italic> means as the first sin offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn562"><sup>31</sup> See I.E. on Lev. 6:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn563"><sup>32</sup> That Scripture is elliptical. See I.E. on verse 10 and on Lev. 8:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn564"><sup>33</sup> Hebrew, <italic>shok ha-yamin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn565"><sup>34</sup> From the ox and the ram.</ftnote>

In other words, <italic>shok ha-yamin</italic> is not to be rendered the <italic>right thigh</italic>, for <italic>ha-yamin</italic> (the right) is not an adjective describing <italic>shok</italic> (thigh). If <italic>ha-yamin</italic> (the right) were an adjective describing <italic>shok</italic> (thigh), our phrase would have read, <italic>ha-shok ha-yamin</italic>, rather than <italic>shok ha-yamin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn567"><sup>36</sup> Hebrew, <italic>el</italic> (literally, to).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn568"><sup>37</sup> In other words, <italic>el ha-am</italic> means towards the people. We have followed the reading in <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38.

<p>1. EACH OF THEM HIS CENSER.<sup><xref rid="fn577">1</xref></sup> Each man took his firepan.<sup><xref rid="fn578">2</xref></sup> I believe that this event also took place on the eighth day.<sup><xref rid="fn579">3</xref></sup> <italic>Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering</italic> (v. 19)<sup><xref rid="fn580">4</xref></sup> is proof of this.</p>
<p>AND PUT FIRE THEREIN. Not from the fire that came forth from the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn581">5</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>strange fire</italic>.</p>
<p>[WHICH HE HAD NOT COMMANDED THEM.] They acted on their own and were not commanded to burn incense and certainly not to employ a strange fire.</p>
<p>2. AND THEY DIED BEFORE THE LORD. They thought that they were doing something favorable before Him.<sup><xref rid="fn582">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. THIS IS THAT THE LORD SPOKE. God has previously told me that He will demonstrate His holiness through those who are close to Him.<sup><xref rid="fn583">7</xref></sup> Our verse is similar in meaning to <italic>You only have I known</italic><sup><xref rid="fn584">8</xref></sup> (Amos 3:2). I will be exalted when I show My sanctity through those who are close to Me. I will then be glorified before all the people, and they will fear me.</p>
<p>4. CARRY YOUR BRETHREN FROM BEFORE THE SANCTUARY. Some say<sup><xref rid="fn585">9</xref></sup> that the incense was before the altar of the burnt offering<sup><xref rid="fn586">10</xref></sup> and the Levites entered there.<sup><xref rid="fn587">11</xref></sup> Others say<sup><xref rid="fn588">12</xref></sup> that the incense was on the altar of incense<sup><xref rid="fn589">13</xref></sup> and Moses took them out of the tent of meeting.<sup><xref rid="fn590">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROM BEFORE THE SANCTUARY. The reference is to the courtyard. The latter, as I have explained, is referred to as the sanctuary, in contrast to the camp.<sup><xref rid="fn591">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. LET NOT THE HAIR OF YOUR HEADS GO LOOSE. Some say that <italic>tifra&#x2019;u</italic> (go loose) means to let the hair grow long.</p>
<p>REND. The word <italic>tifromu</italic> means rend. Actually the word <italic>tifra&#x2019;u</italic> (go loose) is related to the word <italic>faru&#x2019;a</italic> (go loose)<sup><xref rid="fn592">16</xref></sup> in <italic>his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose</italic> (Lev. 13:45).<sup><xref rid="fn593">17</xref></sup> Many say that it means<sup><xref rid="fn594">18</xref></sup> covered.<sup><xref rid="fn595">19</xref></sup> Others say that it means uncovered.<sup><xref rid="fn596">20</xref></sup> The words of tradition are true.<sup><xref rid="fn597">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT YE DIE NOT. The word <italic>ve-lo</italic> (that&#x2026;not) is to be read as if written twice. Compare, <italic>And I have not learned wisdom</italic> (Prov. 30:3).<sup><xref rid="fn598">22</xref></sup> Our verse is to be understood as follows: and that He be not wroth with all the congregation,<sup><xref rid="fn599">23</xref></sup> for you will atone for them.</p>
<p>[BUT LET YOUR BRETHREN, THE WHOLE HOUSE OF ISRAEL.] You will find the meaning of this alluded to in the Torah portion <italic>Behold, I Set</italic> (Deut. 11:26).<sup><xref rid="fn600">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO AARON. For Aaron was a prophet.<sup><xref rid="fn601">25</xref></sup> Others say through Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn602">26</xref></sup> as in <italic>And the Lord spoke again unto Ahaz</italic> (Is. 7:10).<sup><xref rid="fn603">27</xref></sup> God cautioned Aaron and his sons to keep the law<sup><xref rid="fn604">28</xref></sup> so that they do not die as Aaron&#x2019;s oldest sons died.</p>
<p>9. NOR STRONG DRINK. Made from any kind of wheat, honey, or dates, for wine destroys the reason of the one who imbibes it and he confuses things. Hence Scripture states, <italic>And that ye may put difference</italic> (v. 10).<sup><xref rid="fn605">29</xref></sup> Since you are a <italic>kohen gadol</italic> you will differentiate<sup><xref rid="fn606">30</xref></sup> between a holy place and a common place. The word <italic>chol</italic> (common) is related to the word <italic>chillul</italic> (profaned).<sup><xref rid="fn607">31</xref></sup> It is possible that <italic>between the holy and the common</italic> means between a holy day and a common day.</p>
<p>10. AND BETWEEN THE UNCLEAN AND THE CLEAN. Among cattle and things that swarm in the water and that fly. Therefore the section opening with the words <italic>These are the living things</italic> (Lev. 10:11), and then the sections dealing with the woman who gives birth (Lev. 12:1-8) and the leprosy that is found in humans (Lev. 13:1-46), on garments (Lev. 13:47-59) and in houses (Lev. 14:33-53); one who experiences a seminal emission (Lev. 15:16-18); a male or female who experiences a flux (Lev. 15:1-15, 25-33); and a menstruant (Lev. 15:19-24) follow this section. This is the meaning of <italic>and between the unclean and the clean</italic>.</p>
<p>11. AND THAT YE MAY TEACH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The rest of the commandments. Similarly <italic>and do according to all that the priests&#x2026;shall teach you</italic> (Deut. 24:8).</p>
<p>12. TAKE THE MEAL-OFFERING. No one aside from those who are holy are fit to eat that which remains from the meal offering after part of it has been burned in honor of God.<sup><xref rid="fn608">32</xref></sup> You shall begin to eat the portion which God has given you, to always take of God&#x2019;s fire-offerings;<sup><xref rid="fn609">33</xref></sup> this means<sup><xref rid="fn610">34</xref></sup> all meal offerings, part of which was burned in honor of God.</p>
<p>[14. IN A CLEAN PLACE.] Even though it is outside the courtyard. The breast and the thigh shall be eaten by males and females, for Scripture clearly states, <italic>every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof</italic> (Num. 18:11). Similarly slaves bought by money and born in the house,<sup><xref rid="fn611">35</xref></sup> and a widow<sup><xref rid="fn612">36</xref></sup> who returned to her father&#x2019;s house.<sup><xref rid="fn613">37</xref></sup> As you now eat the breast and the thigh, so shall the law be that you take these portions from all the sacrifices of peace offerings.</p>
<p>16. WAS BURNT. <italic>Soraf</italic> (was burnt) is a <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn614">38</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>morak</italic><sup><xref rid="fn615">39</xref></sup> (sodden) in <italic>it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water</italic> (Lev. 6:21).</p>
<p>17. IN THE PLACE OF THE SANCTUARY. At the opening of the tent of meeting, for this is clearly stated in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn616">40</xref></sup> <italic>And He hath given it you [to bear the iniquity of the congregation</italic>], for when you eat the sin offering God will bear the iniquity of the congregation.<sup><xref rid="fn617">41</xref></sup> Or its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn618">42</xref></sup> is, you will bear the iniquity of the congregation; that is, the sins of the congregation will be forgiven through you.<sup><xref rid="fn619">43</xref></sup> Hence Scripture states, <italic>to make atonement</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn620">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. BEHOLD, THE BLOOD OF IT WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE SANCTUARY WITHIN. Like the bullock brought by the <italic>kohen</italic> and the congregation for violation of any of the commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn621">45</xref></sup> Should one ask, &#x201C;Look, the bullock of the sin offering<sup><xref rid="fn622">46</xref></sup> was burned<sup><xref rid="fn623">47</xref></sup> and its blood was not brought into the inner sanctuary,<sup><xref rid="fn624">48</xref></sup> the reference being to the place of the curtain and the golden altar?&#x201D; Know that the sin offering bullock<sup><xref rid="fn625">49</xref></sup> was to purify the altar,<sup><xref rid="fn626">50</xref></sup> the he-goat sin offering<sup><xref rid="fn627">51</xref></sup> was to atone for the people, and the flesh of the sin offering was for the <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn628">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>YE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE EATEN IT. <italic>Akhol tokhelu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn629">53</xref></sup> is to be rendered, ye should have certainly eaten it.</p>
<p>[19.] There are grammarians who say that the interrogative <italic>heh</italic> is not followed by a <italic>dagesh</italic> when the letter<sup><xref rid="fn630">54</xref></sup> is vocalized with one of the seven &#x201C;kings.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn631">55</xref></sup> The letter following an interrogative <italic>heh</italic> is found with a <italic>dagesh</italic> only when it has a mobile <italic>sheva</italic> beneath it. The <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn632">56</xref></sup> is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> because two mobile <italic>shevas</italic> cannot come back to back.<sup><xref rid="fn633">57</xref></sup> Now, since they<sup><xref rid="fn634">58</xref></sup> found that the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>ha-yitav</italic> (would it have been well pleasing) has a <italic>dagesh</italic> in it, they said that the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>ha-yitav</italic> is the <italic>heh</italic> which indicates the direct object,<sup><xref rid="fn635">59</xref></sup> like the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>ha-shavah</italic> (that came) in <italic>that came back with Naomi</italic> (Ruth 2:6); the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>ha-nimtze&#x2019;u foh</italic> (that are found here) (I Chron. 29:17); the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>ha-hullalah</italic> (the renowned) in <italic>The renowned city</italic> (Ezek. 26:17). These <italic>hehs</italic> are in place of the word <italic>asher</italic> (that). This is the meaning of <italic>ha-yitav</italic> (would it have been well pleasing).<sup><xref rid="fn636">60</xref></sup> They further said that <italic>ve-akhalti</italic> (and if I had eaten) is a verb in the perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn637">61</xref></sup> If the word were an imperfect it would have been ultimately accented like the words <italic>vedibbarti</italic> (I have also spoken)<sup><xref rid="fn638">62</xref></sup> in <italic>I have also spoken unto the prophets</italic> (Hosea 12:11) and <italic>ve-dibbarti</italic> (and I will speak) in <italic>And I will speak with thee</italic> (Ex. 25:22).</p>
<p>The meaning of the first half of our verse is, my sons who were burned today offered their sin offering and their burnt offering, for the bull-calf and the ram<sup><xref rid="fn639">63</xref></sup> were offered on behalf of Aaron and his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn640">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THERE HAVE BEFALLEN ME SUCH THINGS AS THESE. The reference is to troubles or anxiety because of the death of the sons. It was because of this that I was not able to eat the entire sin offering, but I ate enough of it to find favor in the eyes of God, that is, an amount which is enough to fulfill my obligation.<sup><xref rid="fn641">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, in the opinion of the transmitters of tradition<sup><xref rid="fn642">66</xref></sup> the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>ha-yitav</italic> is an interrogative <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn643">67</xref></sup> and the word is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn644">68</xref></sup> It is also irregular according to the explanation which I mentioned above,<sup><xref rid="fn645">69</xref></sup> for we do not find in all of Scripture the definite article <italic>heh</italic> prefixed to a verb in the imperfect.<sup><xref rid="fn646">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>ve-akhalti chattat</italic> is to be interpreted as, and if I had eaten the sin offering.<sup><xref rid="fn647">71</xref></sup> We also find words in the imperfect that are penultimately accented.<sup><xref rid="fn648">72</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ve-ganavti</italic> (and steal)<sup><xref rid="fn649">73</xref></sup> in <italic>lest I be poor, and steal</italic> (Prov. 30:9). The meaning of our clause<sup><xref rid="fn650">74</xref></sup> is, I was mourning, and a mourner does not eat of the sin offering. Its meaning is similar to <italic>I have not eaten thereof</italic><sup><xref rid="fn651">75</xref></sup> <italic>in my mourning</italic> (Deut. 26:14).<sup><xref rid="fn652">76</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn578"><sup>2</sup> In other words, <italic>ish machtato</italic> is to be interpreted as if written <italic>kol ish machtato</italic> (each man his censer). Our verse literally reads, And&#x2026;the sons of Aaron took a man his censer. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that our verse is to be interpreted, And&#x2026;the sons of Aaron took each man his firepan.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 11</title>
<p>1. AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND TO AARON. For Aaron is the <italic>kohen</italic> who teaches and who differentiates between the unclean and the clean.<sup><xref rid="fn653">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. PARTETH. <italic>Mafreset</italic> (parteth) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn654">2</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>makrin mafris</italic><sup><xref rid="fn655">3</xref></sup> (horned and hoofed) (Ps. 69:32).<sup><xref rid="fn656">4</xref></sup> It means all animals which are described as having a hoof.</p>
<p>AND IS WHOLLY CLOVEN-FOOTED. <italic>Shosa&#x2019;at</italic> (wholly cloven) is an adjective. The meaning of <italic>ve-shosa&#x2019;at shesa perasot</italic> (and is wholly cloven-footed) is, whose hoofs are cloven.</p>
<p>AND CHEWETH THE CUD. <italic>Gerah</italic> (cud) is related to the word <italic>garon</italic> (throat).<sup><xref rid="fn657">5</xref></sup> The word <italic>ma&#x2019;alat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn658">6</xref></sup> (cheweth) is a verb in the present.<sup><xref rid="fn659">7</xref></sup> Scripture mentions the camel (v. 4), the rockbadger (v. 5), the hare (v. 6), and the swine (v. 7) because each one has one sign.<sup><xref rid="fn660">8</xref></sup> It is the style of Scripture to mention the male of each species because the masculine also takes in the feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn661">9</xref></sup> Scripture mentions the <italic>arnevet</italic> (hare).<sup><xref rid="fn662">10</xref></sup> Some say that it does so because the male is not found among them.<sup><xref rid="fn663">11</xref></sup> There are others who say that the male turns into a female and vice versa. However, the first interpretation appeals to me.</p>
<p>8. AND THEIR CARCASSES YE SHALL NOT TOUCH. Scripture does not mention that one who touches their carcasses shall be unclean until evening.<sup><xref rid="fn664">12</xref></sup> However, we know this from tradition. Now, the one who deliberately touches their carcass incurs the penalty of flogging, for he violated a negative commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn665">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>[9. IN THE SEAS.] If we pursue the literal meaning of the verse without the tradition of the rabbis, then the fish that are found in the lakes (<italic>agammim</italic>) are prohibited, for Scripture specifies <italic>the seas and the rivers</italic>.</p>
<p>FINS AND SCALES. <italic>Snappir ve-kaskeset</italic> (fins and scales) is to be rendered as the Aramaic translator does.<sup><xref rid="fn666">14</xref></sup></p>

Note, fish are called flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn669">17</xref></sup> However, what the sages of blessed memory said with regard to vows<sup><xref rid="fn670">18</xref></sup> refers to the custom of their generations.<sup><xref rid="fn671">19</xref></sup> Scripture adds, <italic>Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales</italic> to include all waters, for Scripture earlier mentioned only the seas and the rivers.</p>
<p>13. THE GREAT VULTURE The meaning of <italic>nesher</italic> (the great vulture) is known. This is also the bird which has the same name in the language of the Ishmaelites.<sup><xref rid="fn672">20</xref></sup> There is something of a proof that this is the case, because the two languages are related.</p>
<p>AND THE OSPRAY. Even though there is an individual opinion that it (the osprey) is not found in inhabited places, the Gaon erred in rendering it <italic>al enka</italic>, for this term in the language of the Ishmaelites refers to something that never existed. It refers to something that was not created and never was. It is only employed metaphorically. The Arab grammarians admit this. This being the case, it is not possible that the Torah would prohibit something that never existed.<sup><xref rid="fn673">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THE KITE. The term <italic>da&#x2019;ah</italic> (kite) is a general term which takes in two kinds, namely, the <italic>da&#x2019;ah</italic> (kite) and the <italic>dayyah</italic> (falcon).<sup><xref rid="fn674">22</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>tzippor</italic> (birds), the word used for a turtle-dove and a young pigeon in <italic>but the birds divided he not</italic> (Gen. 15:10). Now the transmitters of tradition who said that the <italic>ra&#x2019;ah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn675">23</xref></sup> (glede) is to be identified with the <italic>da&#x2019;ah</italic> (kite)<sup><xref rid="fn676">24</xref></sup> are correct.<sup><xref rid="fn677">25</xref></sup> The argument of Rabbi Jonah,<sup><xref rid="fn678">26</xref></sup> who asked how is it possible to say be on guard because of the <italic>aryeh</italic> (lion) and the <italic>layyish</italic> (lion),<sup><xref rid="fn679">27</xref></sup> is turned aside.<sup><xref rid="fn680">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that <italic>nesher</italic> (the great vulture) is connected to the word <italic>ashurennu</italic> (I see him) (Num. 23:9);<sup><xref rid="fn681">29</xref></sup> <italic>peres</italic> (bearded vulture) is related to the word <italic>pros</italic> (deal)<sup><xref rid="fn682">30</xref></sup> in <italic>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry</italic> (Is. 58:7);<sup><xref rid="fn683">31</xref></sup> <italic>ozniyyah</italic> (osprey) is related to the word <italic>oz</italic> (mighty)<sup><xref rid="fn684">32</xref></sup> and its <italic>nun</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn685">33</xref></sup> It is the bird which is called <italic>akba</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn686">34</xref></sup> <italic>da&#x2019;ah</italic> (kite) is related to the word <italic>yideh</italic> (swoopeth) in <italic>as the vulture swoopeth down</italic> (Deut. 28:49);<sup><xref rid="fn687">35</xref></sup> <italic>ayyah</italic> (falcon) is so called because it is accustomed to dwell in certain well-known islands (<italic>iyyim</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn688">36</xref></sup> <italic>orev</italic> (raven) is related to the word <italic>erev</italic> (evening). It is so called because of its darkness.</p>
<p>16. AND THE OSTRICH. Some say that the <italic>bat ha-ya&#x2019;anah</italic> (ostrich)<sup><xref rid="fn689">37</xref></sup> is a kind among whom males are not found.<sup><xref rid="fn690">38</xref></sup> It is like the hare. There is no argument from the word <italic>ka-ye&#x2019;enim</italic> (like the ostriches)<sup><xref rid="fn691">39</xref></sup> (Lam. 4:3), for the reference is to females as in the case of <italic>ye&#x2019;elim</italic> (wild goats) (Ps. 104:18)<sup><xref rid="fn692">40</xref></sup> and <italic>rechelim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn693">41</xref></sup> (ewes) (Gen. 32:15).</p>
<p>AND THE NIGHT-HAWK. <italic>Tachmas</italic> (night-hawk) is related to the word <italic>chamas</italic> (violence) (Gen. 5:11).</p>
<p>THE SEA-MEW. The <italic>shachaf</italic> (sea-mew) gives birth to consumption (<italic>shachefet</italic>) (Lev. 26:16).</p>
<p>AND THE HAWK. The <italic>netz</italic> (hawk) has many feathers.<sup><xref rid="fn694">42</xref></sup> It most likely refers to the well-known bird which always spreads its wings to the south,<sup><xref rid="fn695">43</xref></sup> for it seeks a warm place.</p>
<p>17. AND THE LITTLE OWL. The word <italic>kos</italic> (little owl) is similar to the word <italic>kos</italic> (owl) in <italic>as an owl of the waste places</italic> (Ps. 102:7). Some say that the bird is hidden (<italic>nikhseh</italic>) from the eyes of people. It therefore rests in uninhabited places.</p>
<p>AND THE CORMORANT. Some say that the <italic>shalakh</italic> (cormorant) is so called because its nature is to cast (<italic>le-haslikh</italic>) its offspring down.</p>
<p>AND THE GREAT OWL. The <italic>yanshuf</italic> (great owl) is a bird that flies at night (<italic>neshef</italic>), for it cannot see during the day because of the brightness of the sun light.</p>
<p>18. AND THE HORNED OWL. Whoever looks at the <italic>tinshemet</italic> (the horned owl) is astonished (<italic>yishom</italic>). The term <italic>tinshemet</italic> is also found among the swarming things (v. 30).<sup><xref rid="fn696">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE PELICAN. Some say that the <italic>ka&#x2019;at</italic> (pelican) is a bird whose nature is to regurgitate (<italic>le-haki</italic>) its food.</p>
<p>AND THE CARRION-VULTURE. The Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn697">45</xref></sup> says that the <italic>racham</italic> (carrion-vulture) is the animal which is similarly called in Arabic,<sup><xref rid="fn698">46</xref></sup> with the <italic>chet</italic> interchanging with a <italic>khaf</italic>, for they are written with the same letter.<sup><xref rid="fn699">47</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>racham</italic> refers to a bird that has pity (<italic>merachem</italic>) upon its offspring.</p>
<p>19. AND THE STORK. Some say the <italic>chasidah</italic> (stork) is the bird which appears at certain well-known times in the year. Others say that it scatters loving kindness (<italic>chesed</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn700">48</xref></sup> This is far-fetched.</p>
<p>AND THE HERON. The <italic>anafah</italic> (heron) grows angry (<italic>yitannef</italic>) quickly.<sup><xref rid="fn701">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE HOOPOE. The Sadducees say that the <italic>dukhifat</italic> (hoopoe) refers to the chicken. However, they are the world&#x2019;s greatest fools, for who told them this?</p>
<p>AND THE BAT. A small bird that flies at night. The word <italic>atalef</italic> (bat) is a quadriliteral; that is, it comes from a four-letter root.</p>
<p>Note that the word <italic>teshakketzu</italic> in <italic>teshakketzu min ha-of</italic> (these ye shall have in detestation among the fowls) (v. 13) has a slightly different grammatical meaning from <italic>teshakketzu</italic> in <italic>al teshakketzu et nafshotekhem</italic> (ye shall not make yourselves detestable) (v. 43). In the latter instance the word <italic>nafshotekhem</italic> (yourselves) is the object, while in the case of the fowl (v. 13) its meaning is, you shall know that they are detestable and they shall be considered detestable to you.</p>
<p>All winged swarming things that at times fly and at times go upon all fours are detestable.<sup><xref rid="fn702">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. WHICH HAVE JOINTED LEGS. The main reading is the one that spells <italic>lo</italic> with a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn703">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO LEAP. The word <italic>le-natter</italic> has no brother.<sup><xref rid="fn704">52</xref></sup> The Aramaic translator renders <italic>le-natter ba-hen</italic> by <italic>le-kappatza behen;</italic> since the word <italic>le-kappatza</italic> is similar to <italic>mekappetz</italic> (leaping) (Cant. 2:8),<sup><xref rid="fn705">53</xref></sup> its meaning is leaping. He translated correctly.</p>
<p>[22. THE LOCUST.] The word <italic>arbeh</italic> (locust) is connected to the word <italic>ribbuy</italic> (large amount).</p>
<p>AND THE BALD LOCUST. The <italic>sale&#x2019;am</italic> (bald locust) refers to a kind of locust which climbs on rocks (<italic>sela&#x2019;im</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn706">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE CRICKET. If the word <italic>chargol</italic> (cricket) is a quadriliteral, then it has no brother.<sup><xref rid="fn707">55</xref></sup> If it is a combination of two words<sup><xref rid="fn708">56</xref></sup> like the word <italic>palmoni</italic> (certain one) in <italic>unto that certain one who spoke</italic> (Dan 8:13), then the nature of the <italic>chargal</italic> is the reverse of the nature of the <italic>sale&#x2019;am</italic> (bald locust).<sup><xref rid="fn709">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE GRASSHOPPER. Its meaning is known from the language of the Ishmaelite.<sup><xref rid="fn710">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. [BUT ALL WINGED SWARMING THINGS.] Scripture had previously stated, <italic>that go upon all fours</italic> (v. 20).<sup><xref rid="fn711">59</xref></sup> The Torah now states, <italic>But all winged swarming things, which have four feet</italic>, because it is possible that there is a swarming creature that has four legs but that does not walk upon them but only flies.<sup><xref rid="fn712">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND BY THESE YE SHALL BECOME UNCLEAN. By all winged swarming things that have four feet; <italic>And these ye shall have in detestation among the fowls</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn713">61</xref></sup> Others believe that the word <italic>elleh</italic> (these) (v. 24) refers to <italic>among all the beasts</italic> and to <italic>And whatsoever goeth upon its paws</italic> (v. 27).<sup><xref rid="fn714">62</xref></sup> I believe that the word <italic>elleh</italic> refers to all those mentioned above.<sup><xref rid="fn715">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>YE SHALL BECOME UNCLEAN. The word <italic>tittamma&#x2019;u</italic> (ye shall become unclean) is a <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic>. The <italic>tet</italic> receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> because the <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn716">64</xref></sup> is swallowed. The same is the case with the word <italic>middabber</italic> (speaking) in <italic>then he heard the Voice speaking unto him</italic> (Num. 7:89) and the word <italic>mittaher</italic> (cleansed) in <italic>And he that is to be cleansed shall wash</italic> (Lev. 14:8).<sup><xref rid="fn717">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. Scripture chose the path of brevity, for the unclean must bathe in water.</p>
<p>25. AND WHOSOEVER BEARETH. Bearing is more serious than touching. Therefore the bearer must wash his garments. How much more so [must he bathe] his body. The same law applies to all beasts.<sup><xref rid="fn718">66</xref></sup> Scripture also follows the path of brevity here.<sup><xref rid="fn719">67</xref></sup> The verse is to be understood as follows, or is clovenfooted but cheweth not the cud or cheweth the cud but is not cloven-footed.<sup><xref rid="fn720">68</xref></sup> Scripture has previously stated, <italic>and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you</italic> (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn721">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. [EVERY ONE THAT TOUCHETH THEM.] This means everyone who touches any of the above-mentioned carcasses shall become unclean until the evening, for that is the law regarding the previously mentioned carcasses. There is a type of misbeliever who belongs to the Sadducee heresy who says that <italic>every one that toucheth them</italic> means whoever touches them while they are alive shall be unclean. There is no need to respond to insane talk, for Scripture only prohibited their flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn722">70</xref></sup> It states, <italic>and their carcasses ye shall not touch</italic> (v. 8).</p>
<p>27. AND WHATSOEVER GOETH UPON ITS PAWS. At first<sup><xref rid="fn723">71</xref></sup> the law is the same.<sup><xref rid="fn724">72</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>And he that beareth the carcass of them</italic> (v. 28).<sup><xref rid="fn725">73</xref></sup> This verse affirms my explanation of the words <italic>And by these ye shall be come unclean</italic> (v. 24),<sup><xref rid="fn726">74</xref></sup> for Scripture there states, <italic>And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them</italic> (v. 25).<sup><xref rid="fn727">75</xref></sup> Both of them are in one section.</p>
<p>The reason Scripture states, <italic>They are unclean unto you</italic>, is that it wants to include all of Israel: men, women, and children.<sup><xref rid="fn728">76</xref></sup> One law applies to all.</p>
<p>29. AND THESE ARE THEY WHICH ARE UNCLEAN UNTO YOU. By touch.<sup><xref rid="fn729">77</xref></sup> We also are not able to actually know what these eight creatures<sup><xref rid="fn730">78</xref></sup> refer to. This is also true of the fowl.<sup><xref rid="fn731">79</xref></sup> We can only know their identity by tradition.</p>
<p>31. [THESE ARE THEY WHICH ARE UNCLEAN.] It means that these alone are the unclean<sup><xref rid="fn732">80</xref></sup> which, when dead, defile you.<sup><xref rid="fn733">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>shall be unclean until the even</italic> is, after he bathes he shall be unclean until the evening.<sup><xref rid="fn734">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. IT MUST BE PUT INTO WATER. The garment or the sack or the vessel which is susceptible of uncleanness. We have a need for tradition regarding these things.<sup><xref rid="fn735">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. WHEREIN TO ANY OF THEM FALLETH. <italic>Me-hem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn736">84</xref></sup> is to be rendered, any one of them. Compare, <italic>And was buried in the cities of Gilead</italic><sup><xref rid="fn737">85</xref></sup> (Jud. 12:7).<sup><xref rid="fn738">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. AND ALL DRINK. <italic>Mashkeh</italic> (drink) is a noun.<sup><xref rid="fn739">87</xref></sup> <italic>Mashkeh</italic> in <italic>Now I was giving drink to the king</italic> (Neh. 1:11) is a verb in the present tense.<sup><xref rid="fn740">88</xref></sup> Now, an <italic>oven</italic> (v. 35) which is used to bake bread and a <italic>range</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.) which is used to cook meat shall be broken into pieces,<sup><xref rid="fn741">89</xref></sup> for they are unclean. This is the decree of the king.<sup><xref rid="fn742">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>[36.] A CISTERN. The Hebrew word <italic>be&#x2019;er</italic> (well) is a feminine. It bubbles forth. Compare, <italic>As a well</italic> (bir)<sup><xref rid="fn743">91</xref></sup> <italic>welleth with her waters</italic> (Jer. 6:7). However, a <italic>bor</italic> (cistern) is dug or excavated to store the rain from the sky. If so,<sup><xref rid="fn744">92</xref></sup> the well is a fountain.<sup><xref rid="fn745">93</xref></sup> There is no need to mention rivers.<sup><xref rid="fn746">94</xref></sup> <italic>Mikveh mayim</italic> (a gathering of water) is connected to <italic>bor</italic> (cistern),<sup><xref rid="fn747">95</xref></sup> for there are <italic>borot</italic> (cisterns) without water.<sup><xref rid="fn748">96</xref></sup> Some say that <italic>mikveh</italic> is missing a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn749">97</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Reuben, Simeon</italic> (Ex, 1:2),<sup><xref rid="fn750">98</xref></sup> and <italic>shemesh yare&#x2019;ach</italic> (the sun moon) (Hab. 3:11).<sup><xref rid="fn751">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT HE WHO TOUCHETH THEIR CARCASS. The water that touches their carcasses will be unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn752">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. SOWING. <italic>Zeru&#x2019;a</italic> (sowing) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn753">101</xref></sup> It is similar to a <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn754">102</xref></sup> On the other hand, there might be two nouns for the word seed.<sup><xref rid="fn755">103</xref></sup> <italic>And gave them pulse</italic> (zeronim<sup><xref rid="fn756">104</xref></sup>) (Dan. 1:16) is proof of this.</p>
<p>38. BUT IF WATER BE PUT. If they water their field and aught of their carcasses fall on the seed.<sup><xref rid="fn757">105</xref></sup> Some say on the water.<sup><xref rid="fn758">106</xref></sup> The word <italic>yuttan</italic> (be put), which is singular, governs <italic>mayim</italic> (water).<sup><xref rid="fn759">107</xref></sup> We find a similarity in <italic>because the water</italic> (meh) <italic>of sprinkling was not dashed</italic> (zorak)<sup><xref rid="fn760">108</xref></sup> <italic>against him</italic> (Num. 19:13). The word <italic>yuttan</italic> is similar to <italic>yukkach</italic> (be fetched) in <italic>Let now a little water be fetched</italic> (Gen. 18:4). It belongs to the heavy conjugation to which a letter is added.<sup><xref rid="fn761">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>39. OF WHICH YE MAY. <italic>Asher hi la-khem le-okhlah</italic> means of which ye may eat.<sup><xref rid="fn762">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. After he bathes in water.<sup><xref rid="fn763">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>[40. AND HE THAT EATETH.] The law regarding he that eats<sup><xref rid="fn764">112</xref></sup> is stricter.<sup><xref rid="fn765">113</xref></sup> It is similar to the law governing he that that carries,<sup><xref rid="fn766">114</xref></sup> for both bear.<sup><xref rid="fn767">115</xref></sup> One carries outside<sup><xref rid="fn768">116</xref></sup> and the other<sup><xref rid="fn769">117</xref></sup> inside.<sup><xref rid="fn770">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>[41. AND EVERY SWARMING THING.] This means all swarming things of the earth. The eight swarming creatures<sup><xref rid="fn771">119</xref></sup> are included. Scripture mentions that they<sup><xref rid="fn772">120</xref></sup> are not to be eaten.<sup><xref rid="fn773">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>42. THE BELLY. The word <italic>gachon</italic> (belly) is similar to the word <italic>gechonekha</italic> (thy belly) in <italic>upon thy belly shalt thou go</italic> (Gen. 3:14).</p>
<p>AND WHATSOEVER GOETH UPON ALL FOURS. Among the swarming things which are small, as I explained with regard to the swarming things in the water.<sup><xref rid="fn774">122</xref></sup></p>
<p>MANY FEET. The word <italic>marbeh</italic> (many) is an adjective. It is in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn775">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>43. YE SHALL NOT MAKE YOURSELVES DETESTABLE. By being filthy and dirty.<sup><xref rid="fn776">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>NEITHER SHALL YE MAKE YOURSELVES UNCLEAN. For it is known that that which is eaten turns into the flesh of the one who ingests it.<sup><xref rid="fn777">125</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT YE SHOULD BE DEFILED THEREBY. The word <italic>ve-nitmetem</italic> (that ye should be defiled) is missing an <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn778">126</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>reshit</italic><sup><xref rid="fn779">127</xref></sup> (beginning) in <italic>from the beginning of the year</italic> (Deut. 11:12). Others say that they come from two roots.<sup><xref rid="fn780">128</xref></sup> The word <italic>nitminu</italic> (unclean) in <italic>And reputed unclean in your sight</italic><sup><xref rid="fn781">129</xref></sup> (Job 18:3) is proof. It<sup><xref rid="fn782">130</xref></sup> means that you do not become dumb-witted.<sup><xref rid="fn783">131</xref></sup></p>
<p>45. YE SHALL THEREFORE BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY. Hence I told you <italic>neither shall ye defile yourselves</italic> (v. 44). The <italic>vav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn784">132</xref></sup> is similar to the unaspirated <italic>fah</italic> in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn785">133</xref></sup> Similarly the <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>va-ya&#x2019;azov</italic> (left) in <italic>left his servants</italic> (Ex. 9:21).<sup><xref rid="fn786">134</xref></sup> There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn787">135</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FOR I AM THE LORD.] This means I did not take you out of Egypt for any reason but to be your God. If you will not be holy, I will not be a God to you. Hence if you want Me to be your God you must be holy.</p>
<p>47. TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UNCLEAN. Among the fowl and that which swarms in the water.</p>
<p>THAT MAY BE EATEN. That is permitted to be eaten.</p>
<p>THAT MAY NOT BE EATEN. According to the words of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn788">136</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn712"><sup>60</sup> Verse 20 teaches that a swarming creature that walks on four legs is detestable. Our verse teaches that a swarming creature that has four legs is detestable even if it does not walk upon them. Our verse thus not repeat verse 20.</ftnote>

<h1>TAZRI&#x2019;A</h1>
<p>2. IF A WOMAN BE DELIVERED.<sup><xref rid="fn789">1</xref></sup> After Scripture concludes the law of clean and unclean food, it deals with human uncleanliness. The Torah starts<sup><xref rid="fn790">2</xref></sup> with the woman who gives birth, because human life begins at birth. Many say that if the woman produces the seed first,<sup><xref rid="fn791">3</xref></sup> then she gives birth to a male.<sup><xref rid="fn792">4</xref></sup> Scripture therefore states, <italic>and bear a man-child</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn793">5</xref></sup> The wise men of the Greeks similarly believed that the seed is of the woman. The seed of the male congeals.<sup><xref rid="fn794">6</xref></sup> All of the child is created out of the blood of the woman.<sup><xref rid="fn795">7</xref></sup> Note, the meaning of <italic>tazri&#x2019;a</italic> (be delivered) means will give seed, for a woman<sup><xref rid="fn796">8</xref></sup> is like the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn797">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-tame&#x2019;ah</italic> (then shall be unclean) is like the unaspirated <italic>vav</italic> in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn798">10</xref></sup> The reason that she is unclean for seven days is that she must wait until she completes<sup><xref rid="fn799">11</xref></sup> a quarter of days.<sup><xref rid="fn800">12</xref></sup> We find a similarity in the days of illness, for a change is seen at the end of the seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn801">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE IMPURITY OF. The word <italic>niddat</italic> (impurity of) is a noun.<sup><xref rid="fn802">14</xref></sup> It follows the paradigm of <italic>bizzat</italic> (spoil of).<sup><xref rid="fn803">15</xref></sup> Both words come from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn804">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>HER SICKNESS. <italic>Devotah</italic> (her sickness) is a noun in the plural.<sup><xref rid="fn805">17</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>madveh</italic> (diseases) in <italic>the evil diseases of Egypt</italic> (Deut. 7:15).<sup><xref rid="fn806">18</xref></sup> The blood that comes out is an illness in the woman&#x2019;s body.<sup><xref rid="fn807">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND IN THE EIGHTH DAY. Our wise men, of blessed memory, said during the day, not at night.<sup><xref rid="fn808">20</xref></sup> Now a child born a half hour before sunset is circumcised after six and half days,<sup><xref rid="fn809">21</xref></sup> for the day of the Torah is not measured by twenty-four hours.<sup><xref rid="fn810">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED. <italic>Yimmol</italic> (shall be circumcised) is a <italic>nifal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn811">23</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>yikkon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn812">24</xref></sup> (be established) in <italic>shall not be established</italic> (Ps. 101:7). According to this opinion, <italic>yimmol</italic> is related to the word <italic>mullim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn813">25</xref></sup> (circumcised) in <italic>were circumcised</italic> (Josh. 5:5). It is also possible that <italic>yimmol</italic> is missing a <italic>nun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn814">26</xref></sup> and is related to the word <italic>u-nemaltem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn815">27</xref></sup> (and ye shall be circumcised) (Gen. 17:11). <italic>Yimmol</italic> is like the word <italic>yiddor</italic> (voweth)<sup><xref rid="fn816">28</xref></sup> in <italic>When a man voweth a vow unto the Lord</italic> (Num. 30:3). Scripture omits the one who performs the circumcision, such as the father or the Beth Din (court).<sup><xref rid="fn817">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>HIS FORESKIN. It is known that the foreskin is on the private part.<sup><xref rid="fn818">30</xref></sup> This is not the case regarding the foreskin of the heart,<sup><xref rid="fn819">31</xref></sup> the lip,<sup><xref rid="fn820">32</xref></sup> and the ear,<sup><xref rid="fn821">33</xref></sup> for all of them are connected to another word.<sup><xref rid="fn822">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. [PURIFICATION.] The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>tohorah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn823">35</xref></sup> (purification) is unsounded.<sup><xref rid="fn824">36</xref></sup> It should have been pronounced. It is like the <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn825">37</xref></sup> in <italic>lah</italic> (it)<sup><xref rid="fn826">38</xref></sup> in <italic>and called it Nobah</italic> (Num. 32:43).</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>deme tohorah</italic> (the blood of purification) is clean blood.<sup><xref rid="fn827">39</xref></sup> This blood, in contrast to <italic>dam niddah</italic> (menstrual blood), is clean. It does not cause uncleanliness.</p>
<p>The forty days that God decreed regarding a male child<sup><xref rid="fn828">40</xref></sup> corresponds to the time it takes for the form of the male to be completed in the womb.<sup><xref rid="fn829">41</xref></sup> It takes double that time for a female.<sup><xref rid="fn830">42</xref></sup> This is clear and tested.</p>
<p>SHE SHALL TOUCH NO HALLOWED THING. Such as the tithe, <italic>trumah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn831">43</xref></sup> and the flesh of peace offerings.</p>
<p>NOR COME INTO THE SANCTUARY. The courtyard of the tent of meeting or into the temple courtyard.<sup><xref rid="fn832">44</xref></sup> <italic>Be-deme tohorah</italic> (in the blood of purification) (v. 4) and <italic>al deme tohorah</italic> (in the blood of purification)<sup><xref rid="fn833">45</xref></sup> have one meaning.</p>
<p>6. OF THE FIRST YEAR. If we did not have tradition, who would explain whether <italic>ben shenato</italic> (of the first year)<sup><xref rid="fn834">46</xref></sup> means exactly one year, or less than a year, or a year plus?<sup><xref rid="fn835">47</xref></sup> Some say that the reason a woman who gives birth brings a lamb for a burnt offering is that she may have had some unseemly thought because of her pain when giving birth.<sup><xref rid="fn836">48</xref></sup> She brings a sin offering because she might have uttered some unseemly thing with her lips.<sup><xref rid="fn837">49</xref></sup></p>

This one and the other one,<sup><xref rid="fn838">50</xref></sup> the lamb and the turtle-dove or the young pigeon.<sup><xref rid="fn839">51</xref></sup> Scripture employed an abridged style.

<p>AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HER. As I explained.<sup><xref rid="fn843">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SHE SHALL BE CLEANSED FROM THE FOUNTAIN OF HER BLOOD. This is a sign that she does not naturally became cleansed until the days that are enumerated arrive.</p>
<p>8. AND IF HER MEANS SUFFICE NOT.<sup><xref rid="fn844">56</xref></sup> This means the same as but if his means suffice not<sup><xref rid="fn845">57</xref></sup> (see Lev. 5:11).</p>
<p>AND THE PRIEST SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HER, AND SHE SHALL BE CLEAN. This teaches that if the <italic>kohen</italic> does not make atonement for her she shall not be clean. This applies only in the Land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn846">58</xref></sup></p>

Thus <italic>ishah ki tazri&#x2019;a</italic> (if a woman be delivered) literally means if a woman gives forth her seed, i.e., the seed planted in her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn798"><sup>10</sup> It does not always indicate the start of a new clause. See I.E. on Gen. 1:2 (Vol. 1, p. 30). In other words, <italic>ve-tame&#x2019;ah</italic> is not to be rendered: and she shall be unclean, but, then she shall be unclean.</ftnote>

Hence I.E. points out that &#x201C;he&#x201D; refers to the father of the child, the Beth Din, or any authorized person.

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 13</title>
<p>1. AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON. This commandment was directly communicated to Aaron because all human maladies shall be determined according to his pronouncement.<sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> Aaron shall declare who is clean and who is unclean.</p>
<p>2. WHEN A MAN. Scripture does notread, &#x201C;Whosoever&#x2026; of the house of Israel&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn848">2</xref></sup> because it wants to include strangers.<sup><xref rid="fn849">3</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>When any man of you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn850">4</xref></sup> (Lev. 1:2), for there is one law to the native born and to the stranger<sup><xref rid="fn851">5</xref></sup> regarding offerings. The Torah includes the stranger [in the laws relating to maladies]<sup><xref rid="fn852">6</xref></sup> so that the stranger does not defile another person, for leprosy is a disease that is passed on from the sick to the healthy.<sup><xref rid="fn853">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEN HE SHALL BE BROUGHT. By his consent or against his will, for one who sees one of these signs<sup><xref rid="fn854">8</xref></sup> will force the afflicted [to go to the <italic>kohen</italic>].</p>
<p>[UNTO AARON THE PRIEST.] The meaning of <italic>Aaron the priest</italic> is, the <italic>kohen</italic> who is anointed in his place.<sup><xref rid="fn855">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR UNTO ONE OF HIS SONS THE PRIESTS. This means one of the common priests outside of the temple<sup><xref rid="fn856">10</xref></sup> such as the <italic>kohanim</italic> of Anatot.<sup><xref rid="fn857">11</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>the priests</italic> is that they should not be from among those who are disqualified to serve as priests.<sup><xref rid="fn858">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>[A RISING.] The word <italic>se&#x2019;et</italic> (a rising) means a burn.<sup><xref rid="fn859">13</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>maset</italic> (fire) in <italic>But when the fire began to rise</italic><sup><xref rid="fn860">14</xref></sup> (Jud. 20:40) and <italic>va-yisa&#x2019;em david</italic> (and David burnt them)<sup><xref rid="fn861">15</xref></sup> (II Sam. 5:21). The <italic>se&#x2019;et</italic> is probably so called because it is the nature of fire to rise upwards.<sup><xref rid="fn862">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>A SCAB. The word <italic>sappachat</italic> (scab) is related to <italic>sefachani</italic> (put me)<sup><xref rid="fn863">17</xref></sup> in <italic>Put me, I pray thee</italic> (I Sam. 2:36) <italic>and ve-nispechu</italic> (and they shall cleave) in and <italic>they shall cleave to the house of Jacob</italic> (Is. 14:1). It refers to a disease which attaches itself to one place.</p>
<p>A BRIGHT SPOT. The word <italic>baheret</italic> (bright spot) is related to the word <italic>bahir</italic> (bright) in <italic>which is bright in the skies</italic> (Job 37:21). It is a known malady which produces a mark and a sign.</p>
<p>[3.] BE TURNED WHITE. <italic>Hafakh lavon</italic> means be turned white.<sup><xref rid="fn864">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>BE DEEPER. Its depth is deeper than the depth of the skin. The word <italic>amok</italic> (deep) does not mean the same as <italic>shafal</italic> (lower) (v. 20).<sup><xref rid="fn865">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND PRONOUNCE HIM UNCLEAN.<sup><xref rid="fn866">20</xref></sup> Verbally.<sup><xref rid="fn867">21</xref></sup> He shall declare him unclean.</p>
<p>[4.] THEN THE PRIEST SHALL SHUT UP HIM THAT HATH THE PLAGUE SEVEN DAYS.<sup><xref rid="fn868">22</xref></sup> The person shall be shut up.<sup><xref rid="fn869">23</xref></sup> He shall wait up to seven days, for most illnesses change on the seventh day.<sup><xref rid="fn870">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. STAY IN ITS APPEARANCE. <italic>Amad be-enav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn871">25</xref></sup> means stay in its appearance. The term <italic>enav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn872">26</xref></sup> is employed, for its appearance is seen by the eye. All the commentaries says that <italic>beenav</italic> (in its appearance) means in its make-up, that is, in the way it was.<sup><xref rid="fn873">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>SPREAD. <italic>Pasah</italic> means spread.</p>
<p>6. AGAIN. <italic>Shenit</italic> (again) means a second time.</p>
<p>THE PLAGUE BE DIM. Many of the wise men say that the word <italic>kehah</italic> (dim) means dark.<sup><xref rid="fn874">28</xref></sup> They offer proof from <italic>vatikhhena</italic> (were dim) in <italic>and his eyes were dim</italic> (Gen. 27:1).<sup><xref rid="fn875">29</xref></sup> They say that the phrase <italic>kehot levanot</italic> (dull white) (v. 39) is similar to <italic>le-vanah adamdamet</italic> (reddish-white) (v. 19)<sup><xref rid="fn876">30</xref></sup> in that it contains both colors. However, I believe that the word <italic>kehah</italic> (dim) is the reverse of <italic>pasah</italic> (spread).<sup><xref rid="fn877">31</xref></sup> It is related to the word <italic>va-tikhhena</italic> (were dim) in <italic>and his eyes were dim</italic> (Gen. 27:1). The word <italic>khihah</italic> (stopped) in <italic>and he diminished</italic><sup><xref rid="fn878">32</xref></sup> <italic>them not</italic><sup><xref rid="fn879">33</xref></sup> (I Sam. 3:13) is close to it. The meaning of <italic>kahah ha-nega</italic> (the plague be dim) is that the plague did not spread to another place. Note, there are two signs, namely, the size of the affliction was diminished and it did not spread to the healthy part of the body.</p>
<p>THEN THE PRIEST SHALL PRONOUNCE HIM CLEAN.<sup><xref rid="fn880">34</xref></sup> The <italic>kohen</italic> shall say that he is clean,<sup><xref rid="fn881">35</xref></sup> for it was a scab (<italic>mispachat</italic>). However, if it spreads afterwards he is unclean.</p>
<p>9. THEN HE SHALL BE BROUGHT. The man having the affliction. <italic>Be brought</italic> is to be interpreted like its counterpart.<sup><xref rid="fn882">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND IT HAVE TURNED. The black hair white.<sup><xref rid="fn883">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>QUICK. The meaning of <italic>michyat</italic> (quick) is live flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn884">38</xref></sup> Flesh which does not feel is not alive.</p>
<p>11. OLD. Of yore.</p>
<p><italic>Yasgirennu</italic> (shut him up) governs two actions.<sup><xref rid="fn885">39</xref></sup> It means he shall command that the afflicted be shut up.</p>
<p>13. HE SHALL PRONOUNCE HIM CLEAN THAT HATH THE PLAGUE. For the plague has already surfaced and removed itself from the afflicted. The meaning of <italic>ve-tiher et hanaga</italic><sup><xref rid="fn886">40</xref></sup> (he shall pronounce him unclean that hath the plague) is that he shall verbally clean the affliction; that is, he shall declare that this plague will not make others unclean.</p>
<p>16. BUT IF THE RAW FLESH AGAIN BE TURNED.<sup><xref rid="fn887">41</xref></sup> For it is possible that the affliction will return.</p>
<p>19. REDDISH-WHITE. A mixture of the two colors. Or a little of each. The word <italic>tzara&#x2019;at</italic> (leprosy) (v. 20) means a disease. Similarly <italic>ha-tzirah</italic> (the disease)<sup><xref rid="fn888">42</xref></sup> in <italic>I will send the disease</italic> (Ex. 23:28). The fact that the Torah reads, <italic>and I will send</italic> is no argument against this interpretation,<sup><xref rid="fn889">43</xref></sup> for Scripture reads, <italic>He sent His word</italic> (Ps. 107:20); <italic>For I&#x2026;send all My plagues</italic> (Ex. 9:14); and <italic>He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger</italic> (Ps. 78:49).</p>
<p>20. AND, BEHOLD, IF THE APPEARANCE THEREOF. It is not grammatically correct to vocalize the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>mareha</italic> (its appearance) with a long <italic>kamatz</italic> and a <italic>mappik</italic><sup><xref rid="fn890">44</xref></sup> in the <italic>heh</italic> as in the case of <italic>yadah</italic> (her hand) and <italic>raglah</italic> (her foot),<sup><xref rid="fn891">45</xref></sup> for we do not find words whose roots end in a silent <italic>heh</italic> to be so treated.<sup><xref rid="fn892">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>[21. LOOK ON IT.] The <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>yirennah</italic> (look upon it) has a <italic>dagesh</italic> in it like the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>yasgirennu</italic> (v. 11) to compensate for the missing added <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn893">47</xref></sup> The same is true with <italic>mi-mennah</italic> (from her) and <italic>mi-mennu</italic> (from it).<sup><xref rid="fn894">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. IN ITS PLACE.<sup><xref rid="fn895">49</xref></sup> If the affliction stays in its place,<sup><xref rid="fn896">50</xref></sup> for there are afflictions that move from place to place.</p>
<p>SCAR. The word <italic>tzarevet</italic> (scar) is similar to the word <italic>ve-nitzrevu</italic> (shall be seared) in <italic>and all faces&#x2026;shall be seared</italic> (Ezek. 21:30). It has the meaning of a burning mass, heat, and a flame.<sup><xref rid="fn897">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. OR WHITE. Alone.</p>
<p>28. AND IF THE BRIGHT SPOT STAY IN ITS PLACE&#x2026;BUT BE DIM. The word <italic>kehah</italic> (dim) is to be understood as I explained it earlier (v. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn898">52</xref></sup> Scripture does not mention <italic>kehah</italic> (dim) the first time, <italic>But if the bright spot stay in its place</italic> (v. 23), because there the bright spot remains as it was.<sup><xref rid="fn899">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>[29. AND WHEN&#x2026;] Scripture mentions a man or a woman<sup><xref rid="fn900">54</xref></sup> because it deals with an affliction in the beard<sup><xref rid="fn901">55</xref></sup> [and the head]. Also, because the Torah has to use the word <italic>ish</italic> (man), and not the term <italic>adam</italic> (a human being) to exclude women from the law of the bald head and the bald forehead (v. 40).<sup><xref rid="fn902">56</xref></sup> Note, our verse means, when a man or a woman has an affliction upon the head or a man upon the beard.<sup><xref rid="fn903">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. YELLOW. The word <italic>tzahov</italic> (yellow) in Arabic refers to a color that is close to white.</p>
<p>IT IS A SCALL. The word <italic>netek</italic> (scall) is related to the word <italic>yennatek</italic> (is broken) in <italic>as a string of tow is broken</italic> (Jud. 16:9). The reference is to the hair.<sup><xref rid="fn904">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. THEN HE SHALL BE SHAVEN. The head or the beard shall be shaven. However, the place of the <italic>netek</italic> (scall) shall not be shaven.</p>
<p>34. AND HE SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES. It is unnecessary to say that he shall bathe in water.</p>
<p>36. SHALL NOT SEEK. The meaning of <italic>yevakker</italic> is, he shall seek. Similarly <italic>u-vikkartim</italic> (and seek them out) (Ezek. 34:11). It is close in meaning to the word separate.<sup><xref rid="fn905">59</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>He shall not inquire</italic> (yevakker) <italic>whether it be good or bad</italic> (Lev. 27:33).</p>
<p>39. A TETTER. The word <italic>bohak</italic> (tetter) is known in Rabbinic literature.<sup><xref rid="fn906">60</xref></sup> It has no counterpart in Scripture.</p>
<p>40. BE FALLEN OFF. <italic>Yimmaret</italic> (be fallen off) is similar to <italic>moretim</italic> (them that plucked off the hair) in <italic>And my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair</italic> (Is. 50:6).<sup><xref rid="fn907">61</xref></sup> The latter<sup><xref rid="fn908">62</xref></sup> refers to the hair that is around the cheeks.</p>
<p>HE IS BALD. <italic>Kere&#x2019;ach</italic> (bald) is similar to <italic>korchah</italic> (baldness) in <italic>nor make any baldness</italic> (Deut. 14:1). The meaning of <italic>his head</italic> is, his entire head.</p>
<p>41. FOREHEAD-BALD. The word <italic>gibbe&#x2019;ach</italic> (forehead-bald) has no neighbor<sup><xref rid="fn909">63</xref></sup> except in this section. <italic>Gibbe&#x2019;ach</italic> is an adjective. In my opinion <italic>kere&#x2019;ach</italic> (bald) refers to the top of the head.<sup><xref rid="fn910">64</xref></sup> Scripture does not mention a woman<sup><xref rid="fn911">65</xref></sup> because a woman does not become bald as she contains a lot of moisture,<sup><xref rid="fn912">66</xref></sup> and hair is similar to grass.<sup><xref rid="fn913">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>43. AS THE APPEARANCE OF LEPROSY IN THE SKIN OF THE FLESH. On the rest of the body.<sup><xref rid="fn914">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>45. HIS CLOTHES SHALL BE RENT. The word <italic>perumim</italic> means rent. The leper is to be so dressed so that he may be recognized because of his abnormal garb. Or the leper is to behave like a mourner. Scripture therefore states, <italic>his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose</italic>. The reason for the latter is so that the leper mourn for his evil actions, for this plague came upon him because of his deeds.</p>
<p>HIS UPPER LIP. <italic>Safam</italic> refers to the upper lip. The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>safam</italic> is a root letter. The word <italic>sefamo</italic> (his beard) in <italic>nor trimmed his beard</italic> (II Sam. 19:22)<sup><xref rid="fn915">69</xref></sup> is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn916">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE SHALL COVER.<sup><xref rid="fn917">71</xref></sup> With his garments. The word <italic>yateh</italic> (he shall cover) is related to the word <italic>oteh</italic> (coverest) in <italic>Who coverest Thyself with light</italic> (Ps. 104:2). He shall cover his upper lip so that he does not harm anyone with the breath of his mouth.</p>
<p>AND&#x2026;UNCLEAN. The word <italic>unclean</italic> is repeated. When the leper passes on a road in an inhabited area he shall continually announce<sup><xref rid="fn918">72</xref></sup> that he is unclean so that people will be on guard and not touch him.</p>
<p>46. ALL THE DAYS WHEREIN THE PLAGUE IS IN HIM HE SHALL BE UNCLEAN. For he is truly unclean. The word <italic>badad</italic> (alone) is explained<sup><xref rid="fn919">73</xref></sup> in the Book of Lamentations.<sup><xref rid="fn920">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>48. OR IN THE WARP, OR IN THE WOOF. The meaning of <italic>sheti</italic> (warp) and <italic>erev</italic> (woof) is known. It is possible that the word <italic>sheti</italic> is related to the word <italic>shet</italic> (buttocks) in <italic>ve-chasufe shet</italic> (buttocks uncovered) (Is. 20:4) wherein the word <italic>shet</italic> means the foundation,<sup><xref rid="fn921">75</xref></sup> as the clause <italic>When the foundations</italic> (ha-shatot) <italic>are destroyed</italic> (Ps. 11:3) proves. The word <italic>erev</italic> (woof) refers to that which is mixed with the warp.<sup><xref rid="fn922">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR IN THE SKIN. As it is.<sup><xref rid="fn923">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR IN ANY THING MADE OF SKIN. Such as a <italic>coverlet</italic> (II Kings 8:15) or a bottle (Jud. 4:19).</p>
<p>49. GREENISH. The word <italic>yerakrak</italic> (greenish) is related to the word <italic>yerek</italic> (green), for the color of the affliction is like it. The word is doubled<sup><xref rid="fn924">78</xref></sup> to indicate that it is less than full green. The same applies to <italic>shecharchoret</italic> (swarthy) (Cant. 1:6).<sup><xref rid="fn925">79</xref></sup> Others say that the reverse is true.<sup><xref rid="fn926">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>51. MALIGNANT. The word <italic>mameret</italic> (malignant) is similar to the word <italic>mammir</italic> (pricking) in <italic>a pricking brier</italic> (sillon mamir) (Ezek. 28:24). Now, since the word <italic>sillon</italic> (brier) means a thorn, the word <italic>mamir</italic> means painful.<sup><xref rid="fn927">81</xref></sup> The second <italic>mem</italic> in <italic>mameret</italic> is a root letter and the word <italic>mameret</italic> is not related to the word <italic>me&#x2019;erah</italic> (curse).<sup><xref rid="fn928">82</xref></sup> It is possible that the reason Scripture does not mention silk and cotton<sup><xref rid="fn929">83</xref></sup> is that the Torah speaks of what is contemporarily present.<sup><xref rid="fn930">84</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee</italic> (Ex. 23:5). The same law applies to a horse and a mule. On the other hand, it is possible that the affliction only strikes wool and flax.</p>
<p>55. AFTER THAT THE PLAGUE IS WASHED. The word <italic>hukkabbes</italic> (is washed) is an infinitive whose subject is not identified. It is in the <italic>hofal</italic>.</p>
<p>A FRET. The word <italic>pechetet</italic> (fret) has no brother in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn931">85</xref></sup> It is known in Rabbinic literature.<sup><xref rid="fn932">86</xref></sup> <italic>Pechetet</italic> refers to a defect which appears in the <italic>karachat</italic> (bareness&#x2026;within) or the <italic>gabachat</italic> (bareness&#x2026;without) of the garments. The Gaon says that <italic>karachat</italic> refers to the underside of the garment, for <italic>gabachat</italic> refers to the face of the garment. If this is the case, then the word <italic>kere&#x2019;ach</italic> (bald) (v. 40) refers to the back of the head. He explained well.</p>
<p>57. AND IF IT APPEAR STILL. The word <italic>tera&#x2019;eh</italic> (it appear)<sup><xref rid="fn933">87</xref></sup> refers to the <italic>pechetet</italic> (the fret).<sup><xref rid="fn934">88</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>porachat hi</italic> (it is breaking out).<sup><xref rid="fn935">89</xref></sup> After stating thou shalt burn [it], Scripture goes on to say that the place of the affliction alone shall be burned.<sup><xref rid="fn936">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>58. THEN IT SHALL BE WASHED THE SECOND TIME. There is divine command to wash it twice.</p>
<p>IF THE PLAGUE BE DEPARTED FROM THEM. <italic>Ve-sar me-hem ha-naga</italic> means if the plague be departed from them.<sup><xref rid="fn937">91</xref></sup> I have previously shown you many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn938">92</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-khubbas</italic> (it shall be washed) is a <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn939">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>59. THIS IS THE LAW OF THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IN A GARMENT OF WOOL. Our verse has four words in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn940">94</xref></sup> Elsewhere in Scripture we find five words in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn941">95</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Gibore chayil melechet avodat bet haElohim</italic> (very able men for the work of the service of the house of God) (I Chron. 9:13). They all depend (<italic>semukhim</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn942">96</xref></sup> on God, who supports (<italic>somekh</italic>) all who fall.<sup><xref rid="fn943">97</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn849"><sup>3</sup> According to the <italic>Sifra</italic>, Scripture employs the term &#x201C;man&#x201D; because the latter includes converts to Judaism. According to Krinsky, I.E. interprets similarly. However, this is far from certain, for elsewhere I.E. refers to any non-Jew living in the Land of Israel as a stranger.

<ftnote id="fn901"><sup>55</sup> Our verse deals with an affliction in the head and the beard.

<ftnote id="fn902"><sup>56</sup> The law regarding an affliction in a bald head does not apply to a woman, for women are rarely bald.

Scripture thus wanted to emphasize that the law regarding afflictions in the hairy head applies to both men and women.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn903"><sup>57</sup> So Sarim and Krinsky.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn912"><sup>66</sup> A woman&#x2019;s body contains more water than that of a man.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn913"><sup>67</sup> Grass requires water in order to grow. Similarly, hair requires moisture to grow. Thus a well-watered body such as that of a female will not lose its hair. I.E. speaks from the point of view of medieval science. What he says is rejected by modern biology.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn914"><sup>68</sup> See Rashi: &#x201C;As the appearance of leprosy that is stated in the section (treating) of the skin of the flesh (Lev. 13:2).&#x201D;</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 14</title>
<h1>METZORA</h1>
<p>1. [AND THE LORD SPOKE.] Scripture states <italic>and the Lord spoke</italic><sup><xref rid="fn944">1</xref></sup> because it begins the laws of the one who is cleansed. Rabbi Jonah the Spaniard, the grammarian, says that <italic>and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper</italic> (v. 3) is inverted. It should have read &#x201C;and, behold, if the leper be healed from the plague of leprosy.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn945">2</xref></sup> Why should we because of our lack of knowledge, invert the words of the living God? Does not Scripture elsewhere read that <italic>the scall is healed, he is clean</italic> (Lev. 13:37)?<sup><xref rid="fn946">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture also reads, <italic>because the plague is healed</italic> (Lev. 14:48).</p>
<p>2. [HE SHALL BE BROUGHT.] <italic>He shall be brought</italic> is to be interpreted like its counterparts,<sup><xref rid="fn947">4</xref></sup> for it is possible that after the plague of leprosy is removed the afflicted person will not want to bring what he is obligated to.<sup><xref rid="fn948">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND THE PRIEST SHALL GO FORTH OUT OF THE CAMP. Even though the <italic>kohen</italic> declared him clean he shall not enter the camp or the city until he brings his cleanliness offerings and completes<sup><xref rid="fn949">6</xref></sup> all that he has been commanded to do.</p>
<p>AND THE PRIEST SHALL GO FORTH. The reference is not to the <italic>kohen gadol</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn950">7</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>or unto one of his sons the priests</italic> (Lev 13:2) has now been clarified.<sup><xref rid="fn951">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. TO TAKE FOR HIM THAT IS TO BE CLEANSED. The <italic>kohen</italic> shall take of his own.<sup><xref rid="fn952">9</xref></sup> Some say that the leper shall give them.<sup><xref rid="fn953">10</xref></sup> The <italic>tav</italic> of the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic> form is swallowed by the <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>tet</italic> of <italic>mittaher</italic> (cleansed). The word <italic>mittaher</italic> follows the form of <italic>mithallel</italic> (boasteth himself)<sup><xref rid="fn954">11</xref></sup> in <italic>he that boasteth himself</italic> (Prov. 25:14).</p>
<p>TWO&#x2026;BIRDS.<sup><xref rid="fn955">12</xref></sup> The term <italic>tzippor</italic> applies to all birds. Note, he shall take any bird that he finds.</p>
<p>LIVING. Not dead.<sup><xref rid="fn956">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>CLEAN. He shall not take from the unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn957">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND CEDAR-WOOD&#x2026;AND HYSSOP. These are the biggest and smallest among the plants. This is proven by Scripture&#x2019;s description of Solomon&#x2019;s wisdom.<sup><xref rid="fn958">15</xref></sup> There is no reason to search for the meaning of the word <italic>ezov</italic> (hyssop), for it is known by tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn959">16</xref></sup> Note, the leper and the plagued house and uncleanness caused by a corpse<sup><xref rid="fn960">17</xref></sup> are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn961">18</xref></sup> They are also similar to the Egyptian Passover.<sup><xref rid="fn962">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THE PRIEST SHALL COMMAND TO KILL. The priest shall command another <italic>kohen</italic> or an Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn963">20</xref></sup> Some say he shall command the leper. However, the latter is farfetched.<sup><xref rid="fn964">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN AN EARTHEN VESSEL. The word <italic>el</italic> (in)<sup><xref rid="fn965">22</xref></sup> is to be rendered as over. Similarly <italic>el</italic> (for) in <italic>For this child I prayed</italic> (I Sam. 1:27).<sup><xref rid="fn966">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>OVER RUNNING WATER.<sup><xref rid="fn967">24</xref></sup> Taken from a bubbling fountain.<sup><xref rid="fn968">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND SHALL DIP THEM. The cedar-wood, the scarlet, and the hyssop.</p>
<p>OVER&#x2026;WATER. With which the blood was mixed.</p>
<p>7. AND HE SHALL SPRINKLE. From the blood mixed with water after immersing the living bird and the other items mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn969">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>INTO THE OPEN FIELD. An uninhabited place so that the leprosy does not infect anyone. The sprinkling was done with all three.<sup><xref rid="fn970">27</xref></sup> On the other hand, it might only have been done with the hyssop as in the case of one who has been made unclean by a corpse.<sup><xref rid="fn971">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND&#x2026;SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES AND SHAVE OFF ALL HIS HAIR. A general statement.<sup><xref rid="fn972">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BATHE HIMSELF IN WATER, AND HE SHALL BE CLEAN. In the evening, as is the law.<sup><xref rid="fn973">30</xref></sup> After stating this,<sup><xref rid="fn974">31</xref></sup> Scripture backtracks and explains that this<sup><xref rid="fn975">32</xref></sup> occurs after seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn976">33</xref></sup> The same law applied to the seven days of Miriam.<sup><xref rid="fn977">34</xref></sup> Scripture details<sup><xref rid="fn978">35</xref></sup> that he shall shave all his hair on the seventh day. Scripture then goes on to explain that the meaning of <italic>all his hair</italic> is, the hair on his head, his beard, and his eyebrows. The word <italic>gabbot</italic> (eyebrows) is close in meaning to the word <italic>gav</italic> (high place).<sup><xref rid="fn979">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. EVEN ALL HIS HAIR. The hair of the feet. Some say the hair of his arms, thighs, and chest.</p>
<p>10. TWO HE-LAMBS&#x2026;AND ONE EWE-LAMB. The leper shall bring a he-lamb for a burnt offering as is the law regarding all who have evil thoughts,<sup><xref rid="fn980">37</xref></sup> because the plague of leprosy is a punishment for deeds of the tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn981">38</xref></sup> Another he-lamb is brought as a guilt offering as is the law with all guilt offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn982">39</xref></sup> A ewe-lamb is offered for a sin offering as is the law with all sin offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn983">40</xref></sup> Also three tenth parts of an <italic>ephah</italic> as is the law, for a tenth part of an <italic>ephah</italic> is brought with a lamb.<sup><xref rid="fn984">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ONE LOG. A measure.<sup><xref rid="fn985">42</xref></sup> The term <italic>log</italic> has no brother.<sup><xref rid="fn986">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>[11. AND THOSE THINGS.] This refers to the he-lambs and the ewe-lamb. Also, this guilt offering<sup><xref rid="fn987">44</xref></sup> and also the sin offering,<sup><xref rid="fn988">45</xref></sup> with the exception of the parts offered on the altar,<sup><xref rid="fn989">46</xref></sup> belong to the <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn990">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. UPON THE TIP. The meaning of <italic>tenuch</italic> (tip) is understood from its context.<sup><xref rid="fn991">48</xref></sup> Now, the one who is cleansed from leprosy, which is an affliction in the body, is similar to the <italic>kohen</italic> who is installed,<sup><xref rid="fn992">49</xref></sup> for sin is like a leprosy in the soul.<sup><xref rid="fn993">50</xref></sup> The thumb is the place of connection.<sup><xref rid="fn994">51</xref></sup> It is the main component of all acts.<sup><xref rid="fn995">52</xref></sup> The right thumb was selected because of the power of the right side. The tip of the ear is a reminder to listen to what God has commanded.<sup><xref rid="fn996">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. INTO THE PALM OF HIS OWN LEFT HAND.<sup><xref rid="fn997">54</xref></sup> <italic>The palm</italic> in <italic>kaf ha-kohen</italic> (the palm of his own)<sup><xref rid="fn998">55</xref></sup> refers to the palm of the <italic>kohen</italic> who cleanses. Scripture reads thus<sup><xref rid="fn999">56</xref></sup> because such style is considered elegant in the Hebrew language.<sup><xref rid="fn1000">57</xref></sup> The verse that follows is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1001">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. BEFORE THE LORD. Towards the entrance of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p>17. UPON THE BLOOD OF THE GUILT-OFFERING. Which is upon the tip, the thumb, and the great toe.</p>
<p>19. AND THE PRIEST SHALL OFFER THE SIN-OFFERING. The ewe-lamb as is the law with all sin offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn1002">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND THE PRIEST SHALL OFFER THE BURNT-OFFERING. The he-lamb and its meal offering, which consists of a tenth of an <italic>ephah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1003">60</xref></sup> Some say that the <italic>kohen</italic> shall offer the entire meal offering<sup><xref rid="fn1004">61</xref></sup> with the burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1005">62</xref></sup> He shall offer the guilt offering first<sup><xref rid="fn1006">63</xref></sup> because it is more severe.<sup><xref rid="fn1007">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE SHALL BE CLEAN. Then<sup><xref rid="fn1008">65</xref></sup> he shall be clean like all who are clean.</p>
<p>21. AND IF HE BE POOR. The term <italic>dal</italic> (poor) is found with regard to the body.<sup><xref rid="fn1009">66</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>poor</italic> (dal) <italic>and very ill-favored</italic> (Gen. 41:19); <italic>Happy is he that considereth the poor</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1010">67</xref></sup> (dal) (Ps. 41:2); <italic>son of the king, art thou thus becoming leaner</italic> (dal) (II Sam. 13:4). The term <italic>dal</italic> is also found with regard to one who has no money.<sup><xref rid="fn1011">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON. Scripture begins explaining the laws dealing with leprosy in a house.<sup><xref rid="fn1012">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>[34. WHEN YE ARE COME INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN.] Scripture reads thus<sup><xref rid="fn1013">70</xref></sup> because this law applies only in the Land of Israel because of the great status of the land; for the temple was among them, and the Glory was in the midst of the temple.</p>
<p>AND I PUT. The event<sup><xref rid="fn1014">71</xref></sup> is contingent on God&#x2019;s putting.<sup><xref rid="fn1015">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>[35.] THEN HE THAT OWNETH THE HOUSE SHALL COME. There is a divine command that he<sup><xref rid="fn1016">73</xref></sup> come to the <italic>kohen</italic>.</p>
<p>36. THAT THEY EMPTY THE HOUSE. The master of the house and all men of his household.<sup><xref rid="fn1017">74</xref></sup> Scripture employs the plural<sup><xref rid="fn1018">75</xref></sup> for it is to be emptied quickly.<sup><xref rid="fn1019">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>BEFORE THE PRIEST GO IN. For the <italic>kohen</italic> will close up the house because of its uncertain status.<sup><xref rid="fn1020">77</xref></sup> The house shall be emptied before its status is declared to be in doubt.</p>
<p>37. HOLLOW STREAKS. The word <italic>sheka&#x2019;arurot</italic> (hollow streaks) has no sister.<sup><xref rid="fn1021">78</xref></sup> We do not know if it is a quadrilateral<sup><xref rid="fn1022">79</xref></sup> with the last letter<sup><xref rid="fn1023">80</xref></sup> doubled or if it is a pentaliteral.<sup><xref rid="fn1024">81</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>sheka&#x2019;arurot</italic> is to be ascertained from its context. Some say that it refers to marks or streaks. Others say that it is a compound word. It is akin to <italic>va-tishka</italic> (sank down)<sup><xref rid="fn1025">82</xref></sup> in <italic>and the fire sank down</italic> (Num. 11:2) and to <italic>rorot</italic>, which is related to the word <italic>rar</italic> (run)<sup><xref rid="fn1026">83</xref></sup> in <italic>run with his issue</italic> (Lev. 15:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1027">84</xref></sup> However, this is far-fetched.</p>
<p>AND THE APPEARANCE THEREOF.<sup><xref rid="fn1028">85</xref></sup> The appearance of each one of them<sup><xref rid="fn1029">86</xref></sup> be lower [than the wall].</p>
<p>40. THAT THEY TAKE OUT THE STONES. <italic>Ve-chilletzu</italic> means <italic>that they take out</italic>. Compare, <italic>challetzeni</italic> (deliver me) in <italic>Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man</italic> (Ps. 140:2).</p>
<p>INTO AN UNCLEAN PLACE. So that no one remove the stones from there.<sup><xref rid="fn1030">87</xref></sup> So that it be recognized that they<sup><xref rid="fn1031">88</xref></sup> are unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn1032">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. AND HE SHALL CAUSE THE HOUSE TO BE SCRAPED. The word <italic>yaktzi&#x2019;a</italic> (he shall cause&#x2026;to be scraped) is related to the word <italic>maktzu&#x2019;ot</italic> (planes) (Is. 44:13) and the word <italic>ketzi&#x2019;ot</italic> (cassia) in <italic>Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia</italic> (Ps. 45:9). The meaning of <italic>ketz&#x2019;ot</italic> (cassia) is cuttings.<sup><xref rid="fn1033">90</xref></sup> Some say the corner<sup><xref rid="fn1034">91</xref></sup> shall be peeled.<sup><xref rid="fn1035">92</xref></sup> However, this is incorrect, for the plague had already spread in the house.<sup><xref rid="fn1036">93</xref></sup> Actually, he must scrape the whole house. The meaning of <italic>mi-bayit</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1037">94</xref></sup> means within. The word <italic>hiktzu</italic> (they scrape off) is related to the word <italic>katzeh</italic> (extremity), for they only removed the upper extremity.<sup><xref rid="fn1038">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>42. AND SHALL PLASTER THE HOUSE. The word <italic>tach</italic> (plaster) is the reverse of <italic>yaktzi&#x2019;a</italic> (he shall cause&#x2026;to be scraped) (v. 41).<sup><xref rid="fn1039">96</xref></sup> It is related to <italic>tachim</italic> (daub) in <italic>they daub it with whited plaster</italic> (Ezek. 13:10).</p>
<p>AND HE SHALL TAKE OTHER MORTAR.<sup><xref rid="fn1040">97</xref></sup> The owner of the house who wants to dwell in the house. If the plague returns (v. 43), then the <italic>kohen</italic> shall come (v. 44).<sup><xref rid="fn1041">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>43. AFTER THE HOUSE HATH BEEN SCRAPED. After the stones have first been taken out and the house has been scraped. Scripture employs the plural forms <italic>ve-lakechu</italic> (and they shall take) and <italic>ve-hevi&#x2019;u</italic> (and put them) to indicate haste.<sup><xref rid="fn1042">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>45. AND HE SHALL BREAK DOWN THE HOUSE. By command.<sup><xref rid="fn1043">100</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>and he shall carry them forth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1044">101</xref></sup> It is most likely that the house was shut up for seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn1045">102</xref></sup> However, Scripture employed an abridged style.<sup><xref rid="fn1046">103</xref></sup> He <italic>that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up</italic> (v. 46) which applies to the first and second times is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1047">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>46. SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. After he bathes his body as the law requires.<sup><xref rid="fn1048">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>47. AND HE THAT LIETH. This<sup><xref rid="fn1049">106</xref></sup> is very severe uncleanliness. He that lies in the house must therefore wash his garments<sup><xref rid="fn1050">107</xref></sup> and bathe and be unclean until evening. Scripture does not mention that he be unclean until evening, for whoever lies and eats in the house, first comes into the house.<sup><xref rid="fn1051">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>49. AND HE SHALL TAKE. This is to be interpreted as its counterpart.<sup><xref rid="fn1052">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>57. WHEN IT IS UNCLEAN. The day when the man or the garment or the house will be unclean or clean.</p>
<ftnote id="fn944"><sup>1</sup> Our chapter continues the theme of the preceding chapter. Thus the statement <italic>And the Lord spoke unto Moses</italic> in Lev. 13:1 would appear to apply to our chapter as well. Therefore the clause <italic>And the Lord spoke unto Moses</italic> in Lev. 14:1 seems unnecessary. Hence I.E. points out that our portion begins with <italic>And the Lord spoke</italic> because it contains a new commandment, <italic>viz</italic>., the laws of the cleansing of the leper. In other words, our chapter is not a mere continuation of what came before it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn945"><sup>2</sup> In other words, our verse should be interpreted as if written, if the leper be healed from the plague of leprosy, for according to Rabbi Jonah it is the person not the plague who is healed.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 15</title>
<p>AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND TO AARON. For the <italic>kohanim</italic> distinguish between a woman who has an issue (<italic>zavah</italic>) and one who menstruates (<italic>niddah</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1053">1</xref></sup> Compare the Rabbinic interpretation on <italic>between blood and blood</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1054">2</xref></sup> (Deut. 17:8). Scripture now begins to deal with those who become unclean from a hidden source,<sup><xref rid="fn1055">3</xref></sup> for until now it dealt with leprosy which is a visible plague.</p>
<p>2. AN ISSUE. The word <italic>zav</italic> (issue) is similar to the word <italic>zavat</italic> (flowing) in <italic>flowing with milk</italic> (Ex. 44:13). <italic>Zav</italic> refers to dripping drops.<sup><xref rid="fn1056">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>OUT OF HIS FLESH. A euphemism for the male&#x2019;s private part.<sup><xref rid="fn1057">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>HIS ISSUE. <italic>Zovo</italic> (his issue) is a noun.<sup><xref rid="fn1058">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND THIS SHALL BE HIS UNCLEANLINESS. This means the issue takes two forms.<sup><xref rid="fn1059">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>HIS FLESH RUN WITH HIS ISSUE. The word <italic>rar</italic> (run) is related to the word <italic>riro</italic> (his spittle) in, <italic>and let his spittle fall down upon his beard</italic> (I Sam. 21:14).</p>
<p>OR BE STOPPED. The word <italic>hechtim</italic> means stopped. It is related to the word <italic>chatum</italic> (sealed) in <italic>that is sealed</italic> (Is. 29:11). It means that the issue pools and congeals so that semen is not ejaculated when the afflicted sleeps with a women. The same law applies to what the one who has an issue lies or sits on.<sup><xref rid="fn1060">8</xref></sup> Similarly, there is one law regarding the one who touches what the afflicted lies on or sits on.<sup><xref rid="fn1061">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. ANDS HE THAT TOUCHETH THE FLESH OF HIM THAT HATH THE ISSUE. Any part without exception.<sup><xref rid="fn1062">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. SPIT. The meaning of <italic>yarok</italic> (spit) is known. It comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn1063">11</xref></sup> The fact that the <italic>kof</italic> of <italic>rukki</italic> (my spittle) (Job 7:19) has a <italic>dagesh</italic> is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1064">12</xref></sup> Note, the spit of the one who suffers an issue is harmful,<sup><xref rid="fn1065">13</xref></sup> for the issue is one of the infectious diseases. It is not the practice of men to spit in the face of other people.<sup><xref rid="fn1066">14</xref></sup> What happened occurred unintentionally. The one suffering from an issue expectorated his spittle and it fell on a clean person.<sup><xref rid="fn1067">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND WHAT SADDLE. Which, as the transmitters of tradition explained, becomes unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn1068">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. ANY THING THAT IS UNDER HIM. Under the saddle shall become lightly unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn1069">17</xref></sup> However, the uncleanliness of those who carry them<sup><xref rid="fn1070">18</xref></sup> is more strict.<sup><xref rid="fn1071">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. WITHOUT HAVING RINSED HIS HANDS IN WATER. It would have appeared to us<sup><xref rid="fn1072">20</xref></sup> that any food or anything similar, that the one having an issue touched by hand,<sup><xref rid="fn1073">21</xref></sup> and the hands were washed, is not unclean, for the afflicted did not touch the place of the issue.<sup><xref rid="fn1074">22</xref></sup> However, since we saw that our fathers<sup><xref rid="fn1075">23</xref></sup> explained that the hands are like the body<sup><xref rid="fn1076">24</xref></sup> we accept their words. According to the plain meaning of our verse if the one experiencing an issue touches someone with hands that have been washed the one touched is unclean but his garments are not unclean. However, if the one suffering the issue did not wash his hands then the garments are unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn1077">25</xref></sup> This law is similar<sup><xref rid="fn1078">26</xref></sup> to the one regarding he who touches anything which is under the saddle.<sup><xref rid="fn1079">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. FOR HIS CLEANSING.<sup><xref rid="fn1080">28</xref></sup> From the day of his cleansing.<sup><xref rid="fn1081">29</xref></sup> The sacrifice consists of a burnt-offering<sup><xref rid="fn1082">30</xref></sup> and a sin-offering,<sup><xref rid="fn1083">31</xref></sup> for the issue is a punishment for sin.</p>
<p>16. GO OUT. Involuntarily.<sup><xref rid="fn1084">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>FLOW OF SEED. <italic>Shikhvat</italic> (flow) is similar to <italic>shikhvat</italic> (layer) in <italic>the layer of dew</italic> (Ex. 16:14).<sup><xref rid="fn1085">33</xref></sup> It is related to the word <italic>yashkiv</italic> (pour out) in <italic>who can pour out</italic> (Job 38:37). It would appear to us<sup><xref rid="fn1086">34</xref></sup> that the garment or the skin requires washing if it has wet semen or dry semen on it.<sup><xref rid="fn1087">35</xref></sup> However, the truth lies with the words of tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn1088">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn1089">37</xref></sup> concludes the laws of the male.<sup><xref rid="fn1090">38</xref></sup> It then begins with the female.<sup><xref rid="fn1091">39</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>And if he be on the bed</italic> (v. 23) refers back to the object<sup><xref rid="fn1092">40</xref></sup> that she sits upon (v. 22). Now the object<sup><xref rid="fn1093">41</xref></sup> is on the bed or the object<sup><xref rid="fn1094">42</xref></sup> is on another object.<sup><xref rid="fn1095">43</xref></sup> The uncleanliness is therefore light.<sup><xref rid="fn1096">44</xref></sup> Scripture does not mention a saddle with regards to a women for Scripture speaks of what is prevalent.<sup><xref rid="fn1097">45</xref></sup> The law is the same.<sup><xref rid="fn1098">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. IN HER FLESH. In the women&#x2019;s private part. Those who explain <italic>then he shall bathe all his flesh</italic> (v. 16) which is written concerning one who ejaculates as referring to the penis<sup><xref rid="fn1099">47</xref></sup> err. The word <italic>all</italic> is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn1100">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND IF ANY MAN LIE WITH HER. Without any sinful intent.<sup><xref rid="fn1101">49</xref></sup> On the contrary, he erred in sleeping with her.<sup><xref rid="fn1102">50</xref></sup> Behold her menstrual flow came while he was with her. This is the meaning of <italic>be upon him</italic>, for the one who sleeps with a menstruating women incurs the penalty of <italic>karet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1103">51</xref></sup> The same law applies to a women who has an issue,<sup><xref rid="fn1104">52</xref></sup> even though it is not stated.</p>
<p>AND EVERY BED WHEREON HE LIETH SHALL BE UNCLEAN. For he is unclean for seven days. He also defiles others. The latter is so even though it is not stated.</p>
<p>25. MANY DAYS NOT IN THE TIME OF HER IMPURITY. Every women has fixed periods. Or, she had an issue added to her menstruation.<sup><xref rid="fn1105">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND BRING THEM. <italic>Ve-hevi&#x2019;ah</italic> (and bring them) is ultimately accented. It is an irregular word.<sup><xref rid="fn1106">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. THUS SHALL YE SEPARATE. Some say that <italic>ve-hizzartem</italic> (thus shall ye separate) is missing a <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1107">55</xref></sup> and is to be interpreted <italic>ve-hizzhartem</italic> (and you shall warn). This cannot be so, for the <italic>heh</italic> is not vowel letter.<sup><xref rid="fn1108">56</xref></sup> It is only silent at the end of a word.<sup><xref rid="fn1109">57</xref></sup> On the contrary, <italic>ve-hizzartem</italic> is related to the word <italic>ve-yinnazeru</italic> (that they separate)<sup><xref rid="fn1110">58</xref></sup> in <italic>that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel</italic> (Lev. 22:2). The meaning of that <italic>ve-hizzartem</italic> is, and you shall distance.<sup><xref rid="fn1111">59</xref></sup> The word <italic>nazir</italic> (nazirite) is derived from the same root. A <italic>nazir</italic> is one who has distanced himself from the lusts of the world. <italic>Ve-hizzartem</italic> is vocalized like the word <italic>ve-hippaltem</italic> (and you shall divide)<sup><xref rid="fn1112">60</xref></sup> in, <italic>and you shall divide the land</italic> (Ezek. 45:1), for the <italic>nun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1113">61</xref></sup> is swallowed in the <italic>dagesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1114">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THEIR UNCLEANLINESS. <italic>Be-tumatam</italic> (in their uncleanliness) is to be rendered because of their uncleanliness.<sup><xref rid="fn1115">63</xref></sup> Its meaning is, <italic>when they defile My tabernacle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1116">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. SO THAT HE IS UNCLEAN THEREBY. There is a Divine command for him to be in a state of ritual impurity. I will explain this later.<sup><xref rid="fn1117">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>[33.] <italic>Whether it be a man</italic> explains <italic>the law of him that hath an issue</italic> (v. 32). <italic>With her that is unclean</italic> refers to a women who has an issue or menstruates.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1053"><sup>1</sup> Hence this commandment was also communicated to Aaron.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1054"><sup>2</sup> Deuteronomy 17:8-9 states that if there be a dispute regarding <italic>blood and blood</italic> then the <italic>kohen</italic> shall decide the aforementioned. The Rabbis interpret <italic>between blood and blood</italic> as meaning between &#x201C;between menstrual blood and blood of an issue and blood of childbirth (<italic>Sifre</italic>, on Deut. 17:8).&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1055"><sup>3</sup> Such as an issue.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1056"><sup>4</sup> I.E. interprets Ex. 44:13 as &#x201C;dripping with milk.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1057"><sup>5</sup> <italic>Flesh</italic> is a euphemism for the penis.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1058"><sup>6</sup> With the pronominal suffix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1059"><sup>7</sup> <italic>His flesh will run with his issue or be stopped with his issue</italic> (v. 3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1060"><sup>8</sup> They have to be immersed in water and are unclean till the evening.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1061"><sup>9</sup> He has to immerse himself and his clothes and remains unclean until evening.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1062"><sup>10</sup> Unlike earlier (v. 2 and v. 3) where the word <italic>flesh</italic> refers to the penis here it refers to any organ. Thus the meaning of <italic>and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue</italic> means, and he that touches any part of him that has the issue.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1063"><sup>11</sup> Its root is <italic>resh, kof, kof</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1064"><sup>12</sup> For the <italic>dagesh</italic> compensates for the missing root <italic>kof</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1065"><sup>13</sup> Hence it is a source of uncleanliness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1066"><sup>14</sup> <italic>And if</italic> (<italic>ve-khi</italic>) <italic>he that hath an issue spit upon him that is clean</italic> could conceivably be rendered, and when (<italic>ve-khi</italic>) he that hath an issue spit upon him that is clean. &#x201C;And when&#x201D; implies that this is the normal course of events. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1067"><sup>15</sup> In other words, <italic>ve-khi</italic> is to be rendered as &#x201C;and if&#x201D; that is and if by accident.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1068"><sup>16</sup> According to the Rabbis the term <italic>mercav</italic> (saddle) refers to equipment set aside for riding. See <italic>Torat Kohanim, Metzora</italic> 3:9. Also see Rashi, &#x201C;&#x2026;The hold in front of the saddle&#x2026;becomes unclean as a part of something for riding on (<italic>mercav</italic>)&#x2026;and the saddle&#x2026;is unclean as being something to sit upon (<italic>moshav</italic>)&#x201D; (Rosenbaum and Silverman translation).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1069"><sup>17</sup> It does not require immersion of garments (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1070"><sup>18</sup> The objects earlier mentioned, i.e., that which the one having an issue lies upon, sits upon, or rides upon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1071"><sup>19</sup> It requires the immersion of garments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1072"><sup>20</sup> From a plain reading of the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1073"><sup>21</sup> In others words, <italic>toucheth</italic> means touched by hand.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1074"><sup>22</sup> The hands most certainly did not have any issue on them, hence his hands do not defile. However, if the hands were not washed they may have come into contact with his issue, hence they defile.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1075"><sup>23</sup> The Rabbis of the Talmud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1076"><sup>24</sup> According to the Rabbis the term hands in our verse does not only refer to the hands. It refers to the whole body. According tao the <italic>Rabbis without having rinsed his hands with water</italic> means without immersing his body. See <italic>Niddah</italic> 66b; <italic>Kiddushin</italic> 25a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1077"><sup>25</sup> According to <italic>halakhah</italic> there is no difference whether the one having an issue touched a person with hands that have or have not been washed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1078"><sup>26</sup> In that at times it entails a light uncleanliness and at times a strict uncleanliness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1079"><sup>27</sup> One who touches that which is under the saddle becomes lightly unclean. However, one carries these objects becomes more strictly unclean. See I.E. on verse 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1080"><sup>28</sup> Hebrew, <italic>le-taharrato</italic>, literally, to his cleansing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1081"><sup>29</sup> The <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>le-taharrato</italic> is not to be rendered to, but from. Hence <italic>le-tahorrato</italic> is to be interpreted, from his cleaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1082"><sup>30</sup> To atone for evil thoughts. See I.E. on Lev. 1:4. The reference might be to thoughts of forbidden sexual practices. See next note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1083"><sup>31</sup> To atone for transgressions actually committed. According to Krinsky the reference is to prohibited sexual practices. The fact that Scripture goes on to speak of a man having an emission of semen might support this interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1084"><sup>32</sup> For verse 18 speaks of voluntary emission of semen.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1085"><sup>33</sup> Which I.E. renders a descent or a pouring down of dew. See I.E. on Ex. 16:14 (Vol. 2, p. 320).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1086"><sup>34</sup> From the plain meaning of the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1087"><sup>35</sup> If it come into contact with wet or dry semen, for the verse does not differentiate among them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1088"><sup>36</sup> The Mishnah in <italic>Niddah</italic> 7:1 states, &#x201C;Semen [coveys] uncleanliness when wet but not when dry.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1090"><sup>38</sup> Who has a normal or abnormal discharge from his penis.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1091"><sup>39</sup> Who has a normal or abnormal discharge of blood.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1092"><sup>40</sup> I.E. renders <italic>And if he</italic> (hu) <italic>be on the bed</italic> as, And if it be on the bed, for the word <italic>hu</italic> may mean he or it.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1094"><sup>42</sup> The object which a person touches.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1095"><sup>43</sup> Upon which the women sits.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1096"><sup>44</sup> The one who touches it does not have to immerse his garments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1097"><sup>45</sup> Most of riding was done by men. Some editions read <italic>behamah</italic> (cattle). According to this version our text reads, for Scripture speaks of [an] animal. The latter is probably to be interpreted, Scripture speaks of one who usually rides on an animal, that is, males, and not females.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1098"><sup>46</sup> This law applies to both men and women.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1099"><sup>47</sup> They take the word flesh to mean penis. See I.E. on verse 2.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1102"><sup>50</sup> He was not aware that her menstrual flow would commence while he slept with her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1103"><sup>51</sup> See Lev. 20:18. Had the man had an evil intention when he had intercourse with the menstruating women then Scripture would have mentioned that he committed a major sin. Scripture appears to state, as a matter of fact, that a man who sleeps with a menstruating woman is unclean. One may take this to imply that one is permitted to sleep with a menstruating woman but is unclean if he does so. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1104"><sup>52</sup> The same law applies to one who engages in coitus with a women who has an issue.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1105"><sup>53</sup> Her flow continued beyond her menstrual period.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1106"><sup>54</sup> It should have been penultimately accented.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1107"><sup>55</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>ve-hizzartem</italic> comes from the root <italic>zayin, heh, resh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1108"><sup>56</sup> A vowel letter is occasionally dropped, for it is not sounded.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1109"><sup>57</sup> It serves as a vowel letter at the end of the word. However, when it comes in the middle of a word it is sounded. Hence it is not dropped.</ftnote>

<h1>ACHARE MOT</h1>
<p>1. AFTER THE DEATH. After God warned Israel not to incur the death penalty<sup><xref rid="fn1118">1</xref></sup> He also told Moses to caution Aaron not to die as his sons died.<sup><xref rid="fn1119">2</xref></sup> This section is proof that the sons of Aaron brought the incense within the veil.<sup><xref rid="fn1120">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHEN THEY DREW NEAR.] The word <italic>be-korvatam</italic> (when they drew near) is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn1121">4</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>le-korvah</italic> (to come unto) in <italic>to come unto the work</italic> (Ex. 36:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1122">5</xref></sup> The <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>le-korvah</italic> has been turned into a <italic>tav</italic> in <italic>be-korvatam</italic> as is the practice with the feminine <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1123">6</xref></sup> Rabbi Joshua,<sup><xref rid="fn1124">7</xref></sup> who says that <italic>be-korvatam</italic> is a noun following the paradigm of <italic>chokhmatam</italic> (their wisdom) (Jer. 49:7),<sup><xref rid="fn1125">8</xref></sup> errs.</p>
<p>2. INTO THE HOLY PLACE. In contrast to the tent of meeting.<sup><xref rid="fn1126">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR I APPEAR IN THE CLOUD.<sup><xref rid="fn1127">10</xref></sup> It means Aaron shall only enter with incense. He shall produce smoke so that God&#x2019;s glory will not be seen, and as a result he dies.<sup><xref rid="fn1128">11</xref></sup> Note, the meaning of <italic>ki be-anan era&#x2019;eh</italic> (for I appear in the cloud upon the ark-cover) is, I will not appear to him except through the agency of a cloud.<sup><xref rid="fn1129">12</xref></sup> There are those who say that the meaning of <italic>ki be-anan era&#x2019;eh al ha-kapporet</italic> (for I appear in the cloud) is, because I dwell in a cloud upon the ark-covering.<sup><xref rid="fn1130">13</xref></sup> <italic>For I appear in the cloud</italic> is similar in meaning to <italic>The Lord hath said that He would dwell in the thick darkness</italic> (I Kings 8:12).</p>
<p>3. WITH A YOUNG BULLOCK. Its meaning is not that Aaron should bring the bullock into the holy place<sup><xref rid="fn1131">14</xref></sup> but rather that he first bring a bullock of his own<sup><xref rid="fn1132">15</xref></sup> for a sin offering to atone for himself and the <italic>kohanim</italic>. Others say also for the Levites,<sup><xref rid="fn1133">16</xref></sup> for they found, <italic>And thou shalt write Aaron&#x2019;s name upon the rod of Levi</italic> (Num. 17:18).<sup><xref rid="fn1134">17</xref></sup> However, this is farfetched. On the contrary, the Levites are considered among the Israelites.</p>
<p>4. THE HOLY LINEN TUNIC. Scripture does not mention the ephod,<sup><xref rid="fn1135">18</xref></sup> the breastplate,<sup><xref rid="fn1136">19</xref></sup> and the robe of the ephod,<sup><xref rid="fn1137">20</xref></sup> for it earlier mentioned, <italic>and the sound thereof</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1138">21</xref></sup> <italic>shall be heard when he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1139">22</xref></sup> <italic>goeth in unto the holy place</italic> (Ex. 28:35).<sup><xref rid="fn1140">23</xref></sup> The men of the second temple who served without the <italic>Urim</italic> and the <italic>Thummim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1141">24</xref></sup> learned from this verse [that their practice was proper].<sup><xref rid="fn1142">25</xref></sup> There were also prophets there.<sup><xref rid="fn1143">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND AARON SHALL PRESENT THE BULLOCK OF THE SIN-OFFERING, WHICH IS FOR HIMSELF. To the opening of the tent of meeting as is the law.<sup><xref rid="fn1144">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HIMSELF.] This means that with it he will make atonement for himself and for his house after he slaughters it.<sup><xref rid="fn1145">28</xref></sup> There are those who say that presenting the bullock<sup><xref rid="fn1146">29</xref></sup> is the atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn1147">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. LOTS. We know what they are from the words of our sages.<sup><xref rid="fn1148">31</xref></sup> The Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn1149">32</xref></sup> says that Azazel is the name of a mountain. It is so called because of its might.<sup><xref rid="fn1150">33</xref></sup> God&#x2019;s name<sup><xref rid="fn1151">34</xref></sup> is mentioned in Azazel as it is in <italic>ke-harere el</italic> (the mighty mountains) (Ps. 36:7) and in <italic>yakti&#x2019;el</italic> (Joktheel) (II Kings 14:7). The Gaon, the Levite,<sup><xref rid="fn1152">35</xref></sup> caught him in error. He pointed out that the <italic>alef</italic> of Azazel is placed between one <italic>zayin</italic> and the other <italic>zayin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1153">36</xref></sup> There are those who say that Azazel is the name of a mountain close to Mount Sinai. God commanded that the goat be led and brought up there until it slipped down the mountain. Later on in the time of the temple, they led it to a different mountain. &#x201C;And Aaron did&#x201D; (v. 34) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1154">37</xref></sup> The same, in my opinion, as I will explain in its place,<sup><xref rid="fn1155">38</xref></sup> is true of the festival of Shavu&#x2019;ot.<sup><xref rid="fn1156">39</xref></sup> There are those who say that the service<sup><xref rid="fn1157">40</xref></sup> during the second temple was unlike that of the first, for the <italic>kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1158">41</xref></sup> lacked the garments<sup><xref rid="fn1159">42</xref></sup> and there was no ark-cover. This commentator says that the goat was sent into the wilderness, for Scripture states, <italic>and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness</italic> (v. 22).<sup><xref rid="fn1160">43</xref></sup> The latter is similar in meaning to the bird of the one who is cleansed from leprosy<sup><xref rid="fn1161">44</xref></sup> which is sent into the open field, an uninhabited place. <italic>A land which is cut off</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1162">45</xref></sup> (v. 22) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1163">46</xref></sup> We answered him that they sent the goat into the wilderness as it is written.<sup><xref rid="fn1164">47</xref></sup> However, the goat was pursued<sup><xref rid="fn1165">48</xref></sup> until it fled and climbed up a rock. The rabbis therefore said, &#x201C;and he<sup><xref rid="fn1166">49</xref></sup> pushes it down.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1167">50</xref></sup> Rabbi Samuel<sup><xref rid="fn1168">51</xref></sup> says that even though it is written that the goat offered as a sin offering is to be offered to God, the goat that was sent was also offered to God. There is no need for this interpretation, for the goat sent into the wilderness did not serve as an offering since it was not slaughtered. If you are able to understand the secret that follows Azazel<sup><xref rid="fn1169">52</xref></sup> then you will know its secret and the secret of its name, for it has comrades in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1170">53</xref></sup> I will reveal a bit of its secret to you in a hint. When you are thirty-three, you will understand it.<sup><xref rid="fn1171">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND OFFER HIM<sup><xref rid="fn1172">55</xref></sup> FOR A SIN-OFFERING. He shall slaughter it.</p>
<p>10. SHALL BE SET ALIVE. The word <italic>yo&#x2019;omad</italic> (shall be set) is a <italic>hofal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1173">56</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1174">57</xref></sup> should have been vocalized with a <italic>shuruk</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1175">58</xref></sup> However, it was enlarged<sup><xref rid="fn1176">59</xref></sup> because of the guttural.<sup><xref rid="fn1177">60</xref></sup> The word <italic>yochoram</italic> (should be forfeited) in <italic>all his substance should be forfeited</italic> (Ez. 10:8) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1178">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO MAKE ATONEMENT OVER HIM.<sup><xref rid="fn1179">62</xref></sup> For the atonement shall be upon it.<sup><xref rid="fn1180">63</xref></sup> It means to send him away.</p>
<p>11. AND AARON SHALL PRESENT. Scripture goes on to explain that after Aaron has presented the bullock and the two goats to the tent of meeting, he shall begin to slaughter his bullock. Scripture does this because<sup><xref rid="fn1181">64</xref></sup> it dwelt at length on the goats.<sup><xref rid="fn1182">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. A CENSER. The meaning of <italic>machtah</italic> (censer) is known.</p>
<p>HIS HANDS FULL. Both hands.<sup><xref rid="fn1183">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>SWEET INCENSE. Mentioned earlier.<sup><xref rid="fn1184">67</xref></sup> It would have appeared to us that <italic>upon the ark-cover</italic> (v. 14); <italic>and before the arkcover</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.) are to be taken literally. However, the transmitters of tradition said that <italic>upon the ark-cover</italic> means between the staves.<sup><xref rid="fn1185">68</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>and before the ark-cover</italic> is known from their words.<sup><xref rid="fn1186">69</xref></sup> What they said is true.</p>
<p>15. THEN SHALL HE KILL THE GOAT OF THE SIN-OFFERING. He shall now, when he goes out,<sup><xref rid="fn1187">70</xref></sup> slaughter it. There are those who say that he should slaughter the goat before he slaughters the bullock.<sup><xref rid="fn1188">71</xref></sup> The latter is untrue.<sup><xref rid="fn1189">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND HE SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THE HOLY PLACE. The reference is to the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>AND SO SHALL HE DO FOR THE TENT OF MEETING. He shall sprinkle seven times before the ark-cover (<italic>kaporet</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1190">73</xref></sup> and on the horns of the altar of incense.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>And he shall make atonement for the holy place</italic> is that the blood serves as a ransom so that the holy place does not destroy<sup><xref rid="fn1191">74</xref></sup> because of the uncleanliness of the unclean.</p>
<p>17. AND THERE SHALL BE NO MAN. From among the <italic>kohanim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1192">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO MAKE ATONEMENT IN THE HOLY PLACE. Inside.<sup><xref rid="fn1193">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HAVE MADE ATONEMENT FOR HIMSELF, AND FOR HIS HOUSEHOLD. With his sin offering bullock.</p>
<p>AND FOR ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL. With their sin offering goat.</p>
<p>18. AND HE SHALL GO OUT UNTO THE ALTAR. The reference is to the burnt offering altar.<sup><xref rid="fn1194">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND HE SHALL PUT THEM. After the sins are removed from Israel they are, as it were, placed on the head of the goat. The sins will go to a place were they will never again be remembered. Scripture speaks in a way that all will understand.<sup><xref rid="fn1195">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>APPOINTED. <italic>Itti</italic> (appointed) means prepared for his time.<sup><xref rid="fn1196">79</xref></sup> Or <italic>itti</italic> refers to an individual whose custom it was to always lead the goat on the Day of Atonement. The <italic>yod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1197">80</xref></sup> relates to the word <italic>et</italic> (time).<sup><xref rid="fn1198">81</xref></sup> <italic>Itti</italic> is similar to <italic>penimi</italic> (internal).<sup><xref rid="fn1199">82</xref></sup> The interpretation of those who explain <italic>itti</italic> to mean wise<sup><xref rid="fn1200">83</xref></sup> does not appear correct to me.<sup><xref rid="fn1201">84</xref></sup> Our sages, of blessed memory, said that the &#x201C;bearer&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1202">85</xref></sup> was a <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1203">86</xref></sup> Their words are true.</p>
<p>24. IN A HOLY PLACE. In the courtyard of the tent of meeting. They used to spread a sheet for the <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1204">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>HIS OTHER VESTMENTS.<sup><xref rid="fn1205">88</xref></sup> With which he serves every day.<sup><xref rid="fn1206">89</xref></sup> There are those who say that the reference is to the garments mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1207">90</xref></sup> The fact that Scripture does not say <italic>and put on other garments</italic> (Lev. 6:4) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1208">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>HIS BURNT-OFFERING. The reference is to the ram<sup><xref rid="fn1209">92</xref></sup> and the ram of the people,<sup><xref rid="fn1210">93</xref></sup> the bullock of the people,<sup><xref rid="fn1211">94</xref></sup> and the seven lambs,<sup><xref rid="fn1212">95</xref></sup> for it is so written in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1213">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND THE FAT OF THE SIN-OFFERING. The fat of the bullock sin offering<sup><xref rid="fn1214">97</xref></sup> and the fat of the goat sin offering<sup><xref rid="fn1215">98</xref></sup> and also the fat of the he-goat sin offering, which is a sin offering belonging to the <italic>kohen</italic> as is the law, and is not burned. The last named sacrifice is found in the Torah portion <italic>Pinechas</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1216">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>[26.] AND BATHE HIS FLESH IN WATER. This is sufficient for him,<sup><xref rid="fn1217">100</xref></sup> for he does not become unclean until evening.</p>
<p>27. SHALL BE CARRIED FORTH<sup><xref rid="fn1218">101</xref></sup> WITHOUT THE CAMP. By command.<sup><xref rid="fn1219">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY SHALL BURN. The <italic>kohanim</italic> shall burn them. All those who do the burning shall bathe in water and immediately come into the camp. The fact that Scripture immediately states, <italic>and afterward he may come into the camp</italic>, is proof of this, for what reason is there to states this.<sup><xref rid="fn1220">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND IT SHALL BE A STATUTE FOR EVER UNTO YOU. This service.<sup><xref rid="fn1221">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THE SEVENTH MONTH, ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE MONTH, YE SHALL AFFLICT YOUR SOULS. Since Scripture writes, <italic>And let your soul delight itself in fatness</italic> (Is. 55:2), we know that affliction is the reverse of delight and that affliction of the soul refers to fasting.<sup><xref rid="fn1222">105</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>And satisfy the afflicted soul</italic> (Is. 58:10), the meaning of which is like <italic>And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.), for it is the style of the prophets to repeat themselves.<sup><xref rid="fn1223">106</xref></sup> Now since we have tradition<sup><xref rid="fn1224">107</xref></sup> there is no reason to go on searching.<sup><xref rid="fn1225">108</xref></sup> <italic>I afflicted my soul with fasting</italic> (Ps. 35:13) is no proof<sup><xref rid="fn1226">109</xref></sup> because the word fast is mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1227">110</xref></sup> The general rule is, whenever we find in Scripture the word affliction connected to soul, the reference is to a fast.<sup><xref rid="fn1228">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE HOME-BORN, OR THE STRANGER THAT SOJOURNETH AMONG YOU. We are not permitted to let him<sup><xref rid="fn1229">112</xref></sup> do any work,<sup><xref rid="fn1230">113</xref></sup> but we do not force him<sup><xref rid="fn1231">114</xref></sup> to fast.<sup><xref rid="fn1232">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. SHALL ATONEMENT BE MADE FOR YOU. By the <italic>kohen</italic>. The commentators therefore say regarding the goat which is sent into the wilderness, concerning which it is written, <italic>shall be set alive&#x2026;to make atonement over him</italic> (v. 10), that the atonement becomes effective by the placing of the goat before the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn1233">116</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROM ALL YOUR SINS. This is to be understood in accordance with my earlier explanation that the noun <italic>chattat</italic> (sin) is a general term. It is therefore found with reference to both accidental and deliberate sin.</p>
<p>31. IT IS A SABBATH OF SOLEMN REST. Some say that <italic>shabbat shabbaton</italic> (a sabbath of solemn rest) means rest for the soul and rest for the body.<sup><xref rid="fn1234">117</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>shabbat shabbaton</italic> means a rest above which there is no other rest.<sup><xref rid="fn1235">118</xref></sup> Both words<sup><xref rid="fn1236">119</xref></sup> are nouns. At times the other word comes first.<sup><xref rid="fn1237">120</xref></sup> They have one meaning,<sup><xref rid="fn1238">121</xref></sup> This interpretation is not farfetched.</p>
<p>IT IS A STATUTE FOR EVER. To fast.</p>
<p>32. AND THE PRIEST&#x2026;SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT. Scripture now goes on to explain what the <italic>kohen</italic> shall make atonement for.</p>
<p>WHO SHALL BE ANOINTED. By the anointer<sup><xref rid="fn1239">122</xref></sup> with the anointing oil<sup><xref rid="fn1240">123</xref></sup> after he has been consecrated.<sup><xref rid="fn1241">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE SHALL PUT ON. He<sup><xref rid="fn1242">125</xref></sup> is the one who shall put on these holy garments, for another person may not wear them.</p>
<p>33. THE MOST HOLY PLACE. Which is located on the inner side of the veil.</p>
<p>AND SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THE PRIESTS AND FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE ASSEMBLY. The Levites are included among the latter, for the Levites are not called <italic>kohanim</italic>. On the contrary, every <italic>kohen</italic> is a Levite<sup><xref rid="fn1243">126</xref></sup> but every Levite is not a <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1244">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. AND THIS SHALL BE&#x2026;UNTO YOU. Scripture already stated this.<sup><xref rid="fn1245">128</xref></sup> It is repeated to add <italic>once in the year</italic>.</p>
<p>35. AND HE DID. And Aaron did.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1118"><sup>1</sup> In Lev. 15:31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1119"><sup>2</sup> See Lev. 10:1,2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1120"><sup>3</sup> Into the Holy of Holies. The veil separated the Holy of Holies and the rest of the tabernacle. Our chapter relates that after Aaron&#x2019;s sons died, God told Moses to caution Aaron against entering the Holy of Holies so as not to die as his sons did. The implication of the latter is that Aaron&#x2019;s sons died because they entered the Holy of Holies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1121"><sup>4</sup> An infinitive with a pronoun suffixed to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1122"><sup>5</sup> <italic>Korvatam</italic> is made up of the infinitive <italic>korvah</italic> plus the pronominal suffix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1123"><sup>6</sup> When a feminine word ending in a <italic>heh</italic> is connected to a pronominal suffix, the <italic>heh</italic> changes into a <italic>tav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1124"><sup>7</sup> A Karaite Bible commentator.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1125"><sup>8</sup> That is; <italic>korvatam</italic> is made up of the noun <italic>korvah</italic> plus a pronominal suffix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1126"><sup>9</sup> The tent of meeting is also a holy place. Hence I.E. points out that <italic>the holy</italic> here refers to the place that is considered holy with regard to the tent of meeting, i.e., it is holier than the tent of meeting.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1127"><sup>10</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ki be-anan</italic>, which I.E. renders: for only with a cloud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1128"><sup>11</sup> This interpretation renders <italic>ki be-anan era&#x2019;eh al ha-kapporet</italic>,: for only with a cloud may I be seen over the ark-cover.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1129"><sup>12</sup> Aaron is not permitted to look directly at God&#x2019;s glory. He must screen God&#x2019;s glory with the smoke of the incense. According to this interpretation <italic>ki be-anan era&#x2019;eh al ha-kapporet</italic> means, I may only be seen through the smoke of the incense.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1130"><sup>13</sup> Hence Aaron shall <italic>come not at all times into the holy place</italic> (v. 2).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1131"><sup>14</sup> <italic>Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock</italic> might be taken to mean that Aaron should bring the bullock into the Holy of Holies. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1132"><sup>15</sup> From his own property.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1133"><sup>16</sup> The bullock also atones for the Levites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1134"><sup>17</sup> We thus see that the Levites and the <italic>kohanim</italic> form one unit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1135"><sup>18</sup> See Ex. 28:6-12.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1139"><sup>22</sup> The <italic>kohen gadol</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1140"><sup>23</sup> The point is Ex. 28:35 tells us that the <italic>kohen</italic> must wear the robe when he enters the Holy of Holies. Now, the <italic>ephod</italic> and the breastplate were attached to the robe. Hence there was no need for Scripture to repeat once again that Aaron shall wear these garments when he enters the Holy of Holies. Rashbam on Ex. 28:35 explains similarly. It should be noted that this interpretation is contrary to the accepted <italic>halakhic</italic> opinion which rules that the <italic>kohen gadol</italic> does not enter the Holy of Holies wearing the <italic>ephod</italic>, its band, the breastplate, and the robe. See <italic>Rosh Ha-Shanah</italic> 26a. Also see Rashi, &#x201C;This teaches us that he must not officiate in the interior (the Holy of Holies) robed in the eight garments which were the insignia of the High Priest&#x2026;in which he performed the service outside&#x2026;but in the four garments&#x2026;like an ordinary priest&#x201D; (Rosenbaum and Silbermann).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1141"><sup>24</sup> Which was placed in the breastplate (Ex. 28:30).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1142"><sup>25</sup> Since Scripture does not mention the <italic>Urim</italic> and the <italic>Thummim</italic> in our verse, it appears that the wearing of the <italic>Urim</italic> and the <italic>Thummim</italic> is not essential for the service to be valid.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1143"><sup>26</sup> At the beginning of the second temple period. These prophets taught the Israelites that the <italic>kohen gadol</italic> may officiate without the <italic>Urim</italic> and the <italic>Thumim</italic> if the latter are not available.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1154"><sup>37</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase of <italic>and he did</italic>. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that Scripture goes out of the way to state that Aaron did as God commanded him in the wilderness, for later on when Israel entered Israel some parts of the Yom Kippur ritual were performed a bit differently. The sending of the goat to Mount Azazel is an example.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1155"><sup>38</sup> See I.E. on Lev. 23:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1156"><sup>39</sup> According to I.E., God commanded Israel to observe the first Shavu&#x2019;ot on a Sunday. However, the latter did not apply in succeeding years. See I.E. on Lev. 23:11.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1169"><sup>52</sup> Verse 10 reads, <italic>la-azazel ha-midbarah</italic> (for Azazel into the wilderness). According to I.E. the word <italic>ha-midbarah</italic> is the key to understanding the meaning of Azazel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1170"><sup>53</sup> According to I.E., Azazel is a compound word. It is made up of the two words <italic>ez</italic> (goat) and <italic>azal</italic> (to go). There are many such compound names in Scripture. Compare, Emmanuel (God is with us). According to I. E. the meaning of <italic>la-azazel ha-midbarah</italic> is, for a goat that goes into the wilderness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1171"><sup>54</sup> According Nahmanides what Ibn Ezra means is, if you count 33 verses you will understand why the goat was sent into the wilderness. If we count 33 verses we come to Lev. 17:7. The Torah there prohibits Israel from sacrificing to the <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic> (satyrs). According to I.E. the <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic> were demons that had the shape of goats. Now it is not clear what the purpose was of sending the goat to demons who were shaped like goats. According to Nahmanides the goat was a gift to Satan so that he would not interfere with Israel&#x2019;s sacrifice. However, it is doubtful that I.E. had this in mind. Weiser suggests that the goat was sent to a place of demons so that the sins which it (literally or symbolically) bore would not contaminate people, for demons dwell in a place which is uninhabited.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 17</title>
<p>2. SPEAK UNTO AARON, AND UNTO HIS SONS. For they are the ones who slaughter<sup><xref rid="fn1246">1</xref></sup> for Israel. If the Torah had read, <italic>in the camp</italic> (v. 3),<sup><xref rid="fn1247">2</xref></sup> then it would have been permissible to slaughter it<sup><xref rid="fn1248">3</xref></sup> outside the camp.<sup><xref rid="fn1249">4</xref></sup> Also, this<sup><xref rid="fn1250">5</xref></sup> commandment<sup><xref rid="fn1251">6</xref></sup> is dependent upon the Holy Temple.<sup><xref rid="fn1252">7</xref></sup> However, this law applies only to any place that is close to Jerusalem.<sup><xref rid="fn1253">8</xref></sup> We know how close from the words of tradition,<sup><xref rid="fn1254">9</xref></sup> for if the place is far, one is permitted to slaughter flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn1255">10</xref></sup> The latter is so, for Scripture states it.<sup><xref rid="fn1256">11</xref></sup> Many say that it is forbidden to eat flesh in the exile.<sup><xref rid="fn1257">12</xref></sup> They explain <italic>neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth</italic> (Dan. 10:3)<sup><xref rid="fn1258">13</xref></sup> as referring to the flesh of fish.<sup><xref rid="fn1259">14</xref></sup> They did not speak correctly. I do not want to dwell on this and answer them.</p>
<p>5. TO THE END THAT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MAY BRING. This is the reason for this commandment. <italic>And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs</italic> (v. 7) explains <italic>in the open field</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1260">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. UNTO THE SATYRS. <italic>Se&#x2019;irim</italic> (satyrs) are the demons. They are so called because the body of one who sees them &#x201C;storms.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1261">16</xref></sup> However, it appears that they are so called because the insane see them in the form of goats (<italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic>). The word &#x201C;more&#x201D; teaches that the Israelites did so in Egypt.</p>
<p>AFTER WHOM THEY GO ASTRAY. For whoever seeks after them and believes in them strays from under his God, for he thinks that there is someone aside from God the glorious and awe inspiring who does good or bad. This section<sup><xref rid="fn1262">17</xref></sup> does not mention the stranger, for the commandment regarding sacrifices and burnt offerings falls on Israel. Scripture mentions the stranger<sup><xref rid="fn1263">18</xref></sup> in order to teach that Israel shall not permit a stranger to sacrifice to idols in the Land of Israel. The law regarding <italic>all manner of blood</italic> (v. 10) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1264">19</xref></sup> The eating of blood is prohibited<sup><xref rid="fn1265">20</xref></sup> because it is the very life, for the flesh lives by the blood.<sup><xref rid="fn1266">21</xref></sup> The truth of the matter is that the life by which a person lives is in the blood which is in the heart.</p>
<p>11. THAT MAKETH ATONEMENT BY REASON OF THE LIFE.<sup><xref rid="fn1267">22</xref></sup> The blood makes atonement by the life which is in it.<sup><xref rid="fn1268">23</xref></sup> The reason for the latter is life for life.<sup><xref rid="fn1269">24</xref></sup> There are others who explain <italic>ba-nefesh yekhapper</italic> (that maketh atonement by reason of the life) as, to make atonement for your souls.<sup><xref rid="fn1270">25</xref></sup> However, the latter makes no sense, for what reason is there for Scripture to say this after stating <italic>to make atonement for your souls</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn1271">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. THAT TAKETH IN HUNTING ANY BEAST OR FOWL THAT MAY BE EATEN. Such as a deer or a gazelle.</p>
<p>OR FOWL THAT MAY BE EATEN. We also learn from this verse that we should not allow the stranger to eat in our land the flesh of a pig or a horse, or any bird of prey which is unclean. It is possible that God commanded that all blood which is not offered on the altar<sup><xref rid="fn1272">27</xref></sup> be covered so that the one who sees the blood of the deer, stag, or fowl not think that it comes from a sacrifice that was offered to an idol, for God had commanded that no blood be eaten and that no blood from God&#x2019;s altar be spilled outside of the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn1273">28</xref></sup> I will explain the secret of this verse in the Torah portion opening with the words <italic>Behold, I set</italic> (Deut. 11:26).<sup><xref rid="fn1274">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. THE BLOOD THEREOF IS ALL ONE WITH THE LIFE THEREOF. The blood is coupled with the life thereof,<sup><xref rid="fn1275">30</xref></sup> for it is known<sup><xref rid="fn1276">31</xref></sup> that the threads<sup><xref rid="fn1277">32</xref></sup> that go out from the left side of the heart are divided, half for blood and half for the breath, like the olive oil and the light thereof.<sup><xref rid="fn1278">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEREFORE I SAID UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The meaning of <italic>va-omar</italic> (therefore I said) is, and I have previously said.<sup><xref rid="fn1279">34</xref></sup> The reference is to the section now mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1280">35</xref></sup> Since Scripture mentions the beast (<italic>chayyah</italic>) which is not offered as a sacrifice, and similarly the fowl,<sup><xref rid="fn1281">36</xref></sup> it goes on to speak of <italic>every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself</italic> (v. 15), which is also not offered as a sacrifice. Scripture also mentions the latter because of its reference to an animal which is taken in hunting.<sup><xref rid="fn1282">37</xref></sup> If one does so deliberately<sup><xref rid="fn1283">38</xref></sup> he violates a negative precept<sup><xref rid="fn1284">39</xref></sup> and is flogged.<sup><xref rid="fn1285">40</xref></sup> If he does so accidentally, he brings a sin offering. If one should argue,<sup><xref rid="fn1286">41</xref></sup> does not Scripture state, <italic>thou mayest give it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1287">42</xref></sup> <italic>unto the stranger that is within thy gates, that he may eat it</italic> (Deut. 14:21)? The answer is that this<sup><xref rid="fn1288">43</xref></sup> speaks of a stranger who dwells in the Land of Israel. Scripture similarly reads, <italic>or the stranger that sojourneth among you</italic> (Lev. 16:29). We shall not allow him to eat anything that dies of itself. However, we may give it<sup><xref rid="fn1289">44</xref></sup> to the stranger that comes into our gates<sup><xref rid="fn1290">45</xref></sup> and he will eat it outside.<sup><xref rid="fn1291">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. THEN HE SHALL BEAR HIS INIQUITY. Permanently. He<sup><xref rid="fn1292">47</xref></sup> will be forgiven for his sin by the punishment which God shall bring upon him. This section<sup><xref rid="fn1293">48</xref></sup> follows because Scripture mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn1294">49</xref></sup> the topic of the satyrs which Israel sacrificed to in Egypt. The prohibited sexual practices<sup><xref rid="fn1295">50</xref></sup> deal with those of the land of Canaan,<sup><xref rid="fn1296">51</xref></sup> for Scripture so states at the end.<sup><xref rid="fn1297">52</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1246"><sup>1</sup> The sacrifices.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1247"><sup>2</sup> That is, if verse 3 had only stated, <italic>in the camp</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1248"><sup>3</sup> Any one of the animals mentioned in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1249"><sup>4</sup> Hence verse 3 reads, <italic>in the camp, or&#x2026;without the camp</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1250"><sup>5</sup> The law codified in verses 3 and 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1251"><sup>6</sup> Like many others which precede it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1252"><sup>7</sup> It is in effect only when a central sanctuary for the bringing of sacrifices exists.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1253"><sup>8</sup> Even when the temple stood, the law applied only to places which were close to Jerusalem. I.E. is interpreting according to the plain meaning of the text. According to the rabbis, our verse speaks of sacrifices; i.e., sacrifices are not to be offered in any place except for the tabernacle or the temple. See <italic>Sifra</italic> and Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1254"><sup>9</sup> See <italic>Kiddishin</italic> 57b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1255"><sup>10</sup> He is permitted to slaughter an animal for the purpose of eating its flesh without presenting it for an offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1256"><sup>11</sup> In Deut. 12:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1257"><sup>12</sup> This was a Karaite opinion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1258"><sup>13</sup> Daniel, who lived in Babylon, tells us that he refrained from meat and wine while he fasted. This indicates that he ate meat when he did not fast.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1259"><sup>14</sup> The Karaites explain the word &#x201C;flesh&#x201D; in <italic>neither came flesh&#x2026;in my mouth</italic> as referring to the flesh of fish, for they maintain that one cannot eat meat outside of the Land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1260"><sup>15</sup> The reason Israel shall not sacrifice in the open field is so that <italic>they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs</italic> whom they believe to dwell there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1261"><sup>16</sup> The person who sees them is agitated. This opinion connects <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic>, spelled with a <italic>sin</italic>, to the word <italic>sa&#x2019;arah</italic> (storm), spelled with a <italic>samekh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1262"><sup>17</sup> Which prohibits the slaughter of meat except as an offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1263"><sup>18</sup> In verse 8, which prohibits offering a sacrifice outside of the sanctuary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1264"><sup>19</sup> It is the same case with the law regarding the prohibition of eating all manner of blood.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1265"><sup>20</sup> To the Israelite and to the stranger.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1266"><sup>21</sup> The blood is offered on the altar to atone for the life of the sinner, life for life. It is therefore not to be eaten.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1267"><sup>22</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ba-nefesh yekhapper</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1268"><sup>23</sup> This interpretation renders <italic>ba-nefesh yekhapper</italic> (makes atonement by reason of the life) as makes atonement with the life which is in it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1269"><sup>24</sup> The life of the animal is given in place of the life of the sinner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1270"><sup>25</sup> They render <italic>ba-nefesh</italic> (by reason of the life) as for the soul, the reference being for the soul of the sinner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1271"><sup>26</sup> What reason is there for Scripture to repeat itself?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1272"><sup>27</sup> That is, <italic>the blood of any beast</italic> (chayyah) <italic>or fowl that may be eaten</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1273"><sup>28</sup> Hence a person who sees blood pooled on the ground will assume that it is from blood offered to idols.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1274"><sup>29</sup> See I.E. on Deut. 12:25. I.E. there explains that eating the blood of an animal will harm one&#x2019;s soul as well as have a bad effect on one&#x2019;s children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1275"><sup>30</sup> I.E. renders <italic>damo be-nafsho</italic> as the blood thereof is with the life thereof.</ftnote>

Since Scripture does not mention the house of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn1310">13</xref></sup> we learn that we are not permitted to allow the stranger to practice in our country any of the abominations mentioned, so that he does not defile the land.</p>
<p>ANY THAT IS NEAR OF KIN TO HIM. <italic>She&#x2019;er</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1311">14</xref></sup> (near) is a general term for all those with whom one is prohibited to engage in sexual relations. Scripture then goes into detail.<sup><xref rid="fn1312">15</xref></sup> Rabbi Aaron Ha-Kohen<sup><xref rid="fn1313">16</xref></sup> says that the reference is to the emission of semen in vain.<sup><xref rid="fn1314">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>NONE OF YOU SHALL APPROACH. Approach is a euphemism for lying with.<sup><xref rid="fn1315">18</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>And I approached the prophetess</italic> (Is. 8:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1316">19</xref></sup> Our verse is close to <italic>come not near a woman</italic> (Ex. 19:15).<sup><xref rid="fn1317">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>NAKEDNESS. <italic>Ervah</italic> (nakedness) refers to something unseemly which is exposed and has to be covered. The meaning of <italic>I am the Lord</italic> is that God loves the one who separates himself to serve God and to obey his word. What happened at Mount Sinai is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn1318">21</xref></sup> The first man is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn1319">22</xref></sup> This is the secret of man.<sup><xref rid="fn1320">23</xref></sup> Since the inclination of the heart of man is like that of beasts, it was not possible to prohibit all women.<sup><xref rid="fn1321">24</xref></sup> Note, Scripture prohibited all women that are found around a person at all times.<sup><xref rid="fn1322">25</xref></sup> I will reveal to you a hidden and sealed secret in the Torah portion <italic>When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies</italic> (Deut. 23:10).<sup><xref rid="fn1323">26</xref></sup> Observe, whoever defiles himself is distanced from God, from receiving God.<sup><xref rid="fn1324">27</xref></sup> Scripture therefore mentions, <italic>I am the Lord</italic>.</p>
<p>7. THE NAKEDNESS OF THY FATHER. Scripture begins<sup><xref rid="fn1325">28</xref></sup> with the father, who precedes the son.<sup><xref rid="fn1326">29</xref></sup> Scripture states that anyone who is closely related to his father or mother<sup><xref rid="fn1327">30</xref></sup> is prohibited. Note, the nakedness of the mother is the one that is mentioned first.<sup><xref rid="fn1328">31</xref></sup> The nakedness of the father&#x2019;s wife, who is not the mother, follows. Then comes the sister, who is the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.</p>
<p>9. BORN AT HOME. Who was born in accordance with the laws of the house of Israel following the first and second stage of marriage.<sup><xref rid="fn1329">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>BORN ABROAD. Unconventionally.<sup><xref rid="fn1330">33</xref></sup> Some say that <italic>born at home</italic> is similar to <italic>were born upon Joseph&#x2019;s knees</italic> (Gen. 50:23).<sup><xref rid="fn1331">34</xref></sup> It means she grew up with you in the same house. It is possible that <italic>born abroad</italic> means she is in a different place and a different city and grew up away from you, outside of your father&#x2019;s house. Scripture next mentions <italic>thy son&#x2019;s daughter</italic> (v. 10).<sup><xref rid="fn1332">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THE NAKEDNESS OF THY FATHER&#x2019;S WIFE&#x2019;S DAUGHTER. There are those who say that this refers to a sister from a father and mother.<sup><xref rid="fn1333">36</xref></sup> We know<sup><xref rid="fn1334">37</xref></sup> that the one who sleeps with a sister from a father and mother violates two negative laws.<sup><xref rid="fn1335">38</xref></sup> There are those who say that our verse was written for emphasis.<sup><xref rid="fn1336">39</xref></sup> The Sadducees<sup><xref rid="fn1337">40</xref></sup> say that <italic>thy father&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s daughter</italic> does not refer to the daughter of one&#x2019;s mother. They explain that <italic>begotten of thy father</italic> means whom your father raised. Our verse deals with an instance in which the father took a woman who had a small daughter. They say the same thing regarding Tamar.<sup><xref rid="fn1338">41</xref></sup> Their proof is, <italic>for he will not withhold me from thee</italic> (II Sam. 13:13).<sup><xref rid="fn1339">42</xref></sup> She thus was not begotten by David. Now since the transmitters of tradition said that the daughter of your father&#x2019;s wife is permitted, we have no need to answer those who invent things in their hearts. It is possible that &#x201C;the daughter of thy father&#x2019;s wife&#x201D; refers to a daughter<sup><xref rid="fn1340">43</xref></sup> resulting from a rape.<sup><xref rid="fn1341">44</xref></sup> The word <italic>she&#x2019;er</italic> (kin<sup><xref rid="fn1342">45</xref></sup>) and <italic>basar</italic> (kin)<sup><xref rid="fn1343">46</xref></sup> are close in meaning.</p>
<p>14. SHE IS THINE AUNT. She is considered as your aunt.<sup><xref rid="fn1344">47</xref></sup> Similarly &#x201C;Behold Hanamel, my uncle.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1345">48</xref></sup> Now what will those who rely on the Torah alone for the commandments<sup><xref rid="fn1346">49</xref></sup> do? For Scripture does not prohibit the wife of the brother of one&#x2019;s mother, and not the mother of one&#x2019;s father, or the mother of one&#x2019;s mother.<sup><xref rid="fn1347">50</xref></sup> We therefore need tradition. It is possible that the reason that Scripture did not mention that the wife of one&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s brother is prohibited is that we learn this from the prohibition of the wife of the father&#x2019;s brother. The prohibition of the wife of one&#x2019;s brother is mentioned in the Torah (Lev. 19:3) portion <italic>Ye shall be holy</italic>. Also, the reason that those whom I mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn1348">51</xref></sup> are not listed in Scripture is that the Torah speaks of that which is prevalent.<sup><xref rid="fn1349">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. THOU SHALT NOT UNCOVER THE NAKEDNESS OF THY BROTHER&#x2019;S WIFE. This is explained in the Torah portion <italic>If brethren dwell together</italic> (Deut. 25:5). To the one who asks why didn&#x2019;t Scripture mention a daughter, [I reply] that the daughter is stated in <italic>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter</italic> (Lev. 18:17), whether or not it is his daughter, for once he has slept with the mother the daughter is prohibited.</p>
<p>17. THEY ARE NEAR KINSWOMEN. <italic>She&#x2019;er</italic> (kin) and <italic>sha&#x2019;arah</italic> (kinswomen) are two nouns. If the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>sha&#x2019;arah</italic> were not a guttural, it would be quiescent like the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>salmah</italic> (raiment) (Ex. 22:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1350">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. TO BE A RIVAL. <italic>Li-tzeror</italic> (to be a rival) is related to the word <italic>tzaratah</italic> (her rival) in <italic>And her rival vexed her</italic> (I Sam. 1:6). Note, Scripture does not mention in the Torah portion <italic>Ye shall be holy</italic> (Lev. 19:2)<sup><xref rid="fn1351">54</xref></sup> the punishment for sleeping with two sisters, and it does not mention the punishment for sleeping with the daughter of one&#x2019;s son and with the daughter of one&#x2019;s daughter.<sup><xref rid="fn1352">55</xref></sup> The one who says that Rachel and Leah<sup><xref rid="fn1353">56</xref></sup> were not sisters<sup><xref rid="fn1354">57</xref></sup> errs. His proof is, <italic>for all these abominations&#x2026;</italic> (Lev. 18:27).<sup><xref rid="fn1355">58</xref></sup> However, this is not a rigorous proof. There are those who answer the one who asks, how could God punish for something He did not warn against,<sup><xref rid="fn1356">59</xref></sup> by saying the sons of Noah were warned about these sexual offenses. Others say<sup><xref rid="fn1357">60</xref></sup> that even though Scripture makes a general statement, <italic>for all these abominations&#x2026;</italic>, the reference is not to all these abominations but to most of them.<sup><xref rid="fn1358">61</xref></sup> You will learn my opinion<sup><xref rid="fn1359">62</xref></sup> in the Torah portion <italic>And Moses went</italic> (Deut. 31:1).<sup><xref rid="fn1360">63</xref></sup> One who sleeps with a menstruating woman is considered to have slept with a woman whose nakedness one is prohibited from uncovering.<sup><xref rid="fn1361">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. WITH THY NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S WIFE. This excludes the captive woman.<sup><xref rid="fn1362">65</xref></sup> There are those who say that she<sup><xref rid="fn1363">66</xref></sup> was previously prohibited. Those whose sexual craving<sup><xref rid="fn1364">67</xref></sup> overcame the intelligence of their heart erred in explaining the meaning of <italic>le-zara</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1365">68</xref></sup> (carnally).<sup><xref rid="fn1366">69</xref></sup> We know that sexual intercourse is divided into three groups. One, to be fruitful and multiply<sup><xref rid="fn1367">70</xref></sup> and not to satisfy lust. Two, to relieve the fullness of the body.<sup><xref rid="fn1368">71</xref></sup> Three, for the purpose of lust, which is similar to the lust of an animal.<sup><xref rid="fn1369">72</xref></sup> Now since Scripture says <italic>le-zara</italic> (carnally), the meaning of which is even for seed,<sup><xref rid="fn1370">73</xref></sup> a married woman is prohibited by a very severe prohibition.<sup><xref rid="fn1371">74</xref></sup> <italic>And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to set them apart to Molech</italic> (v. 21) is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn1372">75</xref></sup> Scripture adds to <italic>defile thyself with her</italic> to let us know that the one who touches her will not be cleansed; he will be defiled forever. This verse<sup><xref rid="fn1373">76</xref></sup> does not at all prohibit a non-Jewish woman.<sup><xref rid="fn1374">77</xref></sup> There is no argument from the captive woman,<sup><xref rid="fn1375">78</xref></sup> for she converts to Judaism.</p>
<p>21. TO MOLECH. Molech is the name of an image. The rabbis interpreted Molech as a general term for all<sup><xref rid="fn1376">79</xref></sup> whom a person accepts as a king over him.<sup><xref rid="fn1377">80</xref></sup> It is possible that Molech is the abomination of the Ammonites.<sup><xref rid="fn1378">81</xref></sup> The word <italic>le-ha&#x2019;avir</italic> (to set apart) is to burn, for that was the way Molech was worshipped. Some say that they used to pass<sup><xref rid="fn1379">82</xref></sup> their sons over the fire. Some lived and some died. In view of the fact that the verse does not mention fire, some explained <italic>le-ha&#x2019;avir lamolekh</italic> (to set apart to Molech) as meaning to cause to pass over from the Torah of God to another religion.<sup><xref rid="fn1380">83</xref></sup> You will defile the Lord who is known as your God<sup><xref rid="fn1381">84</xref></sup> when you give from the holy seed to Molech. The Gaon says that fornication has eight levels.<sup><xref rid="fn1382">85</xref></sup> The most severe is intercourse with a beast of another species; afterwards comes the male, the entire gender of which is prohibited; afterwards comes the nakedness of the father&#x2019;s wife and her companions,<sup><xref rid="fn1383">86</xref></sup> which are prohibited at all times. I will not dwell on this, for what purpose is there to these words since Scripture says, concerning all of them, <italic>even the souls that do them shall be cut off</italic> (v. 29).</p>
<p>22. WITH MANKIND. Since we find, <italic>Behold, I lay yester-night with my father</italic> (Gen. 19:34), we see that the prohibition<sup><xref rid="fn1384">87</xref></sup> applies to the one who lay and the one who is lain with.<sup><xref rid="fn1385">88</xref></sup> Rabbi Hannanel, of blessed memory, says that there are those in whose body a female genitalia is newly formed.<sup><xref rid="fn1386">89</xref></sup> However, this is impossible according to the laws of nature.<sup><xref rid="fn1387">90</xref></sup> There are those who say that the reference is to an androgynous person. All this pain was caused by the fact that Scripture employs the plural <italic>mishkeve ishah</italic> (as with womankind).<sup><xref rid="fn1388">91</xref></sup> There is an individual opinion<sup><xref rid="fn1389">92</xref></sup> that <italic>mishkeve ishah</italic> refers to two types of intercourse.<sup><xref rid="fn1390">93</xref></sup> I believe that the precept is to be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn1391">94</xref></sup> The men of sound wisdom<sup><xref rid="fn1392">95</xref></sup> also applied the death penalty to those who performed this act.<sup><xref rid="fn1393">96</xref></sup> Scripture employed respectable language in saying [thou shalt not lie].<sup><xref rid="fn1394">97</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>thou shalt not approach</italic> (v. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn1395">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, since the male was created to make<sup><xref rid="fn1396">99</xref></sup> and the female to be made,<sup><xref rid="fn1397">100</xref></sup> Scripture notes that one should not reverse the words of God. There is a type of laying whose aim is to emit semen.<sup><xref rid="fn1398">101</xref></sup> Hence Scripture employs the term <italic>mishkeve</italic> which is a plural.<sup><xref rid="fn1399">102</xref></sup> It is unfit to dwell at length on this. Scripture states <italic>it is abomination</italic>, for it is an abomination to a holy soul even by the laws of nature.<sup><xref rid="fn1400">103</xref></sup> I have already explained the word <italic>shekhovtekha</italic> (lie carnally).<sup><xref rid="fn1401">104</xref></sup> It is possible that the word <italic>shekhovtekha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1402">105</xref></sup> is derived from <italic>shekhivah</italic> (lying), for the emission of semen comes along with lying.<sup><xref rid="fn1403">106</xref></sup> As Scripture states to defile <italic>thyself with her</italic> (v. 20) with regard to a married woman, it similarly says so with regard to a beast.</p>
<p>23. AND&#x2026;ANY BEAST. A female beast.</p>
<p>BEFORE A BEAST. A male beast.</p>
<p>TO LIE DOWN THERETO.<sup><xref rid="fn1404">107</xref></sup> <italic>Le-rivah</italic> reverts to the beast, for the woman is the one who is penetrated.<sup><xref rid="fn1405">108</xref></sup> The word <italic>rivah</italic> (lie down) is related to the word <italic>arba&#x2019;ah</italic> (four).<sup><xref rid="fn1406">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>IT IS PERVERSION. The grammarians say that the word <italic>tevel</italic> (perversion) comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn1407">110</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>temes</italic> (melteth)<sup><xref rid="fn1408">111</xref></sup> in <italic>which melteth and passeth away</italic> (Ps. 58:9). The <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>tevel</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1409">112</xref></sup> They say that <italic>tevel</italic> means destruction.<sup><xref rid="fn1410">113</xref></sup> There are those who say that the word <italic>mabbul</italic> (flood) is related to it.<sup><xref rid="fn1411">114</xref></sup> However, the word <italic>mabbul</italic> is most likely related to the word <italic>balal</italic> (confound) in <italic>the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth</italic> (Gen. 11:9). This is the general rule: Scripture prohibits all kinds of women with which it is possible for a person to be alone;<sup><xref rid="fn1412">115</xref></sup> a married woman, a non-Jewish woman,<sup><xref rid="fn1413">116</xref></sup> and those with whom intercourse cannot result in children,<sup><xref rid="fn1414">117</xref></sup> for a kind cannot reproduce except with its own kind and with those like its kind.</p>
<p>24. DEFILE NOT YE YOURSELVES. The <italic>tet</italic> of <italic>tittamme&#x2019;u</italic> (defile ye yourselves) has a <italic>dagesh</italic> to compensate for the swallowed<sup><xref rid="fn1415">118</xref></sup> <italic>tav</italic> of the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1416">119</xref></sup> The <italic>dagesh</italic> does not compensate for the <italic>nun</italic> of the <italic>nifal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1417">120</xref></sup> The <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>tittamme&#x2019;u</italic>, which is there according to the rules of grammar, is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1418">121</xref></sup> Observe, Scripture notes that each one of these acts defiles the soul.</p>
<p>WHICH I CAST OUT FROM BEFORE YOU. It means, from the Holy Land, dead or expelled.<sup><xref rid="fn1419">122</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND THE LAND VOMITED OUT HER INHABITANTS. Whatever a person regurgitates is despised in his eyes, and he will not take it back.</p>
<p>26. YE THEREFORE SHALL KEEP MY STATUTES. The very ones that I enumerated<sup><xref rid="fn1420">123</xref></sup> shall be prohibited to you.</p>
<p>AND MINE ORDINANCES. You shall execute the judgment which I will command, upon the one who violates any of these.</p>
<p>The reason that <italic>and shall not do any of these abominations</italic> is written a second time<sup><xref rid="fn1421">124</xref></sup> is to include the stranger, for this precept<sup><xref rid="fn1422">125</xref></sup> applies equally to the native and to the stranger who dwells in the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>If you have any intelligence<sup><xref rid="fn1423">126</xref></sup> you can understand why in past days Jacob took two sisters in Haran and later Amram took his aunt in Egypt, and they were not defiled through them.<sup><xref rid="fn1424">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>for all these abominations</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1425">128</xref></sup> (Lev. 18:27) is, you and your children shall know this so that you shall keep these precepts, and the land will be pure and the land will not regurgitate you.</p>
<p>27. THESE. <italic>Ha-el</italic> (these) and <italic>ha-elleh</italic> (these) (v. 29) have one meaning. Compare, <italic>ha-hem</italic> (those) and <italic>ha-hemah</italic> (those). However, this is not the opinion of the Gaon.<sup><xref rid="fn1426">129</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AS IT VOMITED OUT. <italic>Ka&#x2019;ah</italic> (vomited out) is a verb in the perfect. It is related to the word <italic>keyo</italic> (spew)<sup><xref rid="fn1427">130</xref></sup> in <italic>Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew</italic> (Jer. 25:27), for the letters <italic>alef, heh, vav, yod</italic> interchange.<sup><xref rid="fn1428">131</xref></sup> The word <italic>eretz</italic> is found in the masculine.<sup><xref rid="fn1429">132</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>netam aretz</italic> (the land burnt up)<sup><xref rid="fn1430">133</xref></sup> (Is. 9:18), and <italic>ve-lo nasa otam ha-aretz</italic> (and the land was not able to bear them)<sup><xref rid="fn1431">134</xref></sup> (Gen. 13:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1432">135</xref></sup> On the other hand, the word <italic>hiy</italic> (it)<sup><xref rid="fn1433">136</xref></sup> might be missing.<sup><xref rid="fn1434">137</xref></sup> Our verse should be interpreted as if it read, <italic>ka&#x2019;asher hiy ka&#x2019;ah</italic> (as it vomited out). In this case, <italic>ka&#x2019;ah</italic> is similar to <italic>ba&#x2019;ah</italic> (cometh) in <italic>cometh with the sheep</italic> (Gen. 29:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1435">138</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. EVEN THE SOULS THAT DO THEM SHALL BE CUT OFF. If they do so in public you shall put them to death. If they do so in secret then I will cut them off.</p>
<p>30. THEREFORE SHALL YE KEEP MY CHARGE. This charge. The charge being not to do [any of these abominable practices].</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>which were done before you</italic> is, a person shall not say, since the earlier ones did so, I will also do so. <italic>I am the Lord your God</italic> is connected to <italic>My charge</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1436">139</xref></sup> One who lacks intelligence<sup><xref rid="fn1437">140</xref></sup> shall not ask,<sup><xref rid="fn1438">141</xref></sup> &#x201C;Why this charge?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1439">142</xref></sup> For I am the Lord your God.

<ftnote id="fn1329"><sup>32</sup> A Jewish marriage is effectuated in two stages, <italic>erusin</italic> and <italic>nusu&#x2019;in</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1337"><sup>40</sup> The Karaites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1338"><sup>41</sup> Tamar was the daughter of David. She was raped by her brother Amnon. See II Sam. 13:1-22. According to the Karaites, Tamar was not actually David&#x2019;s daughter. She was his stepdaughter. When David married her mother she was already grown. According to the Karaites, Scripture only prohibits a stepsister that grew up in one&#x2019;s home. Hence it was permitted for Amnon to take her in marriage,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1339"><sup>42</sup> If she were his real sister, she would not have said this to Amnon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1340"><sup>43</sup> Of one&#x2019;s father.</ftnote>

Ebr</italic>. 38 reads: <italic>in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle</italic> (Jer. 32:6). Be that as it may, I.E.&#x2019;s point is that Hanamel was not Jeremiah&#x2019;s uncle. He was the son of Jeremiah&#x2019;s uncle. Nevertheless, Scripture refers to him as his uncle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1346"><sup>49</sup> The Karaites.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1353"><sup>56</sup> Two sisters whom Jacob married.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1354"><sup>57</sup> Hence Jacob was permitted to marry them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1355"><sup>58</sup> Marrying two sisters is thus an abomination. Jacob would not commit an abominable act.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1356"><sup>59</sup> Verses 27 and 28 tells us that the Canaanites were punished for practicing the sexual acts that the Torah prohibits. Hence the question arose from the anonymous commentator quoted by I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1357"><sup>60</sup> In reply to the problem raised by Jacob marrying two sisters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1358"><sup>61</sup> The phrase does not include two sisters. Thus marrying two sisters is not an abomination. The law prohibiting two sisters did not apply to Jacob, who lived before the Torah was given to Israel.</ftnote>

However, a Jewish woman is prohibited to an Israelite only if she is married. Thus &#x201C;thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife&#x201D; does not stand in contrast to a married captive woman but in contrast to an unmarried Jewish woman (Filwarg).

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 19</title>
<h1>KEDOSHIM</h1>
<p>2. [UNTO ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] The reason that Scripture states <italic>unto all the congregation of the children of Israel</italic> is to exclude strangers<sup><xref rid="fn1440">1</xref></sup> since they, like the Israelites, are commanded to abstain from prohibited sexual relations. The reason this chapter follows the one dealing with prohibited sexual relations is that the Israelites should not imagine that they would remain in the land by observing only the laws dealing with the prohibited sexual relations. God informs them that there are other commandments. If they do not observe them, they will be exiled from the land. The aforementioned are the ten statements.<sup><xref rid="fn1441">2</xref></sup> God warns against idol worship after stating, <italic>I the Lord&#x2026;am holy</italic> which, according to many commentators, is parallel to the first statement of the Decalogue.<sup><xref rid="fn1442">3</xref></sup> <italic>And ye shall not swear by my name falsely</italic> (v. 12) is parallel to <italic>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</italic> (Ex. 20:7).</p>
<p>3. AND YE SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS. This parallels <italic>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy</italic> (Ex. 20:8). <italic>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</italic> is similar to <italic>Honor thy father and thy mother</italic> (Ex. 20:12). <italic>Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor</italic> (v. 16) is likewise the same as the statement <italic>Thou shalt not murder</italic> (Ex. 20:13). The law regarding the bondmaid designated for a man (v. 20) is parallel to <italic>Thou shalt not commit adultery</italic> (Ex. 20:13 with a free woman. Similarly, <italic>Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another</italic> (v. 11); <italic>Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor</italic> (v. 13) are parallel to the three remaining statements.<sup><xref rid="fn1443">4</xref></sup> I have previously told you in my comments on the Torah portion <italic>Ve-Elleh Ha-Mishpatim</italic> (now these are the ordinances) (Ex. 21:1) that each and every precept stands by itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1444">5</xref></sup> However,<sup><xref rid="fn1445">6</xref></sup> there is some support for connecting the verses.<sup><xref rid="fn1446">7</xref></sup> Note, the section that opens with the words <italic>Ye shall be holy</italic> (v. 2) begins with <italic>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</italic> (v. 3). Now Scripture tells us that the years of the one who honors his parents will be long (Ex. 20:12). This implies that the days of one who disrespects his parents will be shortened. Scripture therefore says, <italic>Ye shall fear</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1447">8</xref></sup> The reason Scripture mentions the mother before the father is that a child first recognizes only its mother.<sup><xref rid="fn1448">9</xref></sup> Then it recognizes its father. The Torah next mentions the Sabbath because, unlike all the other festivals, a child is commanded to keep the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn1449">10</xref></sup> The child shall then recognize his God who rested on the seventh day.<sup><xref rid="fn1450">11</xref></sup> Scripture next mentions, <italic>Turn ye not unto the idols</italic> (v. 4).</p>
<p>We know from tradition what Scripture means by fearing parents.<sup><xref rid="fn1451">12</xref></sup> Our verse employs the word <italic>ish</italic> (every man) once<sup><xref rid="fn1452">13</xref></sup> because it wants to be brief. Scripture employs the plural <italic>tira&#x2019;u</italic> (ye shall fear)<sup><xref rid="fn1453">14</xref></sup> because those who observe the child have to teach him and force him to fear his parents. It is the same case regarding Sabbath observance.<sup><xref rid="fn1454">15</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>I am the Lord your God</italic> is, act as I did, for I rested from all work on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>4. TURN YE NOT. Even in your hearts to look upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn1455">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNTO THE IDOLS.<sup><xref rid="fn1456">17</xref></sup> The reference is to statues. They are called <italic>elilim</italic> because they are false objects. Compare the word <italic>elil</italic> (no value) in <italic>Ye are physicians of no value</italic> (Job 13:4). It is possibly related to the word <italic>al</italic> (not). <italic>Elilim</italic> means things that do not exist.</p>
<p>NOR&#x2026;MOLTEN GODS. Made to receive power from those who are on high, for there is no need for another god along with Me.<sup><xref rid="fn1457">18</xref></sup> Scripture therefore states,<sup><xref rid="fn1458">19</xref></sup> <italic>I am the Lord your God</italic>. Scripture employs the plurals <italic>tifnu</italic> (turn ye) and <italic>ta&#x2019;asu</italic> (make), for the one who sees idol worship and does not reveal the matter is a partner of the idolater.</p>
<p>5. AND WHEN YE OFFER A SACRIFICE OF PEACE-OFFERINGS. This is connected to what is written above.<sup><xref rid="fn1459">20</xref></sup> It means that one shall not sacrifice to the demons, no-gods,<sup><xref rid="fn1460">21</xref></sup> but only unto God. Scripture employs the plural <italic>tizbechu</italic> (ye offer), for Scripture is speaking about what is most prevalent, for people to join together to offer a sacrifice. Scripture reads <italic>li-retzonekhem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1461">22</xref></sup> (that ye may be accepted) because they shall not be forced to bring the offering but shall offer it of their own free will.</p>
<p>8. BUT EVERY ONE THAT EATETH IT. The meaning of <italic>okhelav</italic> is every one that eats of it.<sup><xref rid="fn1462">23</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>But the righteous are secure as a young lion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1463">24</xref></sup> (Prov. 28:1).<sup><xref rid="fn1464">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>BECAUSE HE HATH PROFANED THE HOLY THING OF THE LORD. After he offered the parts designated to God by Scripture, all the flesh<sup><xref rid="fn1465">26</xref></sup> is holy. <italic>Chillel</italic> (profaned) is related to the word <italic>chol</italic> (profane). It is something that has no significance.<sup><xref rid="fn1466">27</xref></sup> It is like an empty space (<italic>challel</italic>). In this section<sup><xref rid="fn1467">28</xref></sup> Scripture explains the punishment,<sup><xref rid="fn1468">29</xref></sup> namely, <italic>and that soul shall be cut off</italic>.</p>
<p>9. [AND WHEN YE REAP THE HARVEST.] This follows the law dealing with the peace offering, for as you gave to God the parts designated in Scripture, so shall you, out of respect for God, give what Scripture designates from the harvest of your land<sup><xref rid="fn1469">30</xref></sup> for the poor and the stranger. The word <italic>u-ve-kutzrekhem</italic> (and when ye reap the harvest) is grammatically irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn1470">31</xref></sup> It is an infinitive<sup><xref rid="fn1471">32</xref></sup> in the <italic>kal</italic>.</p>
<p>THE CORNER OF THY FIELD. The Israelite shall leave a corner in the field.<sup><xref rid="fn1472">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE GLEANING. The meaning of <italic>leket</italic> (gleaning) is known.</p>
<p>10. GLEAN. <italic>Te&#x2019;olel</italic> (glean) means to cut off the <italic>olelot</italic>, that is the young grapes. Compare, <italic>olel</italic> (young child). Very young children are also called <italic>yonekot</italic> (sucklings).<sup><xref rid="fn1473">34</xref></sup> This word<sup><xref rid="fn1474">35</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>shereshkha</italic> (root thee out)<sup><xref rid="fn1475">36</xref></sup> in <italic>And root thee out of the land of the living</italic> (Ps. 52:7), the meaning of which is, to cut the root. Similarly the meaning <italic>of mesa&#x2019;ef</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1476">37</xref></sup> <italic>purah</italic> (Is. 10:33) is to lop the boughs.</p>
<p>THE FALLEN FRUIT. The meaning of <italic>peret</italic> (fallen fruit) is known in the words of tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn1477">38</xref></sup> It is related to the word <italic>poretim</italic> (thrum)<sup><xref rid="fn1478">39</xref></sup> in <italic>That thrum on the psaltery</italic> (Amos 6:5).</p>
<p>FOR THE POOR. Of Israel.</p>
<p>AND FOR THE STRANGER. Who lives among you.<sup><xref rid="fn1479">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. [YE SHALL NOT STEAL.] <italic>Ye shall not steal</italic> follows,<sup><xref rid="fn1480">41</xref></sup> for Scripture, as it were, says I have commanded that you give from your property to the poor out of respect for God.<sup><xref rid="fn1481">42</xref></sup> You shall certainly not take what belongs to others. Scripture employs the plural <italic>Ye shall not steal</italic>, for the one who sees and is silent is also a thief.</p>
<p>NEITHER SHALL YE DEAL FALSELY. This applies to something which has been deposited with you. The one who knows and does not testify also deals falsely.<sup><xref rid="fn1482">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>NOR LIE. Seek money from one who does not owe you anything.<sup><xref rid="fn1483">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. [AND YE SHALL NOT SWEAR BY MY NAME FALSELY.] This follows <italic>Ye shall not steal</italic>, for the one who is suspected of theft and dealing falsely with regard to a deposit swears.<sup><xref rid="fn1484">45</xref></sup> Scripture employs the plural <italic>ye shall not swear</italic> because it wants to include the one who causes an oath to be taken.<sup><xref rid="fn1485">46</xref></sup> Scripture reads, <italic>so that thou profane the name of thy God</italic> because, as I have noted,<sup><xref rid="fn1486">47</xref></sup> the one who swears falsely denies God.</p>
<p>13. THOU SHALT NOT OPPRESS THY NEIGHBOR. In secret.</p>
<p>NOR ROB HIM. Openly by the use of force.</p>
<p>THE WAGES. <italic>Pe&#x2019;ulat</italic> means the wages of.<sup><xref rid="fn1487">48</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Behold, His reward</italic> (u-fe&#x2019;ulato) <italic>is with Him</italic> (Is. 40:10). It is possible that Scripture is elliptical and that <italic>pe&#x2019;ulat</italic> is short for <italic>sekhar pe&#x2019;ulato</italic> (the wages of his labor). Many say that Scripture speaks of a person hired for the day.<sup><xref rid="fn1488">49</xref></sup> One is not permitted to tell him to work the next morning and in the morning say I will pay you for two days&#x2019; work. The transmitters of tradition<sup><xref rid="fn1489">50</xref></sup> say that our verse<sup><xref rid="fn1490">51</xref></sup> refers to someone hired for a day,<sup><xref rid="fn1491">52</xref></sup> for the sun is not permitted to set on a worker<sup><xref rid="fn1492">53</xref></sup> who is hired for the night.<sup><xref rid="fn1493">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. [THOU SHALT NOT CURSE THE DEAF.] Because you have the power to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn1494">55</xref></sup> You shall likewise not put a stumbling block before the blind.</p>
<p>BUT THOU SHALT FEAR THY GOD. For He is able to punish you and make you deaf and blind.</p>
<p>15. YE SHALL DO NO UNRIGHTEOUSNESS. Scripture speaks of the judges and the witnesses.<sup><xref rid="fn1495">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE PERSON OF THE MIGHTY. Great in money such as Barzillai (II Sam. 19:33).<sup><xref rid="fn1496">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. A TALEBEARER. The word <italic>rakhil</italic> (talebearer) is similar to <italic>rekhulltekh</italic> (thy merchandise) (Ezek. 26:12) and <italic>rokhel</italic> (merchant) in <italic>With all powders of the merchant</italic> (Cant. 3:6). <italic>Rakhil</italic> means a slanderer, for the merchant moves goods. He buys from one person and sells to another. The talebearer reveals to one person what he heard from another person.</p>
<p>NEITHER SHALT THOU STAND IDLY BY THE BLOOD OF THY NEIGHBOR. A person should not join bloodthirsty men.<sup><xref rid="fn1497">58</xref></sup> It is known that many people have been murdered and killed because of slander.<sup><xref rid="fn1498">59</xref></sup> Doeg the Edomite<sup><xref rid="fn1499">60</xref></sup> is proof of this. The meaning of <italic>I am the Lord</italic> is, I see what you do in secret.</p>
<p>17. THOU SHALT NOT HATE THY BROTHER IN THY HEART. This is the reverse of <italic>but thou shalt love thy neighbor</italic> (v. 18). Now all of these commandments are implanted in the heart.<sup><xref rid="fn1500">61</xref></sup> Israel will dwell in the land when they observe them, for the second temple was destroyed because of hatred of one&#x2019;s neighbor for no reason.<sup><xref rid="fn1501">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU SHALT SURELY REBUKE THY NEIGHBOR. Perhaps you suspected him of something which was not so.<sup><xref rid="fn1502">63</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>and not bear sin because of him</italic> is that you be punished because of him.<sup><xref rid="fn1503">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. THOU SHALT NOT TAKE VENGEANCE, NOR BEAR ANY GRUDGE. This is explained in the words of our rabbis of blessed memory.<sup><xref rid="fn1504">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOR. Many are of the opinion that the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>le-re&#x2019;akha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1505">66</xref></sup> (thy neighbor) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1506">67</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>le-avner</italic> (Abner) (II Sam. 3:30).<sup><xref rid="fn1507">68</xref></sup> I believe that <italic>le-re&#x2019;akha</italic> is to be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn1508">69</xref></sup> Its meaning is that one should love that which is good for one&#x2019;s neighbor as he does for himself.<sup><xref rid="fn1509">70</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>I am the Lord</italic> is, I the Lord alone created all of you.</p>
<p>19. [THOU SHALT NOT LET THY CATTLE GENDER WITH A DIVERSE KIND.] The reason Scripture states <italic>Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind</italic> is to warn us. Since you are holy, in that you do not act violently towards your fellow human being, you must also not do anything to an animal which entails changing God&#x2019;s work. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>Ye shall keep My statutes</italic>; that is, each species is to be preserved. A kind is not to interbreed with another kind.</p>
<p>WITH A DIVERSE KIND. <italic>Kilayim</italic> (a diverse kind) means two kinds. I will yet explain the meaning of <italic>kilayim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1510">71</xref></sup> The reason for the law regarding a field and a garment is that they serve as reminders,<sup><xref rid="fn1511">72</xref></sup> for many commandments serve as reminders. Examples of the latter are: the festival of unleavened bread,<sup><xref rid="fn1512">73</xref></sup> Sukkot,<sup><xref rid="fn1513">74</xref></sup> <italic>tzitzit</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1514">75</xref></sup> <italic>shofar</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1515">76</xref></sup> <italic>mezuzah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1516">77</xref></sup> and <italic>tefilin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1517">78</xref></sup> I will hint to you here at a secret. Know that &#x201C;the complete is very complete.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1518">79</xref></sup> Scripture therefore says with regard to Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn1519">80</xref></sup> <italic>and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws</italic> (Gen. 26:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1520">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF TWO KINDS. The transmitters of tradition said that the word <italic>shatnez</italic> (two kinds) is made up of three words.<sup><xref rid="fn1521">82</xref></sup> It may come from a five-letter root.<sup><xref rid="fn1522">83</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>shatnez</italic> is &#x201C;mixed.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1523">84</xref></sup> It is a noun which stands alone in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1524">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. A BONDMAID, DESIGNATED FOR A MAN. The deniers<sup><xref rid="fn1525">86</xref></sup> say that the bondmaid is not a Jewess. However, the correct interpretation according to the plain meaning of the text is that the bondmaid is the one mentioned in <italic>And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant</italic> (Ex. 21:7) and that she is an Israelite. Our verse deals with an instance in which the bondmaid was designated for marriage to her master or his son.<sup><xref rid="fn1526">87</xref></sup> However, she had not undergone the first stage of marriage.<sup><xref rid="fn1527">88</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>nor was freedom given her</italic> is that she is not free until she undergoes the first stage of marriage as is the practice of young ladies. Many believe that <italic>necherefet</italic> means designated. However, I believe that <italic>necherefet</italic> is related to the word <italic>cherpah</italic> (reproach) because she is an unmarried virgin maidservant under the control of a stranger.</p>
<p>REDEEMED. <italic>Hofdeh</italic> (redeemed) is an infinitive in the <italic>hofal</italic>. The meaning of <italic>and not at all redeemed</italic> is that her father or any other family member did not redeem her before she became a young woman.</p>
<p>FREEDOM. The <italic>shuruk</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1528">89</xref></sup> in <italic>chufshah</italic> (freedom) is in place of a furtive <italic>kamatz</italic>, for the individual form of the word is <italic>chofesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1529">90</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>nor was freedom given her</italic>, because it was traditional to write a writ of manumission<sup><xref rid="fn1530">91</xref></sup> if her father sold her for a set time. The transmitters of tradition said that our verse speaks of a woman who was half free and half servant.<sup><xref rid="fn1531">92</xref></sup> What they said is true.</p>
<p>THERE SHALL BE AN INQUISITION. Some say that <italic>bikkoret</italic> (inquisition) means a concubine.<sup><xref rid="fn1532">93</xref></sup> They say that the same applies to the word <italic>biykkrotekha</italic> (among thy favorites) in <italic>Kings&#x2019; daughters are among thy favorites</italic> (Ps. 45:10).<sup><xref rid="fn1533">94</xref></sup> However, they did not explain it correctly, for the meaning of <italic>biykkrotekha</italic> is, among the precious handmaidens.<sup><xref rid="fn1534">95</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1535">96</xref></sup> is missing<sup><xref rid="fn1536">97</xref></sup> because the <italic>bet</italic>, which serves as a preposition, is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1537">98</xref></sup> It is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic> because of the confluence of two mobile <italic>shevas</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1538">99</xref></sup> the first beneath the prefix<sup><xref rid="fn1539">100</xref></sup> and the second beneath the first root letter of the word <italic>yikkrotekha</italic>, which is in the feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn1540">101</xref></sup> The tongue does not have the power to enunciate two mobile <italic>shevas</italic> in succession.<sup><xref rid="fn1541">102</xref></sup> The same is true for the entire language.<sup><xref rid="fn1542">103</xref></sup> There is no exception to this except for the word <italic>mi-yeshene</italic> (that sleep) in <italic>And many of them that sleep in the dust</italic> (Dan. 12:2),<sup><xref rid="fn1543">104</xref></sup> according to the reading of Ben Naphtali.<sup><xref rid="fn1544">105</xref></sup> There are those who say that <italic>bikkoret</italic> is related to the word <italic>yevakker</italic> (seek) in <italic>shall not seek</italic> (Lev. 13:36). The meaning of <italic>bikkoret</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1545">106</xref></sup> is that the matter shall be searched out. The transmitters of tradition say he<sup><xref rid="fn1546">107</xref></sup> incurs the penalty of being lashed with a strap made from the skin of cattle (<italic>bakar</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1547">108</xref></sup> This is true by way of tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn1548">109</xref></sup> The word <italic>bikkoret</italic> is used as a support for the tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn1549">110</xref></sup> This section is placed here because the one who sleeps with the bondwoman oppresses the master of the bondwoman.<sup><xref rid="fn1550">111</xref></sup> He therefore brings a ram as a guilt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1551">112</xref></sup> Furthermore, this type of intercourse can be interpreted midrashically as mixing diverse kinds, namely, a free man and a bondwoman.<sup><xref rid="fn1552">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND HE SHALL BE FORGIVEN.<sup><xref rid="fn1553">114</xref></sup> I will explain this later.<sup><xref rid="fn1554">115</xref></sup> The reason Scripture now discusses forbidden fruit is that Scripture had previously mentioned the seed of the field<sup><xref rid="fn1555">116</xref></sup> and the seed of the woman,<sup><xref rid="fn1556">117</xref></sup> who is likened to the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn1557">118</xref></sup> Scripture therefore<sup><xref rid="fn1558">119</xref></sup> now mentions that which is planted. It is known that fruit which grows before three years have passed is of no value and is harmful to the body. It is like all fish that have no fins and scales that are injurious to the body,0 and like all flesh of birds of prey and unclean animals that harm the wise soul. The intelligent will understand this.<sup><xref rid="fn1559">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. [THEN YE SHALL COUNT THE FRUIT THEREOF AS FORBIDDEN.] The meaning of <italic>ve-areltem et orlato</italic> (then ye shall count as forbidden) is that the fruit is counted as a foreskin<sup><xref rid="fn1560">121</xref></sup> which is harmful and serves no purpose, such as the &#x201C;foreskin&#x201D; of the lips,<sup><xref rid="fn1561">122</xref></sup> the ear,<sup><xref rid="fn1562">123</xref></sup> and the foreskin of the penis. The meaning of <italic>ve-areltem</italic> (then ye shall count) is, you shall consider it as a foreskin. It is also beautifully explained in the Aramaic translation.<sup><xref rid="fn1563">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHALL IT BE AS FORBIDDEN<sup><xref rid="fn1564">125</xref></sup> UNTO YOU.<sup><xref rid="fn1565">126</xref></sup> This explains the meaning of <italic>ve-areltem</italic> (then ye shall count).<sup><xref rid="fn1566">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. SHALL BE HOLY, FOR GIVING PRAISE. For giving praise to the Lord. The <italic>kohen</italic> shall eat it.</p>
<p>[25. THAT IT MAY YIELD UNTO YOU MORE RICHLY THE INCREASE THEREOF.] <italic>That it may yield unto you more richly the increase thereof is</italic> connected to <italic>shall be holy, for giving praise</italic> (v. 24) even though it is some distance from it.<sup><xref rid="fn1567">128</xref></sup> <italic>If he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft</italic> (Ex. 22:2) is similarly connected to <italic>he shall pay five oxen for an ox</italic> (Ex. 21:37). There are many other similar instances. The meaning of <italic>I am the Lord your God</italic> is, I will place a blessing upon the produce.</p>
<p>26. YE SHALL NOT EAT WITH THE BLOOD. This is connected<sup><xref rid="fn1568">129</xref></sup> to what is written above it.<sup><xref rid="fn1569">130</xref></sup> Scripture warned against eating from the fruit of any planted tree until the fifth year. It similarly also prohibited one, if he is in the proximity of the sanctuary, to eat from any permitted flesh unless its blood first be sprinkled on the altar of God. The account of King Saul is a faithful witness to this interpretation, for the ark of the Lord was with Saul, and Scripture explicitly states, &#x201C;Behold, the people are eating with the blood.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1570">131</xref></sup> As I explained,<sup><xref rid="fn1571">132</xref></sup> it was as if the people were sacrificing to the demons, for this was their custom in Egypt. There they were accustomed to sacrifice in the name of the demons. Now this is clear,<sup><xref rid="fn1572">133</xref></sup> since the blood was not poured on the altar in the worship of God. <italic>Neither shall ye practice divination</italic> is connected to <italic>ye shall not eat with the blood</italic> because they used to eat with the blood and go astray after the demons in Egypt, and they used to practice divination and soothsaying in Canaan. The aforementioned is clearly stated in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1573">134</xref></sup> This too was like the <italic>doings of the land of Egypt;</italic>&#x2026;and&#x2026;<italic>the doings of the land of Canaan</italic> (Lev. 18:3). The word <italic>menachesh</italic> means divines. Compare, <italic>I have observed the signs</italic> (nichashti), <italic>And the Lord hath blessed me</italic> (Gen. 30:27). Divinations take many forms. There are types of divination that employs images,<sup><xref rid="fn1574">135</xref></sup> sticks,<sup><xref rid="fn1575">136</xref></sup> actions,<sup><xref rid="fn1576">137</xref></sup> movements,<sup><xref rid="fn1577">138</xref></sup> days,<sup><xref rid="fn1578">139</xref></sup> and hours.<sup><xref rid="fn1579">140</xref></sup></p>
<p>SOOTHSAYING. Some say that the word <italic>te&#x2019;onennu</italic> (soothsaying) is related to the word <italic>anah</italic> (answer). The soothsayer imagines something in his heart and inclines his ear to hear what the speaker will answer.<sup><xref rid="fn1580">141</xref></sup> However, the rule of grammar rejects this interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn1581">142</xref></sup> There are those who say that <italic>te&#x2019;onennu</italic> comes from the word <italic>onah</italic> (time). It is similar to the word <italic>onatah</italic> (her conjugal rights)<sup><xref rid="fn1582">143</xref></sup> in <italic>and her conjugal rights, shall he not diminish</italic> (Ex. 21:10).<sup><xref rid="fn1583">144</xref></sup> However, it appears to me that <italic>te&#x2019;onennu</italic> is related to the word <italic>anan</italic> (cloud), for it is known that the one who practices divination looks at the clouds and observes their forms and their movements. <italic>Te&#x2019;onennu</italic> probably comes from a verb with a doubled root.<sup><xref rid="fn1584">145</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>tesovevu</italic> (you will go round about),<sup><xref rid="fn1585">146</xref></sup> for we find, <italic>And with soothsayers</italic> (onenim) <italic>like the Philistines</italic> (Is. 2:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1586">147</xref></sup> [I note this] for it is possible that <italic>te&#x2019;onennu</italic> is a doubled form.<sup><xref rid="fn1587">148</xref></sup> <italic>Me&#x2019;onen</italic> (one that uses divination) <italic>u-menachesh</italic> (Deut. 18:9) is proof.</p>
<p>[27. YE SHALL NOT ROUND THE CORNERS OF YOUR HEADS.] Scripture states, <italic>Ye shall not round the corners of your heads</italic> as the non-Jewish nations do, so that you will be separated from them. Now since the hair on the head and the beard serve to glorify a person it is unfit to destroy them. Some say that this verse is connected to <italic>Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead</italic> (v. 28), for there are people who destroy the hair on the corner of their heads and also on the corner of their beards for the dead.</p>
<p>28. CUTTINGS. We know the meaning of the corners of the head and of the beard from the words of tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn1588">149</xref></sup> The word <italic>le-nefesh</italic> means for a dead body. It is also so rendered in the Aramaic translation.<sup><xref rid="fn1589">150</xref></sup> This is its true meaning. The <italic>nun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1590">151</xref></sup> does not receive a <italic>dagesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1591">152</xref></sup> in order to simplify enunciation.</p>
<p>IMPRINT ANY MARKS. Some say that this is connected to <italic>Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh</italic>, for there are people who, employing fire, mark their bodies with a recognizable form for the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1592">153</xref></sup> Even today there are those who, while young, mark their faces so that they [may] be recognized.<sup><xref rid="fn1593">154</xref></sup> The word <italic>ka&#x2019;aka</italic> (marks) is doubled.<sup><xref rid="fn1594">155</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>He that spread forth</italic> the <italic>earth and that which cometh out of it</italic> (ve-tze&#x2019;etza&#x2019;ehah)<sup><xref rid="fn1595">156</xref></sup> (Is. 42:5). <italic>Ka&#x2019;aka</italic> is related to the word <italic>ve-hoka</italic> (and hang)<sup><xref rid="fn1596">157</xref></sup> in <italic>and hang them up</italic> (Num. 25:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1597">158</xref></sup> According to the Aramaic translator, it is also an irregular word. He is also correct [in translating <italic>ka&#x2019;aka</italic> as engraved].</p>
<p>29. [PROFANE NOT THY DAUGHTER.] Scripture now mentions <italic>profane not thy daughter</italic> because it earlier stated <italic>Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh</italic> (v. 28). The import of our verse is, your daughter shall not be displayed before the public.<sup><xref rid="fn1598">159</xref></sup> Now the voice of a woman is like her nakedness.<sup><xref rid="fn1599">160</xref></sup> A cutting is certainly so.<sup><xref rid="fn1600">161</xref></sup></p>
<p>LEST THE LAND FALL INTO HARLOTRY. The reference is to the harlotry of the people of the land.<sup><xref rid="fn1601">162</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>when a land sinneth against Me</italic> (Ezek. 14:13).<sup><xref rid="fn1602">163</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. [YE SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS.] Scripture now says, <italic>Ye shall keep My sabbaths</italic>, because it earlier<sup><xref rid="fn1603">164</xref></sup> dealt with the dead, for there is no mourning on the Sabbath. <italic>And reverence My sanctuary</italic> is to be understood as referring to the <italic>kohen gadol;</italic> he shall not act as other mourners do.<sup><xref rid="fn1604">165</xref></sup> There is a similar prohibition upon all the people of the sanctuary.<sup><xref rid="fn1605">166</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>I am the Lord</italic> is, God will punish you if you do not revere the sanctuary and respect it. Scripture similarly next mentions <italic>the ghosts</italic> and <italic>the familiar spirits</italic> (v. 31) because of the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1606">167</xref></sup> It similarly writes in Isaiah <italic>on behalf of the living unto the dead</italic> (Is. 8:19).<sup><xref rid="fn1607">168</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. THE GHOSTS. <italic>Ovot</italic> (ghosts) is related to the word <italic>ovot</italic> (wineskins) in <italic>Like new wine-skins</italic> (Job 32:19), for wineskins are the main instruments in this &#x201C;art.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1608">169</xref></sup></p>
<p>NOR UNTO FAMILIAR SPIRITS. <italic>Yidonim</italic> (familiar spirits) is related to the word <italic>da&#x2019;at</italic> (knowledge). Those who turn to <italic>yidonim</italic> seek to know the future. The empty heads say if there were no truth in the <italic>ovot</italic> (ghosts) and in various magical practices, then Scripture would not have prohibited them. However, I say the reverse. Scripture would not have permitted that which was true. It only prohibited that which is false. <italic>The idols</italic> (elilim)<sup><xref rid="fn1609">170</xref></sup> and <italic>the images</italic> (v. 4) are proof of this. Were it not that I do not want to go on at length, I would have explained the incident of the woman who was an expert in divining by ghosts.<sup><xref rid="fn1610">171</xref></sup> I would have brought unquestionable proof to my explanation.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>Turn ye not</italic> is, do not turn to the one who knows the art.<sup><xref rid="fn1611">172</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>seek them not out</italic> is, do not inquire of them as king Saul did.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>I am the Lord your God</italic> is, you shall not seek except for the Lord alone. Note, Scripture reads, <italic>to be defiled by them</italic>, because the soul of the one who inquires of a ghost or a familiar spirit is defiled, for it does not cleave to the Lord.</p>
<p>32. [THOU SHALT RISE UP BEFORE THE HOARY HEAD.] Scripture mentions the hoary head because it earlier mentioned the dead<sup><xref rid="fn1612">173</xref></sup> and the aged are close to death, for the bodies of the old are considered dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1613">174</xref></sup> Note, our verse refers to all the old and to every hoary head.<sup><xref rid="fn1614">175</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>and thou shalt fear thy God</italic> is, fear the Lord who shall punish you in your old age.<sup><xref rid="fn1615">176</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. AND IF A STRANGER SOUJORN WITH THEE. Scripture mentions the stranger after the old man. It does so to, as it were, to say, as I warned you to respect the old Israelite because he has no strength, I warn you not to wrong the foreigner because you are stronger than he is, or who has no power because he is in your country and subject to you.<sup><xref rid="fn1616">177</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. AND THOU SHALT LOVE HIM AS THYSELF. This has been explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1617">178</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. [YE SHALL DO NO UNRIGHTEOUSNESS.] Scripture states, <italic>Ye shall do no unrighteousness</italic> because it earlier dealt with the stranger. Our verse is similar to <italic>and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him</italic> (Deut. 1:16). You shall similarly not cheat in measurements; that is, you shall not deceive in measuring cubits, for the cubits vary.<sup><xref rid="fn1618">179</xref></sup> It is also possible that the meaning of <italic>in judgment</italic> is according to the known practice of the land.<sup><xref rid="fn1619">180</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. JUST BALANCES, JUST WEIGHT. <italic>Avne tzedek</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1620">181</xref></sup> means just weights.</p>
<p>A JUST EPHAH. For that which is dry.</p>
<p>AND A JUST HIN. For liquid. <italic>A just hin</italic> explains <italic>in measure</italic> (v. 36).</p>
<p>Scripture states, <italic>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt</italic>, because it earlier mentioned <italic>for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt</italic> (v. 34). Therefore, you are obligated to keep My statutes and ordinances in mind and observe them. The meaning of <italic>I am the Lord</italic> is, you shall pursue my statutes which I placed upon you, for they are all righteous.</p>

Ebr.</italic> 38. <italic>Mikra&#x2019;ot Gedolot</italic> reads, <italic>The reason why Scripture states unto all the congregation of the children of Israel is to <span class="underline">include</span> the strangers</italic>. The reading in <italic>Vat. Ebr.</italic> 38 appears correct, for <italic>unto all the congregation of the children of Israel</italic> seems to imply that what follows only applies to the children of Israel. Furthermore, in his comments on Lev. 20:1, I.E. explicitly says that our chapter applies only to the children of Israel. By strangers I.E. means non-Jews living in Israel. See I.E. on Ex. 20:9 (Vol. 2, p. 427).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1441"><sup>2</sup> In our chapter. Our chapter, as I.E. goes on to explain, contains ten precepts which parallel the Decalogue.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1442"><sup>3</sup> <italic>For I the Lord&#x2026;am holy</italic> (Ex. 20:7).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1443"><sup>4</sup> Of the Decalogue. <italic>Ye shall not steal</italic> is parallel to <italic>Thou shalt not steal</italic> (Ex. 20:13). <italic>Neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another</italic> is parallel to <italic>Thou shalt not bear false witness</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.). <italic>Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor</italic> is parallel to <italic>Thou shalt not covet</italic> (Ex. 20:14).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1444"><sup>5</sup> Each and every precept is an independent statement. It is not connected to what comes before nor to what follows. See I.E. on Ex. 21:2 (Vol. 2, p. 448).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1445"><sup>6</sup> Hebrew, <italic>lakhen</italic> (literally, therefore). However, I.E. occasionally uses the term <italic>lakhen</italic> in the sense of however (Filwarg). It is also possible that we should read <italic>akeh</italic> rather than <italic>lakhen</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1446"><sup>7</sup> If we try, we can find a reason that the commandments follow each other.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1447"><sup>8</sup> Ex. 20:12 reads, <italic>Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long</italic>. The implication is that one who disrespects his parents will suffer premature death. According to I.E. the meaning of <italic>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and father</italic> is, be afraid of disrespecting your parents, for if you dishonor them you will suffer dire consequences. Our verse is thus parallel to Ex. 20:12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1448"><sup>9</sup> According to I.E. our verse is directed at a child. Hence it mentions the mother first. When the Bible mentions the father first (Ex. 20:12) it is directed at an adult.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1449"><sup>10</sup> According to I.E. a father is obligated to prevent his child from doing work on the Sabbath. See I.E. on Ex. 20:8 (Vol. 2, p. 426).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1450"><sup>11</sup> By resting on the Sabbath the child will come to know that there is a God in the world. Hence our verse concludes with <italic>I am the Lord your God</italic>. I.E. speaks of a progression. The child learns to recognize its mother, then its father, and then God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1451"><sup>12</sup> According to the <italic>Sifra</italic> fearing one&#x2019;s father refers to sitting in his place, speaking in his turn, and contradicting him. See <italic>Sifra</italic> on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1452"><sup>13</sup> Elsewhere the Torah uses the term <italic>ish ish</italic>. See Lev. 17:3,10,13; Lev. 15:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1453"><sup>14</sup> <italic>Ish</italic> is in the singular. Thus the verb governing it should be in the singular. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1454"><sup>15</sup> Those who observe the child violating the Sabbath have to correct him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1455"><sup>16</sup> Do not even think about looking at idols.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1464"><sup>25</sup> According to I.E. the meaning of Prov. 28:1 is, each one of the righteous is secure as a young lion. See I.E. on Gen. 49:22 (Vol. 1, p. 44, notes 156,157).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1474"><sup>35</sup> <italic>Olel</italic> means a young child or a young plant. <italic>Te&#x2019;olel</italic> thus appears to mean to plant a young shoot. However, it has the opposite meaning. It means to harvest a young plant. Thus a word coming from a root meaning a young plant can, in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>, have the opposite meaning, i.e., to destroy a young plant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1475"><sup>36</sup> <italic>Shereshkha</italic> comes from the stem meaning root. Thus the word might be taken to mean to root. However, it has the opposite meaning in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1476"><sup>37</sup> <italic>Mesa&#x2019;ef</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>se&#x2019;if</italic> (a branch). However, in the <italic>p&#x2019;iel</italic> it means to cut the branches.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1477"><sup>38</sup> The word <italic>perat</italic> is often used in Rabbinic tradition and there has the meaning of that which is singled out. See <italic>Sotah</italic> 37b; <italic>Chagigah</italic> 6a. Thus <italic>peret</italic> means the single grapes that fall off the vine. See <italic>Pe&#x2019;ah</italic> 6:5, <italic>Two grapes are peret; three are not peret</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1478"><sup>39</sup> According to I.E. <italic>ha-poretim&#x2026;al ha-navel</italic> means those that pluck on each one of the strings of the psaltery.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1482"><sup>43</sup> Hence the plural, &#x201C;ye.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1483"><sup>44</sup> The verse deals with appropriating someone else&#x2019;s property. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1487"><sup>48</sup> The word <italic>pe&#x2019;ulat</italic> literally means labor of. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1488"><sup>49</sup> According to this opinion a person hired for the day must be paid as soon as the day is over.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 20</title>
<p>1. [AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING.] Scripture earlier<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> stated, <italic>unto all the congregation&#x2026;of Israel</italic>, because the commandments, which followed, are obligatory upon all of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1622">2</xref></sup> Strangers have no part in them.<sup><xref rid="fn1623">3</xref></sup> Scripture now begins to mention the punishment for harlotry, which will befall anyone who lives in the Land of Israel, be he native born<sup><xref rid="fn1624">4</xref></sup> or resident alien.<sup><xref rid="fn1625">5</xref></sup> It begins with the most severe of them all, namely, with the individual who gives of his seed to Molech, that is, the one who has intercourse with a woman who worships idols.<sup><xref rid="fn1626">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>the people of the land</italic> is, the people of the land wherein the culprit resides, be he a native or a resident stranger.<sup><xref rid="fn1627">7</xref></sup> This<sup><xref rid="fn1628">8</xref></sup> applies to one who publicly offers his offspring to Molach.</p>
<p>3. I ALSO WILL SET MY FACE AGAINST THAT MAN. If the sin was committed secretly.<sup><xref rid="fn1629">9</xref></sup> Others say that the reference<sup><xref rid="fn1630">10</xref></sup> is to the extirpation of the culprit&#x2019;s seed.</p>
<p>TO DEFILE MY SANCTUARY. Which is in the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>AND TO PROFANE MY HOLY NAME. For nations will hear.<sup><xref rid="fn1631">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>It would have appeared to us that <italic>ba-even</italic> (with stones)<sup><xref rid="fn1632">12</xref></sup> (v. 2) is a collective noun.<sup><xref rid="fn1633">13</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And I have oxen</italic> (shor),<sup><xref rid="fn1634">14</xref></sup> <italic>and asses</italic> (chamor)<sup><xref rid="fn1635">15</xref></sup> (Gen. 32:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1636">16</xref></sup> However, the words of tradition are correct.<sup><xref rid="fn1637">17</xref></sup> They are true. Rabbi Jonah the Spanish grammarian who rests in paradise says that <italic>and against his family</italic> (v. 5) means all those like him.<sup><xref rid="fn1638">18</xref></sup> Who brought us into this trouble?<sup><xref rid="fn1639">19</xref></sup> Our verse is to be taken literally. The people of the land<sup><xref rid="fn1640">20</xref></sup> will hide their eyes because they are of his family.<sup><xref rid="fn1641">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. [AND ALL THAT GO ASTRAY AFTER HIM.] This means others will go astray if the culprit is not put to death.</p>
<p>6. AND THE SOUL THAT TURNETH UNTO THE GHOSTS. This means as I will cut off the one who gives from his seed to Molech in secret or in public if the people of the land do not kill him, so will I cut off the one who strays from me and turns to ghosts. We find the term <italic>nefashim</italic> (souls) (Ezek. 20:13) in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1642">22</xref></sup> We also find <italic>all the souls</italic> (nefesh) <italic>were fourteen</italic> (arba&#x2019;ah asar)<sup><xref rid="fn1643">23</xref></sup> (Gen. 46:22). We similarly read,<sup><xref rid="fn1644">24</xref></sup> <italic>and will cut him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1645">25</xref></sup> (oto) <italic>off</italic>.</p>
<p>7. SANCTIFY YOURSELVES THEREFORE, AND BE YE HOLY; FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD. <italic>Ki ani Adonai Elohekhem</italic> (for I am the Lord your God) means for I the Lord your God am holy. I have given you statutes to observe in order to sanctify you.<sup><xref rid="fn1646">26</xref></sup> Scripture has already mentioned this.<sup><xref rid="fn1647">27</xref></sup> It repeats this command so as to include the strangers residing among Israel, for they too are obligated to be holy so that they may continue to be allowed to dwell in a holy land. Scripture begins the list of punishments at the beginning of the section<sup><xref rid="fn1648">28</xref></sup> with the person who curses his father in the same manner that Scripture earlier starts with <italic>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</italic> (Lev. 19:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1649">29</xref></sup> Our verse mentions the father before the mother out of respect for the father. It is unlike <italic>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1650">30</xref></sup> for he is not put to death if he has not reached the age of <italic>mitzvah</italic> observance.<sup><xref rid="fn1651">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. FOR WHATSOEVER MAN THERE BE THAT CURSETH HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH.<sup><xref rid="fn1652">32</xref></sup> The phrase <italic>asher yekallel</italic> (that curseth) is to be read as if written twice. Our verse is to be read as if written, &#x201C;and whoever curses his mother.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1653">33</xref></sup> <italic>He hath cursed his father or his mother</italic> is another way of saying he has committed a great abomination.</p>
<p>HIS BLOOD SHALL BE UPON HIM. Compare, <italic>his blood shall be upon his head</italic> (Josh. 2:19).<sup><xref rid="fn1654">34</xref></sup> The blood of those who are stoned and strangled is upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn1655">35</xref></sup> I will now state a general rule concerning all executions. We cannot derive the manner of execution from Scripture. Hence we need the tradition of our fathers.<sup><xref rid="fn1656">36</xref></sup> Scripture similarly does not state at what age one is obligated to observe the commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn1657">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. [AND THE MAN THAT COMMITTETH ADULTERY WITH ANOTHER MAN&#x2019;S WIFE.] Scripture next mentions, <italic>and the man that committeth adultery with another man&#x2019;s wife</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1658">38</xref></sup> for she was prohibited.<sup><xref rid="fn1659">39</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor&#x2019;s wife</italic> is similar to <italic>he hath cursed his father or his mother</italic> (v. 9). It means he committed an evil act.</p>
<p>AND THE ADULTERESS. Women who are raped would not be so termed.<sup><xref rid="fn1660">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. HE HATH UNCOVERED HIS FATHER&#x2019;S NAKEDNESS. He has committed a great sin.</p>
<p>12. HIS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW. <italic>Kallato</italic> means his daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>CORRUPTION. I have previously explained the meaning of <italic>tevel</italic> (corruption).<sup><xref rid="fn1661">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. BOTH OF THEM HAVE COMMITTED ABOMINATION. If the one who was penetrated was not raped.</p>
<p>14. AND IF A MAN TAKE WITH HIS WIFE ALSO HER MOTHER, IT IS WICKEDNESS. <italic>Zimmah</italic> (wickedness) means a promiscuous thought.<sup><xref rid="fn1662">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY. This one or that one. If the mother<sup><xref rid="fn1663">43</xref></sup> was his wife, then the daughter is burned.<sup><xref rid="fn1664">44</xref></sup> The same is true in the reverse.</p>
<p>15. AND YE SHALL SLAY THE BEAST. So that it not cause another to sin.<sup><xref rid="fn1665">45</xref></sup> Others say, to hide the shame.<sup><xref rid="fn1666">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND LIE DOWN THERETO. <italic>Le-rivah</italic> (and lie down thereto) is an infinitive even though it is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1667">47</xref></sup> for the forms of the infinitive change. Compare, <italic>be-shivri</italic> (when I break) (Lev. 26:26).<sup><xref rid="fn1668">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND IF A MAN SHALL TAKE HIS SISTER, HIS FATHER&#x2019;S DAUGHTER. In a place where he is unknown and afterwards the facts become known.<sup><xref rid="fn1669">49</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>and see</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1670">50</xref></sup> <italic>her nakedness</italic> is, or see her nakedness.<sup><xref rid="fn1671">51</xref></sup> It is like <italic>he hath cursed his father or his mother</italic> (v. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn1672">52</xref></sup> See means uncover. The meaning of <italic>and she see his nakedness</italic> is that they both agreed to this.</p>
<p>IT IS A SHAMEFUL THING. The word <italic>chesed</italic> (shameful thing) is related to <italic>yechassedkha</italic> (revile thee) in <italic>Lest he that heareth revile thee</italic> (Prov. 25:9). <italic>Chesed hu</italic> (it is a shameful thing) means it is an inflated act of harlotry.<sup><xref rid="fn1673">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>HE HATH UNCOVERED HIS SISTER&#x2019;S NAKEDNESS. Employing force.<sup><xref rid="fn1674">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>HE SHALL BEAR HIS INIQUITY. He alone shall bear his iniquity. The reason scripture mentions these things<sup><xref rid="fn1675">55</xref></sup> regarding the sister is that they grew up in one house and are young people who play. The brother is always alone with his sister. Scripture does not mention the punishment for intercourse with the daughter of one&#x2019;s son or the daughter of one&#x2019;s daughter, for it relied on the oral Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1676">56</xref></sup> It is possible that they are not mentioned because of the father&#x2019;s lack of desire,<sup><xref rid="fn1677">57</xref></sup> for he is advanced in years when he has a mature daughter. It is for this reason that Scripture does not mention the mother of one&#x2019;s father and the mother of one&#x2019;s mother, for they are aged.<sup><xref rid="fn1678">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. SICKNESS. She is ill because of her blood.<sup><xref rid="fn1679">59</xref></sup> <italic>And shall uncover her nakedness</italic> means that he committed a great abomination. The meaning of <italic>and she hath uncovered</italic> is that she willingly uncovered, for if she was forced to have intercourse the man alone is cut off.</p>
<p>19. AND&#x2026;THE NAKEDNESS OF THY MOTHER&#x2019;S SISTER. Its meaning is, I have previously<sup><xref rid="fn1680">60</xref></sup> warned you not to uncover the nakedness of thy mother&#x2019;s sister.<sup><xref rid="fn1681">61</xref></sup> Now the one who uncovers the nakedness<sup><xref rid="fn1682">62</xref></sup> has made naked his near kin.<sup><xref rid="fn1683">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEY SHALL BEAR THEIR INIQUITY. If they willingly acted thus. Scripture does not mention the punishment for having intercourse with the sister of one&#x2019;s father. It also does not even hint at the punishment for taking two sisters.<sup><xref rid="fn1684">64</xref></sup> The intelligent will understand why.<sup><xref rid="fn1685">65</xref></sup> The words of tradition are also true.<sup><xref rid="fn1686">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. WITH HIS UNCLE&#x2019;S WIFE. <italic>Dodato</italic> refers to his uncle&#x2019;s wife.<sup><xref rid="fn1687">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEY SHALL DIE CHILDLESS. The Sadducees<sup><xref rid="fn1688">68</xref></sup> say that <italic>aririm</italic> (childless) means naked and that the meaning of <italic>yamutu</italic> (they shall die) is, they shall be put to death.<sup><xref rid="fn1689">69</xref></sup> They did not speak the truth. The correct interpretation is found in the words of the Aramaic translator,<sup><xref rid="fn1690">70</xref></sup> for <italic>aririm</italic> is similar to <italic>ariri</italic> (childless) in <italic>I go hence childless</italic> (ariri) (Gen. 15:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1691">71</xref></sup> I have previously explained <italic>Write ye this man childless</italic> (ariri) (Jer. 22:30).<sup><xref rid="fn1692">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>[21. IT IS IMPURITY.] Scripture employs the term <italic>niddah</italic> (impurity) with regard to a brother&#x2019;s wife. The meaning of <italic>niddah hiy</italic> (it is impurity)<sup><xref rid="fn1693">73</xref></sup> is, it is fitting for him to distance himself from her.<sup><xref rid="fn1694">74</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>Your brethren that hate you, that cast you out</italic> (menaddekhem)&#x2026;<italic>have said</italic> (Is. 66:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1695">75</xref></sup> Note, there is no mention of <italic>niddah</italic> in all of the prohibited sexual partners<sup><xref rid="fn1696">76</xref></sup> except with regard to a brother&#x2019;s wife. A <italic>niddah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1697">77</xref></sup> is prohibited.<sup><xref rid="fn1698">78</xref></sup> However, a time comes when she is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn1699">79</xref></sup> This possibility,<sup><xref rid="fn1700">80</xref></sup> as I will explain in the section <italic>If brethren dwell together</italic> (Deut. 25:5), also arises in the case of a brother&#x2019;s wife. My reply to those who say,<sup><xref rid="fn1701">81</xref></sup> as it is prohibited to marry the sister of the father (v. 19) so it is prohibited for a woman to marry her uncle<sup><xref rid="fn1702">82</xref></sup> is: this is not the way of Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1703">83</xref></sup> It is the males who are dominant<sup><xref rid="fn1704">84</xref></sup> with regard to the prohibited sexual practices.<sup><xref rid="fn1705">85</xref></sup> No one dominates the male.<sup><xref rid="fn1706">86</xref></sup> Let those who accept the faulty logic of those who offer the above interpretation<sup><xref rid="fn1707">87</xref></sup> show us why we should not accept the testimony of two women.<sup><xref rid="fn1708">88</xref></sup> If they<sup><xref rid="fn1709">89</xref></sup> argue from the laws of evaluation<sup><xref rid="fn1710">90</xref></sup> then four women should be equal to two male witnesses. We therefore need tradition.</p>
<p>22. YE SHALL THEREFORE KEEP ALL MY STATUTES. Not to violate the laws regarding these prohibited sexual practices.</p>
<p>AND ALL MINE ORDINANCES. The laws governing the punishment of those who engage in prohibited sexual practices.</p>
<p>[VOMIT YOU OUT.] I will explain this in the Torah portion <italic>Va-Yelech</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1711">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND THEREFORE I ABHORRED THEM. This was stated metaphorically.<sup><xref rid="fn1712">92</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>and His soul were grieved</italic> (Jud. 10:16). The meaning of <italic>a land flowing with milk and honey</italic> (v. 24) is, there is no land like it.</p>
<p>24. WHO HAVE SET YOU APART FROM THE PEOPLES. With these statutes.<sup><xref rid="fn1713">93</xref></sup> Furthermore, <italic>Ye shall&#x2026;separate between the clean beast&#x2026;</italic>(v. 25).<sup><xref rid="fn1714">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>[25. THE CLEAN.] The ten mentioned beasts.<sup><xref rid="fn1715">95</xref></sup> All the others are unclean. <italic>The unclean fowl</italic> means the unclean fowl which are mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1716">96</xref></sup> All others are clean. The meaning of <italic>to hold unclean</italic> is that you shall know in your mind and in your speech<sup><xref rid="fn1717">97</xref></sup> that it is unclean. Similarly, <italic>ye shall have in detestation among the fowls</italic> (Lev. 11:13).<sup><xref rid="fn1718">98</xref></sup> A resident alien<sup><xref rid="fn1719">99</xref></sup> shall therefore not eat that which is unclean in the clean land. He shall dwell in the land on this condition.<sup><xref rid="fn1720">100</xref></sup> If you keep all that I command you, you will then be holy. You are obligated to follow Me,<sup><xref rid="fn1721">101</xref></sup> <italic>for I the Lord am holy</italic>.</p>
<p>[27. A MAN ALSO OR A WOMAN.] The reason Scripture states <italic>A man also or a woman that divineth by a ghost or a familiar spirit, shall surely be put to death</italic> is that the Torah earlier had said concerning ghosts and familiar spirits, <italic>seek them not out to be defiled by them</italic> (Lev. 19:31). Scripture now says, be holy and put to death the one who defiles himself with a ghost or a familiar spirit. Previously it did not mention the punishment for publicly turning to a ghost. Scripture mentions <italic>woman</italic>, for this art is mostly practiced by women. Similarly, <italic>Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live</italic> (Ex. 22:17).<sup><xref rid="fn1722">102</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1621"><sup>1</sup> Lev. 19:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1622"><sup>2</sup> That is, only upon Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1623"><sup>3</sup> Non-Jews do not share these laws with Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1624"><sup>4</sup> An Israelite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1625"><sup>5</sup> A non-Jew living in Israel. Hence our chapter explicitly notes that what follows applies to both an Israelite and a non-Israelite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1626"><sup>6</sup> This interpretation is rejected by the Mishnah. See <italic>Megillah</italic> 4:9: &#x201C;If a man says <italic>And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to set them apart to Molech</italic> (Lev. 18:21) means, and thou shalt not give of thy seed to make it pass to heathendom, they put him to silence with a rebuke.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1627"><sup>7</sup> The term &#x201C;the land&#x201D; indicates a specific land. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1628"><sup>8</sup> Stoning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1629"><sup>9</sup> For if the sin is committed in public, the culprit is executed (v. 2).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1630"><sup>10</sup> <italic>I also will set my face against that man</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1635"><sup>15</sup> Literally, an ass.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1636"><sup>16</sup> Literally, and I have an ox and an ass.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1637"><sup>17</sup> The rabbis took <italic>ba-even</italic> literally. According to the Midrash the culprit was first stoned by one stone. See <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 6:4, &#x201C;The place of stoning was twice the height of a man. One of the witnesses knocked him down&#x2026;If he died that sufficed; but if not, the second witness took a stone and dropped it on his heart. If he died that sufficed; but if not, he was stoned by all Israel.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1638"><sup>18</sup> Rabbi Jonah was bothered by God&#x2019;s threatening the family of the sinner with punishment when they apparently did not commit any sin.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1640"><sup>20</sup> Spoken of in verse 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1641"><sup>21</sup> In other words, the family spoken of in our verse is to be identified with the earlier mentioned (v. 4) people of the land who hid their eyes from the sinner</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1642"><sup>22</sup> <italic>Nefashim</italic> (souls) is masculine. <italic>Nefesh</italic> (soul) is usually feminine. However, our verse reads, <italic>ve-hikhratti oto</italic> (and will cut him [the soul] off). It thus treats <italic>nefesh</italic> as masculine. I.E. therefore points out that <italic>nefesh</italic> is sometimes treated as a masculine in Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1643"><sup>23</sup> <italic>Arba&#x2019;ah asar</italic> (fourteen) is masculine. Thus Gen. 46:22 treats <italic>nefesh</italic> as masculine.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1648"><sup>28</sup> That is, the list of punishments for the sins following verse 7, which reads, <italic>Sanctify yourselves therefore and be holy</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1649"><sup>29</sup> The preceding verse is, <italic>Ye shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy</italic> (Lev. 19:2).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1650"><sup>30</sup> Where the mother is placed before the father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1651"><sup>31</sup> Hence our verse speaks of an adult. Scripture thus places the father before the mother. However, Lev. 19:3 speaks of a minor. Hence it places mother before father. See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Lev. 19:3: &#x201C;The reason Scripture mentions the mother before the father is that a child first recognizes only its mother. Then it recognizes its father.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1652"><sup>32</sup> Literally, For whatsoever man there be that curses his father and his mother shall surely be put to death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1653"><sup>33</sup> Our verse should be interpreted as if written: For whatsoever man there be that curses his father or that curses his mother shall surely be put to death.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1659"><sup>39</sup> Scripture earlier prohibited adultery (Lev. 18:20). However, Lev. 18:20 does not describe the punishment for this sin. Our verse does. The prohibition against adultery is not stated in our verse, for it was stated in Lev. 18:20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1660"><sup>40</sup> A married woman who is raped is not executed, for a raped woman is not an adulteress.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1661"><sup>41</sup> See I.E. on Lev. 18:23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1662"><sup>42</sup> Such an act is the result of promiscuous thinking or planning. The word <italic>zimmah</italic> comes from the Hebrew root <italic>zayin, mem, mem</italic> which means to plan, devise, purpose. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1663"><sup>43</sup> Of the woman with whom he had intercourse.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1700"><sup>80</sup> The possibility of permissibility.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1701"><sup>81</sup> The reference is to the Karaites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1702"><sup>82</sup> The Karaites believe that it is prohibited for a woman to marry the brother of her father. They argue that there is no difference between a man taking his aunt, which is explicitly prohibited by Scripture (v. 19), and a woman marrying her uncle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1703"><sup>83</sup> Scripture does not legislate prohibitions of choosing sexual partners upon women, for it is the man who does the &#x201C;taking&#x201D; (Weiser). Or, the male plays the dominant role in the marriage. Thus it is proper to dominate a niece. However, it is unseemly for a nephew to dominate the sister of his father or his mother (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1704"><sup>84</sup> See Gen. 3:16, <italic>And he</italic> (your husband) <italic>shall rule over thee</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1705"><sup>85</sup> It is the male who does the taking. If Scripture had wanted to prohibit a man from marrying the daughter of his brother it would have said so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1706"><sup>86</sup> No female legally dominates a male.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1707"><sup>87</sup> That as it is prohibited to marry the sister of the father, so it is prohibited for a woman to marry her uncle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1708"><sup>88</sup> If we argue that as males may not marry their aunts so nieces may not marry their uncles, then we are in effect saying that what applies to males also applies to females. Applying this logic we should argue that as males are fit to be witnesses so are females. However, the Karaites like the Rabbinites do not accept the testimony of women.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1709"><sup>89</sup> The Karaites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1710"><sup>90</sup> That women are inferior to men and therefore cannot serve as witnesses. According to Lev. 27:3 a male&#x2019;s valuation is 50 shekels and a female&#x2019;s 30.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 21</title>
<h1>EMOR</h1>
<p>1. SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS. After charging the Israelites, and the sons of Aaron who are included among them, to be holy,<sup><xref rid="fn1723">1</xref></sup> the Lord told the sons of Aaron that they are commanded to keep themselves from other things, for they are the ministers of God. It is possible that <italic>speak unto the priests</italic> refers to the section which is mentioned above,<sup><xref rid="fn1724">2</xref></sup> for the Torah is in the hands of the <italic>kohanim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1725">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SAY UNTO THEM. This refers to the commandments which they alone are obligated to keep.<sup><xref rid="fn1726">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR THE DEAD. <italic>Le-nefesh</italic> (for the dead) refers to the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1727">5</xref></sup> The word <italic>yittamma</italic> (defile) is a <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic>. The <italic>tet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1728">6</xref></sup> receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> because the <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1729">7</xref></sup> is, swallowed.<sup><xref rid="fn1730">8</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>be-amav</italic> (among his people) is among all of Israel, who are his people.<sup><xref rid="fn1731">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. EXCEPT FOR HIS KIN. It had appeared to us that the meaning of <italic>she&#x2019;ero</italic> (His kin) is similar to <italic>she&#x2019;er</italic> (near of kin) in <italic>None of you&#x2026;to any that is near of kin to him</italic> (Lev. 18:6). In other words, <italic>she&#x2019;ero</italic> is a general term,<sup><xref rid="fn1732">10</xref></sup> with the details <italic>for his mother, and for his father</italic> following. The meaning of <italic>ba&#x2019;al be-amav</italic> (a chief man among his people) (v. 4) is that a husband<sup><xref rid="fn1733">11</xref></sup> shall not defile himself for his wife. However, since we saw that our teachers transmitted to us the law that a <italic>kohen</italic> is permitted to defile himself for his wife,<sup><xref rid="fn1734">12</xref></sup> the first interpretation falls away. They employed the word <italic>she&#x2019;er</italic> as a support,<sup><xref rid="fn1735">13</xref></sup> as I explained in my comments on the phrase <italic>unto a foreign people</italic> (Ex. 21:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1736">14</xref></sup> The rabbis said that the meaning of <italic>ba&#x2019;al</italic> is, a chief who rules over the people, as in <italic>the owner thereof</italic> (be-alav) <italic>not being with it</italic> (Ex. 22:13).<sup><xref rid="fn1737">15</xref></sup> The reason Scripture mentions the mother of the <italic>kohen</italic> before the father is that in most cases the male lives longer than the female.<sup><xref rid="fn1738">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. THAT IS NEAR UNTO HIM. In that she is his sister from his father and his mother.<sup><xref rid="fn1739">17</xref></sup> Now, aside from those mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn1740">18</xref></sup> a chief (v. 4) shall not defile himself for any of his people, be they <italic>kohanim</italic> or Israelites.</p>
<p>[4.] TO PROFANE HIMSELF. The <italic>lamed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1741">19</xref></sup> has a <italic>dagesh</italic> in it to compensate for the missing other <italic>lamed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1742">20</xref></sup> <italic>Le-hechallo</italic> (to profane himself) is an infinitive in the <italic>nifal</italic>.</p>
<p>5. THEY SHALL NOT MAKE BALDNESS UPON THEIR HEAD. Over the dead.</p>
<p>THE CORNERS OF THEIR BEARD. Over the dead, as is the practice in places in the land of the Chaldeans. The meaning of the <italic>corners of thy beard</italic> (Lev. 19:27) is thus clarified.<sup><xref rid="fn1743">21</xref></sup> <italic>Saratet</italic> (cuttings) means even one cut.<sup><xref rid="fn1744">22</xref></sup> Israel has already been cautioned not to do these things.<sup><xref rid="fn1745">23</xref></sup> The reason Scripture warns the <italic>kohanim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1746">24</xref></sup> about this is that one who has a bald head, or whose beard has been shorn, or whose flesh is cut shall not serve before the Lord.</p>
<p>6. AND NOT PROFANE THE NAME OF GOD. The reason being, for <italic>the offerings made by fire&#x2026;they do offer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1747">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. WOMAN THAT IS A HARLOT. If we follow the plain meaning of the text then we do not find in all of Scripture the word <italic>zonah</italic> (harlot) to have any but its literal meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn1748">26</xref></sup> The meaning of and <italic>have given a boy for a harlot</italic> (zonah) (Joel 4:3) is also as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1749">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR PROFANED. A woman who is not known as a harlot.<sup><xref rid="fn1750">28</xref></sup> According to the plain meaning, it would appear from the words of Ezekiel<sup><xref rid="fn1751">29</xref></sup> that the widow of a <italic>kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1752">30</xref></sup> is permitted to marry other <italic>kohanim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1753">31</xref></sup> The words of tradition<sup><xref rid="fn1754">32</xref></sup> are thus true.<sup><xref rid="fn1755">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. THOU SHALT SANCTIFY HIM THEREFORE. In mind<sup><xref rid="fn1756">34</xref></sup> and in speech.</p>
<p>THE BREAD<sup><xref rid="fn1757">35</xref></sup> OF THY GOD. Food<sup><xref rid="fn1758">36</xref></sup> which is offered to God.</p>
<p>I THE LORD, WHO SANCTIFY YOU.<sup><xref rid="fn1759">37</xref></sup> All of you.</p>
<p>9. IF SHE PROFANE HERSELF BY PLAYING THE HARLOT. Many believe that <italic>techel</italic> (profane) is related to <italic>techillah</italic> (beginning).<sup><xref rid="fn1760">38</xref></sup> However, I believe that it is related to the word <italic>chillul</italic> (profane) but it is a <italic>hifil</italic>. Compare, <italic>he shall not break</italic> (yachel)<sup><xref rid="fn1761">39</xref></sup> <italic>his word</italic> (Num. 30:3). According to both interpretations the word comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn1762">40</xref></sup> However, it is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn1763">41</xref></sup> It is possible that the word <italic>hechel</italic> (profaned) (Ezek. 20:9) and the word <italic>techel</italic> are both irregular in that the <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1764">42</xref></sup> is vocalized with a <italic>tzereh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1765">43</xref></sup> so that it not is confused in meaning with <italic>techillah</italic> (beginning).<sup><xref rid="fn1766">44</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>hechel</italic> (profaned)<sup><xref rid="fn1767">45</xref></sup> in <italic>that it should not be profaned</italic> (Ezek. 20:9).</p>
<p>AND THE DAUGHTER OF ANY PRIEST&#x2026;SHE SHALL BE BURNT WITH FIRE. If she profaned herself by harlotry, for she profaned the honor of her father.</p>
<p>SHE SHALL BE BURNT WITH FIRE. Whether she is either married or betrothed.<sup><xref rid="fn1768">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. THE GARMENTS. The reference is to the holy garments.</p>
<p>SHALL NOT LET THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD GO LOOSE, NOR REND HIS CLOTHES. We learn from this verse what our sages transmitted regarding the laws of mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn1769">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. NEITHER SHALL HE GO IN TO ANY DEAD BODY. <italic>Nafshot met</italic> is to be read as if written <italic>nafshot guf met</italic> (dead body). The word <italic>guf</italic> (body)<sup><xref rid="fn1770">48</xref></sup> is missing, for <italic>met</italic> (dead) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn1771">49</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>But the rich answers impudent</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1772">50</xref></sup> (Prov. 18:23)<sup><xref rid="fn1773">51</xref></sup> and <italic>and their food plenteous</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1774">52</xref></sup> (Hab. 1:16),<sup><xref rid="fn1775">53</xref></sup> where the word lamb is missing. The meaning of <italic>he shall</italic> [not] <italic>go in</italic> is, he shall not go into a tent or a house where the dead body is located. The meaning of <italic>for his father, or his mother</italic> is, for his father and mother, whom he is obligated to respect while they live and after their death. The <italic>kohen gadol</italic> may certainly not defile himself over his brother or his son.<sup><xref rid="fn1776">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. NEITHER SHALL HE GO OUT OF THE SANCTUARY. After the dead, so said the transmitters of tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn1777">55</xref></sup> What they said is correct. Some say that the reference is to the seven days of consecration. However, this cannot be so, for Scripture has already stated, <italic>and</italic> [the kohen] <italic>that is consecrated</italic> (v. 10).<sup><xref rid="fn1778">56</xref></sup> It is also possible that the meaning of our verse is that the <italic>kohen gadol</italic> shall not go out of the sanctuary except for the purpose of observing a precept.</p>
<p>13. IN HER VIRGINITY. There are nouns in Hebrew that never come in the singular. Compare, <italic>ne&#x2019;urim</italic> (youth), <italic>zekunim</italic> (old age), <italic>alumim</italic> (youth), and <italic>betulim</italic> (virginity). There are other words which never come in the plural, i.e., <italic>taf</italic> (children), <italic>shekhem</italic> (shoulder), <italic>zahav</italic> (gold), and <italic>barzel</italic> (iron).</p>
<p>14. A WIDOW, OR ONE DIVORCED. Any woman widowed or divorced from a <italic>kohen</italic> or an Israelite.</p>
<p>OR A PROFANED WOMAN, OR A HARLOT. The connective <italic>vav</italic> before the word <italic>zonah</italic> (harlot) is missing.<sup><xref rid="fn1779">57</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>The sun moon</italic> (shemesh yare&#x2019;ach) <italic>stand still in their habitation</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1780">58</xref></sup> (Hab. 3:11).<sup><xref rid="fn1781">59</xref></sup> The reason Scripture reads <italic>but a virgin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1782">60</xref></sup> is that it wants to add <italic>of his own people</italic>, for a captive virgin<sup><xref rid="fn1783">61</xref></sup> and a convert<sup><xref rid="fn1784">62</xref></sup> are prohibited to him.</p>
<p>15. AND HE SHALL NOT PROFANE HIS SEED. By taking a widow or a divorced woman in secret. <italic>These shall he not take</italic> (v. 14) means he shall not publicly take any of these women.<sup><xref rid="fn1785">63</xref></sup> After Scripture mentions the sanctity of the <italic>kohanim</italic> it begins to list the blemishes.<sup><xref rid="fn1786">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THE BREAD OF HIS GOD. The reference is to the sacrifices offered on the altar. The <italic>kohanim</italic> spoken of in our verse refer to common priests. Scripture therefore states anyone who is of the seed of Aaron the <italic>kohen</italic>.</p>
<p>18. MAIMED. <italic>Charum</italic> (maimed) is the reverse of <italic>saru&#x2019;a</italic> (too long). Note, <italic>charum</italic> is related to the word <italic>cherem</italic> (destruction).<sup><xref rid="fn1787">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>TOO LONG. <italic>Saru&#x2019;a</italic> (too long) is related to the word <italic>me-histare&#x2019;a</italic> (to stretch himself) (Is. 29:20).</p>
<p>20. OR CROOK-BACKED. The word <italic>gibben</italic> (crook-backed) is most probably related to the word <italic>gavnunnim</italic> (peaks) in <italic>ye mountains of peaks</italic> (Ps. 68:17).<sup><xref rid="fn1788">66</xref></sup> The <italic>nun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1789">67</xref></sup> is a root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn1790">68</xref></sup> <italic>Gibben</italic> is an adjective. Similarly the word <italic>dak</italic> (a dwarf) is to be interpreted according to the plain meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn1791">69</xref></sup> <italic>Dak</italic> means short of stature.<sup><xref rid="fn1792">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>HATH HIS EYE OVERSPREAD. Some say that <italic>tevallul</italic> (overspread) is related to the word <italic>tevel</italic> (corruption) in <italic>they have wrought corruption</italic> (Lev. 20:12). <italic>Tevallul</italic> means a corruption.<sup><xref rid="fn1793">71</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>tevallul</italic> is related to the word <italic>belullah</italic> (mingled) in <italic>mingled with oil</italic> (Lev. 2:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1794">72</xref></sup> According to both interpretations the <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>tevallul</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1795">73</xref></sup> According to the opinion of many the scab (<italic>garav</italic>) is also in the eye.</p>
<p>OR SCURVY. <italic>Yalefet</italic> (scurvy) means sticking.<sup><xref rid="fn1796">74</xref></sup> It is related to the word <italic>va-yilpot</italic> (took fast hold) in <italic>And Samson took fast hold</italic> (Jud. 16:29). There are others who say that <italic>yalefet</italic> means crooked.<sup><xref rid="fn1797">75</xref></sup> It is related to the word <italic>va-yillafet</italic> (turned) in <italic>that the man was startled, and turned</italic> (Ruth 3:8). The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>yalefet</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1798">76</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>yitzhar</italic> (oil) (Num. 18:12).<sup><xref rid="fn1799">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>CRUSHED. <italic>Mero&#x2019;ach</italic> (crushed) is an adjective. It is related to the word <italic>ru&#x2019;ach</italic> (wind).<sup><xref rid="fn1800">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>STONES. <italic>Ashekh</italic> (stones) refers to the testicle. After listing specific blemishes the Torah issues a general statement and says, <italic>no man&#x2026;that hath a blemish</italic> (v. 21). The meaning of <italic>hath a blemish</italic> is similar to <italic>he hath cursed his father or his mother</italic> (Lev. 20:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1801">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. THE BREAD OF HIS GOD&#x2026;OF THE MOST HOLY. The showbread, the guilt offering, and the sin offering, which in comparison to the peace offerings are most holy, for the peace offerings are also holy.</p>
<p>AND OF THE HOLY. The tithe and the first-born.</p>
<p>23. ONLY HE SHALL NOT GO IN UNTO THE VEIL. Although he is a <italic>kohen gadol</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1802">80</xref></sup> He shall also not approach the altar.</p>
<p>24. [AND UNTO ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] If it were not for the tradition<sup><xref rid="fn1803">81</xref></sup> we would interpret <italic>and unto all the children of Israel</italic> as meaning that those who are blemished should not slaughter peace offerings for the children of Israel. Now, since Scripture mentions that a blemished <italic>kohen</italic> may eat that which is holy, it warns<sup><xref rid="fn1804">82</xref></sup> that the one who eats sacred food must be clean.</p>

According to the rabbis a <italic>zonah</italic> is a woman who had intercourse with an individual whom she is not permitted to marry, i.e., a woman who has relations with a close relative or with a non-Jew. Such a woman is considered a <italic>zonah</italic> even if the intercourse was not with her consent. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1749"><sup>27</sup> In other words, <italic>zonah</italic> in Joel 4:3 refers to a harlot. It means that they gave a young man in payment for sexual favors.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1750"><sup>28</sup> A woman who is not a harlot but has been defiled. I.E. does not define how the woman was profaned. However, from the context it appears that I.E. refers to a woman who is not a prostitute but had intercourse with someone who is not a <italic>kohen</italic>. It is also possible that I.E. refers to a woman who is promiscuous but not a prostitute. It should be noted that according to the rabbis the reference is to a woman born of a marriage between a <italic>kohen</italic> and a woman prohibited to him (<italic>Kiddushin</italic> 77a).</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 22</title>
<p>2. THAT THEY SEPARATE THEMSELVES. <italic>Ve-yinnazeru</italic> (that they separate themselves) is similar to <italic>ve-hizzhartem</italic> (thus shall ye separate) (Lev. 15:31).<sup><xref rid="fn1805">1</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-yinnazeru</italic> is a <italic>nifal</italic>. It means they shall distance and separate themselves. It is related to the word <italic>nazir</italic> (nazirite).<sup><xref rid="fn1806">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THAT THEY PROFANE NOT. <italic>And that they profane not</italic> applies to what immediately follows it and to what follows later. Our verse is to be read as follows: And that they profane not My holy name, and that they profane not that which they hallow unto Me. The meaning of <italic>I am the Lord</italic> is, I the Lord am holy.</p>
<p>[3. FROM BEFORE ME: I AM THE LORD.] This means since he is cut off from God, he will cease to exist.<sup><xref rid="fn1807">3</xref></sup> I have explained the latter in my comments on the secret of God&#x2019;s name.<sup><xref rid="fn1808">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. UNTIL HE BE CLEAN. Until the days necessary for his cleansing have passed.</p>
<p>5. WHEREBY HE MAY BE MADE UNCLEAN. The word <italic>lo</italic> means whereby.<sup><xref rid="fn1809">5</xref></sup> Compare the word <italic>li</italic> (of me)<sup><xref rid="fn1810">6</xref></sup> in <italic>say of me</italic>: <italic>He is my brother</italic> (Gen. 20:13). All those mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn1811">7</xref></sup> shall become unclean until evening.</p>
<p>7. AND WHEN THE SUN IS DOWN, HE SHALL BE CLEAN. It is known that <italic>he shall be clean</italic> refers to the unclean, for there is no mention of the word day in the verse.<sup><xref rid="fn1812">8</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean</italic> (Lev. 12:8). However, the rabbis of blessed memory transmitted to us the law that even if the sun sets he shall not eat until it is completely dark.<sup><xref rid="fn1813">9</xref></sup> They used this verse as a support.<sup><xref rid="fn1814">10</xref></sup> I have explained the latter<sup><xref rid="fn1815">11</xref></sup> in my comments on the verse <italic>unto a foreign people</italic> (Ex. 21:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1816">12</xref></sup> The rabbis therefore<sup><xref rid="fn1817">13</xref></sup> said that <italic>ve-taher</italic> (he should be clean) means that the day shall be clean.</p>
<p>BECAUSE IT IS HIS BREAD. His food.<sup><xref rid="fn1818">14</xref></sup> I have previously explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn1819">15</xref></sup> Those whose brains are empty explain the verse in Ezekiel, which reads, <italic>The priests shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be fowl or beast</italic> (Ezek. 44:31), as meaning that the priests shall not eat anything brought down or torn by animals or fowl.<sup><xref rid="fn1820">16</xref></sup> However, this is nonsense, for the Torah states all that dies of itself or is torn he<sup><xref rid="fn1821">17</xref></sup> shall not eat.<sup><xref rid="fn1822">18</xref></sup> The meaning<sup><xref rid="fn1823">19</xref></sup> is if he eats<sup><xref rid="fn1824">20</xref></sup> he shall not minister.<sup><xref rid="fn1825">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. THEY SHALL THEREFORE KEEP MY CHARGE. <italic>Mishmarti</italic> (my charge) alludes to the sanctuary. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>lest they bear sin for it</italic> (alav), <italic>and die therein</italic> (vo).</p>
<p>10. THERE SHALL NO COMMON MAN. One who is not of the seed of Aaron.</p>
<p>11. THEY MAY EAT OF HIS BREAD. Males and females.</p>
<p>12. THAT WHICH IS SET APART FROM THE HOLY THINGS. The thigh and the breast (Lev. 10:15).</p>
<p>13. SHE MAY EAT OF HER FATHER&#x2019;S BREAD. As at first.</p>
<p>BUT THERE SHALL NO COMMON MAN EAT OF IT. The reference is to a son, if she has one. She cannot eat of the holy food because of her son.</p>
<p>14. AND SHALL GIVE UNTO THE PRIEST THE HOLY THING. The meaning of <italic>ve&#x2019;et ha-kodesh</italic> (the holy thing) is, with<sup><xref rid="fn1826">22</xref></sup> the holy thing.<sup><xref rid="fn1827">23</xref></sup> On the other hand, <italic>and shall give unto the priest</italic> might apply to what precedes it and to what follows it. Our verse is to be interpreted as follows: Then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it and shall give it unto the priest, and he shall give unto the priest the holy thing. I believe that there is no need for this interpretation, for Scripture reads <italic>unto it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1828">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND SO CAUSE THEM TO BEAR. <italic>Ve-hisi&#x2019;u</italic> (and cause&#x2026;to bear) is a <italic>hifil</italic>. Its meaning is, they shall caution them and teach them so that they do not err.<sup><xref rid="fn1829">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>After mentioning the holy things of the children of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn1830">26</xref></sup> Scripture goes on<sup><xref rid="fn1831">27</xref></sup> to caution the Israelites to not bring the holy things from blemished animals.</p>
<p>[18. STRANGERS.] Scripture reads <italic>or of the strangers</italic> for it is stated that there is one law for the Israelite and the stranger who offer a vow or freewill offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1832">28</xref></sup> The sages differentiated between a vow offering and a freewill offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1833">29</xref></sup> All vow offerings are freewill offerings. However, not all freewill offerings are vow offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn1834">30</xref></sup> It is fitting that all sacrifices that are offered in their entirety<sup><xref rid="fn1835">31</xref></sup> on the altar be unblemished.<sup><xref rid="fn1836">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. CLEARLY UTTERED. <italic>Le-fale</italic> means to clearly utter.</p>
<p>22. BLIND. <italic>Avveret</italic> (blind) is an adjective relating to the eye. Some say that <italic>shavur</italic> (broken) means a break in the hand and <italic>charutz</italic> (maimed) refers to an injury in the foot. <italic>Charutz</italic> is related to <italic>charatzta</italic> (hast decided it) in <italic>So shall thy judgment be</italic>; <italic>thyself hast decided it</italic> (I Kings 20:40). <italic>Charutz</italic> means cut.<sup><xref rid="fn1837">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>A WEN. <italic>Yabbelet</italic> (wen) is similar to <italic>tevallul</italic> (overspread) (Lev. 21:20). The general rule is: we rely on tradition,<sup><xref rid="fn1838">34</xref></sup> not on our deficient minds.</p>
<p>YE SHALL NOT OFFER THESE UNTO THE LORD. In fulfillment of a clearly uttered vow. Nor shall the <italic>kohen</italic> take the organs from these.<sup><xref rid="fn1839">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. TOO LONG. <italic>Saru&#x2019;a</italic> (too long) has the same meaning as when first mentioned (Lev. 21:18).<sup><xref rid="fn1840">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>TOO SHORT. <italic>Kalut</italic> (too short) is the opposite of <italic>saru&#x2019;a</italic> (too long). <italic>Kalut</italic> is related to the word <italic>miklat</italic> (refuge) in <italic>the city of refuge</italic> (Josh. 21:13).<sup><xref rid="fn1841">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. BRUISED. <italic>Ma&#x2019;uch</italic> (bruised) is related to <italic>mo&#x2019;akhu</italic> (pressed) in <italic>their bosoms pressed</italic> (Ezek. 23:3).</p>
<p>OR CRUSHED. <italic>Katut</italic> (crushed) is related to <italic>va-ekkot</italic> (beat) in <italic>and beat it in pieces</italic> (Deut. 9:21). Crushed and bruised refer to wounds in the testicles.</p>
<p>OR TORN. <italic>Natuk</italic> (torn) is related to <italic>yinnatek</italic> (broken) in <italic>as a string of tow is broken</italic> (Jud. 16:9).</p>
<p>NEITHER SHALL YE DO THUS IN YOUR LAND. To change God&#x2019;s work.<sup><xref rid="fn1842">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. FROM THE HAND OF A FOREIGNER. One should not think as follows: I will not hesitate to offer this sacrifice, for it is the offering of a foreigner.<sup><xref rid="fn1843">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEIR CORRUPTION. The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>moshchatam</italic> (their corruption) is not a root letter. However, its <italic>tav</italic> is a root letter. <italic>Moshchatam</italic> is related to the word <italic>hashchatah</italic> (destruction).<sup><xref rid="fn1844">40</xref></sup> On the other hand, the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>moshchatam</italic> (their anointing) (Ex.40:15) is a root letter and the <italic>tav</italic> is not.<sup><xref rid="fn1845">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>BE ACCEPTED. <italic>Yeratzu</italic> (be accepted) is a <italic>nifal</italic>. After stating that a blemished sacrifice will not be accepted, Scripture goes on to say that any sacrifice brought from an animal less than eight days old will also not be accepted.</p>
<p>27. WHEN A BULLOCK, OR A SHEEP, OR A GOAT. The newborn animals are called by what they ultimately become. Compare, <italic>And stripped the naked</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1846">42</xref></sup> <italic>of their clothing</italic> (Job 22:6); &#x201C;the dead<sup><xref rid="fn1847">43</xref></sup> shall be put to death&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1848">44</xref></sup> (Deut. 17:6); &#x201C;for the one who falls shall fall from it&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1849">45</xref></sup> (Deut. 22:8). On the other hand, Scripture may have been referring to the name of the species.<sup><xref rid="fn1850">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BUT FROM THE EIGHTH DAY AND THENCEFORTH.] Like a child that is circumcised, that is, until a quarter of the month has passed.<sup><xref rid="fn1851">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>THENCEFORTH. <italic>Hale&#x2019;ah</italic> (thenceforth) means afterwards. The arrow of Jonathan is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn1852">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AND WHETHER IT BE COW<sup><xref rid="fn1853">49</xref></sup> OR EWE.<sup><xref rid="fn1854">50</xref></sup> I have previously explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn1855">51</xref></sup> The commandment pertains to both males and females.<sup><xref rid="fn1856">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>[29. AND WHEN YE SACRIFICE A SACRIFICE OF THANKSGIVING.] The reason that <italic>And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving&#x2026;On the same day it shall he eaten</italic> follows is that Scripture earlier noted it is prohibited to kill a cow or a ewe [and its young together] in one day.<sup><xref rid="fn1857">53</xref></sup> Scripture adds to what is written in the Torah portion <italic>Tzav</italic> (Lev. 6:2),<sup><xref rid="fn1858">54</xref></sup> <italic>that ye may be accepted</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1859">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>[30. I AM THE LORD.] Scripture reads <italic>I am the Lord</italic> to teach that the thanksgiving offering is to be &#x201C;whole.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1860">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. AND YE SHALL KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS. In your hearts.</p>
<p>AND DO THEM; I AM THE LORD. For I investigate what is in the heart, and I see everything that is done.</p>
<p>[32. AND YE SHALL NOT PROFANE MY HOLY NAME.] This is directed to the sons of Aaron, for this section<sup><xref rid="fn1861">57</xref></sup> is connected to what is earlier stated.<sup><xref rid="fn1862">58</xref></sup> They<sup><xref rid="fn1863">59</xref></sup> are commanded not to sacrifice for themselves or for Israel a cow and its offspring on one day. It is also possible that <italic>And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving</italic> (v. 29) is directed to the <italic>kohanim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1864">60</xref></sup> The fact that the following section opens with <italic>Speak unto the children of Israel</italic> (Lev. 23:2) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1865">61</xref></sup> <italic>But I will be hallowed among the children of Israel</italic> is a second witness.<sup><xref rid="fn1866">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. THAT BROUGHT YOU OUT. The verse ends with <italic>I am the Lord</italic>. This the first statement of the Decalogue<sup><xref rid="fn1867">63</xref></sup> and the root of all the commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn1868">64</xref></sup> After mentioning the holy things of the children of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn1869">65</xref></sup> the Torah notes<sup><xref rid="fn1870">66</xref></sup> the days that Israel shall offer burnt offerings. It starts with the Sabbath.</p>

Deut. 44:21 prohibits an Israelite from eating meat which dies of itself (<italic>nevelah</italic>). Ezek 44:21 seems to limit the prohibition to eat <italic>nevalah</italic> and <italic>terefah</italic> only to <italic>kohanim</italic>. In order to harmonize Ezekiel and the Torah, there were those who claimed that Ezekiel spoke of an animal that has been properly slaughtered and then ripped apart and befouled by birds and beasts. In other words, the Torah prohibits any Israelite from eating the meat of any animal that has been ripped apart by an animal of prey, while Ezekiel adds that a <italic>kohen</italic> is also prohibited from eating kosher meat that has been befouled. It should be noted that according to this interpretation the word <italic>nevelah</italic> is not to be taken literally but means flesh which is as disgusting as meat that dies of itself (Filwarg).

<title>CHAPTER 23</title>
<p>[2. EVEN THESE ARE MY APPOINTED SEASONS.] Scripture reads, <italic>even these are My appointed seasons</italic> (mo&#x2019;adai) because there are many Sabbaths in the year.<sup><xref rid="fn1871">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. IN ALL YOUR DWELLINGS. In your country and outside of your country, at home and on the way.</p>
<p>I have previously explained the meaning of <italic>it is a sabbath unto the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1872">2</xref></sup> Scripture then mentions the festivals (v. 4). The Torah says, <italic>even these are My appointed seasons</italic>, with regard to the Sabbath and <italic>in their appointed season</italic> with regard to the festivals. The meaning of <italic>in their appointed season</italic> is, in any day of the week in which they fall. Note, I will now lay down a general rule with regard to the festivals. During the time of the Temple the festivals were in the hands of the Beth Din. Do you not see that Scripture says, <italic>For the king had taken counsel</italic> (II Chron. 30:2), with regard to the Passover proclaimed by Hezekiah.<sup><xref rid="fn1873">3</xref></sup> After Hezekiah established the new moon of Nisan he proclaimed a leap year.<sup><xref rid="fn1874">4</xref></sup> Our sages, of blessed memory, criticized him for this, for he should not have added a Nisan on Nisan.<sup><xref rid="fn1875">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The transmitters of tradition said that the Beth Din took many things into consideration in estabhshing the year.<sup><xref rid="fn1876">6</xref></sup> They said, regarding Rabbi Akiba, that he established two leap years back to back according to the needs of the hour.<sup><xref rid="fn1877">7</xref></sup> There is no proof in Scripture as to how Israel established the months and the festivals. The Gaon&#x2019;s statement to the effect that they relied on the intercalational calculation<sup><xref rid="fn1878">8</xref></sup> is not true, for there are proofs in the Mishnah and also in the Talmud that Passover fell on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.<sup><xref rid="fn1879">9</xref></sup> There are also two stories in the Talmud [which show that they did not rely on a fixed calendar].<sup><xref rid="fn1880">10</xref></sup> Leap years<sup><xref rid="fn1881">11</xref></sup> come close to compensating for the additional days which a solar year has over a lunar year.<sup><xref rid="fn1882">12</xref></sup> The latter does not follow the way of the ancients.<sup><xref rid="fn1883">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The calculation<sup><xref rid="fn1884">14</xref></sup> starts with the end of 14 hours of the sixth day;<sup><xref rid="fn1885">15</xref></sup> that is, add four days, eight hours, and 876 parts<sup><xref rid="fn1886">16</xref></sup> to five hours and 204 parts of an hour of the second day of the week.<sup><xref rid="fn1887">17</xref></sup> Then the birth of the new moon will occur at the end of 14 hours of the sixth day.<sup><xref rid="fn1888">18</xref></sup> A year is added,<sup><xref rid="fn1889">19</xref></sup> for we start counting from five hours and 204 parts of an hour of the second day of the week<sup><xref rid="fn1890">20</xref></sup> because of the five days which preceded the creation of Adam, for a day into a year is considered a year.<sup><xref rid="fn1891">21</xref></sup> This presents no problem.<sup><xref rid="fn1892">22</xref></sup> You cannot add an additional year,<sup><xref rid="fn1893">23</xref></sup> for it did not yet exist. Note, an additional month was added to the year after a year and a half.<sup><xref rid="fn1894">24</xref></sup> The intercalation is based on the average<sup><xref rid="fn1895">25</xref></sup> movement of the moon.<sup><xref rid="fn1896">26</xref></sup> The sages therefore said that sometimes the birth of the moon comes at longer intervals; at times it comes at shorter intervals.<sup><xref rid="fn1897">27</xref></sup> The establishment of the month<sup><xref rid="fn1898">28</xref></sup> is not tied to the sighting of the moon in Jerusalem,<sup><xref rid="fn1899">29</xref></sup> or in the far east,<sup><xref rid="fn1900">30</xref></sup> or in the west [of the world].<sup><xref rid="fn1901">31</xref></sup> The place of the average conjunction of the moon<sup><xref rid="fn1902">32</xref></sup> is proof of this,<sup><xref rid="fn1903">33</xref></sup> for look, it is reckoned when occurring over Jerusalem.<sup><xref rid="fn1904">34</xref></sup> Furthermore, we have seen the moon many times on the second night of the month of Nisan. It was similarly seen in the entire world. However, the month was established on the third night [of the week].<sup><xref rid="fn1905">35</xref></sup> The same thing happened in the three months preceding Nisan. This occurs when the birth of the new moon of Tishri occurs at nine hours and 204 parts of an hour of the third day [of the week].<sup><xref rid="fn1906">36</xref></sup> It was enacted<sup><xref rid="fn1907">37</xref></sup> because of the postponement.<sup><xref rid="fn1908">38</xref></sup> There are also times when the month of Tishri was established on the fifth day [of the week] and the moon was not seen on the night of the Sabbath. Now, the air was then clear. This occurs every year when the birth of the new moon<sup><xref rid="fn1909">39</xref></sup> is close to half of the day<sup><xref rid="fn1910">40</xref></sup> and the moon is in half of its sphere&#x2019;s apogee. The establishment<sup><xref rid="fn1911">41</xref></sup> is also not dependent on the time of the conjunction<sup><xref rid="fn1912">42</xref></sup> of the sun and moon. It is not even dependent on their mean conjunction, for note, the conjunction<sup><xref rid="fn1913">43</xref></sup> of the sun and moon at 15 hours and 599 parts<sup><xref rid="fn1914">44</xref></sup> of the hour on the second day<sup><xref rid="fn1915">45</xref></sup> and similarly the conjunction at nine hours and 204 parts of the third day<sup><xref rid="fn1916">46</xref></sup> is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1917">47</xref></sup> If I did not want to go on at length I would explain the secret of the calculation of the calendar and the secret of the very difficult law, i.e., the rule regarding a moon born before midday.<sup><xref rid="fn1918">48</xref></sup> The general principle is: our wise men, of blessed memory, transmitted to us the rule that we are to rely on the intercalated calendar in exile. We received the same from the mouth of the prophets. We cannot do anything better than it. The sages ruled that the festivals be observed for two days in the Diaspora because of uncertainty.<sup><xref rid="fn1919">49</xref></sup> Those who fast for two days in observance of Yom Kippur<sup><xref rid="fn1920">50</xref></sup> fast in vain<sup><xref rid="fn1921">51</xref></sup> due to the &#x201C;postponements.&#x201D; For in a year when the birth of the new moon<sup><xref rid="fn1922">52</xref></sup> occurs at nine hours and 204 parts of the hour on the third day of the week, they should fast on what is the eighth day of the month according to our calculation if they rely on the conjunction.<sup><xref rid="fn1923">53</xref></sup> Why<sup><xref rid="fn1924">54</xref></sup> manipulate the date of the start of one year<sup><xref rid="fn1925">55</xref></sup> because of another year?<sup><xref rid="fn1926">56</xref></sup> This would happen to them<sup><xref rid="fn1927">57</xref></sup> if the month is established by seeing the new moon.<sup><xref rid="fn1928">58</xref></sup></p>

The sages said that on <italic>the morrow after the sabbath</italic> means on the morrow after the festival.<sup><xref rid="fn1937">67</xref></sup> Those who contradict the sages<sup><xref rid="fn1938">68</xref></sup> say that the word Sabbath is be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn1939">69</xref></sup> Those who believe in the Rabbinic tradition offer proof from the Sabbatical year,<sup><xref rid="fn1940">70</xref></sup> the Jubilee, the great fast,<sup><xref rid="fn1941">71</xref></sup> and the day of <italic>shofar</italic> sounding,<sup><xref rid="fn1942">72</xref></sup> for the word <italic>shabbaton</italic> (a solemn rest) is employed with regard to them.<sup><xref rid="fn1943">73</xref></sup> Scripture similarly employs <italic>shabbaton</italic> with regard to Sukkot<sup><xref rid="fn1944">74</xref></sup> and Shemini Atzeret.<sup><xref rid="fn1945">75</xref></sup> They also say that the meaning of <italic>sheva shabbatot</italic> (v. 15) is seven weeks.<sup><xref rid="fn1946">76</xref></sup> The same is true of <italic>ba&#x2019;eh shabbat im yotze&#x2019;eh shabbat</italic> (those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath) (II Kings 11:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1947">77</xref></sup> The same word<sup><xref rid="fn1948">78</xref></sup> is employed with two meanings in one verse.<sup><xref rid="fn1949">79</xref></sup> Note, we find a similarity in <italic>sheloshim ayarim</italic> (thirty ass colts) (Jud. 10:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1950">80</xref></sup> They<sup><xref rid="fn1951">81</xref></sup> offer proof from the word <italic>complete</italic> (v. 15).<sup><xref rid="fn1952">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>A wise man in Rome<sup><xref rid="fn1953">83</xref></sup> offered proof<sup><xref rid="fn1954">84</xref></sup> from on <italic>the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn</italic> (Josh. 5:11).<sup><xref rid="fn1955">85</xref></sup> He did not know that it cost him his life,<sup><xref rid="fn1956">86</xref></sup> for the Passover falls on the 14th<sup><xref rid="fn1957">87</xref></sup> and the morrow following it is on the 15th.<sup><xref rid="fn1958">88</xref></sup> Scripture similarly reads, <italic>And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month</italic> (Num. 33:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1959">89</xref></sup> The eating of parched corn is prohibited until the waving of the <italic>omer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1960">90</xref></sup> The Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn1961">91</xref></sup> says that there are two Passovers, a Passover of the Lord and a Passover of Israel. The Passover of God is on the night of the 15th.<sup><xref rid="fn1962">92</xref></sup> Now, the <italic>day after the Passover</italic> in Joshua refers to the 16th day.<sup><xref rid="fn1963">93</xref></sup> It follows from this that the interpretation of <italic>on the morrow after the passover</italic> (Num. 33:3), is on the morrow following the sacrifice of the Passover.<sup><xref rid="fn1964">94</xref></sup> What he said has no value. The festival<sup><xref rid="fn1965">95</xref></sup> is called Passover only because God skipped over the houses.<sup><xref rid="fn1966">96</xref></sup> Its morrow is the morning of the 15th.<sup><xref rid="fn1967">97</xref></sup> Scripture similarly writes, <italic>all that day, and all the night, and all the next day</italic> (yom ha-mochorat)<sup><xref rid="fn1968">98</xref></sup> (Num. 11:32). The Gaon further states that the unleavened cakes and the parched corn were from the old grain.<sup><xref rid="fn1969">99</xref></sup> This is not far-fetched, for Scripture says that the waving of the <italic>omer</italic> should begin <italic>from the time the sickle is first put to the standing corn</italic> (Deut. 16:9). If the <italic>omer</italic> was waved on the 15th<sup><xref rid="fn1970">100</xref></sup> when did they harvest and make unleavened bread?<sup><xref rid="fn1971">101</xref></sup> Furthermore, there was no harvest,<sup><xref rid="fn1972">102</xref></sup> for the <italic>omer</italic> is brought from the first of the barley harvest.<sup><xref rid="fn1973">103</xref></sup> There is also what appears to be proof of the Gaon&#x2019;s opinion,<sup><xref rid="fn1974">104</xref></sup> for Scripture states, <italic>of the produce</italic> (meavur) <italic>of the land</italic> (Josh. 5:11). It is possible that the term <italic>avur</italic> refers to the produce of the year that has passed.<sup><xref rid="fn1975">105</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>the produce of the land</italic> is the produce of the land of Sihon and Og.<sup><xref rid="fn1976">106</xref></sup> The fact that Scripture afterwards states, <italic>of the fruit of the land of Canaan</italic> (Josh. 5:12), is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn1977">107</xref></sup> Furthermore, <italic>kaluy</italic> (parched corn) (Josh. 5:11) is not the same as <italic>kali</italic> (parched com) (Lev. 23:14).<sup><xref rid="fn1978">108</xref></sup> Now, Scripture says, <italic>And ye shall eat neither bread nor parched corn</italic> (kali), <italic>nor fresh ears</italic> (v. 14). The verse which reads <italic>kaluy ba-esh</italic> (parched with fire) (Lev. 2:14)<sup><xref rid="fn1979">109</xref></sup> cannot serve as an argument to the contrary,<sup><xref rid="fn1980">110</xref></sup> for it describes the act<sup><xref rid="fn1981">111</xref></sup> since corn in the ear parched in fire is called <italic>kaluy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1982">112</xref></sup> We can also ask:<sup><xref rid="fn1983">113</xref></sup> From where do we know that the <italic>kohen</italic> waved the <italic>omer</italic> on the other side of the Jordan,<sup><xref rid="fn1984">114</xref></sup> for the verse states, <italic>which I give unto you</italic> (v. 10)?<sup><xref rid="fn1985">115</xref></sup> However, the land was not yet given to them.<sup><xref rid="fn1986">116</xref></sup> Scripture mentions matzot and corn only because the manna ceased. This is the meaning of the entire verse.<sup><xref rid="fn1987">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn1988">118</xref></sup> further says: If the word Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn1989">119</xref></sup> is to be taken literally<sup><xref rid="fn1990">120</xref></sup> then from which Sabbath shall we start to count? Joshua<sup><xref rid="fn1991">121</xref></sup> answers that there are 18 days aside from the Sabbath whereon sacrifices are offered. These days are called <italic>mo&#x2019;adim</italic> (festivals). Now, since there is a sacrifice<sup><xref rid="fn1992">122</xref></sup> on the day that the <italic>omer</italic> is offered<sup><xref rid="fn1993">123</xref></sup> it is a sign and a witness that the waving takes place on one of the days of the spring festival.<sup><xref rid="fn1994">124</xref></sup> Note, he<sup><xref rid="fn1995">125</xref></sup> forgot the sacrifices that are offered on the new moon, which are not mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1996">126</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>After this manner ye shall offer daily</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1997">127</xref></sup> <italic>for seven days</italic> (Num. 28:24). Scripture should have stated, aside from the offering of the <italic>omer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1998">128</xref></sup> This<sup><xref rid="fn1999">129</xref></sup> too<sup><xref rid="fn2000">130</xref></sup> is no argument against us, for we rely on tradition when it comes to the commandments. Now, Scripture does not state &#x201C;aside from the he-lambs brought for a peace offering,&#x201D; when it lists in the Torah portion <italic>Pinechas</italic> the offerings to be brought on the festival of Shavu&#x2019;ot.<sup><xref rid="fn2001">131</xref></sup> It states above,<sup><xref rid="fn2002">132</xref></sup> <italic>and one young bullock, and two rams</italic> (v. 18). However, <italic>Pinechas</italic> reads, <italic>two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year</italic> (Num. 28:27).<sup><xref rid="fn2003">133</xref></sup> The believer can also answer<sup><xref rid="fn2004">134</xref></sup> that Moses prophetically knew the day that the <italic>omer</italic> would be waved.<sup><xref rid="fn2005">135</xref></sup> He knew that the first day of the month<sup><xref rid="fn2006">136</xref></sup> would be established on the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn2007">137</xref></sup> The arrangement of the bread which took place on the Sabbath is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn2008">138</xref></sup> Scripture notes<sup><xref rid="fn2009">139</xref></sup> how they calculated the first year.<sup><xref rid="fn2010">140</xref></sup> They then<sup><xref rid="fn2011">141</xref></sup> brought the peace offerings and the burnt offerings which are mentioned [in our Torah portion] and then<sup><xref rid="fn2012">142</xref></sup> the ones mentioned in the Torah portion <italic>Pinechas</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2013">143</xref></sup> Scripture then goes on to say,<sup><xref rid="fn2014">144</xref></sup> <italic>in your feast of weeks</italic> (Num. 28:26) and <italic>seven weeks</italic> (Deut. 16:9); it does not state Sabbaths.<sup><xref rid="fn2015">145</xref></sup> There is no proof that the beginning of the week<sup><xref rid="fn2016">146</xref></sup> starts with the first day.<sup><xref rid="fn2017">147</xref></sup> In fact, <italic>then she</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2018">148</xref></sup> <italic>shall be unclean two weeks</italic> (Lev. 12:5) shows that this is not the case.<sup><xref rid="fn2019">149</xref></sup> Look, I will hint at a secret.<sup><xref rid="fn2020">150</xref></sup> All the festivals are contingent on a specific day of the month. Scripture does not give a date for the festival of Shavu&#x2019;ot<sup><xref rid="fn2021">151</xref></sup> because of the counting, which is a commandment. The rabbis, of blessed memory, transmitted the tradition that the Torah was given on the festival of Shavu&#x2019;ot and that it is concerning this day that Scripture states, <italic>for we must hold a feast unto the Lord</italic> (Ex. 10:9).</p>
<p>Some say that whenever the Torah uses the term <italic>li-retzonekhem</italic> it means to be accepted from you,<sup><xref rid="fn2022">152</xref></sup> for Scripture reads, <italic>And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you</italic> (li-retzonekhem) (v. 11). The meaning of the aforementioned is that you shall wave it willingly.<sup><xref rid="fn2023">153</xref></sup> This means you shall offer a he-lamb<sup><xref rid="fn2024">154</xref></sup> of the first year so that you will be accepted.<sup><xref rid="fn2025">155</xref></sup></p>
<p>Those who deny the Rabbinic tradition<sup><xref rid="fn2026">156</xref></sup> say that <italic>ben shanah</italic> (of the first year) (Ex. 12:5) does not have the same meaning as <italic>ben shenato</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2027">157</xref></sup> (of the first year), for <italic>ben shanato</italic> refers to a lamb under a year and <italic>ben shanah</italic> refers to a lamb of a complete year. Note, they did not read the section dealing with the dedication of the altar. The latter reads, <italic>one he-lamb of the first year</italic> (ben shenato), for a burnt offering (Num. 7:15). However, in the final section<sup><xref rid="fn2028">158</xref></sup> it reads, <italic>the he-lambs of the first year</italic> (bene shanah) <italic>twelve</italic> (Num. 7:87).<sup><xref rid="fn2029">159</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. BREAD. From the new grain.<sup><xref rid="fn2030">160</xref></sup> The fact that the Passover offering is eaten with matzot and bitter herbs is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn2031">161</xref></sup> If it were not for tradition<sup><xref rid="fn2032">162</xref></sup> it would have appeared that the counting of the days is similar to the counting of the years<sup><xref rid="fn2033">163</xref></sup> of the Jubilee.<sup><xref rid="fn2034">164</xref></sup> Those who deny the Rabbinic tradition say that the meaning of <italic>complete</italic> is that the first Sabbath from the morrow on which the count begins is not to be considered in the count.<sup><xref rid="fn2035">165</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. SHALL YE NUMBER FIFTY DAYS. For this is the way the Torah counts.<sup><xref rid="fn2036">166</xref></sup> Similarly, in all cases of the eighth day.<sup><xref rid="fn2037">167</xref></sup></p>
<p>[17. YE SHALL BRING OUT.] The word <italic>tavi&#x2019;u</italic> (ye shall bring out) is irregular in that its <italic>alef</italic> has a <italic>dagesh</italic> in it. We do not know the reason for this.</p>
<p>OF YOUR DWELLINGS. We need tradition to teach us from which place it was brought<sup><xref rid="fn2038">168</xref></sup> and when it is to be brought.<sup><xref rid="fn2039">169</xref></sup></p>
<p>TWO WAVE-LOAVES. For the <italic>kohen</italic> along with the peace offering lambs.<sup><xref rid="fn2040">170</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that Scripture changed the sacrifices in the first year<sup><xref rid="fn2041">171</xref></sup> because it was the beginning of the beginning.<sup><xref rid="fn2042">172</xref></sup> Some say that the <italic>kohen</italic> shall offer<sup><xref rid="fn2043">173</xref></sup> either a bullock and two rams<sup><xref rid="fn2044">174</xref></sup> or two bullocks and one ram.<sup><xref rid="fn2045">175</xref></sup> It depends on the will of the <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2046">176</xref></sup> We do not find such a commandment again.<sup><xref rid="fn2047">177</xref></sup> I will give its true explanation in the Torah portion <italic>Pinechas</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2048">178</xref></sup> Now, since the slaughtering of the peace offerings took place on the festival of Shavu&#x2019;ot and it is a day of holy assembly, it is thus permissible to slaughter<sup><xref rid="fn2049">179</xref></sup> on all the festivals. The latter is contrary to the opinion of the Sadducees.<sup><xref rid="fn2050">180</xref></sup></p>
<p>[22. AND WHEN YE REAP.] The reason Scripture mentions <italic>And when ye reap the harvest of your land&#x2026;</italic> a second time<sup><xref rid="fn2051">181</xref></sup> is that Shavu&#x2019;ot is the festival of the first-fruits of the wheat harvest (Ex. 34:22). Scripture cautions: Do not forget what I commanded you<sup><xref rid="fn2052">182</xref></sup> to do at this time.</p>
<p>[23. SPOKE.] The reason the statement <italic>And the Lord spoke</italic> precedes the law dealing with the day of the sounding of the <italic>shofar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2053">183</xref></sup> is that the latter is a festival unto itself.<sup><xref rid="fn2054">184</xref></sup> However, the festival of Shavu&#x2019;ot is connected to the day the <italic>omer</italic> is waved.<sup><xref rid="fn2055">185</xref></sup> <italic>And the Lord spoke</italic> is similarly written in connection with the great fast<sup><xref rid="fn2056">186</xref></sup> and the festival of Sukkot.</p>
<p>24. IN THE SEVENTH MONTH. We begin the count of months from Nisan,<sup><xref rid="fn2057">187</xref></sup> for we then left Egypt. Furthermore, the festival of the new ears of barley<sup><xref rid="fn2058">188</xref></sup> comes first,<sup><xref rid="fn2059">189</xref></sup> next come <italic>the first-fruits of wheat harvest</italic> (Ex. 34:22),<sup><xref rid="fn2060">190</xref></sup> and then the time when you gather in the produce of your work (Deut. 16:13).<sup><xref rid="fn2061">191</xref></sup> These festivals are contingent upon the days that are mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn2062">192</xref></sup> Scripture commands that trumpets are to be sounded on all new moons.<sup><xref rid="fn2063">193</xref></sup> It follows from the aforementioned that <italic>zikhron tru&#x2019;ah</italic> (a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns) and <italic>yom tru&#x2019;ah</italic> (a day of blowing the horn) refer to the sounding of a <italic>shofar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2064">194</xref></sup> Similarly, on Yom Kippur.<sup><xref rid="fn2065">195</xref></sup> I will hint at some secrets to you. Pay attention. Perhaps you will understand them.</p>
<p>The transmitters of tradition said that Rosh Ha-Shanah is a day of judgment and that the sounding of the <italic>shofar</italic> proclaims the kingdom of God.<sup><xref rid="fn2066">196</xref></sup> Now, since the new moon<sup><xref rid="fn2067">197</xref></sup> is the most important [day of the month], the first month of Nisan<sup><xref rid="fn2068">198</xref></sup> is the most glorious month because the tabernacle was erected then. Ezekiel in speaking of the future says, <italic>In the first month, in the first day of the month</italic> (Ezek. 45:18). Similarly, <italic>And so thou shalt do on the seventh day of the month</italic> (Ezek. 40:20) because of the quarter.<sup><xref rid="fn2069">199</xref></sup> Note,<sup><xref rid="fn2070">200</xref></sup> the 15th day of the month<sup><xref rid="fn2071">201</xref></sup> corresponds to the time when one half of the month faces the other half.<sup><xref rid="fn2072">202</xref></sup> The seventh day<sup><xref rid="fn2073">203</xref></sup> is also a quarter.<sup><xref rid="fn2074">204</xref></sup> On the second Passover<sup><xref rid="fn2075">205</xref></sup> the great<sup><xref rid="fn2076">206</xref></sup> and the small<sup><xref rid="fn2077">207</xref></sup> interchange.<sup><xref rid="fn2078">208</xref></sup> The day of Rosh Ha-Shanah is therefore greater<sup><xref rid="fn2079">209</xref></sup> than all of them. Now, even though it is the Day of Judgment it is prohibited to fast on it. The Book of Ezra shows that this is the case.<sup><xref rid="fn2080">210</xref></sup> On Yom Kippur the small light<sup><xref rid="fn2081">211</xref></sup> is in the conjunction.<sup><xref rid="fn2082">212</xref></sup> Note, Sukkot is like Passover.<sup><xref rid="fn2083">213</xref></sup> However, its eighth day, not its seventh, is a festival. From this, the secret<sup><xref rid="fn2084">214</xref></sup> and the secret of the Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn2085">215</xref></sup> will become clear to you.</p>
<p>27. [HOWBEIT.] Scripture reads, <italic>Howbeit on the tenth day</italic>, because a day of solemn assembly (v. 24) is a joyful day.<sup><xref rid="fn2086">216</xref></sup> The Book of Ezra similarly reads, <italic>Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet</italic> (Neh. 8:10).<sup><xref rid="fn2087">217</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND YE SHALL AFFLICT. I have previously explained the meaning of afflict.<sup><xref rid="fn2088">218</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR YOU. Its meaning is, it is a day of atonement for you alone.<sup><xref rid="fn2089">219</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. FOR WHATSOEVER SOUL IT SHALL BE THAT SHALL NOT BE AFFLICTED. <italic>Te&#x2019;unneh</italic> (be afflicted) is a <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic>. This<sup><xref rid="fn2090">220</xref></sup> is a sign that if we know of a person who does not observe this precept as we observe it, then we shall force that individual to fast.<sup><xref rid="fn2091">221</xref></sup> The reason Scripture says that <italic>no</italic> manner of work is to be done on Yom Kippur is so that people will not be engaged in anything but seeking atonement for sins.</p>
<p>30. THAT SOUL WILL I DESTROY. There is a difference between &#x201C;destroy&#x201D; and &#x201C;cut off&#x201D; (v. 29). I cannot explain the difference.<sup><xref rid="fn2092">222</xref></sup></p>
<p>[31. NO MANNER OF WORK.] Scripture repeats, <italic>Ye shall do no manner of work</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2093">223</xref></sup> in order to add, <italic>it is a statue for ever throughout your generations</italic>.</p>
<p>32. SHALL YE KEEP YOUR SABBATH. Scripture reads <italic>your sabbath</italic>, for the Sabbath day is not called the Sabbath of Israel but the Sabbath of God.<sup><xref rid="fn2094">224</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. SEVEN DAYS YE SHALL BRING AN OFFERING MADE BY FIRE. Even though it is not the same as the <italic>offering made by fire</italic> that is brought on Passover.<sup><xref rid="fn2095">225</xref></sup></p>
<p>IT IS A DAY OF SOLEMN ASSEMBLY. Some say that <italic>atzeret</italic> (solemn assembly) means an assembly as in <italic>azteret bogedim</italic> (an assembly of treacherous men) (Jer. 9:1). <italic>Azteret</italic> refers to the gathering of all of Israel on the three pilgrimage festivals. However, they did not speak correctly, for look, Scripture states with regard to Passover, <italic>and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly</italic> (atzeret) (Deut. 16:8). However, it also states <italic>and thou shalt turn in the morning</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2096">226</xref></sup> <italic>and go unto thy tents</italic> (Deut. 16:7).<sup><xref rid="fn2097">227</xref></sup> It appears that <italic>atzeret</italic> is similar to <italic>netzar</italic> (detained)<sup><xref rid="fn2098">228</xref></sup> in <italic>detained before the Lord</italic> (I Sam. 21:8). <italic>Atzeret</italic> means that the Israelite shall not be involved in any worldly affairs.<sup><xref rid="fn2099">229</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>atzeret</italic> is, <italic>ye shall do no manner of servile work</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2100">230</xref></sup> Scripture writes similarly with regard to the <italic>atzeret</italic> of the festival of Passover.<sup><xref rid="fn2101">231</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. THESE ARE THE APPOINTED SEASONS OF THE LORD. Whereon you are obligated to bring an offering made by fire. Scripture explains<sup><xref rid="fn2102">232</xref></sup> that on all of these festivals a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sacrifice,<sup><xref rid="fn2103">233</xref></sup> and libations are to be brought, for until now Scripture only mentioned an offering made by fire, and it is possible that an offering made by fire refers only to a burnt offering or only to a meal offering.<sup><xref rid="fn2104">234</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. AND BESIDE YOUR GIFTS. On the three pilgrimage festivals.<sup><xref rid="fn2105">235</xref></sup> Similarly, And the vows of the congregation and of the individual and their freewill offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn2106">236</xref></sup></p>
<p>39. [HOWBEIT.] Scripture reads <italic>howbeit</italic> because it mentioned the affliction of the soul in the preceding section. The Torah prohibited fasting on the festival of Sukkot, for Scripture reads with regard to this festival, <italic>And thou shalt rejoice</italic> (Deut. 16:14)&#x2026;<italic>and thou shalt be altogether joyful</italic> (Deut. 16:15).</p>
<p>WHEN YE HAVE GATHERED IN THE FRUITS OF THE LAND. From the fields and vineyards.</p>
<p>YE SHALL KEEP THE FEAST. <italic>Tachoggu</italic> (ye shall keep the feast) comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn2107">237</xref></sup> The reference is to the sacrifices.<sup><xref rid="fn2108">238</xref></sup></p>
<p>ON THE FIRST DAY SHALL BE A SOLEMN REST.<sup><xref rid="fn2109">239</xref></sup> <italic>Shabbaton</italic> (a solemn rest) is a noun. The words &#x201C;shall be unto you&#x201D; are missing.<sup><xref rid="fn2110">240</xref></sup> If <italic>shabbaton</italic> were an adjective, the word <italic>yom</italic> (day) would have a <italic>heh</italic> rather than a <italic>bet</italic> prefixed to it.<sup><xref rid="fn2111">241</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. AND YE SHALL TAKE. We shall believe in the words of the transmitters,<sup><xref rid="fn2112">242</xref></sup> for they do not contradict Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2113">243</xref></sup> The latter is so even though we find, <italic>they shall take to them every man a lamb</italic> (Ex. 12:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2114">244</xref></sup> They<sup><xref rid="fn2115">245</xref></sup> also transmitted to us the tradition that <italic>the fruit of goodly trees</italic> (v. 40) refers to the etrog (citron). In truth, there is no fruit of the tree more beautiful than the etrog. The rabbis interpreted the phrase <italic>etz hadar</italic> (goodly trees) to mean [a fruit] which dwells on its tree.<sup><xref rid="fn2116">246</xref></sup> They used the verse as a support for their tradition.

<p>43. THAT&#x2026;IN BOOTHS. The Israelites made booths after they crossed the Sea of Reeds. They certainly did so in the wilderness of Sinai, where they dwelt close to a year. This is the manner of all the camps.

<p>44. UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. Not to all of the children of Israel, for Moses could not talk to all of them.<sup><xref rid="fn2139">269</xref></sup> Scripture similarly reads, <italic>Speak unto the children of Israel</italic>. (verses 2, 10, 24, 34). The verse <italic>unto all the congregation of the children of Israel</italic> (Lev. 19:2) is no argument to the contrary,<sup><xref rid="fn2140">270</xref></sup> for all of Israel is not called a congregation.<sup><xref rid="fn2141">271</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1871"><sup>1</sup> According to I.E. verse 2 refers only to the Sabbath. That being the case, the verse should have read this is My appointed season. I.E. thus points out that <italic>My appointed seasons</italic> refers to all the Sabbaths (of the year. After stating that all the Sabbaths are God&#x2019;s appointed seasons, Scripture goes on to speak of the weekly Sabbath in verse 3. For another interpretation see Rashi.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1880"><sup>10</sup> The Mishnah, <italic>Rosh Ha-Shanah</italic> 2:9 records a controversy between Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Joshua as to when Yom Kippur fell in a certain year. If the rabbis of the Mishnah had used a fixed calendar there would be no place for this difference of opinion. The Mishnah (<italic>Ibid.</italic> 2:8) also reports an instance of two sets of witnesses contradicting themselves as to the position of the new moon. The latter shows that the month was established by actually seeing the new moon and not by calculation. See Weiser and Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1881"><sup>11</sup> Of which there are seven in an 19 year cycle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1882"><sup>12</sup> The solar year is about ten days longer than the lunar year. The extra month added during the leap year comes very close to closing this gap.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1884"><sup>14</sup> Of the fixed calendar. What follows is a bit complicated. Hence a few words are in order. The Jewish months begin with the conjunction of the sun and moon. The calculation starts with the very first conjunction. That conjunction theoretically occurred at the end of five hours and 204 parts of an hour of the second day of the week (the rabbis divided an hour into 1,080 parts). The latter is known as <italic>molad tohu</italic>, or <italic>molad baharad</italic>, which is the Hebrew abbreviation for five hours and 204 parts of an hour of the second day of the week. How do we arrive at this calculation? Ibn Ezra explains that we do so by counting back a year from the conjunction which occurred on the day that Adam was born. It should be noted that that year, except for the five days preceding the birth of Adam, did not exist in reality. It was a theoretical year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1885"><sup>15</sup> Adam was born on Friday. That day was the first day of the month of Tishri. According to the rabbis the moon was then in conjunction with the sun at the end of 14 hours of the day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1886"><sup>16</sup> The days between the start of one simple lunar year to the next lunar year. See Maimonides, <italic>M.T., Laws of the Sanctification of the New Moon</italic>, 6:4,5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1887"><sup>17</sup> There were five days preceding the birth of Adam. Those days belonged to the previous year. In that year the conjunction of the sun and the moon (had they existed) would have taken place at five hours plus 204 parts of on hour of the second day. The calculation is as follows. A lunar month consists of 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 3 1/3 seconds. A year consists of 12 months. If we work backwards from the birth of Adam, who was born on a Friday, a day which we mark as the New Year, then the previous New Year which came 12 months earlier had to fall on a Monday. For 12 times 29 1/2 days and 44 minutes comes to 50 weeks plus four days and some five hours.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1888"><sup>18</sup> Adam was born on a Friday. The day of Adam&#x2019;s birth started a new year.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1893"><sup>23</sup> To the year preceding the birth of Adam and declare the year in which Adam was born a leap year. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that our calendar is accurate. It is based on a 19-year cycle. The 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th year of the cycle are leap years. In those years we add a second month of Adar. According to current calculations the first leap year occurred a year after Adam was born (the third year from creation). If we begin the calendar two years before Adam was born, our calendar would have to be accordingly readjusted. However, we cannot do so, for there was nothing in existence two years before Adam&#x2019;s birth. Hence the calendar must begin a year before the birth of Adam, not before.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1894"><sup>24</sup> A real year and a half following the birth of Adam, for that was the &#x201C;third&#x201D; year from creation. The three years are calculated as follows.

Josh. 5:11 relates: <italic>And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn, in the selfsame day</italic>. This scholar believed that the term <italic>&#x201C;passover&#x201D;</italic> in Josh. 5:11 refers to the 15th of Nisan. Hence <italic>the morrow after the passover</italic> refers to the 16th. This scholar also assumed that the <italic>unleavened cakes and parched corn</italic> came from the new produce. Now, since eating of new produce is forbidden till the <italic>omer</italic> is offered, and Scripture tells us, <italic>And they did eat of the produce of the land</italic>, we must assume that the eating of the new grain was preceded by the offering of the <italic>omer</italic>. We thus see that the <italic>omer</italic> is brought on the 16th of Nisan. Furthermore, Josh. 5:11 shows that <italic>on the morrow after the sabbath</italic> means on the morrow following the first day of the festival.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1956"><sup>86</sup> This is metaphorical. That is, he trapped himself.

<ftnote id="fn1957"><sup>87</sup> Of Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1958"><sup>88</sup> Day of Nisan. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that in Scripture the term Passover is limited to the 14th of Nisan when the Passover sacrifice was offered. The seven days following are referred to as the Festival of Unleavened Bread (<italic>chag ha-matzot</italic>). Thus if we interpret Joshua 5:11 as alluding to the bringing of the <italic>omer</italic>, then we have to assume that the <italic>omer</italic> was brought on the 15th of Nisan, which we today call the first day of Passover. This is not in keeping with Rabbinic tradition. On the contrary, it supports the Karaites, for they believe that the <italic>morrow after the sabbath</italic> in Leviticus 23:16 refers to the first Sunday following the start of Passover. In other words, the Karaites say that in the year that Israel celebrated the first Passover in Canaan, the 15th of Nisan fell on a Sunday and Israel therefore offered the <italic>omer</italic> on that day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1959"><sup>89</sup> The complete clause reads: <italic>And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first of the first month; on the morrow after the passover</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1960"><sup>90</sup> Hence Josh. 5:11 cannot refer to the new grain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1961"><sup>91</sup> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon interprets <italic>And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn</italic> as follows: And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the Passover of the Lord, i.e., the morrow following the 15th day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1962"><sup>92</sup> While the Passover of Israel is on the 14th. The Passover of the Lord falls on the 15th, for that is when God killed the first-born of Egypt. The Passover of Israel falls on the 14th because that is the day that Israel sacrifices the paschal lamb.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1967"><sup>97</sup> Not the morning of the 16th.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1971"><sup>101</sup> If the <italic>omer</italic> was waved on the 15th of Nisan when Israel entered the Land of Israel as the Karaites maintain, when did they harvest the grain to make the unleavened bread? Harvesting is prohibited on a festival.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1973"><sup>103</sup> They could thus not harvest before the <italic>omer</italic> was waved.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2018"><sup>148</sup> A woman who gives birth to a baby girl.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2019"><sup>149</sup> Lev. 12:5 shows that the term week does not apply only to a week which starts on Sunday and concludes on Saturday, for the women who deliver start counting their two weeks from the time of delivery. The same is true of the week which begins when the <italic>omer</italic> is counted. It does not start on a Sunday.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2020"><sup>150</sup> Regarding the festival of Shavu&#x2019;ot. The secret is what follows: All the festivals are contingent on a specific day of the month. Scripture does not give a specific date of the month for the festival of shavu&#x2019;ot (so Weiser). The question arises, what sort of secret is this? This is obvious. It is possible that I.E. is hinting that the establishment of the observance of Shavu&#x2019;ot 50 days from the second day of Passover is not of Pentateuchal origin. The Torah states that the counting of the seven weeks starts from the day <italic>of putting the sickle to the corn</italic>. It does not date when the counting is to begin. See Judah Ha-Levi, <italic>The Book of Kuzari</italic> 3:41, &#x201C;&#x2026;The Synhedrion and all the sages found that this period [of 50 days] was fixed with the intention to create an interval of fifty days between &#x2018;the first fruits of harvest of the barley and the harvest of wheat,&#x2019; and to observe &#x2018;seven weeks,&#x2019; which are seven complete Sabbaths.&#x2019; The first day of the week [<italic>the morrow after the Sabbath</italic>] is only mentioned for argument&#x2019;s sake in the following manner: should the day of putting &#x2018;the sickle to the corn&#x2019; be on a Sunday, you count till Sunday&#x2026;The date of putting of the sickle from which we count is left for us to fix&#x201D; (<italic>The Book of Kuzari</italic>, translated by H. Hirschfeld, N.Y., 1946, p. 153).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2021"><sup>151</sup> It does not state on which day of the month Shavu&#x2019;ot falls.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2022"><sup>152</sup> That is, so that God will accept it from you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2023"><sup>153</sup> In other words, <italic>li-retzonkhem</italic> means willingly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2024"><sup>154</sup> Along with the sheaf. This seems to contradict what came before, for up to now <italic>li-retzonkhem</italic> was interpreted as meaning to be accepted for you. Filwarg suggests emending &#x201C;the meaning of the aforementioned is <span class="underline">not</span> that you shall wave it willingly.&#x201D; Meijler suggests the following: However, the meaning of the aforementioned is that you shall wave it willingly; in other words, our sentence introduces a new interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2025"><sup>155</sup> According to Meijler it means you shall offer a he-lamb willingly so that you will be accepted.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2029"><sup>159</sup> We thus see that Scripture refers to the same lamb by either phrase. There is thus no difference between them; they mean the same.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2030"><sup>160</sup> That when Scripture states, <italic>And ye shall eat neither bread</italic>&#x2026;it refers to bread from the new grain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2031"><sup>161</sup> If our verse refers to bread baked from grain from the previous year, it would not command that unleavened bread be eaten along with the Passover sacrifice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2032"><sup>162</sup> That requires us to count the days between the waving of the <italic>omer</italic> and Shavu&#x2019;ot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2033"><sup>163</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ki-shenot</italic>. Some editions read <italic>bi-shenot</italic>. According to this reading, &#x201C;the counting of days only applies in the days of the Jubilee.&#x201D; In other words, the <italic>omer</italic> is not counted when the Jubilee is not observed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2034"><sup>164</sup> Forty-nine years (seven weeks of years) are counted and the 50th year declared as the year of Jubilee. Similarly, seven weeks would be counted from the offering of the <italic>omer</italic> and the 50th day declared as the festival of Shavu&#x2019;ot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2035"><sup>165</sup> In other words, the Sabbath preceding the day on which the <italic>omer</italic> is waved is not to be considered in the count.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2036"><sup>166</sup> The 50th day is in the count; i.e., Shavu&#x2019;ot does not fall on the 49th day, but on the 50th day. In other words, when the Torah gives a count of days it does not mean up to the last day of the count, it means including the last day mentioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2037"><sup>167</sup> When the Torah tell us to count 50 days and bring an offering, it does not mean to count 50 full days and bring the offering on the 51st day. Similarly, with circumcision, which the Torah requires to be performed on the eighth day from birth. One does not wait till the eighth day is concluded and then perform the rite of circumcision. The ritual is to be performed on the eighth day (Motot). According to Filwarg, I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the Torah tells us to count seven weeks and to offer the sacrifice on the 50<sup>th</sup> day. Similarly, when Scripture requires seven days to pass (as in the case of one experiencing an issue, or a Nazirite who defiled himself) and then to offer a sacrifice, it means count seven days and offer the sacrifice on the eighth day.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2124"><sup>254</sup> Olive branches, branches of wild olive, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of thick trees.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2125"><sup>255</sup> The fact that myrtle branches and branches of thick trees were used in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah to build a <italic>sukkah</italic> does not disprove the Rabbinic tradition that these plants are to be ritually taken in the hand on sukkot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2126"><sup>256</sup> The Karaites claim the &#x201C;boughs of thick trees&#x201D; refers to a plant that grows on tall trees. According to the rabbis the &#x201C;boughs of thick trees&#x201D; refers to the myrtle. The latter does not grow on a tall tree.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2127"><sup>257</sup> <italic>Branches of thick trees</italic> (ale etz avot) (Neh. 8:15) and <italic>boughs of thick trees</italic> (anaf etz avot) are not the exact same plant.

<title>CHAPTER 24</title>
<p>[2. PURE OLIVE OIL.] The reason Scripture now mentions the section<sup><xref rid="fn2142">1</xref></sup> dealing with the pure olive oil is that the Torah earlier recorded the fire offering of each festival<sup><xref rid="fn2143">2</xref></sup> and now has to mention the show bread.<sup><xref rid="fn2144">3</xref></sup> The menorah stood opposite the table.<sup><xref rid="fn2145">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>[4. UPON THE PURE CANDLESTICK.] Scripture in our section adds <italic>upon the pure candlestick</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2146">5</xref></sup> The latter refers to the known candlestick,<sup><xref rid="fn2147">6</xref></sup> which was constructed by Betzalel<sup><xref rid="fn2148">7</xref></sup> and was completely made of gold.<sup><xref rid="fn2149">8</xref></sup> It does not refer to any other candlestick. [As to the menorah], which was made of iron,<sup><xref rid="fn2150">9</xref></sup> it was done so in time of need<sup><xref rid="fn2151">10</xref></sup> by the word of the prophets.<sup><xref rid="fn2152">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THOU SHALT TAKE FINE FLOUR. By command.<sup><xref rid="fn2153">12</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>and bake&#x2026;thereof</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2154">13</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-afita</italic> (and shalt bake) is ultimately accented. It is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn2155">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>[6.] IN TWO ROWS. Corresponding to the number of the tribes.<sup><xref rid="fn2156">15</xref></sup> This is similar to the secret of the ephod and the breastplate.<sup><xref rid="fn2157">16</xref></sup> The<sup><xref rid="fn2158">17</xref></sup> two tenth parts (v. 5) corresponded to the arrangement of the two rows.<sup><xref rid="fn2159">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>UPON THE PURE TABLE. In contrast to the other tables that were there. This table alone was covered with gold and its crown was of gold.<sup><xref rid="fn2160">19</xref></sup> It was the frankincense that was with the bread that served as an offering made by fire unto the Lord. The bread was for the <italic>kohen</italic>. It is possible that Scripture mentioned this section<sup><xref rid="fn2161">20</xref></sup> because there is an obligation on Israel to provide the festival burnt offerings, the oil, and the bread, which was always on the altar.</p>
<p>9. FOR AARON AND HIS SONS. His entire household.</p>
<p>10. AND THE SON OF AN ISRAELITISH WOMAN&#x2026;WENT OUT. From his tent. Compare, <italic>came out, and stood at the door of their tents</italic> (Num. 16:27).</p>
<p>WHOSE FATHER WAS AN EGYPTIAN. Who converted to Judaism.<sup><xref rid="fn2162">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND A MAN OF ISRAEL. <italic>Ve-ish ha-yisra&#x2019;eli</italic> (and a man of Israel) is similar to <italic>le-ish he-ashir</italic> (unto the rich man) (II Sam. 12:4) and to <italic>et yom ha-shevi&#x2019;iy</italic> (the seventh day) (Gen. 2:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2163">22</xref></sup> We do not know why this section<sup><xref rid="fn2164">23</xref></sup> was connected to that which comes before it. Perhaps the blasphemer spoke improperly with regard to the bread, the oil, and the sacrifices.</p>
<p>11. BLASPHEMED. Some say that the meaning of <italic>va-yikkov</italic> (blasphemed) is enunciated. Compare, <italic>Which the mouth of the Lord shall mark out</italic> (yikkavennu) (Is. 62:2) and <italic>that are pointed out</italic> (nikkevu) <italic>by name</italic> (Num. 1:17). Others say that <italic>va-yikkov</italic> is similar to <italic>ekkov</italic> (I curse) in <italic>How shall I curse</italic> (Num. 23:8). However, I believe that the first interpretation is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn2165">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. IN WARD.<sup><xref rid="fn2166">25</xref></sup> In a known place in the camp.<sup><xref rid="fn2167">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND LET ALL THAT HEARD. For he was stoned because of their testimony.</p>
<p>16. ALL THE CONGREGATION. The reference is to the magnates of the land who are the great ones of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2168">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that <italic>Whosoever curseth his God</italic> (v. 15) means whosoever curseth his God in secret.<sup><xref rid="fn2169">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The correct interpretation is as follows. The term <italic>Elohim</italic> (god) is an adjective. The angels are called elohim.<sup><xref rid="fn2170">29</xref></sup> So are the judges.<sup><xref rid="fn2171">30</xref></sup> Who can know what is in the mind of the one who curses? However, if he enunciates the glorious name of God, which stands by itself and is not an adjective and is not intertwined with any noun, [he shall be stoned]. Its meaning is,<sup><xref rid="fn2172">31</xref></sup> when one curses and enunciates the Name he shall be put to death if he enunciates the Name as the son of the Egyptian did.<sup><xref rid="fn2173">32</xref></sup> The Name<sup><xref rid="fn2174">33</xref></sup> is not mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn2175">34</xref></sup> out of respect for God. Scripture reads, <italic>as well the stranger, as the home-born&#x2026;shall be put to death</italic>. It is possible that the ones who quarreled (v. 10) struck each other. This section<sup><xref rid="fn2176">35</xref></sup> was therefore written.<sup><xref rid="fn2177">36</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn2178">37</xref></sup> had previously been mentioned. However, our chapter adds, <italic>as well for the stranger, as for the home-born</italic> (v. 22).</p>
<p>[17. AND HE THAT SMITETH.] Scripture begins<sup><xref rid="fn2179">38</xref></sup> with <italic>and he that smiteth any man mortally</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2180">39</xref></sup> He is not participating in war and deliberately smites any man, be that man a stranger or a native</p>
<p>18. AND HE THAT SMITETH A BEAST MORTALLY SHALL MAKE IT GOOD. Note, the phrase <italic>life for life</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2181">40</xref></sup> serves two verses.<sup><xref rid="fn2182">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. SO SHALL IT BE DONE TO HIM. Samson said, <italic>so have I done unto them</italic> (Jud. 15:11).<sup><xref rid="fn2183">42</xref></sup> The Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn2184">43</xref></sup> brought proof from logic that <italic>breach for breach</italic> (v. 20) cannot be taken literally. The first wound was made unintentionally. How can we justify making a similar wound?<sup><xref rid="fn2185">44</xref></sup> If the wound is in a vital area, the person will die. The same applies to the eye. How are we to do the same to one who injured his neighbor by causing him to suffer the loss of a third of the sight of an eye?<sup><xref rid="fn2186">45</xref></sup> The words of tradition are thus true.<sup><xref rid="fn2187">46</xref></sup> Scripture is to be understood as follows. Ransom money is to be paid in all of these cases. It is fitting to remove his eye if he does not ransom it.<sup><xref rid="fn2188">47</xref></sup> Should one argue against us and say, what happens if the injurer is poor? Then we answer, Scripture speaks about the majority of cases.<sup><xref rid="fn2189">48</xref></sup> It is possible for the poor to become rich.<sup><xref rid="fn2190">49</xref></sup> This also answers those who argue, what shall we do in instances when the injurer of the eye is blind?<sup><xref rid="fn2191">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. SO SHALL IT BE RENDERED UNTO HIM.<sup><xref rid="fn2192">51</xref></sup> There are instances where the <italic>bet</italic> has the meaning of on.<sup><xref rid="fn2193">52</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>the beast that I rode upon</italic> (bah) (Neh. 2:12). There are many such instances. On the other hand, its meaning might be, so shall it be rendered unto him if he does not pay ransom.<sup><xref rid="fn2194">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>[21. AND HE THAT KILLETH A BEAST.] Scripture repeats <italic>And he that killeth a beast&#x2026;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2195">54</xref></sup> because it wants to mention the stranger, for when Scripture speaks of maiming (v. 19) it speaks of an Israelite, for the Torah clearly says,<sup><xref rid="fn2196">55</xref></sup> <italic>his neighbor</italic>. However, there is one law for both the stranger and the native regarding he that kills a person and he that kills a beast.</p>
<p>I have previously informed you that Scripture is being brief when two <italic>cafs</italic> come together.<sup><xref rid="fn2197">56</xref></sup> Scripture also chooses to employ brevity when it does not add &#x201C;and he dies&#x201D; to <italic>u-makkeh adam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2198">57</xref></sup> (and he that killeth a man), for it is known that the culprit is not executed unless the one who is struck dies.</p>
<p>Another interpretation for the repetition<sup><xref rid="fn2199">58</xref></sup> is that Scripture earlier mentions &#x201C;mortally&#x201D; (v. 17).<sup><xref rid="fn2200">59</xref></sup> The latter refers to a blow struck in a vital area. Scripture then lays down<sup><xref rid="fn2201">60</xref></sup> the following general law: A person who kills shall be put to death whether the blow was struck in a vital area or in a non-vital area. The word <italic>nefesh</italic> (mortal) is thus not mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn2202">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>[22. YOUR GOD.] The God of the native and the God of the stranger.</p>
<p>23. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID. They did from this day and onward to one who injures his neighbor, in accordance with this law.</p>

The latter is not to be taken literally, for Samson did not repay his enemies exactly tit for tat.

<ftnote id="fn2184"><sup>43</sup> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2185"><sup>44</sup> The Torah does not distinguish (except for murder) between one who harms his neighbor intentionally and one who harms him unintentionally. This being the case, if someone wounded his neighbor unintentionally, how can we justify making a similar wound in him? It should be noted that Rabbi Saadiah Gaon held that the Torah does not contain laws that contradict reason.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2186"><sup>45</sup> How can we be sure that we are only removing a third of the eye&#x2019;s vision of the one guilty of doing the same to his neighbor?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2187"><sup>46</sup> That <italic>as he hath done, so shall it be done to him</italic> is not to be taken literally. It rather means that he shall make commensurate compensation.</ftnote>

It is known that the word <italic>safi&#x2019;ach</italic> (that which groweth of itself) is connected to the word <italic>sefacheni</italic> (put me)<sup><xref rid="fn2218">16</xref></sup> in <italic>Put me, I pray thee</italic> (I Sam. 3:36).<sup><xref rid="fn2219">17</xref></sup> It is also known that the word <italic>nezirekha</italic> (undressed vine) is related to the word <italic>nazir</italic> (nazirite).<sup><xref rid="fn2220">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>A YEAR OF SOLEMN REST. Its meaning is, because it is a year of solemn rest for the land; that is, the land is not in your possession in this year.</p>
<p>6. AND THE SABBATH-PRODUCE&#x2026;SHALL BE FOR YOU. <italic>Sabbath-produce</italic> refers to all that the land brought out by itself. The meaning of <italic>lakhem</italic> (for you) is, for everyone.<sup><xref rid="fn2221">19</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>lekha</italic> (for thee) is that the owner of the field is permitted to eat of that which grows of itself.<sup><xref rid="fn2222">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND FOR THY CATTLE. Which are under your control.</p>
<p>AND FOR THE BEASTS. Which are not under your control.</p>
<p>9. THEN SHALT THOU MAKE PROCLAMATION WITH THE BLAST OF THE HORN. There is a difference of opinion as to whether the world was created in Nisan or in Tishri.<sup><xref rid="fn2223">21</xref></sup> There is no need to dwell on this, for the transmitters of the law ordained that we are to say in the Rosh Ha-Shanah prayer which they established for us, &#x201C;This day marks the beginning of Your works, it is a memorial of the first day.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2224">22</xref></sup> We also read in Scripture that the <italic>shofar</italic> is to be sounded in the Jubilee year in the month of Tishri at the beginning of the year.<sup><xref rid="fn2225">23</xref></sup> Furthermore,<sup><xref rid="fn2226">24</xref></sup> the Torah, in the portion commanding the people to gather to hear the Torah read states that the Torah is to be read on the festival of Sukkot.<sup><xref rid="fn2227">25</xref></sup> Scripture writes, <italic>that they may hear, and that they may learn</italic> (Deut. 31:12).<sup><xref rid="fn2228">26</xref></sup> It is not possible for this<sup><xref rid="fn2229">27</xref></sup> to take place after half a year has passed.<sup><xref rid="fn2230">28</xref></sup> Furthermore,<sup><xref rid="fn2231">29</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year</italic> (Ex. 23:16). Similarly, <italic>and the feast of the ingathering at the turn of the year</italic> (Ex. 34:22).<sup><xref rid="fn2232">30</xref></sup> The faithful proof is the Sabbatical year, regarding which it is written, <italic>ye shall not sow</italic> (v. 11). They start sowing in the month of Marcheshvan in the Land of Israel. If the beginning of the year started in Nisan, then they would not harvest that which they sowed in the sixth year<sup><xref rid="fn2233">31</xref></sup> and they would not sow,<sup><xref rid="fn2234">32</xref></sup> for it is the Sabbatical year. Since they will not harvest<sup><xref rid="fn2235">33</xref></sup> what they planted in the sixth year, they will not sow twice.<sup><xref rid="fn2236">34</xref></sup> However, Scripture states that they should not sow in the seventh year alone.<sup><xref rid="fn2237">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Judah Ha-Parsi<sup><xref rid="fn2238">36</xref></sup> said that Israel employed a solar calendar.<sup><xref rid="fn2239">37</xref></sup> Now if this were so [then we do not know the exact time that a year begins] for, note, Moses did not explain the length of a complete year and so far the astronomers are unable to bring the length of a solar year to light. For example, the wise men of India add a fifth of an hour to the quarter of the day.<sup><xref rid="fn2240">38</xref></sup> Ptolemy and his friends say that 1/300 of the day is missing.<sup><xref rid="fn2241">39</xref></sup> This is close to that of the intercalated calendar. Those who came after him said one part of 106.<sup><xref rid="fn2242">40</xref></sup> Others said 110.<sup><xref rid="fn2243">41</xref></sup> Still others said 130.<sup><xref rid="fn2244">42</xref></sup> There are those who say 180.<sup><xref rid="fn2245">43</xref></sup> For there are those who calculate the year when the sun concludes a cycle around the constellations from a visible point.<sup><xref rid="fn2246">44</xref></sup> Others calculate it from a point on the sphere which inclines to the right and the left.<sup><xref rid="fn2247">45</xref></sup> We need tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn2248">46</xref></sup> Furthermore, the meaning of the word <italic>chodesh</italic> (month) contradicts the Persian.<sup><xref rid="fn2249">47</xref></sup> The Sadducees<sup><xref rid="fn2250">48</xref></sup> say that the Jewish religion is based on a lunar year.</p>
<p>Note, there is no year at all to the moon.<sup><xref rid="fn2251">49</xref></sup> However, as the sun has no months, the calculators<sup><xref rid="fn2252">50</xref></sup> sought<sup><xref rid="fn2253">51</xref></sup> a number of months close to that of a solar year.<sup><xref rid="fn2254">52</xref></sup> They found them to be 12.<sup><xref rid="fn2255">53</xref></sup> The calculators<sup><xref rid="fn2256">54</xref></sup> sought a number of days for the month<sup><xref rid="fn2257">55</xref></sup> that would be close to the number of days into which a lunar month is divided. Our months are therefore lunar months and our years return<sup><xref rid="fn2258">56</xref></sup> at the end of a solar year.<sup><xref rid="fn2259">57</xref></sup> Our sages therefore transmitted to us a law given to Moses from Sinai that the Bet Din always made seven leap years in every cycle<sup><xref rid="fn2260">58</xref></sup> even though they used to establish every month by sighting the moon.<sup><xref rid="fn2261">59</xref></sup> The secret of the cycle<sup><xref rid="fn2262">60</xref></sup> is known from the science of the stars.<sup><xref rid="fn2263">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>shall ye make proclamation</italic> is that they should sound the <italic>shofar</italic> in all the roads.<sup><xref rid="fn2264">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND YE SHALL HALLOW THE FIFTIETH YEAR. All the inhabitants with regard to working the land.<sup><xref rid="fn2265">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>LIBERTY. The meaning of the word <italic>deror</italic> is known. It means liberty. <italic>As the flying swallow</italic> (deror) (Prov. 26:2) refers to a small bird that produces music when it is free.<sup><xref rid="fn2266">64</xref></sup> However, if it is taken captive it refuses to eat and starves to death.</p>
<p>JUBILEE. The word <italic>yovel</italic> (Jubilee) means sent.<sup><xref rid="fn2267">65</xref></sup> The sages, of blessed memory, said that the meaning of <italic>yovel</italic> is a lamb. <italic>Shoferot ha-yovelim</italic> (rams&#x2019; horns) (Josh. 6:4) is proof of the latter. The year<sup><xref rid="fn2268">66</xref></sup> is called by the name of the <italic>shofar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2269">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BE UNTO YOU.] To the Israelites alone.</p>
<p>AND YE SHALL RETURN EVERY MAN UNTO HIS POSSESSION. As Scripture goes on to explain,<sup><xref rid="fn2270">68</xref></sup> in the year of Jubilee the land that is sold shall return to its owners.<sup><xref rid="fn2271">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND YE SHALL RETURN EVERY MAN UNTO HIS FAMILY. The servant<sup><xref rid="fn2272">70</xref></sup> sold to an Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn2273">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. A JUBILEE SHALL THAT FIFTIETH YEAR BE. Since it is the year of Jubilee you shall not sow.</p>
<p>12. IT SHALL BE HOLY UNTO YOU. For it is distinguished from the other years.</p>
<p>YE SHALL EAT THE INCREASE THEREOF OUT OF THE FIELD. You shall eat what the land produces of itself. It is the same as is written regarding the Sabbatical year.<sup><xref rid="fn2274">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. IN THIS YEAR OF JUBILEE. Its meaning is in the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>14. OR BUY. <italic>Kanoh</italic> (buy) is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn2275">73</xref></sup> A word is missing.<sup><xref rid="fn2276">74</xref></sup> <italic>Kanoh</italic> is in place of <italic>kenitem kano</italic> (you will surely buy).<sup><xref rid="fn2277">75</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>zakhor</italic> (remember) in <italic>Remember the sabbath day</italic> (Ex. 20:8).<sup><xref rid="fn2278">76</xref></sup> There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2279">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>timkeru</italic> (thou sell) is in the plural because it shall be sold in front of witnesses.<sup><xref rid="fn2280">78</xref></sup> The same is true of <italic>al tonu</italic> (ye shall not wrong).<sup><xref rid="fn2281">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>[15. ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF YEARS.] Only according to the number of years.</p>
<p>16. THOU SHALT INCREASE THE PRICE THEREOF. The reverse of <italic>thou shalt diminish</italic>.</p>
<p>[17. AND YE SHALL NOT<sup><xref rid="fn2282">80</xref></sup> WRONG ONE ANOTHER.] This is to be understood as a warning to the seller,<sup><xref rid="fn2283">81</xref></sup> for the first injunction<sup><xref rid="fn2284">82</xref></sup> is directed to the buyer.<sup><xref rid="fn2285">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD. As I am your God, I will exact punishment from the two of them,<sup><xref rid="fn2286">84</xref></sup> from the one who wrongs his neighbor. If you observe My statutes the earth will bring forth its produce. Scripture mentions this<sup><xref rid="fn2287">85</xref></sup> because it earlier spoke of the number of crops<sup><xref rid="fn2288">86</xref></sup> (v. 16).</p>
<p>[20. OUR INCREASE.] The Sadducees<sup><xref rid="fn2289">87</xref></sup> say that <italic>our increase</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2290">88</xref></sup> proves that the year begins in Nisan.<sup><xref rid="fn2291">89</xref></sup> This is no proof, for it is possible that the meaning of <italic>our increase</italic> is what the earth produces of itself.<sup><xref rid="fn2292">90</xref></sup> If they<sup><xref rid="fn2293">91</xref></sup> say that what the earth produces of itself is not called <italic>tevu&#x2019;ah</italic> (increase)<sup><xref rid="fn2294">92</xref></sup> but <italic>safi&#x2019;ach</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2295">93</xref></sup> then <italic>ye shall eat the increase thereof</italic> (tevu&#x2019;atah) <italic>out of the field</italic> (v. 12) contradicts them.<sup><xref rid="fn2296">94</xref></sup> Furthermore, let them inform us how the Israelites were to act in the Jubilee year, for they would not sow in the sixth, seventh,<sup><xref rid="fn2297">95</xref></sup> and eighth year.<sup><xref rid="fn2298">96</xref></sup> They would only sow in the ninth year and harvest in the tenth. Why didn&#x2019;t Scripture mention this, for Scripture only mentions <italic>for the three years</italic> (v. 21).<sup><xref rid="fn2299">97</xref></sup> It appears to me that the meaning of <italic>and it shall bring forth produce</italic> (v. 21) is, I will place a blessing on the sixth year<sup><xref rid="fn2300">98</xref></sup> that it will be sufficient for the sixth and an additional year.<sup><xref rid="fn2301">99</xref></sup> However, in the Jubilee year there will be food for three years and no more.<sup><xref rid="fn2302">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>[21. AND IT SHALL BRING FORTH.] The word <italic>ve-asat</italic> (and it shall bring forth) is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn2303">101</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ministered</italic> (mesharat) <italic>unto the king</italic> (I Rings 1:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2304">102</xref></sup> Scripture reads thus because it drops one of the <italic>tavs</italic> to simplify enunciation when two <italic>tavs</italic> are joined.</p>
<p>22. THE OLD STORE. The word <italic>yashan</italic> (the old store) adverts to the word <italic>min</italic> (of).<sup><xref rid="fn2305">103</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>min</italic> (of) is, of the very thing. Similarly, <italic>with</italic> (min) <italic>the ark-cover</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2306">104</xref></sup> <italic>shall ye make the cherubim</italic> (Ex. 25:19).</p>
<p>23. IN PERPETUITY. The word <italic>tzemitut</italic> (perpetuity) is similar<sup><xref rid="fn2307">105</xref></sup> to <italic>keritut</italic> (divorcement) (Is. 50:1). The <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2308">106</xref></sup> is a root letter. <italic>Tzemitut</italic> is related to the word <italic>yatzmitem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2309">107</xref></sup> (will cut them off) in <italic>The Lord will cut them off</italic> (Ps. 94:23).<sup><xref rid="fn2310">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR THE LAND IS MINE. This is an important reason.<sup><xref rid="fn2311">109</xref></sup> Moses similarly said in his prayer, <italic>Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling-place</italic> (ma&#x2019;on) (Ps. 90:1). [The meaning of the latter is, God, You are like a permanent dwelling-place. However, <italic>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh</italic> (Eccles. 1:4).</p>
<p>24. THE LAND OF YOUR POSSESSION. Which you inherited in the land of Canaan. Also in the land of the Amorite.<sup><xref rid="fn2312">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. BE WAXEN POOR. <italic>Yamukh</italic> (be waxen poor) comes from a root which consists of two stem letters that are sounded and one silent letter placed between them.<sup><xref rid="fn2313">111</xref></sup> Its meaning is poor and destitute.<sup><xref rid="fn2314">112</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT IS NEXT UNTO HIM. From his family.</p>
<p>27. THEN LET HIM COUNT. The word <italic>ve-chishav</italic> (then let him count) is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2315">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. IT SHALL GO OUT.<sup><xref rid="fn2316">114</xref></sup> That which is sold shall go out. Note, a noun<sup><xref rid="fn2317">115</xref></sup> is used in place of an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn2318">116</xref></sup> There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2319">117</xref></sup> Since Scripture states <italic>a dwelling-house in a walled city</italic> (v. 29),<sup><xref rid="fn2320">118</xref></sup> we know that <italic>and sell some of his possession</italic> (v. 25) refers to a field or a vineyard.</p>
<p>29. IN A WALLED CITY. A city surrounded by a wall.<sup><xref rid="fn2321">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>A FULL YEAR. The word <italic>yamim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2322">120</xref></sup> means a year. <italic>Yamim</italic> means until the days return to their point of departure after completing their cycle of cold and hot, summer and winter, for the return of the sun to its place<sup><xref rid="fn2323">121</xref></sup> is the cause of this cycle.<sup><xref rid="fn2324">122</xref></sup> Now, we need tradition as to what determines a full year,<sup><xref rid="fn2325">123</xref></sup> whether it is a solar year, or a lunar year, or an intercalated year.<sup><xref rid="fn2326">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. SHALL BE RECKONED WITH THE FIELDS OF THE COUNTRY. <italic>Al</italic> (with) in our verse is similar to <italic>al</italic> (and) in <italic>And they came, both men and</italic> (al) <italic>women</italic> (Ex. 35:22).<sup><xref rid="fn2327">125</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>al</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2328">126</xref></sup> is with.<sup><xref rid="fn2329">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEY MAY BE REDEEMED.<sup><xref rid="fn2330">128</xref></sup> The reference is to each and every house.<sup><xref rid="fn2331">129</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Its branches</italic> (banot) <italic>run</italic> (tza&#x2019;adah<sup><xref rid="fn2332">130</xref></sup>) <italic>over the wall</italic> (Gen. 49:22), and <italic>for her children</italic>, (baneha) <italic>Because they are not</italic> (enennu) (Jer. 31:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2333">131</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. A PERPETUAL RIGHT OF REDEMPTION. <italic>Olam</italic> (a perpetual right) means forever.</p>
<p>Scripture reads, <italic>va-asher yigal</italic> (and if a man purchase)<sup><xref rid="fn2334">132</xref></sup> (v. 33), because our verse reads <italic>ge&#x2019;ulat olam</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2335">133</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>yigal</italic> is shall purchase. There are those who say <italic>va-asher yigal</italic> means even if the redeemer is a Levite.<sup><xref rid="fn2336">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-yatza</italic> (then&#x2026;shall go out) (v. 33) has the same meaning as the unaspirated <italic>fa</italic> in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn2337">135</xref></sup></p>
<p>A house and a city (v. 33) have one law.<sup><xref rid="fn2338">136</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. AND HIS MEANS FAIL. The word <italic>u-matah</italic> (and&#x2026;fail) is related to the word <italic>yimmot</italic> (he shall&#x2026;be moved) in <italic>he shall never be moved</italic> (Ps. 112:6). The <italic>mem</italic> is a root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn2339">137</xref></sup> Similarly, the word <italic>matah</italic> (slippeth) in <italic>If I say: My foot slippeth</italic> (Ps. 94:18).</p>
<p>THY BROTHER. An Israelite.</p>
<p>WITH THEE. For you are obligated to the one who is found with you, the one that you see.</p>
<p>AS A STRANGER AND A SETTLER. If he is from your country or is a stranger and a settler.<sup><xref rid="fn2340">138</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHALL HE LIVE. <italic>Va-chai</italic> (shall he live) means he shall live.</p>
<p>THEN THOU SHALT UPHOLD HIM. The reverse of <italic>and his means fail</italic> (matah).<sup><xref rid="fn2341">139</xref></sup> You shall uphold him so that he does not fall.</p>
<p>36. INTEREST&#x2026;OR INCREASE. These terms<sup><xref rid="fn2342">140</xref></sup> are explained in the words of tradition. The <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>tarbit</italic> (increase) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn2343">141</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>tarmit</italic> (deceitful) (Zeph. 3:13).<sup><xref rid="fn2344">142</xref></sup> <italic>Tarbit</italic> is related<sup><xref rid="fn2345">143</xref></sup> to the word <italic>rav</italic> (many).<sup><xref rid="fn2346">144</xref></sup> However, it is a verb that comes from a root whose last letter is silent and hidden.<sup><xref rid="fn2347">145</xref></sup> It is similar<sup><xref rid="fn2348">146</xref></sup> to the word <italic>takhlit</italic> (utmost)<sup><xref rid="fn2349">147</xref></sup> in <italic>utmost hatred</italic> (Ps. 139:22). Scripture next<sup><xref rid="fn2350">148</xref></sup> explains the terms <italic>neshekh</italic> (increase) and <italic>tarbit</italic> (increase). The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>marbit</italic> (increase) (v. 37) is also superfluous. It is like the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>maskit</italic> (figured)<sup><xref rid="fn2351">149</xref></sup> in <italic>any figured stone</italic> (Lev. 26:1).</p>
<p>38. [I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD, WHO BROUGHT YOU FORTH OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT.] Where you were strangers. Note, I gave you an inheritance. Our verse is connected in meaning to <italic>as a stranger and a settler shall he live with thee</italic> (v. 35).<sup><xref rid="fn2352">150</xref></sup> It is also connected to the already mentioned section,<sup><xref rid="fn2353">151</xref></sup> for it<sup><xref rid="fn2354">152</xref></sup> deals with the redemption of the land. Scripture mentions the section containing <italic>and his means fail with thee</italic> (v. 35) because it will go on to state that an Israelite who is in such great need that he sells himself<sup><xref rid="fn2355">153</xref></sup> shall go out in the year of Jubilee.<sup><xref rid="fn2356">154</xref></sup> All the sections of the Torah portion are thus connected.</p>
<p>39. AND SELL HIMSELF UNTO THEE. He sells himself to you or he stole from you and he was sold by the Bet Din.</p>
<p>41. HE AND HIS CHILDREN WITH HIM. The transmitters of tradition based themselves on this verse when they explained the meaning of <italic>and he shall serve him for ever</italic> (Ex. 21:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2357">155</xref></sup></p>
<p>42. [FOR THEY ARE MY SERVANTS.] Because I bought them from the house of bondage.</p>
<p>43. THOU SHALT NOT RULE OVER HIM. <italic>Tirdeh</italic> means you shall rule.</p>
<p>WITH RIGOR. <italic>Be-farech</italic> (with rigor) is to be explained as the Aramaic translator does.<sup><xref rid="fn2358">156</xref></sup></p>
<p>44. OF THE NATIONS THAT ARE ROUND ABOUT YOU. Such as Amon, Moab, Edom, and Aram.</p>
<p>45. MOREOVER OF THE CHILDREN OF THE STRANGERS THAT DO SOJOURN AMONG YOU. Who dwell in the land of Canaan, which is your country, and they are from the nations that are mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn2359">157</xref></sup> Or the reference is to Egypt and every nation aside from the seven nations,<sup><xref rid="fn2360">158</xref></sup> for Scripture commanded regarding the aforementioned, <italic>thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth</italic> (Deut. 20:16). Note, it is prohibited to even feed them.<sup><xref rid="fn2361">159</xref></sup> It is possible that when the sages, of blessed memory, spoke of a Canaanite slave<sup><xref rid="fn2362">160</xref></sup> they spoke of someone who lived in Canaan, not of a person of Canaanite ancestry. On the other hand, it is possible that the sages were able to ascertain the truth of the matter,<sup><xref rid="fn2363">161</xref></sup> for our mind is insignificant when measured against their minds.<sup><xref rid="fn2364">162</xref></sup></p>
<p>46. AND YE MAY MAKE THEM AN INHERTANCE. <italic>Ve-hitnachaltem</italic> (and ye may make them an inheritance) is a <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic>. Similarly, <italic>ve-hitavvitem</italic> (and ye shall mark out a line) in and <italic>ye shall mark out your line</italic> (Num. 34:10).</p>
<p>OF THEM MAY YE TAKE YOUR BONDMEN FOR EVER. One is permitted to do so. However, since we find that the sages say that it is a commandment to do so, we accept what they say.<sup><xref rid="fn2365">163</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BUT OVER YOUR BRETHREN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] Its meaning is, you will make a difference between your brother and the stranger.</p>
<p>47. OR TO THE OFFSHOOT. <italic>Eker</italic> (offshoot) means a root. The reference is to a person who accepted the Jewish religion. He himself is from the family of a stranger. The word <italic>eker</italic> has no neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn2366">164</xref></sup> However, it is similar in meaning to <italic>ve-shereshkha</italic> (and root thee out) (Ps. 52:7). It means the opposite of its stem.<sup><xref rid="fn2367">165</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>te&#x2019;akker</italic> (thou shalt hough) in <italic>thou shalt hough their horses</italic> (Josh 11:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2368">166</xref></sup></p>
<p>49. OR IF HE BE WAXEN RICH. He found a lost object or he inherited the money of a deceased member of his family. Scripture first mentions the brother and the family<sup><xref rid="fn2369">167</xref></sup> because that is what is most usually the case.<sup><xref rid="fn2370">168</xref></sup></p>
<p>50. HIM THAT BOUGHT HIM. <italic>Konehu</italic> (him that bought him) has the same meaning whether spelled with a <italic>heh</italic> or not.<sup><xref rid="fn2371">169</xref></sup></p>
<p>HE SOLD HIMSELF. <italic>Himakhero</italic> (he sold himself) is an infinitive<sup><xref rid="fn2372">170</xref></sup> in the <italic>nifal</italic>. The years that he was with his master shall be like the days of a hired man.<sup><xref rid="fn2373">171</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 26</title>
<p>1. YE SHALL MAKE YOU NO IDOLS. Scripture speaks of an Israelite who was sold to a non-Jew.<sup><xref rid="fn2385">1</xref></sup> It therefore warns the Israelite against the worship of idols. He (the Israelite slave) must not serve his master in anything relating to an idol. The Israelite shall also not serve his master on the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn2386">2</xref></sup> The foreigner can purchase an Israelite only under these conditions.</p>
<p>2. AND REVERENCE MY SANCTUARY. By coming to the sanctuary during the three pilgrimage festivals.</p>
<p>It is possible that Scripture states <italic>Ye shall make you no idols</italic> because Scripture had earlier stated, <italic>they are My servants</italic> (Lev. 25:55). Now, since they are My servants they shall serve Me alone and not other gods.</p>
<p>NEITHER&#x2026;A GRAVEN IMAGE. The meaning of <italic>pesel</italic> (a graven image) is known.</p>
<p>OR A PILLAR. For a graven image.<sup><xref rid="fn2387">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>FIGURED. <italic>Maskit</italic> (figured) is a noun. It is similar to <italic>marbit</italic> (increase) (Lev. 25:36).<sup><xref rid="fn2388">4</xref></sup> <italic>Maskit</italic> refers to a stone with figures on it. It is related to the word <italic>maskiyyot</italic> (imaginations) in <italic>the imaginations of their heart</italic> (Ps. 73)<sup><xref rid="fn2389">5</xref></sup> and <italic>sekhiyyot</italic> (imagery) in <italic>delightful imagery</italic> (Is. 2:16).</p>
<p>NEITHER SHALL YE PLACE&#x2026;IN YOUR LAND. This<sup><xref rid="fn2390">6</xref></sup> is the way pagans worship Mercury.</p>
<p>FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD. You shall bow to Me. It<sup><xref rid="fn2391">7</xref></sup> is so explained in the Jerusalem Targum.<sup><xref rid="fn2392">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>YE SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS. The Sabbatical years.</p>
<p>AND REVERENCE MY SANCTUARY. The year of Jubilee, for Scripture clearly states, <italic>it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2393">9</xref></sup> <italic>shall be holy unto you</italic> (Lev. 25:12).</p>
<p>I believe that Scripture employs <italic>My sabbaths</italic> in the sense of <italic>And from one sabbath to another, Shall all flesh come to bow before Me</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2394">10</xref></sup> (Is. 66:23),<sup><xref rid="fn2395">11</xref></sup> for Scripture mentions <italic>to bow down unto it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2396">12</xref></sup> (v. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn2397">13</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>Ye shall keep My sabbaths</italic> is you shall come every Sabbath to bow before Me, and not to a stone with figures on it. You shall come to My sanctuary alone. Note, Scripture mentions the chosen day,<sup><xref rid="fn2398">14</xref></sup> for this day, as I have previously noted,<sup><xref rid="fn2399">15</xref></sup> was chosen for the worship of God. Scripture also mentions the chosen place.<sup><xref rid="fn2400">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>for I am the Lord</italic> is, for I rested from all work on the Sabbath and My glory dwells in the sanctuary. Scripture therefore says <italic>and reverence</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2401">17</xref></sup></p>
<h1>BE-CHUKKOTAI</h1>
<p>3. IF YE WALK IN MY STATUTES, AND KEEP&#x2026;AND DO. This is a commandment to study, to teach, and to observe.</p>
<p>[4. THEN I WILL GIVE.] The <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>ve-natati</italic> (then I will give) is like the <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>ve-ha&#x2019;aretz</italic> (now the earth) in <italic>Now the earth was unformed and void</italic> (Gen. 1:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2402">18</xref></sup> When a word which has a <italic>vav</italic> prefixed to it<sup><xref rid="fn2403">19</xref></sup> is ultimately accented,<sup><xref rid="fn2404">20</xref></sup> the word is an imperfect. When it is penultimately accented it is in the perfect. The above is, aside from a few instances, always the case.</p>
<p>HER PRODUCE. The word <italic>yevulah</italic> (her produce) is related to the word <italic>vul</italic> (food) in <italic>Surely the mountains bring him forth food</italic> (Job 40:20). We do not know whether the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>yevul</italic> is a root letter or is like the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>yekum</italic> (living substance) (Gen.7:23),<sup><xref rid="fn2405">21</xref></sup> which is not a root letter.</p>
<p>5. THRESHING SHALL REACH UNTO THE VINTAGE. Note, <italic>when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field</italic> (Ex. 23:16) is now explained as meaning from the field and the vineyard.<sup><xref rid="fn2406">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>YE HAVE ENOUGH. <italic>Sova</italic> (enough) is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn2407">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>SAFELY. <italic>La-vetach</italic> (safely) has the same meaning whether spelled with a <italic>lamed</italic> or not.<sup><xref rid="fn2408">24</xref></sup> The same is true of the word <italic>levadad</italic> (alone) (Num. 23:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2409">25</xref></sup> Note, Scripture mentions <italic>sova</italic> (enough) first,<sup><xref rid="fn2410">26</xref></sup> for that is most important.</p>
<p>Scripture states, <italic>and dwell in your land safely</italic>, because people wander from their place in days of famine. Its meaning is similar to <italic>it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be</italic> (Gen. 4:12).</p>
<p>6. AND I WILL GIVE PEACE IN THE LAND. Among yourselves.</p>
<p>AND NONE SHALL MAKE YOU AFRAID. No evil beast and no enemy.<sup><xref rid="fn2411">27</xref></sup> On the contrary, you will chase your enemies and they shall fall before you. The greater wonder shall be that a small number of you shall pursue a large number of your enemies. I have previously informed you in my book <italic>Moznayim</italic> that ten, one hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand are round numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn2412">28</xref></sup> It is customary for one who magnifies a number to say &#x201C;one to ten.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2413">29</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>but thou art worth ten thousand of us</italic> (II Sam 18:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2414">30</xref></sup> Scripture here mentions that a hundred shall be chased by five.<sup><xref rid="fn2415">31</xref></sup> Note, Scripture doubled the number used by the one who magnifies.<sup><xref rid="fn2416">32</xref></sup> Each one of a hundred Israelites shall chase a hundred of their enemies.<sup><xref rid="fn2417">33</xref></sup> There are those who say that Scripture adds to the number because the number is increased when the individuals come together.<sup><xref rid="fn2418">34</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>How should one chase a thousand</italic> (Deut. 32:30).<sup><xref rid="fn2419">35</xref></sup> There is no need for this.<sup><xref rid="fn2420">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND YOUR ENEMIES SHALL FALL. This is stated a second time.<sup><xref rid="fn2421">37</xref></sup> The repetition indicates that they will fall time after time. They will not rise again.</p>
<p>9. AND I WILL HAVE RESPECT UNTO YOU. To greatly increase your wealth, to make you fruitful, and to multiply you with sons and daughters. It appears to me that <italic>and make you fruitful</italic> is the reverse of <italic>the barren womb</italic> (Prov. 30:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2422">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WILL ESTABLISH MY COVENANT WITH YOU. In that you will be <italic>as the stars of heaven for multitude</italic> (Deut.1:11) and <italic>as the dust of the earth</italic> (Gen. 13:16).</p>
<p>10. AND YE SHALL EAT OLD STORE LONG KEPT. Amazingly, even though you shall be numerous there shall be so much produce that whoever will want to, shall eat from the old store and also from the old store long kept, which is older than the old store. The word <italic>noshan</italic> (long kept) is a <italic>nifal</italic>. There will be those who shall remove the old store from their house to make room for the new produce, for they will have no place to store it.<sup><xref rid="fn2423">39</xref></sup> There is a commentator who says that the meaning of <italic>and ye shall bring forth</italic> is you shall take it out to the field.<sup><xref rid="fn2424">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND I WILL SET MY TABERNACLE. You will not fear that you might ever lack anything, for My glory shall dwell among you. I am not like a human being who abhors to dwell in one place.<sup><xref rid="fn2425">41</xref></sup> Furthermore, when you go into the land of your enemies<sup><xref rid="fn2426">42</xref></sup> and the temple is no longer among you,<sup><xref rid="fn2427">43</xref></sup> My glory shall go with you. Note, I shall be your God. You shall be My people, for I took you out of the land of Egypt for that purpose.</p>
<p>13. AND I HAVE BROKEN THE BARS OF YOUR YOKE. Scripture employs the metaphor of a plowing bullock<sup><xref rid="fn2428">44</xref></sup> that works the land of its owner, for Israel was forced to work as slaves in improving the land. The latter is clearly stated.<sup><xref rid="fn2429">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>UPRIGHT. <italic>Kommemiyyut</italic> means upright. The empty heads say that there are more curses than blessings. However, they do not speak the truth. What Scripture does is to speak of the blessings in general terms. However, it lists the curses in detail in order to frighten and scare the listeners. What I say will be clear to the one who reads the text carefully.</p>
<p>14. ALL THESE COMMANDMENTS. These that are written.<sup><xref rid="fn2430">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. BUT BREAK. The word <italic>le-hafrekhem</italic> (but break) is grammatically irregular,<sup><xref rid="fn2431">47</xref></sup> for the forms of verbs change.<sup><xref rid="fn2432">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND I WILL APPOINT&#x2026;OVER YOU. As one who is appointed over another does whatever he wants, to him.</p>
<p>TERROR&#x2026;EVEN CONSUMPTION AND FEVER. Common diseases. The meaning of <italic>et</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2433">49</xref></sup> (even) is &#x201C;with&#x201D;. The meaning of <italic>behalah</italic> (terror) is that you will be terrified and will not know what to do. There are those who say that <italic>behalah</italic> (terror) means suddenly.<sup><xref rid="fn2434">50</xref></sup> Many say that <italic>shachefet</italic> (consumption) and <italic>kadachat</italic> (fever) are diseases of the seed like blasting<sup><xref rid="fn2435">51</xref></sup> and mildew,<sup><xref rid="fn2436">52</xref></sup> for Scripture clearly states that the latter are such diseases (Amos 4:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2437">53</xref></sup> They say this<sup><xref rid="fn2438">54</xref></sup> because our verse states, <italic>and ye shall sow your seed in vain</italic>. However, there is no need for this,<sup><xref rid="fn2439">55</xref></sup> for the meaning of our verse is that they shall be struck with illnesses<sup><xref rid="fn2440">56</xref></sup> and if marauders shall come to the villages they shall then eat their seed, for there will not be anyone to go out and scatter the raiders.<sup><xref rid="fn2441">57</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>that shall make the eyes to fail</italic> is that these diseases will darken the eyes and languish the soul. The <italic>alef</italic> is missing in the word <italic>medivot</italic> (languish) in and <italic>the soul to languish</italic>. It is similarly missing in the word <italic>mezin</italic> (giveth ear) in <italic>And a liar giveth ear</italic> (Prov.17:4). Some say that <italic>the eyes to fail</italic> speaks of the eyes of the body<sup><xref rid="fn2442">58</xref></sup> because it goes on to say <italic>and the soul to languish</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2443">59</xref></sup> However, there is no need for this interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn2444">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND I WILL SET MY FACE AGAINST YOU. My wrath and My anger.<sup><xref rid="fn2445">61</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>and her countenance</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2446">62</xref></sup> <italic>was no more</italic> (I Sam. 1:18).<sup><xref rid="fn2447">63</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is that those that remain and are not stricken by disease will be smitten before their enemies, should they go out to fight them. At other times they will flee when no one pursues them as in the case of the Aramean camp.<sup><xref rid="fn2448">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND IF YE WILL NOT YET FOR THESE THINGS. The plagues.</p>
<p>SEVEN. The number seven is used for &#x201C;many&#x201D; because it is a complete number.<sup><xref rid="fn2449">65</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>For a righteous man falleth seven times</italic> (Prov. 24:16); <italic>While the barren hath born seven</italic> (I Sam. 2:5). <italic>Al chatatekhem</italic> (for your sins) does not add the number seven to each sin.<sup><xref rid="fn2450">66</xref></sup> Its meaning is, I will punish you again for each sin. <italic>Ve-yasafti</italic> (then &#x2026;more) is similar to <italic>yasaf</italic> (more) in <italic>and it went on no more</italic> (Deut. 5:19). The meaning of <italic>al chatatekhem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2451">67</xref></sup> is, because of your sins. Some say that the number seven is to be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn2452">68</xref></sup> However, the first interpretation<sup><xref rid="fn2453">69</xref></sup> is correct, for if we count <italic>And I will break&#x2026;</italic>(v. 19) as one; <italic>your heaven as iron</italic> (v. 19) as two; <italic>and your earth as brass</italic> (v. 19);<sup><xref rid="fn2454">70</xref></sup> <italic>And your strength shall be spent in vain</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2455">71</xref></sup> (v. 20); <italic>for your land&#x2026;her produce</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2456">72</xref></sup> (v. 20); <italic>the trees of the land&#x2026;their fruit</italic> (v. 20), then we have six. Note, the plague of <italic>beast of the field</italic> (v. 22) makes seven.<sup><xref rid="fn2457">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THE PRIDE OF YOUR POWER. The satiated,<sup><xref rid="fn2458">74</xref></sup> as in <italic>But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked</italic> (Deut. 32:15). When the proud are broken they fall and are brought low.</p>
<p>20. AND YOUR STRENGTH SHALL BE SPENT IN VAIN. The strength which you expended in working the soil.</p>
<p>21. CONTRARY. Many say that the meaning of <italic>keri</italic> (contrary) is power and might. You will act like a person who hardens his heart and is not afraid that he will be defeated.<sup><xref rid="fn2459">75</xref></sup> The word <italic>keri</italic> has no neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn2460">76</xref></sup> Other say that the word <italic>keri</italic> is related to <italic>korot</italic> (befallen) in <italic>all that had befallen</italic> (Gen. 42:29). Its meaning is found in what Scripture says in the account of the Philistines wherein we read, <italic>it is not His hand that smote us; it was a chance</italic> (mikreh) <italic>that happened to us</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2461">77</xref></sup> (I Sam. 6:9). According to both interpretations the word <italic>keri</italic> is missing a <italic>bet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2462">78</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>sheshet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2463">79</xref></sup> (six) in <italic>for in six days</italic> (Ex. 20:11).<sup><xref rid="fn2464">80</xref></sup> Or, <italic>ve-im telekhu immi keri</italic> (and if you walk contrary unto Me) is to be read as if written <italic>ve-im telekhu immi halikhat keri</italic> (if you walk, a contrary walk, unto Me).<sup><xref rid="fn2465">81</xref></sup> I have already shown you many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2466">82</xref></sup> Note, our verse reads <italic>according to your sins</italic>. God will not add to the sins.<sup><xref rid="fn2467">83</xref></sup> <italic>Al chatatekhem</italic> (for your sins) (v. 18) is connected to <italic>le-yasserah etkhem</italic> (chastise you). The meaning of <italic>al chatatekhem</italic> (for your sins)<sup><xref rid="fn2468">84</xref></sup> is because of your sins.</p>
<p>22. AND I WILL SEND&#x2026;AMONG YOU. <italic>Ve-hishlakhti</italic> (and I will send) is related to the word <italic>mashli&#x2019;ach</italic> (send) in <italic>behold, I will send</italic> (Ex.8: 17).<sup><xref rid="fn2469">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHICH SHALL ROB YOU OF YOUR CHILDREN. By killing your little ones.</p>
<p>AND MAKE YOU FEW IN NUMBER. By the death of adults.</p>
<p>AND YOUR WAYS SHALL BECOME DESOLATE. For there will be no way that will be secure from the fear of wild animals.<sup><xref rid="fn2470">86</xref></sup> I have previously explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn2471">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. YE WILL NOT BE CORRECTED. <italic>Tivvaseru</italic> (be corrected) is a <italic>nifal</italic> imperfect.<sup><xref rid="fn2472">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. FOR YOUR SINS. <italic>Al chatatekhem</italic> (for your sins) is connected to <italic>ve-hikketi</italic> (and I will smite).<sup><xref rid="fn2473">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. THE VENGEANCE OF THE COVENANT. Our verse mentions the covenant.<sup><xref rid="fn2474">90</xref></sup> On the basis of this I earlier said<sup><xref rid="fn2475">91</xref></sup> that our Torah portion contains the covenant referred to in the Torah reading <italic>Now these are the ordinances</italic> (Ex. 21:1). The covenant was made on the day Israel promised [<italic>All that the Lord hath spoken</italic>] <italic>will we do, and obey</italic> (Ex. 24:7). The covenant was then made and Moses told them this portion.<sup><xref rid="fn2476">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND YE SHALL BE GATHERED TOGETHER WITHIN YOUR CITIES. Because of the sword.<sup><xref rid="fn2477">93</xref></sup> There I will send the pestilence and the famine. The pestilence and the famine will cause you to desire to be delivered into the hand of the enemy. This is the meaning of <italic>and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. Ve-nittattem</italic> (and ye shall be delivered) is a <italic>nifal</italic>.</p>
<p>26. WHEN I BREAK. <italic>Shivri</italic> (I break) is an infinitive. It is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2478">94</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>shikhvah</italic> (she lay down) in <italic>when she lay down, nor when she arose</italic> (Gen. 19:33).<sup><xref rid="fn2479">95</xref></sup> The Torah employs the term <italic>break</italic> because it speaks of the <italic>staff of bread</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2480">96</xref></sup> The latter is a metaphor. We find that Isaiah employs the phrase <italic>stay</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2481">97</xref></sup> <italic>of bread</italic> (Is.3:1), for bread <italic>stays man&#x2019;s heart</italic> (Ps. 104:15).</p>
<p>TEN WOMEN. Scripture says <italic>ten women</italic>, for ten is the last of the numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn2482">98</xref></sup> It was the custom of Israel for each family to bake<sup><xref rid="fn2483">99</xref></sup> one oven full of bread for them to eat for the entire week.<sup><xref rid="fn2484">100</xref></sup> The arrangement of the Sabbath bread<sup><xref rid="fn2485">101</xref></sup> is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn2486">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY SHALL DELIVER YOUR BREAD AGAIN BY WEIGHT. For it will consist of a small amount.<sup><xref rid="fn2487">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND YE SHALL EAT, AND NOT BE SATISFIED. There are hungry people who are satisfied by eating a little amount of food. However, you will not be satisfied from eating much food.<sup><xref rid="fn2488">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND&#x2026;FOR ALL THIS. By being smitten by this plague. <italic>And if in&#x2026;these things</italic> (v. 23) similarly means, and if because of the previously mentioned plagues.</p>
<p>28. FOR YOUR SINS. This is connected to <italic>and I also will chastise you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2489">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND YE SHALL EAT THE FLESH OF YOUR SONS&#x2026; There is no famine worse than this one.<sup><xref rid="fn2490">106</xref></sup> You will not have a place to cry out and pray to be saved from the famine, for I will destroy your high places, the place of the sacrifices.</p>
<p>30. YOUR SUN-PILLARS. <italic>Chammnekhem</italic> is related to the word <italic>chammah</italic> (sun).<sup><xref rid="fn2491">107</xref></sup> <italic>Chammnekhem</italic> refers to structures built for the purpose of bowing down to the sun. The <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>chammnekhem</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn2492">108</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>rachamaniyyot</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2493">109</xref></sup> (compassion) in <italic>women full of compassion</italic> (Lam. 4:10).</p>
<p>YOUR CARCASSES. <italic>Pigrekhem</italic> means your carcasses. Compare, <italic>As a carcass</italic> (peger) <italic>trodden under foot</italic> (Is. 14:19).</p>
<p>YOUR IDOLS. <italic>Gillulekhem</italic> (your idols) is a disparaging term for idols. <italic>Gillulekhem</italic> is related to the word <italic>galal</italic> (dung) in <italic>sweepeth away dung</italic> (I Kings 14:10).<sup><xref rid="fn2494">110</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is that when Israel joins themselves to temples dedicated to idol worship they will be killed there and their enemies will destroy the images of their idols. I (God) will not help them.</p>
<p>AND MY SOUL SHALL ABHOR YOU. The divine presence shall be removed and your cities will then be destroyed and your sanctuaries desolated. <italic>Your sanctuaries</italic> (v. 31) refers to the temples, which were at first My (God&#x2019;s) sanctuaries.<sup><xref rid="fn2495">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. AND I WILL NOT SMELL THE SAVOR OF YOUR SWEET ODORS. Scripture states this for the heaven and earth are full of God&#x2019;s glory.<sup><xref rid="fn2496">112</xref></sup> Scripture writes with regard to Noah, <italic>And the Lord smelled the sweet savor</italic> (Gen. 8:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2497">113</xref></sup> Its meaning is,<sup><xref rid="fn2498">114</xref></sup> I will not accept a burnt offering from you after this.<sup><xref rid="fn2499">115</xref></sup> After stating <italic>your cities</italic> and <italic>your sanctuaries</italic>, Scripture mentions the land. The reference is to all of the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>32. SHALL BE ASTONISHED AT IT. There will be so much destruction that the enemies who dwell there will also be astonished. Our verse is in contrast to <italic>The joy of the whole earth</italic> (Lam. 2:15).</p>
<p>33. WILL I SCATTER. <italic>Ezareh</italic> (will I scatter) is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>. Not only will you be scattered but <italic>I will also draw out the sword after you</italic>. The meaning of <italic>draw out</italic> is draw out from its sheath.</p>
<p>AND YOUR LAND. This is connected to the verse which follows it. Its meaning is, when your land shall be desolate it will then be paid for its Sabbaths.<sup><xref rid="fn2500">116</xref></sup> The word <italic>tirtzeh</italic> means pay. Compare, <italic>Till he shall accomplish</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2501">117</xref></sup> (yirtzeh), <italic>as a hireling, his day</italic> (Job 14:6); <italic>That her guilt is paid off</italic> (nirtzah) (Is. 40:2).</p>
<p>34. HER SABBATHS. Sabbatical years and Jubilees. It is similarly written, <italic>until the land had been paid her sabbaths</italic> (II Chron. 36:21). I have explained it there.<sup><xref rid="fn2502">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>DESOLATE. <italic>Hashammah</italic> (desolate) is a noun. The forms of the nouns change.<sup><xref rid="fn2503">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies&#x2019; land</italic> is that the land will be desolate, for you will not inhabit it. Then the land will not be worked and it will find rest and complete its Sabbaths.</p>
<p>[35. AS LONG AS IT LIETH DESOLATE.] The meaning of <italic>as long as it lieth desolate</italic> is, the number of years that it shall not be worked. This is explained in Ezekiel.<sup><xref rid="fn2504">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. AND AS FOR THEM THAT ARE LEFT OF YOU. Scripture says this because it previously stated, <italic>and I will draw out the sword after you</italic> (v. 33).<sup><xref rid="fn2505">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>A FAINTNESS. <italic>Morekh</italic> (faintness) comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn2506">122</xref></sup> Similarly, the word <italic>mo&#x2019;al</italic> (lifting up) in <italic>with the lifting up of their hands</italic> (Neh. 8:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2507">123</xref></sup> The word <italic>morekh</italic> is related to the word <italic>rakh</italic> (faint) in <italic>and faint-hearted</italic> (Deut. 20:8). They will be so scared that the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them. <italic>Niddaf</italic> (driven) is an adjective in the <italic>nifal</italic>. The root <italic>nun</italic> is swallowed.<sup><xref rid="fn2508">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. ONE UPON ANOTHER. Whom he loves.</p>
<p>TO STAND. <italic>Tekumah</italic> (stand) is a <italic>hifil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2509">125</xref></sup> It comes from a root whose middle root letter is a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2510">126</xref></sup> The aforementioned is so because of the <italic>tav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2511">127</xref></sup> It is the same case with the word <italic>terumah</italic> (offering).<sup><xref rid="fn2512">128</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. SHALL EAT YOU UP. It is the norm for most of those exiled to other places to die because of the effect that the change in the air and the water has upon them.</p>
<p>39. AND THEY THAT ARE LEFT. And from those that are left.</p>
<p>[SHALL PINE AWAY.] <italic>Yimmakku</italic> (shall pine away) follows the form of <italic>yissabbu</italic> (turned) in <italic>they turned not</italic> (Ezek. 1:9). Both words come from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn2513">129</xref></sup> <italic>Yimmakku</italic> is related to the word <italic>hamak</italic> (consume away) in <italic>Their flesh shall consume away</italic> (Zech. 14:12) and <italic>mak</italic> (rottenness) in <italic>there shall be rottenness</italic> (Is. 3:24).</p>
<p>AND ALSO IN THE INIQUITIES OF THEIR FATHERS SHALL THEY PINE AWAY WITH THEM. Its meaning is like that of <italic>Our fathers have sinned</italic> (Lam. 5:7). I explained this in my commentary on Lamentations.<sup><xref rid="fn2514">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. AND THEY SHALL CONFESS. <italic>Ve-hitvaddu</italic> (and they shall confess) is a <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic>.</p>
<p>IN THEIR TREACHERY WHICH THEY COMMITTED AGAINST ME. Which their fathers committed against Me.</p>
<p>AND ALSO THAT THEY HAVE WALKED CONTRARY UNTO ME. These, their children, have walked contrary unto Me.</p>
<p>41. I ALSO. Did the same thing to them.<sup><xref rid="fn2515">131</xref></sup> I punished them by bringing them into the land of their enemies until their uncircumcised heart will be humbled. I will explain it<sup><xref rid="fn2516">132</xref></sup> later.</p>
<p>THEY THEN BE PAID THE PUNISHMENT OF THEIR INIQUITY. <italic>Yirtzu</italic> (be paid) means they will compensate and pay.</p>
<p>42. THEN WILL I REMEMBER MY COVENANT. <italic>My covenant</italic> is to be read as if written twice. <italic>Then will I remember My covenant with Jacob</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2517">133</xref></sup> is to be interpreted as if written, Then will I remember My covenant, My covenant with Jacob. Compare, <italic>even the prophesy, Oded the prophet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2518">134</xref></sup> (II Chron. 15:8), which is to be read as if written, even the prophesy, the prophesy of Oded the prophet; <italic>your heads, your tribes</italic> (Deut. 29:9), which is to be read as if written, your heads, the heads of your tribes.</p>
<p>The Gaon says that the reason Scripture mentions Jacob first<sup><xref rid="fn2519">135</xref></sup> is that all of his years were in the covenant.<sup><xref rid="fn2520">136</xref></sup></p>
<p>43. FOR THE LAND SHALL LIE FORSAKEN WITHOUT THEM. This means I will also remember the land that paid off its Sabbaths and was forsaken without them. I will also remember that they paid for their sin.</p>
<p>BECAUSE, EVEN BECAUSE. The first <italic>because</italic> corresponds to <italic>they rejected Mine ordinances</italic>. The second one corresponds to <italic>and their soul abhorred My statutes</italic>. The <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ve-ya&#x2019;an</italic> (even because) is superfluous. It is like the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ba-rishonah</italic> (in the beginning) (Gen. 13:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2521">137</xref></sup></p>
<p>44. AND YET FOR ALL THAT. <italic>Ve-af gam zot</italic> (and yet for all that) is an elegant phrase.<sup><xref rid="fn2522">138</xref></sup> One word would have sufficed. We find this in all of Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2523">139</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ha-rak akh be-mosheh</italic> (hath indeed&#x2026;only with Moses) (Num. 12:2);<sup><xref rid="fn2524">140</xref></sup> <italic>ha-mibbeli en kevarim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2525">141</xref></sup> (because there were no graves) (Ex. 14:11).</p>
<p>I WILL NOT REJECT THEM&#x2026;TO DESTROY THEM UTTERLY. But I will punish them until their hearts are humbled.</p>
<p>NEITHER WILL I ABHOR THEM. <italic>Ge&#x2019;altim</italic> (will I abhor them) means I did not turn away from them.<sup><xref rid="fn2526">142</xref></sup> Or, it means I did not abhor them.</p>
<p>TO BREAK MY COVENANT. Which I made with them by oath. Even though, as Scripture states, they broke My covenant, I will not break My covenant with them, for I am the Lord.</p>
<p>45. BUT I WILL FOR THEIR SAKES REMEMBER. Forever.</p>
<p>THE COVENANT OF THEIR ANCESTORS.<sup><xref rid="fn2527">143</xref></sup> The reference is to the covenant made at Sinai. Scripture refers to this generation as &#x201C;the first,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2528">144</xref></sup> in contrast to their descendants who will be exiled in the land of their enemies. Some say that the reference is to the &#x201C;patriarchs of the world,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2529">145</xref></sup> and the meaning of <italic>whom I brought forth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2530">146</xref></sup> is those to whom I swore that I would free their children from slavery. The first interpretation appears to me to be the correct one.</p>
<p>46. THESE ARE THE STATUTES AND ORDINANCES. These statutes and ordinances are recorded in the Torah portion <italic>Now Jethro&#x2026;heard</italic> (Ex. 18:1); <italic>Now these are the ordinances</italic> (Ex. 21:1), and <italic>In mount Sinai</italic> (Lev. 25:1).</p>
<p>WHICH THE LORD MADE BETWEEN HIM AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. This alludes to the covenant made at Sinai, for after the tabernacle was erected and the glory was present in the tent of meeting, Moses did not ascend Mount Sinai. Scripture also mentions the section of valuations here because it was related to Moses at Mount Sinai. The latter is clearly stated at the end of the portion.<sup><xref rid="fn2531">147</xref></sup> For<sup><xref rid="fn2532">148</xref></sup> the beginning of the Book of Numbers, <italic>And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting</italic> (Num. 1:1), is similar<sup><xref rid="fn2533">149</xref></sup> to the opening of the Book of Leviticus.<sup><xref rid="fn2534">150</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2385"><sup>1</sup> Lev. 25:47-55.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2386"><sup>2</sup> Hence the Sabbath was mentioned in verse 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2387"><sup>3</sup> According to I.E. Scripture only prohibited a pillar made for the purpose of idol worship. See I.E. on Deut. 16:22 (Vol. 5, p. 117).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2388"><sup>4</sup> Both words are nouns that come from a root that end in a <italic>heh</italic> and have similar forms. The root of <italic>maskit</italic> is <italic>sin, kaf, heh</italic>. The root of <italic>marbit</italic> is <italic>resh, bet, heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2389"><sup>5</sup> That which their hearts see.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2393"><sup>9</sup> The year of Jubilee.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2394"><sup>10</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2395"><sup>11</sup> In other words, <italic>My sabbaths</italic> refers to the seventh day of the week, not to the Sabbatical year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2396"><sup>12</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr.</italic> 38 and Filwarg. <italic>Mikra&#x2019;ot Gedolot</italic> reads, and not (<italic>ve-lo</italic>) because Scripture mentioned <italic>to bow down unto it</italic>. The reading in <italic>Mikra&#x2019;ot Gedolot</italic> is very hard to explain and appears to be in error. See Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2397"><sup>13</sup> <italic>To bow down unto it</italic> indicates that <italic>My sabbaths</italic> refers to the seventh day of the week, not to the Sabbatical year. For Is. 66:2 tells us that the Sabbath is the time that people are to come and bow before the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2398"><sup>14</sup> The Sabbath.</ftnote>

I.E.&#x2019;s point is that if a person wants to exaggerate &#x201C;ones,&#x201D; he says ten; if he wants to exaggerate tens, he says a hundred; to exaggerate hundreds he says a thousand; if he wants to exaggerate thousands, he says ten thousand.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2413"><sup>29</sup> If one wants to say that one person shall pursue many, one says he shall pursue ten. If one wants to say that a hundred shall pursue many, one says one hundred shall pursue a thousand, and so forth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2414"><sup>30</sup> Ten thousand is not to be taken literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2415"><sup>31</sup> The usual way of making the point that Scripture is making is to say that ten shall pursue a hundred.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2416"><sup>32</sup> If ten chase a hundred, then five chase fifty. However, Scripture tells us that five shall purse a hundred. Hence it doubles the amount that the Israelites would pursue.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2417"><sup>33</sup> For Scripture states, <italic>and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2418"><sup>34</sup> Five Israelites shall chase a hundred of their enemies but a hundred Israelites shall chase ten thousand of their enemies because a hundred Israelites fighting together can achieve a greater victory per person than five Israelites fighting together.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2538"><sup>4</sup> They read (<italic>be-erkekha</italic>) as if written <italic>be-erekh</italic>. Our verse literally reads: When a man shall clearly utter a vow of lives according to your valuation (<italic>be-erkekha</italic>) of lives to the Lord. The word &#x201C;your&#x201D; does not seem to belong in the verse. Hence these commentaries interpret the verse as follows: When a man shall clearly utter a vow of lives according to the valuation (<italic>be-erkekh</italic>) of lives to the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2539"><sup>5</sup> <italic>In thy valuation</italic> refers to the <italic>kohen</italic>. This commentator explains our verse as follows: When a man shall clearly utter a vow of lives in accordance to what you the <italic>kohen</italic> shall value lives to the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2540"><sup>6</sup> The first mentioned commentaries interpret <italic>ke-erkekha ha-kohen</italic> as if written <italic>ke-erkekh ha-kohen</italic> because they believe that the <italic>kaf</italic> suffix of <italic>be-erkekha</italic> (according to thy evaluation) is superfluous, for if the <italic>kaf</italic> of <italic>be-erkekha</italic> refers to the <italic>kohen</italic>, then the word <italic>ha-kohen</italic> is redundant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2541"><sup>7</sup> If the <italic>kaf</italic> of <italic>be-erkekha</italic> refers to the <italic>kohen</italic>, then the word <italic>ha-kohen</italic> is redundant. Hence the interpretation that <italic>ha-kohen</italic> does not mean the <italic>kohen</italic> but <italic>O kohen</italic>. This interpretation renders <italic>ke-erkekha ha-kohen</italic> as, <italic>as thou O priest valuest it</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2542"><sup>8</sup> The definite article is not placed before a word with a suffix, for <italic>he-erkekha</italic> literally reads, the valuation yours. Thus the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>he-erkekha</italic> is irregular.

He-erkekha</italic> is similarly to be read as if written <italic>he-erekh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2543"><sup>9</sup> <italic>Ha-oholi</italic> (of my tent) is irregular, for it is a noun with a suffix with the definite article prefixed to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2544"><sup>10</sup> It means, the valuation-yours.

<ftnote id="fn2564"><sup>30</sup> Or the meaning of <italic>even unto twenty years old</italic> is, after a day into the twentieth year.

I.E.&#x2019;s point is that it is not clear whether <italic>even unto twenty</italic> means even unto the completion of 20 or from the start of the age of 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2565"><sup>31</sup> As it is with regard to other laws such as Bar Mitzvah.</ftnote>

This means that the thirtieth day is considered less than 30 days; the fifth year is considered under the age of five. The twentieth year is considered under the age of 20; the sixtieth year is considered under the age of 60. Also according to the Mishnah five <italic>shekalim</italic> are given from a month onward through the age of five, and 15 <italic>shekalim</italic> from the age of five complete years through the age of 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2567"><sup>33</sup> Saadiah Gaon states that one gives a <italic>shekel</italic> per year from one month on.

Scripture should have simply said that a <italic>shekel</italic> per year is given from one month until the age of 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2568"><sup>34</sup> According to Scripture a child of a month is valuated. However, according to Rabbi Saadiah Gaon a <italic>shekel</italic> is given per year for the first 20 years.

<ftnote id="fn2586"><sup>52</sup> For that is the literal meaning of our clause.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2588"><sup>54</sup> That is, and he (the <italic>kohen</italic>) shall set him before the <italic>kohen</italic> is poetic.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2589"><sup>55</sup> That is, <italic>ve-he&#x2019;emido</italic> (literally, and he shall set him) refers to the one who vows.

<ftnote id="fn2593"><sup>59</sup> This is to be understood as follows: We find a similar divine decree with regard to the monetary value of a slave. A slave is valued at 30 <italic>shekalim</italic>. (Ex. 21:32). It makes no difference whether the slave in reality is worth more or less than the latter. Similarly with a field.

Verse 20 reads, <italic>And</italic> (ve) <italic>if he&#x2026;will not redeem the field</italic>. According to I.E. verses 19 and 20 continue the thought of the earlier verses. Hence the <italic>vav</italic> is not to be translated, and our verses should be interpreted: If he&#x2026;will indeed redeem it&#x2026; Or if he&#x2026;will not redeem the field.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2602"><sup>68</sup> Not &#x201C;and if he hath sold&#x201D;. In other words, the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-im</italic> (or if) is not to be rendered as and.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2603"><sup>69</sup> After the year of the Jubilee.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2604"><sup>70</sup> Scripture employs the same term, <italic>yatza</italic> (goeth out), with regard to this field, which does not revert to its owner but becomes the property of the Lord, as it does with regard to a field which goes back to its owner.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2618"><sup>84</sup> The first-born of an unclean beast.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2619"><sup>85</sup> Like any other unclean beast, for unlike the first-born of an ass it does not require redemption.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2620"><sup>86</sup> If he dedicates the first-born of an ass.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2621"><sup>87</sup> In addition to its valuation. Normally a first-born ass is redeemed by a sheep. However, if one dedicates the first-born ass he redeems it by giving its value in money. This is in addition to the sheep which he has to give. According to I.E. when the first-born of an ass is redeemed by a lamb, the value of the lamb given in exchange for the ass must be commensurate with the value of the ass.

<ftnote id="fn2625"><sup>91</sup> Our verse speaks of objects devoted to God (<italic>cherem</italic>). So does Num. 21:2. The devoted cities spoken of in Numbers did not belong to the Israelites. Similarly the object in our verse. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
