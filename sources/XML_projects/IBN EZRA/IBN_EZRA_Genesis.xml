<h1>BERESHIT</h1>
<p>1. IN THE BEGINNING. Our wise men<sup><xref rid="fn104">1</xref></sup> taught that the letter <italic>bet</italic> (of <italic>bereshit</italic>, in the beginning) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn105">2</xref></sup> They compare it to the <italic>bet</italic> in the word <italic>ba-rishonah</italic> (at the first) (Genesis 13:4). We know the <italic>bet</italic> in <italic>ba-rishonah</italic> to be superfluous for we find <italic>they shall set forth first</italic> (rishonah) (Numbers 2:9).<sup><xref rid="fn106">3</xref></sup> However, if this were so the <italic>bet</italic> (of <italic>bereshit</italic>) would be vocalized with a long <italic>kamatz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn107">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other scholars maintain that the word <italic>bereshit</italic> is always in the construct and its meaning in our verse is: &#x201C;In the beginning of the evening, or of the night, or of the darkness.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn108">5</xref></sup> However, they have overlooked <italic>And he chose a first part</italic> (reshit) <italic>for himself</italic> (Deuteronomy 33:21).<sup><xref rid="fn109">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>bereshit</italic> is a preposition.<sup><xref rid="fn110">7</xref></sup> They explain that Scripture intends to preclude the thought that heaven and earth were preexisting. Hence it states, <italic>In the beginning</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn111">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that <italic>bereshit</italic> is in the construct, as in <italic>In the beginning of</italic> (bereshit) <italic>the reign of Jehoiakim</italic> (Jeremiah 26:1).<sup><xref rid="fn112">9</xref></sup> Don&#x2019;t ask, how can a word in the construct be connected to a verb in the perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn113">10</xref></sup> This presents no problem, for we find that very case in the verse <italic>When the Lord spoke at first with Hosea</italic> (Hosea 1:2),<sup><xref rid="fn114">11</xref></sup> and in the verse <italic>the city where David encamped</italic> (Isaiah 29:1).<sup><xref rid="fn115">12</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>bereshit</italic> will be explained in our comments on the next verse.<sup><xref rid="fn116">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>CREATED. Most Biblical commentators explain that the word <italic>bara</italic> (created) indicates creation <italic>ex nihilo</italic>. <italic>But if the Lord make</italic> (yivra) <italic>a new thing</italic> (beri&#x2019;ah) (Num. 16:30) is similar. However, they have overlooked <italic>And God created</italic> (va-yivra) <italic>the great sea monsters</italic><sup><xref rid="fn117">14</xref></sup> (Gen. 1:21) and the three times the word created is used in one verse, viz., <italic>And God created</italic> (va-yivra) <italic>man in His own image, in the image of God created</italic> (bara) <italic>He him; male and female created</italic> (bara) <italic>He them</italic> (Gen. 1:27). They also failed to consider <italic>I form the light, and create darkness</italic> (Is. 45:7) wherein darkness, which is the opposite of light, an existing entity, is described by the prophet as being created.<sup><xref rid="fn118">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following is the precise explanation of the word <italic>bara</italic>. <italic>Bara</italic> has two meanings, one of which has been noted above.<sup><xref rid="fn119">16</xref></sup> The second<sup><xref rid="fn120">17</xref></sup> is found in the verse <italic>neither did he eat</italic> (bara) <italic>bread with them</italic> (II Samuel 12:17). However, in the latter case, an <italic>alef</italic> has been substituted for a <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn121">18</xref></sup> The reason is that <italic>bara</italic> (in I Sam. 12:17) is similar to <italic>le-havrot</italic> (to urge to eat) in <italic>And all the people came to cause David to eat</italic> (le-havrot) <italic>bread</italic> (II Sam. 3:35). The verb <italic>le-havrot</italic> appears in the <italic>hifil</italic> (and its root ends with <italic>heh</italic>), for if it ended with an <italic>alef</italic>, Scripture would have read <italic>le-havri</italic>, as in <italic>to make yourselves fat</italic> (le-havri&#x2019;achem) <italic>with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel</italic> (I Sam. 2:29).</p>
<p>We also find <italic>bara</italic> conjugated in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>, as in <italic>and cut down</italic> (u-vereta) <italic>for thyself (trees)</italic> (Joshua 17:15). This is not like the similar word <italic>beru</italic> in <italic>choose</italic> (beru) <italic>you a man for you</italic> (I Sam. 17:8) but rather like <italic>bare</italic> (hack, dispatch) in <italic>and dispatch them</italic> (u-vare) <italic>with their swords</italic><sup><xref rid="fn122">19</xref></sup> (Ezekiel 23:47).</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>bara</italic> is to cut or to set a boundary. The intelligent person will understand what I am alluding to.<sup><xref rid="fn123">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>GOD. <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) is a plural. We know this because we come across the singular form <italic>Elo&#x2019;ah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn124">21</xref></sup> <italic>Elohim</italic> is employed stylistically. Every language has honorific terminology. In the non-Hebrew tongues when an inferior addresses a superior he employs the plural. In Arabic it is customary for a dignitary such as a king to speak in the plural. In Hebrew, too, it is considered a sign of dignity to employ the plural when speaking of a superior. Such is the case with the words <italic>adonim</italic> (lords) and <italic>be&#x2019;alim</italic> (owners). Thus Scripture says, <italic>a cruel lord</italic> (adonim) (Is. 19:4),<sup><xref rid="fn125">22</xref></sup> and <italic>and the owner thereof</italic> (be&#x2019;alav) <italic>shall accept it</italic> (Exodus 22:10).<sup><xref rid="fn126">23</xref></sup> The terms <italic>alav</italic> (upon him), <italic>elav</italic> (to him), and <italic>adav</italic> (unto him) are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn127">24</xref></sup> It is for this reason that Scipture reads <italic>bara Elohim</italic> and not <italic>bare&#x2019;u Elohim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn128">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>We know from the study of logic that speech is called <italic>safah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn129">26</xref></sup> because it is seen to come from the lips. Similarly man&#x2019;s highest soul is called heart (<italic>lev</italic>) even though the soul itself is incorporeal while the heart is corporeal. It is referred to in this manner because the heart is its first resting place. Similarly God is called <italic>Elohim</italic> because His actions are executed via angels who do His will and who are referred to as <italic>Elohim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn130">27</xref></sup> I will explain part of the secret of God&#x2019;s name when I comment on <italic>for My name is in him</italic> (Ex. 23:21).</p>
<p>Pay no heed to the opinion of Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who holds that man is superior to the angels. I have already explained to you in <italic>The Book of Foundation</italic> that all of his proofs are wrong. We know that the prophets are the most exalted human beings. Nevertheless, the prophet Joshua fell upon his face and prostrated himself before God&#x2019;s angel and said to him, <italic>What saith my lord unto his servant</italic> (Josh. 5:14).<sup><xref rid="fn131">28</xref></sup> The same is true of the prophets Zechariah and Daniel.<sup><xref rid="fn132">29</xref></sup> Why should I elaborate when this point is so elementary?</p>
<p>The meaning of Lord of Hosts (<italic>Elohe ha-tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic>) is the same as <italic>God of gods</italic> (<italic>Elohe ha-Elohim</italic>) (Deut. 10:17).<sup><xref rid="fn133">30</xref></sup> The definition of <italic>elohim</italic> (lord) is angels.<sup><xref rid="fn134">31</xref></sup> People engaged in the dispensation of God&#x2019;s justice are also called <italic>elohim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn135">32</xref></sup> <italic>Elohim</italic> is an adjective, not a proper noun.<sup><xref rid="fn136">33</xref></sup> It is not found conjugated in the perfect or imperfect.<sup><xref rid="fn137">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>One should not assume that angels are composed of fire and air because Scripture states, <italic>Who makest winds Thy messengers, The flaming fire Thy ministers</italic> (Psalms 104:4).<sup><xref rid="fn138">35</xref></sup> This is not the literal meaning of this verse. David (in Psalm 104) speaks first of creation. He starts with light and says, <italic>Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment</italic> (Ps. 104:2). He then goes on to say, <italic>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain</italic>, heaven referring to the firmament upon which is water, fire, snow and wind. David next says that the wind serves as God&#x2019;s agent; i.e., it goes wherever God sends it. He speaks in a similar vein of fire as one of God&#x2019;s ministers.<sup><xref rid="fn139">36</xref></sup> David then says, <italic>Who didst establish the earth upon its foundations</italic> (Ps. 104:5), which refers to dry land. Similarly it is written, <italic>Stormy wind, fulfilling His word</italic> (Ps. 148:8).<sup><xref rid="fn140">37</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Et</italic> indicates the very thing. It signifies the direct object, as in <italic>the heaven</italic> (et ha-shamayim).<sup><xref rid="fn141">38</xref></sup> However, sometimes it is omitted, as in <italic>that God created man</italic> (Deut. 4:32). It is also found placed before the subject, as in <italic>and when there came a lion, or</italic> (ve-et) <italic>a bear</italic> (I Sam. 17:34). However, the latter usage is very rare. Furthermore, <italic>et</italic> is used in place of with or from.<sup><xref rid="fn142">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE HEAVEN. The definite article (<italic>ha</italic>) is placed before heaven (<italic>shamayim</italic>) to indicate that Scripture speaks of the heaven visible to man.<sup><xref rid="fn143">40</xref></sup> Heaven (<italic>shamayim</italic>) is always written in the plural.<sup><xref rid="fn144">41</xref></sup> It is possible that <italic>its dominion</italic> in <italic>Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens</italic>? <italic>Canst thou establish its dominion over the earth</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn145">42</xref></sup> (Job 38:33) refers to the dominion exercised by each one of the heavenly spheres.<sup><xref rid="fn146">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>shamayim</italic> (heaven) is high and above, as it is in Arabic, a language akin in form to Hebrew. There is also a heaven of heavens.<sup><xref rid="fn147">44</xref></sup> The word for heaven (<italic>shamayim</italic>) is never written in the singular.<sup><xref rid="fn148">45</xref></sup> It is like the words millstone (<italic>rechayim</italic>) and noon (<italic>tzohorayim</italic>). Those who are well-versed in geometry will understand these secrets.<sup><xref rid="fn149">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon says that the earth may be compared to a point and the heaven to a thread circling it. Since Scripture tells us that heaven and earth were created, we deduce from this that all their contents, such as fire and water, were also created.<sup><xref rid="fn150">47</xref></sup> Others say that the earth includes water and the heaven air.<sup><xref rid="fn151">48</xref></sup> However, in my opinion the heaven and earth spoken of in our verse refer only to the firmament and the dry land.<sup><xref rid="fn152">49</xref></sup> For only one thing was created on each day. Thus light was created on the first day, the firmament on the second, plants on the third, luminaries on the fourth, and living creatures on the fifth and the sixth. This interpretation is borne out by the psalm quoted above (Psalm 104).</p>
<p>It is impossible to maintain that the line circling the dot was created before the dot, or the dot before the circle. Hence our sages say that heaven and earth were created simultaneously.<sup><xref rid="fn153">50</xref></sup> They offer as proof of their viewpoint, <italic>Yea, My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, And My right hand hath spread out the heavens; When I call unto them, They stand up together</italic> (Is. 48:13).<sup><xref rid="fn154">51</xref></sup> However, this proof is questionable. The plain meaning of this verse is not so, for how could God address that which was not yet created?<sup><xref rid="fn155">52</xref></sup> How could He call to that which was in a chaotic state? The explanation of this verse is as follows: I, God, created heaven and earth. When I call them, they stand before Me as servants ready to do My will. The meaning of this verse is similar to that of <italic>Thy word standeth fast in heaven</italic> (Ps. 119:89). After stating this the Psalmist makes mention of the earth (Ps. 119:90). He then goes on to say that heaven and earth stand ready to execute any commands that God will direct to them (Ps. 119:91).</p>
<p>2. NOW THE EARTH. The word <italic>ha-aretz</italic> (the earth) is irregular in that it is always vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath both the <italic>heh</italic> and the <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn156">53</xref></sup> It is unlike the word <italic>ha-elef</italic> (the thousand) in <italic>Thou, O Solomon, shall have the thousand</italic> (ha-elef) (Canticles 8:12); or <italic>ha-even</italic> (the stone) in <italic>and this stone</italic> (ha-even) (Gen. 28:22).<sup><xref rid="fn157">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNFORMED. Saadiah Gaon claims that the word <italic>tohu</italic> (unformed) is a derivative of <italic>tehom</italic> (the deep). This explanation is incorrect because the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>tehom</italic> is a root letter<sup><xref rid="fn158">55</xref></sup> like the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>hadom</italic> (footstool).<sup><xref rid="fn159">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>Sefer Yetzirah</italic> explains <italic>tohu</italic> (unformed) and <italic>bohu</italic> (void) as follows: <italic>Tohu refers to the green line</italic>; <italic>bohu</italic> alludes to the smooth stones.<sup><xref rid="fn160">57</xref></sup> However, the correct meaning of these terms is found in the Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch.<sup><xref rid="fn161">58</xref></sup> We similarly read, <italic>And in the waste</italic> (tohu), <italic>a howling wilderness</italic> (Deut. 32:10), and <italic>go after vain things</italic> (tohu) (I Sam. 12:21), which means worshipping things that have no substance.<sup><xref rid="fn162">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>[VOID.] <italic>Bohu</italic> is a synonym of <italic>tohu</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>vavs</italic> of <italic>tohu</italic> and <italic>bohu</italic> are in place of a <italic>heh</italic>. They are like the <italic>vav</italic> in (<italic>va-yishtachu</italic>) (and he bowed)<sup><xref rid="fn163">60</xref></sup> and the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>achu</italic> (reed-grass) in <italic>They fed in the reed-grass</italic> (achu) (Gen. 41:2).<sup><xref rid="fn164">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of our verses is this: When the creation of the firmament and the dry land took place, the earth was uninhabited because it was covered with water. God created the earth in such a way that by the laws of nature it would be below the waters.<sup><xref rid="fn165">62</xref></sup> Do not reject this interpretation because of the <italic>vav</italic> that is placed before the words <italic>the earth</italic> (<italic>ve-ha-aretz</italic>), for its meaning is identical to that of the Arabic <italic>fa</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn166">63</xref></sup> The <italic>vav</italic> placed before the word mist (<italic>ed</italic>) in <italic>but there went up a mist</italic> (ve-ed) <italic>from the earth</italic> (Gen. 2:6)<sup><xref rid="fn167">64</xref></sup> is analogous.</p>
<p>Our verses are to be so interpreted because Moses did not speak of the eternal world, which is the world of the angels; he spoke only of the transient world.<sup><xref rid="fn168">65</xref></sup> How can those who say that the word heaven in the first verse refers to the highest heavens explain the presence of the earth in the same verse?<sup><xref rid="fn169">66</xref></sup> Intelligent people have reputable proof that there is only one earth.<sup><xref rid="fn170">67</xref></sup> As to the Midrash, when it says that there are seven earths it means that the area of the world inhabited by human beings is divided into seven sections.<sup><xref rid="fn171">68</xref></sup> The Holy Temple was in the center of the inhabited world.<sup><xref rid="fn172">69</xref></sup> It was not in the center of the earth because we know that it was far from there.</p>
<p>AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD. <italic>Ru&#x2019;ach</italic> (wind) is in the construct with <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) because it was the medium employed by God to dry the land.<sup><xref rid="fn173">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE WATERS.] <italic>Mayim</italic> (waters) is in the plural. It does not come in a singular form. It belongs to the dual forms,<sup><xref rid="fn174">71</xref></sup> the latter being either masculine or feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn175">72</xref></sup> <italic>Mayim</italic> is also found used in the singular in <italic>the water of sprinkling was not dashed against him</italic> (Num. 19:13).<sup><xref rid="fn176">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>[HOVERED.] <italic>Merachefet</italic> (hovered) means &#x201C;blowing above the waters.&#x201D; <italic>As an eagle&#x2026;Hovereth</italic> (yerachef) <italic>over her young</italic> (Deut. 32:11), is similar.</p>
<p>3. AND GOD SAID. Saadiah Gaon interprets <italic>va-yomer Elohim</italic> (and God said), as and God wanted. However, if this were the case Scripture should have stated God wanted (said) light to be. Therefore <italic>va-yomer Elohim</italic> is to be rendered &#x201C;and God said.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn177">74</xref></sup> We similarly read, <italic>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made</italic> (Ps. 33:6), and <italic>For He commanded, and they were created</italic> (Ps. 148:5).<sup><xref rid="fn178">75</xref></sup> Scripture describes creation as coming about by God&#x2019;s word because it wants to teach us that heaven and earth came into being without any labor on God&#x2019;s part. We may compare this to a king assigning certain tasks to his servants.</p>
<p>[LIGHT.] The light spoken of in this verse was above the air.<sup><xref rid="fn179">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND GOD SAW THE LIGHT. &#x201C;Saw&#x201D; is to be understood here as perceived. Compare, <italic>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly</italic> (Ecclesiastes 2:13).<sup><xref rid="fn180">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>divided</italic> is: He divided them by naming one, day and the other, night.<sup><xref rid="fn181">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND GOD CALLED. The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>laylah</italic> (night) is superfluous, because the word is penultimately accented. It is always a masculine noun.<sup><xref rid="fn182">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVENING. <italic>Erev</italic> (evening) is close in meaning to <italic>choshekh</italic> (darkness). <italic>Erev</italic> is so called because forms are then intermingled.<sup><xref rid="fn183">80</xref></sup> The opposite of evening is called <italic>boker</italic> (morning) because one can then distinguish between various forms.<sup><xref rid="fn184">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>One day refers to the movement of the sphere.<sup><xref rid="fn185">82</xref></sup> There is a secret meaning to the Midrashic statement to the effect that the world will exist for six thousand years.<sup><xref rid="fn186">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once it is stated that God called the light &#x201C;day,&#x201D; it is impossible to maintain that the evening, too, is considered part of the day.<sup><xref rid="fn187">84</xref></sup> The correct interpretation of <italic>And there was evening and there was morning, one day</italic> is that evening passed and the morning of the first day also came. If the intention of this verse is to teach that evening and morning make a day, then what is the meaning of <italic>And there was evening and there was morning, a second day</italic> (v. 8)?<sup><xref rid="fn188">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND GOD SAID. Saadiah Gaon says things about the firmament that are not so.<sup><xref rid="fn189">86</xref></sup> The correct interpretation of firmament (<italic>raki&#x2019;a</italic>) is something spread out, as in <italic>And they did beat</italic> (va-yirakke&#x2019;u) <italic>the gold into thin plates</italic> (Ex. 39:3); <italic>Then did I beat them</italic> (erka&#x2019;em) (II Sam. 22:43); and similarly, <italic>And spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in</italic> (Is. 40:22).</p>
<p>How precious are the words of he who said that the firmament begins at the point where the sun and the ocean merge.<sup><xref rid="fn190">87</xref></sup> The firmament is the air because when the light shone very strongly upon the earth and a wind dried off from the earth, the flame turned into the firmament.<sup><xref rid="fn191">88</xref></sup> Similarly<sup><xref rid="fn192">89</xref></sup> the Psalmist states, <italic>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; Who layest the beams of Thine upper chambers in the waters</italic> (Ps. 104:2 and 3). The Psalmist then makes mention of the clouds and the wind and the establishment of the earth. The latter is above the waters. We thus read, <italic>For He hath founded it (the earth) upon the seas</italic> (Ps. 24:2), and <italic>To Him that spread forth the earth above the waters</italic> (Ps. 136:6). Similarly whoever goes to the ocean is said to be going down.<sup><xref rid="fn193">90</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>(He) That calleth for the waters of the sea, And poureth them out upon the face of the earth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn194">91</xref></sup> (Amos 5:8) is that God commands the waters of the sea to give birth to clouds, and, afterward, <italic>And (He) poureth them out upon the face of the earth</italic>.</p>
<p>7. AND GOD MADE. Dividing one thing from another is expressed by placing the preposition <italic>ben</italic> (between) before the first object and a <italic>lamed</italic> before the second, as in <italic>And let it divide</italic><sup><xref rid="fn195">92</xref></sup> <italic>the waters</italic> (ben mayim) <italic>from the waters</italic> (la-mayim) (Gen. 1:6) and <italic>between the holy</italic> (ben kodesh) <italic>and the common</italic> (le-chol) (Ezek. 44:23). It may also be expressed by placing the preposition (<italic>ben</italic>) before each one of the objects, as in our verse <italic>and divided the waters</italic><sup><xref rid="fn196">93</xref></sup> (ben ha-mayim) <italic>which were under the firmament from the waters</italic> (u-ven ha-mayim) <italic>which were above the firmament</italic>. And it is found with the word <italic>ben</italic> repeated and a <italic>lamed</italic> before the second object, as in <italic>But your iniquities have separated Between you</italic> (benekhem) <italic>and your God</italic> (le-ven elohekhem) (Is. 59:2).</p>
<p>[AND IT WAS SO.] This phrase is connected to the verse which follows it: <italic>When it was so, God called the firmament heaven</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn197">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND GOD CALLED. There are five things which God named because there was then no man to name them. They are: light, darkness, heaven, earth and the seas. In addition, God named man.<sup><xref rid="fn198">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND GOD SAID. I believe that this chapter is connected to the one preceding it<sup><xref rid="fn199">96</xref></sup> because the firmament did not come into being until the land dried.<sup><xref rid="fn200">97</xref></sup> Proof of this is Scripture&#x2019;s statement, <italic>In the day that the Lord God made earth (dry land) and heaven (the firmament)</italic> (Gen. 2:4). Thus they were made on the same day. The revelation of something which had previously been hidden (the land) or the gathering of something which was scattered (the water) into one place is not a creation.<sup><xref rid="fn201">98</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: now God had said, <italic>Let the waters under the heaven be gathered</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn202">99</xref></sup> There are hundreds of similar instances in the Torah. I will offer two examples from the portion of <italic>Bereshit</italic>. One is: <italic>And the Lord God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed</italic> (Gen. 2:8). After stating this, Scripture goes on to say, <italic>And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight</italic> (v. 9). However, God caused vegetation and trees to sprout before the creation of man.<sup><xref rid="fn203">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second example is when God commanded man not to eat from the tree of knowledge (Gen. 2:16). However, immediately after this it is written, <italic>And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man</italic>, etc. (Gen. 2:19).<sup><xref rid="fn204">101</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>formed</italic> thus is had formed. According to this interpretation it follows that <italic>And God saw that it was good</italic> (Gen. 1:10) is connected to the act of creation which took place on the second day.<sup><xref rid="fn205">102</xref></sup> The account of the creation which took place on the third day thus begins with <italic>And God said: Let the earth put forth grass</italic> (Gen. 1:11).</p>
<p>[LET&#x2026;BE GATHERED.] The meaning of <italic>yikkavu</italic> is let them come together. <italic>Ve-nikvu</italic> in <italic>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord; and all nations shall be gathered</italic> (ve-nikvu) <italic>unto it</italic> (Jer. 3:17) is similar.</p>
<p>[SEAS.] Scripture employs the term seas (<italic>yammim</italic>) because there is no one name for the sea that surrounds all of the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn206">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND GOD SAID. Scripture states, <italic>Let the earth put forth grass</italic> (Gen. 1:11); <italic>Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures</italic> (Gen. 1:20); <italic>Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind</italic> (Gen. 1:24). This teaches that God placed in the earth and in the water the power to bring forth these things at God&#x2019;s command. These are the generations (offspring) of the heaven and the earth (Gen. 2:4).<sup><xref rid="fn207">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>[LET THE EARTH PUT FORTH GRASS.] <italic>Tadshe</italic> means let it put forth.</p>
<p>WHEREIN IS THE SEED THEREOF. Wherein the seed is in the fruit and each one produces its own kind.</p>
<p>14. AND GOD SAID. <italic>Yehi</italic> (let there be) is short for <italic>yiheyeh</italic>. Due to the frequency with which this term is used, it is employed before both the singular and the plural.<sup><xref rid="fn208">105</xref></sup> It is also employed in Scripture with the feminine as in, <italic>If there be a damsel</italic> (yiheyeh) <italic>that is a virgin</italic> (Deut. 22:23).<sup><xref rid="fn209">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR SIGNS AND FOR SEASONS. <italic>For signs</italic>, i.e., for minutes, <italic>and for seasons</italic>, i.e., for hours. <italic>For signs</italic> may also be interpreted as referring to the eclipse of the moon and the sun and also to shooting stars. The last-mentioned phenomena are to be included among the signs produced by the lights of the firmament because they are caused by the stars. This meaning of signs is like signs in <italic>And be not dismayed at the signs (omens) of heaven</italic> (Jer. 10:2).</p>
<p>Anyone who explains the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>le-otot</italic> (for signs) as superfluous is mistaken.<sup><xref rid="fn210">107</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND LET THEM BE FOR SIGNS. A prominent Spanish sage<sup><xref rid="fn211">108</xref></sup> stated that the firmament is divided into eight parts, seven for the seven spheres of the seven stars and one for the constellations.<sup><xref rid="fn212">109</xref></sup> However, this cannot be so because we know there is no body above the sphere of the constellations. Behold, Scripture explicitly states, <italic>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven</italic>, which clearly indicates that there is a heaven above the firmament. <italic>The heaven of heavens</italic> (Nehemiah 9:6) and <italic>To Him that rideth upon the heaven of heavens, which are of old</italic> (kedem) (Ps. 68:34) are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn213">110</xref></sup> Note that the word <italic>kedem</italic> in the verse quoted above does not mean east but ancient.<sup><xref rid="fn214">111</xref></sup> Indeed, Rabbi Saadiah Gaon, may the righteous be remembered for a blessing, was afraid to comment on this verse.<sup><xref rid="fn215">112</xref></sup> It appears to me that the sun, the moon and other luminaries are called <italic>lights in the firmament</italic> because they are visible there.<sup><xref rid="fn216">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND GOD MADE. The sun and the moon are called the great lights in contradistinction to the stars.<sup><xref rid="fn217">114</xref></sup> Similarly the first three sons of Jesse are called the elders, in contrast to their younger brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn218">115</xref></sup> In reality, Eliab, the first born, was the oldest of them all. As to the Midrash, which states <italic>One was not greater than the other</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn219">116</xref></sup> there is a secret meaning to it.<sup><xref rid="fn220">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>[TO RULE THE DAY.] The sun rules during the day and not at night because it is not seen. Conversely, the light of the moon and stars are not seen during the day.</p>
<p>One may ask, do not the astronomers teach that Jupiter and all the stars, with the exception of Mercury and Venus, are larger than the moon? Why, then, is it written <italic>the great lights</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn221">118</xref></sup> The answer is that the term great does not refer to size but to light, and the light of the moon is many times greater than their light because of its proximity to the earth. Thus we see that Scripture describes them as lights.<sup><xref rid="fn222">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND GOD SET. Do not be surprised that Scripture states, <italic>And God set</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn223">120</xref></sup> for the Bible also says, <italic>I have set My bow in the cloud</italic> (Gen. 9:13).<sup><xref rid="fn224">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>18 AND TO RULE. The day spoken of in the Torah begins at sunrise and lasts until sunset. Night begins when the stars are first visible. Those who say that night begins with the appearance of three stars are correct.<sup><xref rid="fn225">122</xref></sup> Know that evening begins at sunset and lasts for one and a third hours, during which time a light-like appearance is seen in the clouds. Similarly morning dawns before sunrise.<sup><xref rid="fn226">123</xref></sup> When the light of the sun shines during the day and the light of the moon at night, they separate between the light and the dark.<sup><xref rid="fn227">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND GOD SAID. <italic>Yishritzu</italic> (let it swarm) is a transitive verb, as is <italic>sharatz</italic> (swarm) in <italic>And the river shall bring forth swarms of frogs</italic> (ve-sharatz) (Ex. 7:28).<sup><xref rid="fn228">125</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures and let fowl fly above the earth</italic> is that the waters shall produce living beings that will immediately fly.<sup><xref rid="fn229">126</xref></sup></p>
<p>The verse <italic>And let fowl fly&#x2026;in the open firmament of heaven</italic> proves my interpretation of the firmament.<sup><xref rid="fn230">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn231">128</xref></sup> explains <italic>al pene</italic> (in the open) to mean with the face of. Hence, according to the Gaon, the heavens face down.<sup><xref rid="fn232">129</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>feh</italic> of <italic>ye&#x2019;ofef</italic> (let fly) is doubled like the <italic>nun</italic> in <italic>yekhonen</italic> (till He establish) (Is. 62:7).<sup><xref rid="fn233">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND GOD CREATED. The meaning of <italic>romeset</italic> (creepeth) is walks. Some are of the opinion that the <italic>sin</italic> of <italic>romeset</italic> is in place of a <italic>samekh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn234">131</xref></sup></p>
<p>22 AND GOD BLESSED. The meaning of <italic>Be fruitful, and multiply</italic> is, &#x201C;You shall be fruitful and you shall multiply.&#x201D; <italic>And die in the mount</italic> (Deut. 32:50) is similar because it is not in one&#x2019;s power to determine the time of one&#x2019;s death.<sup><xref rid="fn235">132</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND GOD SAID. <italic>Living creature</italic> is a general term for what the fire, water and earth gave birth to.<sup><xref rid="fn236">133</xref></sup> It also includes man.</p>
<p>CATTLE. Domesticated beasts that are utilized by man for their needs, for riding and for food.</p>
<p>AND CREEPING THING. Small animals that walk upon the earth.</p>
<p>AND BEAST OF THE EARTH. Animals that are in the wilderness where there are no human settlements. The <italic>vav</italic> at the end of <italic>ve-chayeto</italic> (and beast of) is superfluous. It is like the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>le-mayeno</italic> (into a fountain) in <italic>into a fountain</italic> (le-mayeno) of <italic>waters</italic> (Ps. 114:8), and the <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>the son of</italic> (beno) <italic>Beor</italic> (Num. 24:3).</p>
<p>26. LET US MAKE MAN. Some are of the opinion that <italic>na&#x2019;aseh</italic> (let us make) is a <italic>nifal</italic> participle<sup><xref rid="fn237">134</xref></sup> and is to be compared to the same word in <italic>Now that which was prepared</italic> (na&#x2019;aseh) <italic>for one day</italic> (Neh. 5:18).<sup><xref rid="fn238">135</xref></sup> They further say that <italic>in our image, after our likeness</italic> are the words of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn239">136</xref></sup> They also explain the pronominal suffix &#x201C;his&#x201D; in <italic>And God created man in His own image</italic> (v. 27) as referring to man,<sup><xref rid="fn240">137</xref></sup> and connect God (in Gen. 9:6) to <italic>made</italic> rather than to <italic>image</italic>. They read this verse as follows: &#x201C;For God made man in an image,&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;for in the image of God made He man.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn241">138</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now this interpretation is absurd. According to it the first quoted verse should have read, &#x201C;Let a man be made.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn242">139</xref></sup> Similarly Scripture should have read, &#x201C;He made him in his image.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn243">140</xref></sup> Furthermore, how can the <italic>his</italic> in <italic>His image</italic> (v. 27) refer to man? If this were the case then man had an image before he was created.<sup><xref rid="fn244">141</xref></sup> Finally, what sense would there be to <italic>Whoso sheddeth man&#x2019;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed</italic> (Gen. 9:6), if the reason for the above is that man was made in an image? All living things have an image.<sup><xref rid="fn245">142</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon explains <italic>in our image, after our likeness</italic> as referring to the dominion man exercises on earth.<sup><xref rid="fn246">143</xref></sup> He explains <italic>His image</italic><sup><xref rid="fn247">144</xref></sup> as the image that God in His wisdom chose for man because He saw that this image was good for man. The Gaon further notes that Scripture connects image to God (<italic>be-tzelem Elohim</italic>) to stress man&#x2019;s glorified state.<sup><xref rid="fn248">145</xref></sup> Similarly Scripture states, <italic>and are gone forth out of His land</italic> (Ezek. 36:20). The Bible says this to emphasize the importance of the land of Israel because, in reality, <italic>The earth is the Lord&#x2019;s, and the fullness thereof</italic> (Ps. 24:1).<sup><xref rid="fn249">146</xref></sup> The Gaon also says that the word <italic>na&#x2019;aseh</italic> (let us make) has the meaning of the singular even though it is in the plural because it is the plural of majesty.<sup><xref rid="fn250">147</xref></sup> He offers as proof, <italic>and we will give thee the other also</italic> (Gen. 29:27); <italic>and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king (Daniel 2:36); peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite</italic> (nakkeh) <italic>them</italic> (Num. 22:6). However, these witnesses are false witnesses.<sup><xref rid="fn251">148</xref></sup> First of all, <italic>and we will give thee</italic> (ve-nittenah) (Gen. 29:27) is a <italic>nifal</italic> and its meaning is &#x201C;the other will also be given thee.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn252">149</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>nittenah</italic> (is given) in <italic>and the city is given</italic> (nittenah) (Jer. 32:24). The <italic>vav</italic> conversive changes <italic>nittenah</italic> (she was given) to &#x201C;she will be given (<italic>ve-nittenah</italic>),&#x201D; as is the case with every verb in the perfect which becomes an imperfect when a <italic>vav</italic> conversive is prefixed to it. Similarly <italic>nakkeh bo</italic> (we may smite them) (Num. 22:6) means, &#x201C;I and my army will smite them.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn253">150</xref></sup> Further, <italic>nakkeh</italic> may be a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> infinitive<sup><xref rid="fn254">151</xref></sup> meaning to smite, like <italic>nakeh</italic> (destroy)<sup><xref rid="fn255">152</xref></sup> in <italic>But will not utterly destroy thee</italic> (ve-nakkeh lo anakkekah) (Jer. 46:28). The latter interpretation is supported by the fact that Scripture employs the phrase <italic>lo nukku</italic> (were not smitten) (Ex. 9:32), and a verb cannot come in the <italic>pu&#x2019;a</italic>l unless it also comes in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn256">153</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Moses Ha-kohen, the Spaniard, errs in his book.<sup><xref rid="fn257">154</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>we will tell</italic> (Dan. 2:36) is Aramaic.<sup><xref rid="fn258">155</xref></sup> For if <italic>we will tell</italic> is a plural of majesty, how would Daniel dare to speak in such haughty terms before Nebuchadnezzar who was the &#x201C;King of Kings&#x201D;?</p>
<p>I will now explain. Note that all the works of creation came into being by God&#x2019;s command for the sake of man. Scripture relates that the earth and water brought forth plants and all living creatures. After all plants and living creatures had been created, God said to the angels, <italic>Let us make man</italic>; i.e., We, rather than the earth and water, will occupy ourselves with his creation. We know that the Torah spoke the language of man,<sup><xref rid="fn259">156</xref></sup> for it was given to humans who speak and hear. Now a human being cannot speak of things above or below him without employing human terminology. Hence Scripture uses such terms as the mouth of the earth (Num. 16:30), <italic>the hand of the Jordan</italic> (Num. 13:29),<sup><xref rid="fn260">157</xref></sup> and <italic>the head</italic><sup><xref rid="fn261">158</xref></sup> <italic>of the dust of the world</italic> (Proverbs 8:26).</p>
<p>Far be it from us to believe that God has an image.<sup><xref rid="fn262">159</xref></sup> Scripture clearly refutes such a notion by stating, <italic>To whom then will you liken Me, that I should be equal</italic> (Is. 40:25). It is because man&#x2019;s upper soul is eternal and is compared in its existence to God and because man&#x2019;s soul is incorporeal and fills the body, which is a microcosm, in the same way that God fills the universe that Scripture states, <italic>in our image, after our likeness</italic>. May God&#x2019;s name be blessed. He commenced with the macrocosm and concluded with the microcosm.<sup><xref rid="fn263">160</xref></sup> The prophet also says that he saw God&#x2019;s glory appear in human form (Ezek. 1:26).<sup><xref rid="fn264">161</xref></sup> God is one. He is the creator of all. He is all. I cannot explain further.<sup><xref rid="fn265">162</xref></sup></p>
<p>Man was originally created with two faces;<sup><xref rid="fn266">163</xref></sup> man is thus one but also two. <italic>In the image of God</italic> means in the image of the angels. Man was created both male and female.<sup><xref rid="fn267">164</xref></sup> The words <italic>Be fruitful, and multiply</italic> are a blessing not a command,<sup><xref rid="fn268">165</xref></sup> just as they are with regard to the creatures brought forth by the waters (Gen. 1:22).<sup><xref rid="fn269">166</xref></sup> Nevertheless, there is in fact a commandment to be fruitful and multiply transmitted by our sages, of blessed memory, which they attached to this verse in order to remember the commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn270">167</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND GOD SAID: BEHOLD I HAVE GIVEN YOU. God permitted mankind and every living thing to eat all herbs. He also permitted man to eat the fruits of the trees and limited the animals and creeping things to green herbs. At this point in time the consumption of flesh was not permitted. That came after the flood.</p>
<p>31. THE SIXTH DAY. Some say that the word <italic>yom</italic> (day) is in the construct with sixth,<sup><xref rid="fn271">168</xref></sup> and the meaning of <italic>yom ha-shishi</italic> (the sixth day) is the day of the sixth sphere.<sup><xref rid="fn272">169</xref></sup> They say the same with regard to <italic>yom ha-shevi&#x2019;i</italic> (the seventh day). However, they are wrong. Proof of their error is found in the teaching of the astrologers who tell us who the lord<sup><xref rid="fn273">170</xref></sup> of the sixth day is.<sup><xref rid="fn274">171</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>yom ha-shishi</italic>, then, is the sixth day from day one. This is also the meaning of the seventh day. We similarly find<sup><xref rid="fn275">172</xref></sup> <italic>ish ha-yisraeli</italic> (the Israelite man) (Leviticus 24:10)<sup><xref rid="fn276">173</xref></sup> and many such cases, among them <italic>reki&#x2019;a ha-shamayim</italic> (Gen. 1:20),<sup><xref rid="fn277">174</xref></sup> which should be rendered as &#x201C;the firmament which is heaven.&#x201D;</p>
<ftnote id="fn104"><sup>1</sup> The Hebrew grammarians. See Ibn Janah, <italic>Sefer ha-Rikmah</italic>, 6:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn105"><sup>2</sup> The letter <italic>bet</italic> placed before the word <italic>reshit</italic> has no translatable meaning. According to Weiser it is there for emphasis. Our verse should thus be rendered: First God created heaven and earth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn106"><sup>3</sup> According to this opinion <italic>rishonah</italic> and <italic>ba-rishonah</italic> mean the same. Hence the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ba-rishonah</italic> is superfluous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn107"><sup>4</sup> As is the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ba-rishonah</italic>. The fact that the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>bereshit</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic> proves that both cases are not exactly the same.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn108"><sup>5</sup> The word or phrase that <italic>bereshit</italic> is connected to is missing and must be supplied by the reader. According to Cherez, I.E. is trying to explain why the superfluous <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>bereshit</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic> while that of <italic>ba-rishonah</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>. The reason is that <italic>bereshit</italic> is in the construct and therefore is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn109"><sup>6</sup> Where the word <italic>reshit</italic> is in the absolute.</ftnote>

Ebr</italic>. 38, which has <italic>kli ta&#x2019;am</italic> rather than <italic>bli ta&#x2019;am</italic>. For alternate interpretations see Filwarg, Weiser and Cherez.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn111"><sup>8</sup> The <italic>bet</italic> is there for emphasis. The meaning of the verse is: <italic>In the</italic> beginning, i.e., before anything was created, God created heaven and earth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn112"><sup>9</sup> I.E. agrees that <italic>bereshit</italic> is in the construct. He disagrees with the earlier quoted opinion only in maintaining that it is not always in the construct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn113"><sup>10</sup> A noun is usually in the construct when connected to another noun, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn114"><sup>11</sup> <italic>Techillat</italic> (at first) is in the construct with <italic>dibber</italic> (spoke).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn115"><sup>12</sup> <italic>Kiryat</italic> (the city) is in the construct with <italic>chanah</italic> (encamped).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn116"><sup>13</sup> That is, the explanation of what <italic>bereshit</italic> in the construct is to be connected to.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn117"><sup>14</sup> God obviously did not create the sea monsters <italic>ex nihilo</italic>, for the verse concludes, <italic>and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed</italic>, which shows that the sea monsters were created out of the water. Also, it is absurd to assume that on the fifth day of creation God would create sea monsters <italic>ex nihilo</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn118"><sup>15</sup> Darkness is the absence of light. Thus Isaiah uses the term created in the opposite sense of creation <italic>ex nihilo</italic>. In Isaiah it means the creation of nothing out of something (Krinsky). Hence <italic>bara</italic> does not necessarily imply creation <italic>ex nihilo</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn119"><sup>16</sup> That is, to create or make.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn120"><sup>17</sup> That is, to eat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn121"><sup>18</sup> Most of our manuscripts of the Bible have <italic>barah</italic> with a <italic>heh</italic>.

See also Jacob ben Haim&#x2019;s edition of the Hebrew Bible, 1524, which has the same reading as Ibn Ezra. There is some difficulty in understanding this comment as the printed text is corrupt. We have followed <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 as suggested by Weiser. For a different rendering see Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn122"><sup>19</sup> Ibn Janah, <italic>The Book of Roots</italic>, root <italic>bet, resh, alef</italic>, explains <italic>bara</italic> in Josh. 17:15 to mean chose, as in I Sam. 17:8. Ibn Ezra disagrees. The point of I.E&#x2019;s comment is that <italic>bara</italic> spelled <italic>bet, resh, alef</italic> primarily means to cut. It is encountered with this meaning in both the <italic>kal</italic> and <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>. <italic>Bara</italic> also means to eat. However, in the latter case its root is <italic>bet, resh, heh</italic>, although it is found spelled <italic>bet, resh, alef</italic> in I Sam. 17:8. In the latter instance, however, we treat it as if there were an interchange between the <italic>heh</italic> and <italic>alef</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn123"><sup>20</sup> I. Husik, <italic>A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy</italic>, p. 190, notes, &#x201C;The Hebrew word <italic>bara</italic>, ordinarily translated &#x201C;created,&#x201D; which implies to most people the idea of <italic>creatio ex nihilo</italic>, Ibn Ezra renders, in accordance with its etymology, to limit, to define, by drawing or incising a line or boundary. Having said this, Ibn Ezra, in his wonted mysterious manner, stops short, refusing to say more, and preferring to mystify the reader by adding the tantalizing phrase, &#x2018;The intelligent will understand.&#x2019; He means apparently to indicate that an eternal matter was endowed with form.&#x201D; Nahman Krochmal, <italic>More Nevuche Ha-zeman</italic> (quoted by Krinsky), suggests that Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s belief is similar to that of the Kabbalists; i.e., the world was created out of an emanation from God. See also C. Sirot, <italic>Philosophy in the Middle Ages</italic> (Hebrew), p. 112. Ibn Ezra was a neo-Platonist. According to neo-Platonism the world came about by emanation from God. Ibn Ezra is apparently saying that at the creation spoken of in the first chapter of Genesis, God gave final form to what had previously emanated from Him.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn127"><sup>24</sup> All of these words have plural endings, yet are used to indicate singulars.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn128"><sup>25</sup> Since <italic>Elohim</italic> is to be understood as singular, the verb following it (<italic>bara</italic>) is in the singular. If <italic>Elohim</italic> were plural, the verb following it would also be plural (<italic>bare&#x2019;u</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn129"><sup>26</sup> <italic>Safah</italic> is the Hebrew word for lip. The point is that more than the lips are involved in speech, but speech is so called because it is seen to come from the lips.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn130"><sup>27</sup> Man&#x2019;s soul is often referred to in Scripture as <italic>lev</italic> because the soul acts via the heart. Similarly God is called <italic>Elohim</italic> because He acts via the angels. Husik, p. 191, points out that according to I.E., &#x201C;God cannot come in contact with the material and changeable (hence)&#x2026;it follows that (the terrestrial world)&#x2026;was not made directly by him, but by angels; hence the word <italic>Elohim</italic> is used in the first chapter of Genesis, which means primarily the angels, and secondarily God as acting through the angels.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn131"><sup>28</sup> Joshua&#x2019;s bowing before God&#x2019;s angels proves that angels are superior to prophets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn132"><sup>29</sup> Both address the angels as superiors. See Zechariah 1:9 and Dan. 10:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn133"><sup>30</sup> We thus see that <italic>Elohim</italic> means the same as <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> (hosts or angels).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn144"><sup>41</sup> The word <italic>shamayim</italic> (heaven) is a plural.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn145"><sup>42</sup> In this verse <italic>its dominion</italic> is in the singular. Since <italic>shamayim</italic> is a plural, we would expect &#x201C;their dominion&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;its dominion.&#x201D;</ftnote>

However, according to Saadiah the creation of these two elements is implied. There was no need for Scripture to mention their creation as their creation is self evident. For how could the fire and water, which filled the void between heaven and earth, be in existence before the creation of their container? Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s alternate commentary on this verse in Weiser, p. 145.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn151"><sup>48</sup> Hence Scripture does state that these two elements were created.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn166"><sup>63</sup> The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-ha&#x2019;aretz</italic> (and the earth) introduces a new idea. This contradicts I.E.&#x2019;s assertion that verse 2 is a mere continuation of verse 1, for I.E. interprets verse 1 and 2 as reading: When God made heaven and earth the earth was unformed and void. I.E. thus explains that the <italic>vav</italic> does not always mean &#x201C;and&#x201D; (it is like the Arabic <italic>fa</italic>).

<ftnote id="fn169"><sup>66</sup> If <italic>shamayim</italic> does not refer to the firmament but rather to the abode of the heavenly beings, what, then, does earth refer to? It is illogical to assume that the Bible juxtaposes the creation of the eternal with the creation of the transient.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn170"><sup>67</sup> Perhaps one will argue that earth refers to some spiritual earth, hence I.E.&#x2019;s argument that unlike the heavens there is only one earth.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn176"><sup>73</sup> Strictly speaking, if <italic>mayim</italic> is in the plural, the verb pertaining to it should also be in the plural. Hence, rather than &#x201C;was not,&#x201D; one would expect &#x201C;were not.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn177"><sup>74</sup> If <italic>va-yomer Elohim</italic> means God wanted, rather than God said, Scripture should have used the infinite <italic>li-heyot</italic> in place of <italic>yehi</italic>; <italic>Let there be</italic> implies a statement.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn188"><sup>85</sup> If the intention of Scripture is to teach us that evening and morning make a day, why keep on repeating this with regard to the subsequent days? Hence Scripture is only describing what happened (Kaputa).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn191"><sup>88</sup> I.E. apparently alludes here to &#x201C;the light as the medium whereby the chaotic base elements were progressively transformed into their present form&#x201D; (Levine).

I.E. believed that this element &#x201C;changed and became the <italic>raki&#x2019;a</italic> (firmament)&#x201D; (Cohen).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn192"><sup>89</sup> Ps. 104:2 describes the heaven (firmament) as being &#x201C;stretched out like a curtain,&#x201D; which agrees with I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation that the firmament is &#x201C;something spread out.&#x201D; Furthermore, Psalm 104, like Gen. 1:6-10, first describes the creation of the sky and then that of the dry land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn193"><sup>90</sup> For the earth is above the waters. Cf. Ps. 107:23.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn196"><sup>93</sup> The verse literally reads: <italic>and God divided between the waters</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn197"><sup>94</sup> <italic>And it was so</italic> is out of place following <italic>And God made the firmament</italic>. If he made it, then obviously it was so. Hence it does not apply to verse 7 but is connected to verse 8; viz., after the firmament came into being God called it heaven (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn198"><sup>95</sup> Scripture explicitly tells us that God named the Light, the Darkness, etc. I.E. points out that God also named Adam, even though this is not expressly stated in our chapter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn199"><sup>96</sup> In the Hebrew Bible verses 6-8 and 9-13 form separate chapters. According to I.E. verse 9 does not start the account of the third day of creation, but is a continuation of verse 8. See note 99.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn200"><sup>97</sup> Thus land was created on the second day and not on the third day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn201"><sup>98</sup> Hence Scripture (Gen. 2:4) states, <italic>the Lord God made earth and heaven</italic>, rather than the Lord God created earth and heaven. I.E. had previously commented that only one thing was created on each day. He therefore explains that the making of the firmament and dry land on one day does not constitute the creation of two things on the same day, for the drying of the land was not a creation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn202"><sup>99</sup> <italic>And God said</italic> is to be understood as a pluperfect. Verses 8 and 9 are to be read as one verse and understood as follows: And God called the firmament heaven&#x2026;for God had said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place (Cohen).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn203"><sup>100</sup> According to Gen. 1:11,12, vegetation was created before man. Therefore the meaning of Gen. 2:9 is: And out of the ground the Lord God had previously made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn204"><sup>101</sup> The implication is that the beasts of the field were created after man. However, Gen. 1:25 tells us that man was created after the beasts of the field. Hence the meaning of <italic>formed</italic> in Gen. 2:19 is had formed, i.e., before creating man God had formed the beasts of the field and every fowl of the air.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn205"><sup>102</sup> The account describing the making of the sky and the earth concludes with Gen. 1:10, <italic>And God saw that is was good</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn206"><sup>103</sup> Ibn Ezra, in line with other medievalists, believed that there is one sea covering most of the earth. Thus he was faced with the problem of why Scripture doesn&#x2019;t say God called the gathering of the waters &#x201C;sea.&#x201D; His guess was that the sea had different names in different places. Hence Scripture refers to it as seas. For an alternate interpretation see Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn207"><sup>104</sup> Filwarg. For an alternate interpretation see Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn208"><sup>105</sup> Luminaries is a plural, so Scripture should have used the plural <italic>yiheyu</italic>, rather than the singular <italic>yehi</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn209"><sup>106</sup> Since damsel is a feminine, the verb <italic>tiheyeh</italic>, rather than <italic>yiheyeh</italic> (which is masculine), should have been used. I.E. points out that there is a tendency toward uniformity when a word is employed frequently.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn210"><sup>107</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the <italic>lamed</italic> is a preposition.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn211"><sup>108</sup> Ibn Janah (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn212"><sup>109</sup> The eighth sphere is a sphere of the constellations. The seven &#x201C;planets&#x201D; are the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Each &#x201C;planet&#x201D; has its own sphere (Krinsky). Hence the firmament consists of eight parts. Heaven consists of the seven planets and the constellations. Thus according to the Spanish sage the firmament and heaven are identical.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn213"><sup>110</sup> The term <italic>heaven of heavens</italic> refers to the heaven above the firmament. It is I.E.&#x2019;s belief that the planets and constellations are above the firmament (see note 40).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn214"><sup>111</sup> <italic>Kedem</italic> may also mean east, but not here. If the verse alluded to the eastern sky it could not refer to the heaven above the firmament (the ancient heaven) which is invisible.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn215"><sup>112</sup> The word <italic>kedem</italic> means old. It implies that they are older than the earth and may even be eternal. Hence Saadiah refrains from commenting on this verse. See Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn216"><sup>113</sup> According to I.E. the luminaries are not in the firmament. They are above it. Nevertheless, Scripture states that God placed them in the firmament because they shine through the firmament and thus appear to be there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn217"><sup>114</sup> The term &#x201C;two great lights&#x201D; implies that both lights were of equal size, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. Cf. Rashi&#x2019;s comment on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn218"><sup>115</sup> Obviously only one of them was the eldest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn219"><sup>116</sup> That is, both the sun and the moon were the same size at creation. Cf. <italic>Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer</italic>, Chap. VI.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn220"><sup>117</sup> The Midrashic statement is not to be taken literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn221"><sup>118</sup> The implication from Scripture is clearly that the moon is larger than the stars.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn222"><sup>119</sup> Scripture calls the sun and the moon lights because it refers to the light given off by them and not to their physical size.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn223"><sup>120</sup> If the stars are above the firmament, why does Scripture state, <italic>And God set them in the firmament</italic> (Filwarg).

<ftnote id="fn224"><sup>121</sup> The rainbow only appears to be in the cloud (Krinsky). Weiser interprets, &#x201C;The rainbow is not always visible there.&#x201D; Even so Scripture states, <italic>I have set My bow in the cloud</italic> (Gen. 9:13).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn227"><sup>124</sup> Thus <italic>and to divide the light from the darkness</italic> refers to both the sun and the moon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn228"><sup>125</sup> In Gen. 9:7 and Ex. 1:7 swarm is intransitive. I.E. points out that here and in Exodus it is transitive. Therefore swarm may be either a transitive or an intransitive verb (Weiser).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn230"><sup>127</sup> According to I.E. the firmament is the air or atmosphere, not heaven. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on verse 6. The birds fly in the air, not among the spheres; thus <italic>raki&#x2019;a</italic> cannot be the domain of the spheres (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn231"><sup>128</sup> Filwarg explains that according to Saadiah the stars are in the firmament which is in motion. Thus the fowl fly along with the firmament. It should be noted that Saadiah identifies the firmament with heaven.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn232"><sup>129</sup> Scripture says that the birds fly on the face of the firmament. Since, according to Saadiah, the fowl fly along with the face of the firmament (heaven), then the firmament (heaven) faces down. This is absurd and shows how wrong Saadiah is.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn233"><sup>130</sup> An <italic>ayin vav</italic> has its final letter doubled in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn238"><sup>135</sup> Here <italic>na&#x2019;aseh</italic> is definitely a <italic>nifal</italic> form.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn243"><sup>140</sup> The reference is either to Gen. 9:6 (Netter) or 1:27 (Cherez).

<ftnote id="fn244"><sup>141</sup> If man was created in man&#x2019;s image, then man had an image before he was created. This is obviously an impossibility.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn245"><sup>142</sup> The verse stresses man&#x2019;s uniqueness; i.e., he was created in God&#x2019;s image. But if the verse speaks only of man having an image, animals, too, have an image. Wherein is the uniqueness of man?</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn257"><sup>154</sup> Rabbi Moses ben Samuel Gikatila, an 11th century Bible commentator. It is not clear what error I.E. is referring to. Cf. Filwarg. Perhaps R. Moses also interpreted <italic>nakkeh</italic> as the plural of majesty.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn263"><sup>160</sup> Man. The account of creation begins with the creation of the &#x201C;large world,&#x201D; the universe, and concludes with the creation of the &#x201C;small world,&#x201D; man. &#x201C;Man is a microcosm, a universe in little, for like the great universe he consists of a body animated by a soul&#x201D; (Husik, p. 191).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn264"><sup>161</sup> Hence Ezekiel, like Moses, employed human terminology in speaking of God (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn265"><sup>162</sup> I.E. &#x201C;seems to favor the idea of eternal creation and maintenance of the universe, the relation of which to God is as the relation of speech to the speaker, which exists only so long as the speaker speaks. The moment he ceases speaking the sounds cease to exist&#x201D; (Husik, p. 190). The mystery of God being &#x201C;All&#x201D; is difficult to comprehend and lends itself to misinterpretation. It might lead one to believe in pantheism.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn266"><sup>163</sup> Hence there is no contradiction in Scripture stating, <italic>created He him</italic>, and then saying, <italic>created He them</italic> (Meijler). Weiser explains that I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation is in keeping with the Rabbinic tradition that man was originally androgynous (<italic>Erubin</italic> 18a).

<ftnote id="fn271"><sup>168</sup> If sixth were an adjective then <italic>yom</italic> should have a definite article prefixed to it, i.e., <italic>ha-yom ha-shishi</italic> rather than <italic>yom ha-shishi</italic>, as in Deut. 3:25 <italic>ha-har ha-tov</italic> (that goodly hill-country); or both <italic>yom</italic> and <italic>shishi</italic> should be written without a <italic>heh</italic>, as in <italic>yom sheni</italic> (a second day).

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 2</title>
<p>1. WERE FINISHED. <italic>Va-yekhullu</italic> is a <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic>. It follows the paradigm of <italic>va-yekhussu</italic> (were covered) in <italic>and all the high mountains&#x2026;were covered</italic> (Gen. 7:19). Its meaning is: were finished.</p>
<p>The earth includes the oceans since they form one entity.<sup><xref rid="fn278">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY GOD FINISHED. Some say<sup><xref rid="fn279">2</xref></sup> that the days are created entities, and with the creation of the seventh day God&#x2019;s work was finished. However, this interpretation is unpalatable. Others say that the <italic>bet</italic> may indicate before, as in <italic>Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out</italic> (be-disho) <italic>the corn</italic> (Deut. 25:4), and in <italic>howbeit the first day</italic> (ba-yom ha-rishon) <italic>ye shall put away leaven out of your houses</italic> (Ex. 12:15).<sup><xref rid="fn280">3</xref></sup> However, why go through all this trouble<sup><xref rid="fn281">4</xref></sup> when finishing work does not constitute an act. Saying God finished is equivalent to saying God did no work. This is the meaning of <italic>God finished</italic> and of <italic>and He rested</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn282">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>His work which He had made</italic> refers to the work that he had done on Friday prior to the onset of the Sabbath. <italic>And He rested on the seventh day from all His work</italic> pertains to all creations that God brought into being.<sup><xref rid="fn283">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND GOD BLESSED. A blessing means an increase in well being. On the Sabbath the body is blessed with a renewal of its reproductive strength and the soul with an increase in its intellectual and reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>AND HALLOWED IT. No work was done on the Sabbath, in contrast to the other six days.</p>
<p>[WHICH GOD IN CREATING HAD MADE.] Its meaning is: God placed in the root of all the species the power to reproduce themselves.<sup><xref rid="fn284">7</xref></sup> I disagree with the person who explains <italic>la&#x2019;asot</italic> (had made) as having the same meaning as made<sup><xref rid="fn285">8</xref></sup> and who, furthermore, insists that created and made are synonymous.</p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon explains that the blessing and the holiness spoken of in this verse refer to those who observe the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn286">9</xref></sup> They will be blessed and sanctified.</p>
<p>4. THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS. These are what they gave birth to.<sup><xref rid="fn287">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHEN THEY WERE CREATED. When the firmament came into being and the earth became visible.</p>
<p>[IN THE DAY THAT THE LORD GOD MADE.] <italic>Be-yom asot</italic> means in the day that God fixed.<sup><xref rid="fn288">11</xref></sup> Proof of this can be seen in <italic>and He hastened to dress it</italic> (la-asot oto) (Gen. 18:7), and in <italic>Whom I have created</italic> which is then followed by <italic>I have formed him</italic>, and finally by <italic>yea, I have made him</italic> (asitiv) (Is. 43:7).<sup><xref rid="fn289">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. SHRUB. <italic>Si&#x2019;ach</italic> (shrub) means a tree: so, too, in <italic>Among the bushes</italic> (sichim) <italic>they bray</italic> (Job 30:7). In my opinion <italic>si&#x2019;ach</italic> refers to a fruit-bearing tree, because Scripture compares man to a tree.<sup><xref rid="fn290">13</xref></sup> Behold, Scripture employs such terms as tree (<italic>si&#x2019;ach</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn291">14</xref></sup> fruit,<sup><xref rid="fn292">15</xref></sup> bough,<sup><xref rid="fn293">16</xref></sup> limb,<sup><xref rid="fn294">17</xref></sup> top of a tree<sup><xref rid="fn295">18</xref></sup> and branch<sup><xref rid="fn296">19</xref></sup> when speaking of man.</p>
<p>6. A MIST. <italic>Ed</italic> (mist) means smoke.<sup><xref rid="fn297">20</xref></sup> <italic>The day of their calamity</italic> (yom edom) is similar (Deut. 32:35). An evil day is called a cloudy day and a day of thick darkness.<sup><xref rid="fn298">21</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is that via the power of the lights a mist arose from the earth and watered it and caused it to bring forth vegetation. Saadiah Gaon explains as follows: &#x201C;And no mist yet went up from the earth.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn299">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THEN THE LORD GOD FORMED. Via the power of the lights.<sup><xref rid="fn300">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FORMED.] <italic>Va-yitzer</italic> (formed) is a <italic>kal</italic>. It belongs to those verbs whose first root letter is a <italic>yod</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn301">24</xref></sup> It is like <italic>va-yiketz</italic> in <italic>And Noah awoke</italic> (va-yiketz no&#x2019;ach) (Gen. 9:24).</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life</italic> is that man lives through the nostrils. They remove the air heated by the heart and replace it with fresh air.</p>
<p>Scripture says man became <italic>nefesh chayyah</italic> (a living soul)<sup><xref rid="fn302">25</xref></sup> because like the animals he was immediately able to walk, and thus differed from babies subsequently born.</p>
<p>8. AND THE LORD GOD PLANTED. God had previously planted a garden in the eastern section of the world in a place called Eden. He now placed the man there.<sup><xref rid="fn303">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>be-eden</italic> (in Eden) in <italic>in Eden the garden of God</italic> (Ezek. 28:13) governs not only Eden but also garden.<sup><xref rid="fn304">27</xref></sup> Its meaning thus is, in Eden, in the garden of God. <italic>Even by the God</italic> (me&#x2019;el) of <italic>thy father, who shall help thee and by</italic> (ve-et) <italic>the Almighty, who shall bless thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn305">28</xref></sup> (Gen. 49:25) is similar. There are many other such instances in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn306">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE MAN.] There is a secret meaning as to why the definite article has been placed in front of Adam.<sup><xref rid="fn307">30</xref></sup> The definite article is also found prefixed to <italic>Menasheh</italic> in <italic>the half tribe of Manasseh</italic> (shevet ha-menasheh)<sup><xref rid="fn308">31</xref></sup> (Deut. 3:13) and before the word <italic>Araunah</italic> in <italic>of Araunah the Jebusite</italic> (II Sam. 24:16).<sup><xref rid="fn309">32</xref></sup> It is also possible that the definite article is placed before Adam because the word <italic>adam</italic> is derived from the word used for ground (<italic>adamah</italic>). Hence the name Adam may be a proper name or an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn310">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND OUT OF THE GROUND MADE THE LORD TO GROW. When God made the trees grow from the ground throughout the world he did the same in the Garden of Eden, but there he placed two trees not found anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>AND THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE. In my opinion the phrase <italic>and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil</italic> is to be understood as if written, &#x201C;And the tree of the knowledge, knowledge of good and evil,&#x201D; because the word knowledge has a definite article prefixed to it and thus cannot be in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn311">34</xref></sup> <italic>The ark of the covenant</italic><sup><xref rid="fn312">35</xref></sup> (Josh. 3:14) and <italic>even the prophecy of Oded the prophet</italic> (II Chronicles 15:8)<sup><xref rid="fn313">36</xref></sup> are similar. There are many other similar instances in Scripture.</p>
<p>10. AND A RIVER. Before man was created the river watered the garden on all sides.</p>
<p>[HEADS.] The <italic>alef</italic> in the word <italic>roshim</italic> (heads) is a root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn314">37</xref></sup> In <italic>marashotekhem</italic> (headtires)<sup><xref rid="fn315">38</xref></sup> (Jer. 13:18) the <italic>alef</italic> is enunciated. The meaning of <italic>marashotekhem</italic> is your headtires.</p>
<p>11. THE NAME OF THE FIRST. Saadiah Gaon identifies Pishon with the Nile. But it is known that the Gihon<sup><xref rid="fn316">39</xref></sup> is close to the land of Israel, for Scripture states, <italic>And bring him (Solomon)&#x2026;down to Gihon&#x2026;and&#x2026;anoint him there king over Israel</italic> (I Kings 1:33,34). It (the Gihon) flows from southeast of the land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn317">40</xref></sup> The same is true of the Euphrates (Perat), which marks the furthermost eastern boundary of the land of Israel. The commentaries also tell us that the Tigris (Chiddekel) is another river, in addition to the Euphrates, that flows through Baghdad. Thus these three rivers (the Gihon, the Euphrates and the Tigris) lie east of the land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn318">41</xref></sup> Furthermore, the source of the Nile is in the mountain of Frankincense far south of the equator. Proof of this can be seen by the fact that its waters swell in the summer.<sup><xref rid="fn319">42</xref></sup> We know that the Garden of Eden is below the equator where day and night are always equal. Fools question this and ask, how is this possible?<sup><xref rid="fn320">43</xref></sup> However, there is positive proof that this is so. Thus according to Saadiah one must believe that the Pishon (the Nile) flows from the Garden of Eden, which is in the east, toward the mountain of Frankincense, which is in the southwest, and then flows north.<sup><xref rid="fn321">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is, in fact, no proof that the Pishon is the Nile. Indeed, Saadiah translates the <italic>land of Havilah</italic> which the Pishon compasses to fit in with his translation of the Pishon as being the Nile. The fact of the matter is that he had no tradition concerning these things. He did the same with families, states, animals, fowl and precious stones.<sup><xref rid="fn322">45</xref></sup> Perhaps these things were revealed to him in a dream. He definitely erred in a number of them as I will point out in their proper place.<sup><xref rid="fn323">46</xref></sup> So we will not rely on his dreams. Perhaps he did so out of respect for the honor of God, for he translated the Torah into Arabic language and script and he did not want the Arabs to think that there are parts of Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn324">47</xref></sup> which we do not understand.</p>
<p>Scripture mentions that there is gold in the land of Havilah in order to glorify the river coming out of the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>12. AND THE GOLD. Saadiah Gaon renders <italic>bedolach</italic> (bedellium) as pearls. He compares manna to them. However, Scripture merely says that manna had the color of <italic>bedolach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn325">48</xref></sup> (Num. 11:7). The Gaon also says that <italic>shoham</italic> (onyx) is a precious clear white stone. The fact of the matter is that we do not know the precise meaning of either of these two items.</p>
<p>[14. TOWARD THE EAST OF ASSHUR.] The <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>kidmat</italic> (toward the east of) is in place of a <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn326">49</xref></sup> The difference between <italic>kedem</italic> and <italic>kedemah</italic> is that the <italic>heh</italic> suffixed to <italic>kedemah</italic> is in place of the preposition &#x201C;to&#x201D; (<italic>el</italic>), which is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn327">50</xref></sup> Similarly in <italic>and Abram went down into Egypt</italic> (mitzraymah) (Gen. 12:10), <italic>mitzraymah</italic> means &#x201C;to Egypt.&#x201D; <italic>Kidmat asshur</italic> thus means <italic>toward the east of Asshur</italic>.</p>
<p>Note that from the first verse of the Torah until the word <italic>made</italic> (Gen. 2:3), Scripture refers to the Deity as <italic>Elohim</italic>. Afterward, the honored and revered name (the Tetragrammaton) is coupled with it. How precious are the words of the ancients of blessed memory who said that the complete name of God is used over a complete world. Prior to the completion of creation there was no power to receive this name.<sup><xref rid="fn328">51</xref></sup> If God grants me life I will explain the secret of the Tetragrammaton when I comment upon the first Torah portion of the book of Exodus. I will then explain its meaning in the absolute and in the construct.</p>
<p>Note that the location of the ground from which Adam was created was close to the Garden of Eden.<sup><xref rid="fn329">52</xref></sup> I note this because some say that Adam was created out of the ground of the land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn330">53</xref></sup> They have overlooked <italic>And it came to pass, as they journeyed east</italic> (Gen. 11:2).<sup><xref rid="fn331">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. INTO THE GARDEN OF EDEN. <italic>Gan</italic> (garden) can be both masculine and feminine,<sup><xref rid="fn332">55</xref></sup> hence the plurals <italic>gannim</italic> and <italic>gannot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn333">56</xref></sup> We ask those who maintain that the words <italic>to till (dress) it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn334">57</xref></sup> <italic>and to keep it</italic> (le-ovdah u-le-shomrah) refer to the ground (<italic>adamah</italic>), how it is possible to till and keep a large area from a small one.<sup><xref rid="fn335">58</xref></sup> Furthermore, after Adam sinned God expelled him from the garden and commanded him to till the soil. But according to their interpretation he was already tilling the soil while he was living in the Garden of Eden. <italic>To till it</italic> (le-ovdah) therefore refers to the garden of whose fruit he ate. It was only after he sinned that he had to eat the grass of the ground, i.e., bread. <italic>To till it</italic> means to water it. <italic>To keep it</italic> means to guard the garden so that no animals enter therein and befoul it. Some say that <italic>le-ovdah</italic> means to serve God&#x2019;s commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn336">59</xref></sup> However, a commandment is not served.<sup><xref rid="fn337">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND THE LORD GOD COMMANDED THE MAN. The verb <italic>tzivvah</italic> (command) with the preposition <italic>al</italic> (upon) implies a prohibition. We similarly read, <italic>I will also command</italic> (atzavveh) <italic>the clouds</italic> (al he-avim) <italic>That they rain no rain upon it</italic> (Is. 5:6).</p>
<p>[17. THOU SHALT NOT EAT OF IT.] Even though I (God) permitted you to eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, do not eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.<sup><xref rid="fn338">61</xref></sup> One might ask, What need is there for the term <italic>of it</italic> after having stated <italic>but of the tree of the knowledge&#x2026;thou shalt not eat</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn339">62</xref></sup> The answer is that the Bible elaborates. We find a similar case in <italic>And she opened it, and saw it, even the child</italic> (Ex. 2:6).<sup><xref rid="fn340">63</xref></sup> It is also possible that the term <italic>of it</italic> means even a part of it. You will find the exact grammatical explanation of the term <italic>mi-mennu</italic> (of it) in the <italic>Sefer ha-yisod</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn341">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that Adam was an intelligent being, for God would not direct commands to one who was unintelligent. He was deficient in the knowledge of <italic>good and evil</italic> of only one thing.<sup><xref rid="fn342">65</xref></sup> Don&#x2019;t you see that Adam named every animal and fowl according to the nature of each of their respective species? Thus he was extremely intelligent. If Adam was unintelligent, God, knowing this, would not have brought His creatures to him to see what name he would give to each one of them.</p>
<p>God also showed Adam the tree of knowledge, for his wife knew that it was in the midst of the garden.<sup><xref rid="fn343">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND THE LORD GOD SAID. <italic>It is not good</italic> means it is not good for the man.<sup><xref rid="fn344">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>A HELP MEET. <italic>Help meet</italic> should be understood in the light of <italic>Two are better than one</italic> (Eccles. 4:9).</p>
<p>[19. WHATSOEVER THE MAN WOULD CALL.] The <italic>lamed</italic> (to) in the clause <italic>and whatsoever the man would call</italic> also applies<sup><xref rid="fn345">68</xref></sup> to the phrase <italic>living creature</italic>. Our clause is to be read as follows: <italic>and whatsoever the man would call to it, to every living creature, that was to be the name thereof</italic>. The verse elaborates,<sup><xref rid="fn346">69</xref></sup> as in <italic>And she opened it, and saw it, even the child</italic> (Ex. 2:6).<sup><xref rid="fn347">70</xref></sup> There are many other such instances.</p>
<p>[20. TO ALL CATTLE.] <italic>Le-khol</italic> (to all) also governs two words,<sup><xref rid="fn348">71</xref></sup> for the meaning of our verse is: <italic>And the man gave names to all cattle, and to all the fowl of the air</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn349">72</xref></sup> <italic>In that his men become few</italic> (Deut. 33:6)<sup><xref rid="fn350">73</xref></sup> and <italic>And I have not learned wisdom</italic> (Prov. 30:3)<sup><xref rid="fn351">74</xref></sup> are similar. There are many other such instances.</p>
<p>[BUT FOR ADAM.] The meaning of <italic>but for Adam he did not find a help meet</italic> is that Adam did not find a helpmeet for himself.<sup><xref rid="fn352">75</xref></sup> This is the way of the Hebrew language. Thus we find Samuel saying, <italic>And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel</italic> (I Sam. 12:11).<sup><xref rid="fn353">76</xref></sup> It appears farfetched to me that <italic>he did not find a help meet</italic> refers to God.</p>
<p>Scripture says here that the fowl were created out of the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn354">77</xref></sup> However, it states above that they were created out of the water.<sup><xref rid="fn355">78</xref></sup> This is so because the fowl were created out of both earth and water.</p>
<p>21. AND THE LORD GOD CAUSED A DEEP SLEEP TO FALL. <italic>Va-yappel</italic> (caused to fall) is a <italic>hifil</italic>, as is <italic>va-yashev</italic> (drove away) in <italic>and Abram drove them away</italic> (Gen. 15:11).<sup><xref rid="fn356">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>A DEEP SLEEP. <italic>Tardemah</italic> is a deeper sleep than <italic>shenah</italic>, and <italic>shenah</italic> is a deeper sleep than <italic>tenumah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn357">80</xref></sup> The <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>tardemah</italic> (deep sleep) is not part of its root.<sup><xref rid="fn358">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>ONE OF HIS RIBS. Adam had two sides.<sup><xref rid="fn359">82</xref></sup> <italic>Tzela</italic> here is like <italic>tzela</italic> (side) in <italic>and for the second side</italic> (tzela) <italic>of the tabernacle</italic> (Ex. 26:20).<sup><xref rid="fn360">83</xref></sup> <italic>Tzela</italic> is a feminine noun. It means a side.</p>
<p>INSTEAD THEREOF. <italic>Tachtennah</italic> means in its place. <italic>Tachtennah</italic> (instead thereof) spelled with a superfluous <italic>nun</italic> is in the singular. <italic>Tachtehah</italic> is its plural form. <italic>Tachteni</italic> (under me) and <italic>tachtai</italic> (under me)<sup><xref rid="fn361">84</xref></sup> are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn362">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. MADE HE. <italic>Va-yiven</italic> (made me) is a <italic>hifil</italic> conjugation.<sup><xref rid="fn363">86</xref></sup> We find similar instances with the <italic>kal</italic> conjugation in <italic>va-yifen</italic> (and he turned) (Ex. 7:23) and <italic>va-yiken</italic> (and he bought) (Gen. 33:19).</p>
<p>AND BROUGHT HER. When Adam awoke from his sleep he thought that the woman was brought<sup><xref rid="fn364">87</xref></sup> before him as the animals were brought before him. Scripture speaks of Adam&#x2019;s thoughts. Similarly, <italic>And the men pursued after them</italic> (Josh. 2:7).<sup><xref rid="fn365">88</xref></sup> It is also possible that the woman was created outside of the garden and then was brought to Adam. When he looked around he knew that she had been cut from him, for one of his sides with its flesh was missing and he felt that it had been closed with other flesh.</p>
<p>23. AND THE MAN SAID. Then Adam said, &#x201C;This time I have found a help meet like me for me, for this being came out of me.&#x201D; The tradition concerning Lilith is a homily.<sup><xref rid="fn366">89</xref></sup></p>

<p>[WOMAN.] The <italic>shin</italic> in the word <italic>ishah</italic> (woman) receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> in place of the inaudible <italic>yod</italic> which is found in the word <italic>ish</italic> (man).<sup><xref rid="fn369">92</xref></sup> However, it is possible that <italic>ishah</italic> (woman) receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> to distinguish it from <italic>ishah</italic> (her husband) for at times the <italic>dagesh</italic> in the suffixed pronominal <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>ishah</italic> (her husband)<sup><xref rid="fn370">93</xref></sup> is not pronounced. The plural <italic>nashim</italic> (women) is derived from the words <italic>enosh</italic> (man) and <italic>anashim</italic> (men).<sup><xref rid="fn371">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>[SHALL BE CALLED.] This refers to the name of the woman.<sup><xref rid="fn372">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>[SHE WAS TAKEN.] The <italic>dagesh</italic> is omitted in the <italic>kof</italic> of <italic>lukachah</italic> (she was taken) in order to simplify its enunciation. This word is a <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic> conjugation even though we do not find it conjugated in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn373">96</xref></sup></p>

However, this interpretation is farfetched.<sup><xref rid="fn375">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. NAKED. <italic>Arummim</italic> (naked) is an adjective. <italic>And stripped the naked</italic> (arummim) <italic>of their clothing</italic> (Job 22:6) is similar. Some say that <italic>arum</italic> (prudent) in <italic>A prudent man</italic> (arum) <italic>seeth the evil and hideth himself</italic> (Prov. 22:3) has essentially the same meaning. What the verse means is that the mind of the wise is uncovered (<italic>arum</italic>) and open to everything like the eye.<sup><xref rid="fn376">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WERE NOT ASHAMED. <italic>Yitboshashu</italic> (ashamed) is related to the word <italic>boshet</italic> (shame). It is an <italic>ayin</italic>, <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn377">100</xref></sup> The last letter of the root is doubled.<sup><xref rid="fn378">101</xref></sup> It is like the verb <italic>yitbonen</italic> (he will consider) (Job 11:11).<sup><xref rid="fn379">102</xref></sup> A <italic>kamatz</italic> is placed beneath the first <italic>shin</italic> because the word ends a verse.<sup><xref rid="fn380">103</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn278"><sup>1</sup> Hence Scripture states, <italic>And the heaven and the earth were finished</italic>, rather than, And the heaven, the earth and the oceans were finished.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn279"><sup>2</sup> <italic>And on the seventh day God finished</italic> implies that God created something on the seventh day. The question is what?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn280"><sup>3</sup> <italic>And on the seventh day God finished</italic> is to be translated as <italic>And by the seventh day God had finished His work which He had made</italic>. They similarly translate Deut. 25:4, <italic>Thou shalt not muzzle the ox before he treadeth out the corn</italic>, and render Ex. 12:15 as <italic>howbeit before the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn281"><sup>4</sup> Why give the <italic>bet</italic> a novel meaning (before) when in fact &#x201C;finished&#x201D; does not imply that any work was done on the Sabbath.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn283"><sup>6</sup> In other words part A of verse 2 refers to Friday, part B to the six days of creation. This also explains the reason why part A of the verse reads, <italic>His work</italic> and part B, <italic>all His work</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn284"><sup>7</sup> I.E. explains <italic>asher bara Elohim la&#x2019;asot</italic> (which God in creating had made) as follows: God created (<italic>bara</italic>) his creation in such a way that they would do (<italic>la&#x2019;asot</italic>), i.e., reproduce themselves in the future. That is why <italic>bara</italic> is a perfect and <italic>la&#x2019;asot</italic> is an infinitive (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn285"><sup>8</sup> They interpret <italic>asher bara Elohim la&#x2019;asot</italic> to mean, which God created and made. They maintain that <italic>la&#x2019;asot</italic>, an infinitive, is to be interpreted as <italic>asah</italic>, a perfect (Filwarg). They also do not differentiate between <italic>bara</italic> and <italic>asah</italic>, and interpret &#x201C;made&#x201D; in verse 2 as created (Filwarg, Krinsky). For I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation of <italic>bara</italic> see Gen. 1:1; for <italic>asah</italic> see verse 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn286"><sup>9</sup> According to Saadiah the blessing refers not to the Sabbath but rather to those who observe the Sabbath. We have translated according to Nachmanides&#x2019; rendering of I.E., which had a <italic>vav</italic> before sanctified.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn287"><sup>10</sup> I.E. usually renders <italic>toledot</italic> as &#x201C;accounts of.&#x201D; Cf. Gen. 6:9; 37:1. Here <italic>toledot</italic> refers to what heaven and earth produced: trees, living creatures, man.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn288"><sup>11</sup> I.E. explains that <italic>asah</italic> (make) means &#x201C;to fix in its final form.&#x201D; When the firmament and the earth received their final form, God commanded them to produce offspring (<italic>toledot</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn289"><sup>12</sup> The prophet first speaks of creation (<italic>berativ</italic>) and last, of fixing in final form (<italic>asitiv</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn290"><sup>13</sup> Scripture compares man to a fruit bearing tree. Cf. Ps. 1:1-3, <italic>Happy is the man&#x2026;And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn291"><sup>14</sup> The Hebrew word for speech is <italic>si&#x2019;ach</italic>. Speech is the fruit of the mouth. Hence the tree to which it is compared, <italic>si&#x2019;ach</italic>, must be a fruit-bearing tree (Filwarg).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn297"><sup>20</sup> I.E. reads <italic>ashan</italic> (smoke). That is, a smoke-like substance went up from the earth. Weiser suggests reading <italic>anan</italic> (cloud) because smoke is out of place here since I.E. speaks of clouds.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn298"><sup>21</sup> Hence <italic>yom ed</italic> means a cloudy day, i.e., a dark day or day of calamity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn299"><sup>22</sup> According to Saadiah the word <italic>lo</italic> found in verse 5 also applies to this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn300"><sup>23</sup> This sentence is omitted in <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. It has been suggested that a scribe mistakenly copied it from the previous note (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn301"><sup>24</sup> The root of this verb is therefore <italic>yod, tzadi, resh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn302"><sup>25</sup> This very term is also used in describing the creation of animals. Cf. Gen. 1:24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn303"><sup>26</sup> I.e., <italic>va-yitta</italic> (planted) is a pluperfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn304"><sup>27</sup> I.E. is trying to solve the following problem. In Genesis, Scripture refers to a &#x201C;garden&#x201D; in Eden (<italic>gan be-eden</italic>). However, in Ezek. 28:13 the Bible states, <italic>in Eden the garden of God</italic>. The former implies that the garden is located in Eden, the latter that Eden is located in the garden, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn305"><sup>28</sup> The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>me&#x2019;el</italic> is also to be placed before <italic>ve&#x2019;et</italic> and it is to be read as if written <italic>u-me&#x2019;et</italic>. Thus this verse is to be rendered: Even by the God (<italic>me&#x2019;el</italic>) of thy father who shall help thee, and even by (<italic>u-me&#x2019;et</italic>) the Almighty who shall bless thee.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn306"><sup>29</sup> The technical term used by I.E. for this is <italic>mesharet</italic> (or <italic>moshekh</italic>) <italic>atzmo ve-acher immo</italic>. Friedlander explains this phrase as follows: &#x201C;one word which stands for two&#x201D; (literally, the word draws itself and another with it).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn307"><sup>30</sup> Adam is a proper noun and a proper noun does not have a definite article placed in front of it. As to the secret alluded to by I.E., Filwarg comments, &#x201C;I do not understand what secret he is hinting at.&#x201D; However, it appears that I.E. is hinting that &#x201C;Adam&#x201D; is a collective noun meaning mankind, the secret being that God placed mankind in the Garden of Eden. I.E. will later elaborate on this theme when he speaks of the secret meaning of the garden (Kaputa). Abravanel writes, &#x201C;Ibn Ezra stirred the world by saying that the definite article which precedes the word &#x201C;Adam&#x201D; contains a secret. By this he means&#x2026; (that) Adam should be understood as a noun designating the genus of mankind rather than an individual.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn308"><sup>31</sup> According to Krinsky, I.E. is noting that a proper name which later becomes the name of a group may have a definite article placed in front of it. Thus Adam, although originally a proper noun, became a collective noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn309"><sup>32</sup> According to I.E. <italic>araunah</italic> is a collective noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn310"><sup>33</sup> See Kimchi, II Sam. 24:16. In our case it is an adjective meaning the one taken from the ground, and thus has a definite article prefixed to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn311"><sup>34</sup> A word in the construct cannot have a definite article placed before it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn312"><sup>35</sup> Ark has a definite article placed in front of it. Hence the phrase is to be read as if written, the ark, ark of the covenant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn313"><sup>36</sup> Prophecy has a definite article prefixed to it. Hence the phrase is to be read as if written, even the prophecy, prophecy of Oded the prophet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn314"><sup>37</sup> However, it is silent. There are times when the <italic>alef</italic> is not a root letter, e.g., <italic>the tillage of the poor</italic> (rashim) (Prov. 13:23). The <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>rashim</italic> (the poor) is not part of the word&#x2019;s stem (Filwarg).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn316"><sup>39</sup> The second river flowing out of the garden.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn317"><sup>40</sup> The Garden of Eden is located in the east (v. 8). Furthermore, according to I.E. the Garden of Eden lies south of the equator and the land of Israel is north of the equator. Thus the Gihon flows from the southeast of the land of Israel (Krinsky). Actually the Gihon is not a river but a spring located in the valley of Jehoshaphat. Here as in other places in his commentary I.E. errs with regard to geographical knowledge of the land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn318"><sup>41</sup> Hence, in contradistinction to the Gaon, the Pishon, too, must lie east of the land of Israel (Krinsky). However, the Nile is west of the land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn319"><sup>42</sup> &#x201C;For when it is summer time in the northern hemisphere, it is the time of the rainy season in the southern hemisphere. Thus the Nile, the source of which is in the southern hemisphere, swells during the summer&#x201D; Chevel, <italic>Ramban, Commentary on the Torah</italic>, Vol. I, p. 86, note 414.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn320"><sup>43</sup> For day and night to be equal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn321"><sup>44</sup> The Nile flows from the south to the north. The Garden of Eden is south of the equator toward the east. Thus if the source of the Nile is in the garden it must make this circuit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn322"><sup>45</sup> Whenever Saadiah came across an unfamiliar term he translated it as he saw fit. He explained Havilah as referring to Egypt because he translated Pishon as the Nile.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn323"><sup>46</sup> Cf. I.E., Ex. 28:9 and Lev. 11:13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn324"><sup>47</sup> Most texts of I.E. have the word <italic>mitzvot</italic> (commandments) instead of <italic>millot</italic> (words).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn325"><sup>48</sup> Not that it was identical to it. Saadiah says that <italic>bedolach</italic> resembles manna. As manna is round, so are <italic>bedolach</italic> round. This strengthens his interpretation that <italic>bedolach</italic> means pearls, for the Bible says that the appearance of the manna was like <italic>bedolach</italic> (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn326"><sup>49</sup> Thus <italic>kidmat</italic> is <italic>kedemah</italic> in the construct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn327"><sup>50</sup> In other words <italic>kedemah</italic> means to the east, <italic>kedem</italic>, east.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn328"><sup>51</sup> Creation came to an end with the making of man. The use of the Tetragrammaton is proper only with reference to man. See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 4:1 and Gen. 1:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn329"><sup>52</sup> Hence man was not created in the garden. The commentaries assume that man walked to the Garden of Eden. According to Rabbinic tradition man came to the garden on the very day that he was created, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that Adam was created close to the Garden of Eden (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn330"><sup>53</sup> <italic>The Kuzari</italic>, 2:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn331"><sup>54</sup> Literally, <italic>From the east</italic>. The garden was located in the east (v. 8). The tower of Babel was built after the survivors of the flood journeyed from the east (Gen. 11:2). We know that the ark rested on Mt. Ararat (Gen. 8:4); thus Mt. Ararat lies in the east (See I.E. on Gen. 11:2). Mt. Ararat (in the east) is far from the borders of Israel. Hence the Garden of Eden (in the east), too, must be far from the land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn332"><sup>55</sup> The pronominal suffixes of the verbs <italic>to toil</italic> and <italic>to keep</italic> are in the feminine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn333"><sup>56</sup> For the feminine plural form of garden see Eccles. 2:5. For the masculine plural form see Cant. 4:15. <italic>Gannim</italic> is masculine plural; <italic>gannot</italic>, feminine plural.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn334"><sup>57</sup> J.P.S. translates &#x201C;to dress it.&#x201D; The literal meaning of <italic>le-ovedah</italic> is to till it. Till fits in better with I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn335"><sup>58</sup> If Adam&#x2019;s task was to till and keep the soil outside the garden, then how was it possible for Adam to do this while he was in the garden? The land outside of the garden obviously extended for many miles. It would thus be impossible for Adam to live in the garden and tend the land outside of the garden. The pronominal suffixes (it) of <italic>le-ovdah</italic> and of <italic>le-shomrah</italic> are in the feminine. Those who say that these words refer to the ground do so because they believe <italic>gan</italic> to be masculine while ground is feminine. However, I.E. maintains that <italic>gan</italic> can be either masculine or feminine. Thus <italic>le-ovdah u-le-shomrah</italic> can refer to <italic>gan</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn336"><sup>59</sup> See <italic>Targum Yerushalmi</italic> on this verse. The root of the word till, <italic>ayin, bet, dalet</italic>, is also used in reference to worship (Deut. 6:13; 10:20).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn337"><sup>60</sup> While the root <italic>ayin, bet, dalet</italic> is used in referring to worship, it is not used in Scripture as a technical term for the practice of a precept. The term used for the latter is <italic>lishmor</italic> (to keep) (Deut. 8:1; 10:13). One serves (<italic>oved</italic>) God and observes (<italic>shomer</italic>) the commandments. One cannot be said to serve the commandments, hence I.E.&#x2019;s objection to this interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn338"><sup>61</sup> The Hebrew term implies a commandment to eat of the other trees in the garden, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn339"><sup>62</sup> The verse reads, <italic>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</italic>. It would have sufficed to state, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn340"><sup>63</sup> Scripture should have stated, <italic>And she opened it and saw the child</italic>. The elaboration is there for emphasis (Weiser).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn342"><sup>65</sup> Sexual desire. See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on 3:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn343"><sup>66</sup> Scripture does not explicitly tell us that God told Adam exactly where the tree was. However, from Eve&#x2019;s action we may surmise that He did. See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 3:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn344"><sup>67</sup> The verse literally reads: <italic>And the Lord God said, it is not good, being the man alone</italic>, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. Cherez suggests that I.E. is negating an interpretation which holds it is not good for creation that man be alone lest it be said that he is a god on earth. Cf. Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn345"><sup>68</sup> The verse literally reads: and, whatsoever the man would call it (<italic>lo</italic>) every living creature.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn346"><sup>69</sup> That is, it repeats the object <italic>to it, to every living creature</italic> (Shadal). See note 62.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn347"><sup>70</sup> See note 63.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn348"><sup>71</sup> See above, note 29. According to I.E. <italic>le-khol</italic> (to all), which is prefaced to <italic>cattle</italic>, also governs <italic>fowl</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn350"><sup>73</sup> It should be read as if written, In that his men not become few. In other words, the word <italic>ve-al</italic> in the first part of the verse also governs <italic>yehi</italic> (let).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn351"><sup>74</sup> The verse literally concludes, <italic>And I have knowledge of the Holy One</italic>. The <italic>not</italic> of the first part also applies to the second part. Thus the above should read: And I do not have knowledge of the Holy One. Thus <italic>not</italic> governs two words.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn352"><sup>75</sup> J.P.S. translates, <italic>but for Adam there was not found a help meet</italic>. However, the literal reading of the verse is: <italic>but for Adam he did not find a help meet</italic>. The question is, to whom does &#x201C;he&#x201D; refer? I.E. suggests it refers to Adam, not God. I.E. points out that the Bible occasionally uses a proper noun in instances where a reflexive pronoun is expected. Cf. David Kimchi&#x2019;s commentary on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn353"><sup>76</sup> Rather than saying &#x201C;and me,&#x201D; Samuel says, &#x201C;and Samuel.&#x201D; Here, too, rather than saying &#x201C;but for himself he did not find a help meet&#x201D; the Bible says, <italic>but for Adam</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn363"><sup>86</sup> This comment is difficult. <italic>Va-yiven</italic> is a <italic>kal</italic> conjugation. Krinsky and Weiser suggest deleting it. Indeed, some versions do. If it is retained then it must be explained as follows: <italic>Va-yiven</italic> (from the root <italic>bet, nun, heh</italic>) is short for <italic>va-yivneh</italic>. I.E. notes that this type of short form of a <italic>lamed heh</italic> root is found in the <italic>hifil</italic> and in the <italic>kal</italic> (Weiser). <italic>Vat.

<ftnote id="fn364"><sup>87</sup> The word brought is not to be taken literally. The woman was created next to Adam as he slept; thus she could not have been brought to Adam.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn367"><sup>90</sup> A <italic>lamed</italic> in front of a word usually means to. <italic>Zot</italic> means this. Thus <italic>le-zot</italic> should be rendered to this.

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 3</title>
<p>1. NOW THE SERPENT. Some say that the woman understood and knew the language of the animals. They interpret <italic>And the serpent said</italic> as meaning, that the serpent spoke through signs.<sup><xref rid="fn381">1</xref></sup> Others say that the serpent was in reality Satan.<sup><xref rid="fn382">2</xref></sup> Now why don&#x2019;t they look at what Scripture states at the close of this chapter (v. 14 and 15)? How is Satan to crawl upon his belly or eat the dust of the ground?<sup><xref rid="fn383">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, what meaning is there to the curse <italic>they shall bruise thy head</italic> if the reference is to Satan?<sup><xref rid="fn384">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many err and inquire why the serpent was cursed. They ask, was the serpent fully intelligent?<sup><xref rid="fn385">5</xref></sup> Was he commanded by God to refrain from beguiling the woman?<sup><xref rid="fn386">6</xref></sup> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says since we know that only humans are intelligent and capable of speaking, we must conclude that neither the serpent nor Balaam&#x2019;s ass spoke. He argues that in reality an angel spoke for them. However, Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni took issue with him.<sup><xref rid="fn387">7</xref></sup> On the other hand, Rabbi Solomon ibn Gabirol, the great Spanish scholar and poet who wrote metered verse, arose and disagreed with Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni. It appears to me that we are to interpret the account of the serpent literally. The serpent spoke and walked in an upright position. The One who gave intelligence to man also gave it to the serpent. Scripture itself bears witness that the serpent, although not as intelligent as man, <italic>was more subtle</italic> (arum) <italic>than any beast of the field</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn388">8</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>arum</italic> (subtle) is wise, i.e., one who conducts his affairs intelligently. Now do not be surprised that Scripture uses the term <italic>arum</italic> (subtle, in v. 1) after <italic>arummim</italic> (naked in Gen. 2:25) when each of these words has a different meaning. Scripture is being poetic. Similarly, <italic>With the jawbone of an ass</italic> (ha-chamor), <italic>heaps upon heaps</italic> (chamor chamoratayim) (Judges 15:16), and <italic>on thirty ass colts</italic> (ayarim), <italic>and they had thirty cities</italic> (ayarim) (Jud. 10:4).</p>
<p>Furthermore, if an angel spoke via the mouth of the serpent, then the serpent did not sin.<sup><xref rid="fn389">9</xref></sup> This angel could not be God&#x2019;s messenger.<sup><xref rid="fn390">10</xref></sup> Neither does an angel rebel against God.<sup><xref rid="fn391">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Those who ask, how did the serpent find the woman,<sup><xref rid="fn392">12</xref></sup> are not asking a valid question.<sup><xref rid="fn393">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of the term <italic>af ki</italic> (yea) shows that the serpent spoke other things to the woman and that at the end of his conversation with her said, &#x201C;yea much more so (<italic>af ki</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn394">14</xref></sup> now that God said: <italic>Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden</italic> (v. 1).&#x201D;</p>
<p>The serpent did not mention the revered and feared name of God<sup><xref rid="fn395">15</xref></sup> because he did not know it. The woman also added to God&#x2019;s commandment, <italic>neither shall ye touch it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn396">16</xref></sup> The wife of Manoah did the same when she quoted the angel as saying, <italic>for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death</italic> (Jud. 13:7).<sup><xref rid="fn397">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND YE SHALL BE AS GOD. As angels.<sup><xref rid="fn398">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND WHEN THE WOMAN SAW. In her heart.</p>
<p>AND THAT THE TREE WAS TO BE DESIRED. Because it had the power to make one wise, and her eyes would &#x201C;open.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn399">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>[UNTO HER HUSBAND WITH HER.] The meaning of <italic>with her</italic> is that they ate together of the fruit and that she disclosed to him the secret that the serpent had revealed to her. Adam thus did not sin unwittingly and was therefore punished for violating God&#x2019;s command.</p>
<p>Many commentators say that the tree of knowledge was a fig tree. They base their assertion on <italic>and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles</italic> (v. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn400">20</xref></sup> However, if this interpretation were correct, the Bible would say, &#x201C;And they sewed leaves of the tree of the knowledge.&#x201D; Many others say that it was a wheat plant.<sup><xref rid="fn401">21</xref></sup> However, in my opinion the two trees in the midst of the garden were unique species not found anywhere else on the face of the earth. One of them, the tree of knowledge, possessed the power to instill sexual desire. Therefore the man and woman covered their nakedness. The meaning of <italic>va-yitperu</italic> (sewed) is well-known.<sup><xref rid="fn402">22</xref></sup> <italic>Tafarti</italic> in <italic>I have sewed</italic> (tafarti) <italic>sackcloth upon my skin</italic> (Job 16:15) is similar. Those who ask where Adam and Eve got a needle (to sew their girdle) emit hot air. Adam and Eve could have used a sharp piece of wood. Upon eating of the tree of knowledge, Adam knew (<italic>yada</italic>) his wife. <italic>Yada</italic> (knew) is a euphemism for sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse is called &#x201C;knowledge&#x201D; because sexual desire came from the tree of knowledge. Moreover, a young man begins to have sexual desire at the age at which he begins to &#x201C;know&#x201D; good and evil.<sup><xref rid="fn403">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>tree of life</italic> extended life so that by partaking of it man would live for many years. <italic>Le-olam</italic> (v. 22) does not mean forever. We find this to be the case with the term <italic>olam</italic> in <italic>and he shall serve him for ever</italic> (le-olam) (Ex. 21:6),<sup><xref rid="fn404">24</xref></sup> and in <italic>and there abide for ever</italic> (I Sam. 1:22)<sup><xref rid="fn405">25</xref></sup> and in many other verses,</p>
<p>Some commentators insist that the verse <italic>for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</italic> (Gen. 2:17) indicates that man was created immortal and that he became mortal as a punishment for his sin. Many ask, what sin did Adam&#x2019;s children commit that they were punished with death? Now this is absurd. Man and beast both share a common spirit (life force) through which they live and experience sensations in this world. As animals are destined to die, so must man die. The advantage of man over beast lies in the portion from above (the soul) which man has been granted. A Greek physician has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is impossible for man to live forever.<sup><xref rid="fn406">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND THEY HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LORD GOD WALKING. They heard the voice of God walking toward evening, at the time of the day when the breeze blows. Scripture employs the term <italic>holekh</italic> (walking) when referring to a voice as seen in <italic>The sound thereof shall go</italic> (yelekh) <italic>like the serpent&#x2019;s</italic> (Jer. 46:22), and <italic>And when the voice of the horn waxed</italic> (holekh) <italic>louder and louder</italic> (Ex. 19:19). However, the Spanish grammarian, Rabbi Jonah ibn Janah, says that this verse is to be interpreted as follows: And they heard the voice of God as man was walking in the garden. He also interprets <italic>the day</italic> referred to in <italic>for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</italic> (Gen. 2:17)<sup><xref rid="fn407">27</xref></sup> as meaning a thousand years, as the Midrash does.<sup><xref rid="fn408">28</xref></sup> Others say that Adam was created on a Friday and died on a Friday.<sup><xref rid="fn409">29</xref></sup> Others say that the meaning of <italic>for in the day&#x2026;thou shalt surely die</italic> is that on that day you will incur the death penalty. Still others say that die at times means punishment, as seen in the verse <italic>the man that hath done this deserveth to die</italic> (II Sam. 12:5).<sup><xref rid="fn410">30</xref></sup> Still others say the meaning of this verse is that on the day you eat of this tree you will begin to die. They bring proof from a child.<sup><xref rid="fn411">31</xref></sup> According to my thinking the correct interpretation of this verse is to be found in the words of the Rabbinic sages who said that Adam repented.<sup><xref rid="fn412">32</xref></sup> Their interpretation is in keeping with the words of Jeremiah who says, <italic>At one instant I may speak concerning a nation&#x2026;to destroy it, but if that nation turn from their evil.. J repent of the evil that I thought to do unto it</italic> (Jer. 18:7, 8).</p>
<p>9. AND THE LORD GOD CALLED. <italic>Where art thou</italic> was a means of starting a conversation. Similarly, <italic>Where is Abel thy brother</italic>? (Gen. 4:9).<sup><xref rid="fn413">33</xref></sup> Behold, Cain denied his brother&#x2019;s whereabouts, but God responded, <italic>the voice of thy brother&#x2019;s blood crieth unto Me from the ground</italic> (Gen. 4:10).</p>
<p>11. SHOULDEST NOT. <italic>Bilti</italic> with a <italic>lamed</italic> prefixed to it (<italic>le-vilti</italic>) means &#x201C;not to.&#x201D; Without this <italic>lamed</italic> (<italic>bilti</italic>) it means &#x201C;only.&#x201D;</p>
<p>EAT. <italic>Akhol</italic> (eat) is an infinitive. It is like <italic>shemor</italic> (keep) in<sup><xref rid="fn414">34</xref></sup> <italic>in not keeping</italic> (shemor) <italic>His commandments</italic> (Deut. 8:11).</p>
<p>12. WHOM THOU GAVEST TO BE WITH ME. Thou gavest to me one who gave me the fruit to eat. The word <italic>immadi</italic> (to be with me) means the same as <italic>immi</italic> (with me). Its meaning is: to be with me in the garden. However, <italic>immadi</italic>, in contradistinction to <italic>immi</italic>, is found only in the first person singular.</p>
<p>AND I DID EAT. The <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>va-okhel</italic> (and I did eat) is a first person imperfect prefix. Its vowel (a <italic>cholam</italic>) takes the place of the <italic>alef</italic> of the root that has been dropped. The <italic>khaf</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic> because <italic>and I did eat</italic> comes at the end of a verse. A <italic>vav</italic> prefixed to a participle is always vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>, and never with a <italic>kamatz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn415">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. BEGUILED ME. Persuaded me.</p>
<p>14. CURSED. The serpent was cursed with a short life.<sup><xref rid="fn416">36</xref></sup> However, the correct interpretation is that the serpent was cursed in manner of locomotion.<sup><xref rid="fn417">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>UPON THY BELLY. <italic>Gechonekha</italic> (thy belly) means thy chest. We cannot determine if the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>gakhon</italic> (thy belly) is part of the root of this word, as the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>adon</italic> (lord) is, or if it is a paradigm <italic>nun</italic> like the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>zadon</italic> (insolence).<sup><xref rid="fn418">38</xref></sup> Those who say that <italic>gakhon</italic> is so called because of the air that rushes forth from it<sup><xref rid="fn419">39</xref></sup> are indulging in homiletics. They similarly explain Gihon (Gen. 2:13). They also say that Pishon (Gen. 2:11) comes from the same root as <italic>tafushu</italic> (ye gambol) in <italic>Because ye gambol</italic> (tafushu) <italic>as a heifer</italic> (Jer. 50:11). Also, they say that Perat (the Euphrates, Gen. 2:14) comes from the same roots as <italic>Be fruitful</italic> (peru), <italic>and multiply</italic> (u-revu) (Gen. 1:28). But they are unable to cross the great river, the Chiddeckel (the Tigris) (Gen. 1:28), which stood before them.<sup><xref rid="fn420">40</xref></sup> They decided that it is made up of two words, <italic>chad</italic> (swift) and <italic>kal</italic> (light), and means the river whose waters are swift and light.</p>
<p>15. AND I WILL PUT ENMITY&#x2026;THEY SHALL BRUISE THY HEAD. Her children shall smite thee upon thy head. <italic>Yeshufeni</italic> (bruise) in <italic>He that would break me</italic> (yeshufeni) <italic>with a tempest</italic> (Job 9:17) is similar to <italic>yeshufekha</italic> (shall bruise thee). Look at what follows and you will see that it is so.<sup><xref rid="fn421">41</xref></sup> A <italic>bet</italic> has been omitted from the word <italic>rosh</italic> (head) in <italic>they shall bruise thy head</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn422">42</xref></sup> We find the same in <italic>into the house</italic> (bet) <italic>of the Lord</italic><sup><xref rid="fn423">43</xref></sup> (II Kings 12:17).</p>
<p>HEEL. <italic>Ekev</italic> means the foot. If the head symbolizes the first, then the heel symbolizes the last. <italic>Akevo</italic> in <italic>their rear</italic> (akevo) <italic>lying in wait on the west</italic> (Josh. 8:13), is similar.</p>
<p>16. I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY. <italic>Harbah</italic> (multiply) is an infinitive.</p>
<p>THY PAIN. The pain a woman suffers when she is deflowered.<sup><xref rid="fn424">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THY TRAVAIL. The <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>ve-heronekh</italic> (and thy travail) is not a root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn425">45</xref></sup> Pregnancy is considered by our verse to be a punishment because it and childbirth are a burden to women.<sup><xref rid="fn426">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>THY DESIRE. Thy obedience.<sup><xref rid="fn427">47</xref></sup> This means you will obey whatever your husband commands you for you are under his authority to do his will.</p>
<p>17. AND UNTO ADAM&#x2026;CURSED IS THE GROUND. It will not yield much produce.</p>
<p>IN TOIL THOU SHALT EAT OF IT. This is short for thou shalt eat of its produce.<sup><xref rid="fn428">48</xref></sup> <italic>And let them be of those that eat at thy table</italic> (I Kings 2:7)<sup><xref rid="fn429">49</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>18. THORNS ALSO AND THISTLES. <italic>Kotz</italic> refers to large thorns. <italic>Dardar</italic> (thistles) are smaller than thorns. Its root is <italic>dalet, resh</italic> (<italic>dar</italic>). The other two letters of the word are not root letters.<sup><xref rid="fn430">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IN TOIL.] Thou shalt toil in opening, harrowing and sowing.<sup><xref rid="fn431">51</xref></sup> In addition to this, man will also suffer the sick evil of finding thorns growing amidst the produce of the field.</p>
<p>[THE HERB OF THE FIELD.] Bread. For prior to this, man sustained himself with the fruits of the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>[19. IN THE SWEAT OF THY FACE SHALT THOU EAT BREAD]. Unlike the animals, you will have to work at winnowing, grinding, kneading and cooking before you can eat.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>ze&#x2019;at</italic> (sweat of) can be ascertained from Rabbinic sources.<sup><xref rid="fn432">52</xref></sup> It follows the paradigm of <italic>shenah</italic> (sleep). Its root is <italic>yod, zayin, ayin</italic>. <italic>Ba-yazah</italic> in <italic>they shall not gird themselves with anything that causeth sweat</italic> (ba-yazah) (Ezek. 44:18) is similar. The meaning of the verse is, they shall not come to sweat.</p>
<p>We know that man is created out of the four elements. What, then, does Scripture mean by <italic>for out of it (dust) was thou taken</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn433">53</xref></sup> The answer is that man&#x2019;s skeletal frame is created out of earth (dust). Hence the bones are heavy<sup><xref rid="fn434">54</xref></sup> and lack sensation. The skeletal frame is the foundation of the body. Look, Scripture states, <italic>and the bones came together, bone to its bone</italic> (Ezek. 37:7). The bones are like the frame of a house. Thus after the bones came together <italic>and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above</italic> (Ezek. 37:8). Similarly Scripture states, <italic>and ye shall carry up my bones from hence</italic> (Gen. 50:25).</p>
<p>20. EVE. The <italic>yod</italic> and <italic>vav</italic> are interchangeable.<sup><xref rid="fn435">55</xref></sup> We thus find <italic>hoyah</italic> and <italic>hoveh</italic> interchanged in <italic>behold, the hand of the Lord is upon</italic> (hoyah) <italic>thy cattle</italic> (Ex. 9:3), and in <italic>and thou wouldest be</italic> (hoveh) <italic>be their king</italic> (Neh. 6:6). The reason she was called Chavvah and not Chayyah is to distinguish her name from the noun meaning animal (<italic>chayyah</italic>).</p>
<p>THE MOTHER OF ALL LIVING. Humans.</p>
<p>21. GARMENTS OF SKIN. Some say that Adam and Eve originally consisted of bone and flesh, and God now covered them with skin.<sup><xref rid="fn436">56</xref></sup> Others say <italic>garments of skin</italic> means garments for their skin.<sup><xref rid="fn437">57</xref></sup> Still others say that there exists an animal which has a form similar to that of man, and God commanded that it shed its skin.<sup><xref rid="fn438">58</xref></sup> However, one should in reality not bother to inquire into this matter. We ought to believe that God made garments of skin for Adam and Eve. Who can recount all of God&#x2019;s mighty acts? Who can tell of all of his wonders? There is no end to God&#x2019;s greatness.</p>
<p>22. AND THE LORD GOD SAID&#x2026;AS ONE OF US. When one (<italic>echad</italic>) is in the absolute, it has a cantillical note which indicates the foregoing and it is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic> beneath the <italic>alef</italic>. However, when it is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>alef</italic> (<italic>achad</italic>) it is in the construct. Similarly, <italic>As one of</italic> (ke-achad) <italic>the tribes of Israel</italic> (Gen. 49:16). Hence, according to the rules of grammar, the word <italic>ke-achad</italic> (as one of) cannot have the meaning of as one.<sup><xref rid="fn439">59</xref></sup> Additionally, if <italic>ke-achad</italic> is in the absolute, then it is meaningless.<sup><xref rid="fn440">60</xref></sup> Furthermore, if <italic>ke-achad</italic> is in the absolute, the notes should have connected <italic>mi-mennu</italic> (of us) to <italic>la-da&#x2019;at</italic> (to know).<sup><xref rid="fn441">61</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Mi-mennu</italic> is a plural,<sup><xref rid="fn442">62</xref></sup> as in <italic>ish mi-mennu</italic> (none of us) (Gen. 23:6). I have already explained in <italic>The Book of Foundation</italic> why the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>mi-mennu</italic> receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> when in the plural.<sup><xref rid="fn443">63</xref></sup> The Babylonian grammarians who do not place a <italic>dagesh</italic> in it are in error.<sup><xref rid="fn444">64</xref></sup> The meaning of the verse (v. 22) is the same as <italic>ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil</italic> (v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn445">65</xref></sup> On the other hand, God might be saying what was in Adam&#x2019;s mind.<sup><xref rid="fn446">66</xref></sup> The use of the term <italic>of us</italic> presents no problem. It is similar to <italic>Let us make man in our image</italic> (Gen. 1:26) and <italic>Come, let us go down</italic> (Gen. 11:7). God in all these cases is addressing the angels.</p>
<p>23. THEREFORE THE LORD GOD SENT HIM FORTH. When the word <italic>shelach</italic> (sent forth) is followed by a <italic>mem</italic>, it has a negative connotation and means banished, as in <italic>cast them out</italic> (shalach) of <italic>My sight</italic> (Jer. 15:1). The great Spanish scholar who interpreted <italic>sent him forth</italic> in our verse in a positive way, as in <italic>and Abraham went with them to bring them</italic> (le-shallecham) <italic>on the way</italic> (Gen. 18:16), and in <italic>and he hath sent him away</italic> (va-yeshallechehu), <italic>and he is gone in peace</italic> (II Sam. 3:23), erred. For if he was right then the place Adam was going to was a better place than the Garden of Eden. If this sage should ask, if the meaning of <italic>sent him forth</italic> is he banished him, then why does Scripture go on to say, <italic>So He drove out the man</italic> (v. 24)?<sup><xref rid="fn447">67</xref></sup> The answer is that when man was driven from the garden (v. 4), God placed the cherubim at the east of the Garden of Eden.<sup><xref rid="fn448">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE CHERUBIM.] Some say that cherubim means like images of youths,<sup><xref rid="fn449">69</xref></sup> which is the translation of the Aramaic <italic>ke-ravyah</italic>. However, I believe that the word is a general term for any image. Ezekiel, who first says that he saw the image of an ox (Ezek. 1:10) and later speaks of a cherub (Ezek. 10:14), refers to one and the same image. The image was not changed from that of an ox to that of a cherub because an ox would be a reminder of the sin of the golden calf, as this sin was not committed in Ezekiel&#x2019;s day.<sup><xref rid="fn450">70</xref></sup> When Ezekiel speaks of <italic>the</italic> cherub (10:14) he has in mind the image he had mentioned previously (the image of an ox in 1:10). Therefore every image of an ox is a cherub, but not every cherub is an image of an ox. Proof of this is that Ezekiel refers to all images that he had seen as cherubim (10:20).<sup><xref rid="fn451">71</xref></sup> Our verse speaks of <italic>the cherubim</italic>, which implies the cherubim known to all, i.e., angels.<sup><xref rid="fn452">72</xref></sup> They had a flaming two-edged sword in their hands. The meaning of <italic>which turned every way</italic> is that the sword had two edges. Those who say that the flaming sword refers to the sun are incorrect.<sup><xref rid="fn453">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AT THE EAST. <italic>Mi-kedem</italic> means at the east.<sup><xref rid="fn454">74</xref></sup> Note, the story of the garden of Eden is to be interpreted literally. There is no doubt that it happened exactly as described in Scripture. Nevertheless, it also has a secret meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn455">75</xref></sup> It alludes to the following: Intellect (the Garden of Eden)<sup><xref rid="fn456">76</xref></sup> gave birth to desire (the tree of knowledge). Desire gave birth to man&#x2019;s actions. It is via his actions that man can elevate himself, for the force that propels his desire is in front of him.<sup><xref rid="fn457">77</xref></sup> The fig leaves prove this.<sup><xref rid="fn458">78</xref></sup> Man&#x2019;s actions are also called the testing ground, for by them man is tried. Intellect and desire are only potential.<sup><xref rid="fn459">79</xref></sup> The one who understands the secrets of the tree of knowledge will understand the secret of the four rivers that divided into four parts (Gen. 2:10).<sup><xref rid="fn460">80</xref></sup> This is the secret of the Garden of Eden and the garments of skin.<sup><xref rid="fn461">81</xref></sup> There is also an allusion in all of this to man&#x2019;s potential immortality (the tree of life). The intelligent will understand that this is the ultimate purpose of man&#x2019;s life on earth.<sup><xref rid="fn462">82</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn381"><sup>1</sup> That is, the serpent did not actually speak. He conveyed his intentions through signs; i.e., he went to the tree and pantomimed the eating of the fruit thereof.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn382"><sup>2</sup> Satan took the form of the serpent.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn387"><sup>7</sup> Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni held that the serpent actually spoke. Some editions read: &#x201C;with them,&#x201D; i.e., with Saadiah and the others who do not interpret that the serpent actually spoke.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn390"><sup>10</sup> God would not send an angel to induce Adam and Eve to sin.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn393"><sup>13</sup> The serpent may have encountered the woman at the gate of the garden and engaged her in conversation there (Krinsky), or she may have left the garden briefly and met the serpent outside.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn394"><sup>14</sup> I.E. argues that <italic>af ki</italic> (yea) is a technical term used in a <italic>kal ve-chomer</italic>, an argument from a minor to a major premise. Cf. Job 25:6. Hence a conversation had to precede this final point. See Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn395"><sup>15</sup> The Tetragrammaton. The serpent employed Elohim when referring to God.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn408"><sup>28</sup> The Midrash states that a day of God is a thousand years. Thus what God was telling Adam was, &#x201C;If you eat of the tree of knowledge you will die at the end of a thousand years.&#x201D; Cf. <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 19:14.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn411"><sup>31</sup> A cryptic comment. It is suggested that I.E. draws a parallel to a child who grows to sexual maturity and then begins to decline in physical strength (Krinsky). Filwarg rejects this interpretation by noting that physical decline does not set in with sexual maturity. However, it should be noted that medieval man believed that the emission of semen weakened the body and hastened its decline (see Maimonides, <italic>Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot De&#x2019;ot</italic>, Chap. 4). Thus man&#x2019;s decline sets in with his sexual maturity. Since, according to I.E., man&#x2019;s sexual maturity came with the eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, his decline, too, started at this time.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn412"><sup>32</sup> Had Adam not repented, he would have died on the day he ate of the tree of knowledge. But he repented and thus was spared.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn413"><sup>33</sup> God thus knew what happened to Abel. Hence <italic>Where is Abel thy brother</italic> was a means of starting a conversation. Similarly God knew where Adam was, and <italic>Where art thou</italic> was a means of starting a conversation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn414"><sup>34</sup> <italic>Shemor</italic> also is an infinitive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn415"><sup>35</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>va-okhel</italic> is a first person perfect and not a participle. I.E. makes this point because a participle is vocalized with a <italic>cholam</italic> over the first radical and a <italic>tzere</italic> beneath the second radical. Hence <italic>va-okhel</italic> at first glance appears to be a participle. I.E. points out that this is not so. As a participle it would not have a <italic>vav</italic> with a <italic>kamatz</italic> affixed to it since a connective <italic>vav</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>. Since the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>va-okhel</italic> has a <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath it, it must be a <italic>vav</italic> conversive, changing <italic>okhal</italic>, an imperfect, to <italic>va-okhal</italic>, a perfect. However, because <italic>va-okhal</italic> comes at the end of a sentence it is vocalized <italic>va-okhel</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn416"><sup>36</sup> Just as blessing is an addition of the good (see I.E. on Gen. 2:3), curse is a diminution of the good. According to this interpretation <italic>cursed art thou</italic> refers to the serpent&#x2019;s life span.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn417"><sup>37</sup> He lost his legs and consequently could no longer walk erect. According to this interpretation <italic>cursed art thou</italic> refers to the serpent&#x2019;s means of locomotion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn418"><sup>38</sup> <italic>Zadon</italic> (insolence) comes from the root <italic>zayin, vav, dalet</italic>; therefore the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>zadon</italic> is not part of its root.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn419"><sup>39</sup> From the root <italic>gimel, vav, chet</italic>, meaning to burst forth. They explained Gihon to mean the dashing river, Perat as the river whose waters are fruitful and multiply, and Pishon as the gamboling river.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn420"><sup>40</sup> They were unable to derive it from one root.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn421"><sup>41</sup> The second part of the verse quoted from Job reads, <italic>And multiply my wounds without cause</italic>. This proves that the verb <italic>yeshufeni</italic> means he will bruise me, or smite me. Since <italic>yeshufekha</italic> and <italic>yeshufeni</italic> come from one root, they have one meaning. Hence <italic>yeshufekha</italic> means shall bruise thee.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn422"><sup>42</sup> The verse literally reads, <italic>They shall bruise thee head</italic>. With a <italic>bet</italic> it reads, <italic>They shall bruise thee upon the head</italic>. The <italic>bet</italic> is to be supplied by the reader.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn423"><sup>43</sup> The verse should read, <italic>be-vet Adonai</italic>. However, it reads, <italic>bet Adonai</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn424"><sup>44</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 34:12. The Bible speaks of pain and conception rather than conception and pain. Hence the pain spoken of by Scripture precedes the conception.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn425"><sup>45</sup> The root of conceive is <italic>heh, resh, heh</italic>. <italic>Herayon</italic> refers to pregnancy and childbirth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn426"><sup>46</sup> Elsewhere in Scripture pregnancy is considered to be a blessing, as seen in the verse <italic>Blessings&#x2026;of the womb</italic> (Gen. 49:25).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn427"><sup>47</sup> Perhaps I.E. understood <italic>thy desire</italic> to mean your husband&#x2019;s desire will be your desire. Weiser suggests that the woman&#x2019;s desire for her husband will be so strong that she will listen to everything that he commands her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn428"><sup>48</sup> The verse literally reads, <italic>thou shalt eat it (the ground)</italic>. However, man does not eat the ground. Therefore I.E. says that our verse is abridged (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn429"><sup>49</sup> The verse literally reads, <italic>and let them be of those who eat thy table</italic>. The words &#x201C;the food of&#x201D; must be supplied by the reader.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn430"><sup>50</sup> They indicate that the word is a diminutive, i.e., <italic>dar</italic> a thistle, <italic>dardar</italic> a small thistle (Filwarg). For alternate interpretations see Weiser. I.E. literally reads, <italic>He lives</italic> (dar) <italic>alone, for his brother is missing</italic> (ne&#x2019;edar).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn431"><sup>51</sup> Cf. Is. 28:24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn432"><sup>52</sup> The rabbis often employ the term <italic>ze&#x2019;ah</italic> for sweat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn433"><sup>53</sup> The four elements are: fire, air, water and earth. Why does Scripture only mention dust (earth)? At man&#x2019;s death his body decomposes into all four elements (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn434"><sup>54</sup> Earth is the heaviest element. The Bible refers to the body as bones (Gen. 50:25) because they form man&#x2019;s frame. Man is said to come from the earth because his bones are created out of dust.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn435"><sup>55</sup> The Bible says that the woman was called <italic>Chavvah</italic> because she was the mother of all <italic>chai</italic>. If this is the case then she should have been called <italic>chayyah</italic>. Thus I.E. points out that the <italic>vav</italic> and <italic>yod</italic> interchange and that <italic>chayyah</italic> and <italic>chavvah</italic> are one and the same.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn436"><sup>56</sup> The problem which the commentaries found in this verse is, where did the skins to cover them come from? No animal was yet killed or had died so that its skin would be available for use as material for clothes (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn437"><sup>57</sup> The garments were not made out of skin. They were garments for their skin. These commentators interpret as if written <italic>le-or</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn438"><sup>58</sup> Hence the skin. The skin garments thus fitted man perfectly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn439"><sup>59</sup> Onkelos interpreted <italic>ke-achad</italic> in this way: &#x201C;Man has become one on earth.&#x201D; Cf. Rashi. Man is one on earth as I am one in heaven. I.E. disagrees, for <italic>ke-achad</italic> is in the construct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn440"><sup>60</sup> If <italic>ke-achad</italic> is in the absolute, then Scripture reads, man is like one. This is a meaningless statement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn441"><sup>61</sup> Not to <italic>ke-achad</italic>. A word in the absolute is not connected by a cantillical note to the word that follows. Since <italic>ke-achad</italic> is connected to <italic>mi-mennu</italic> it must be in the construct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn442"><sup>62</sup> Onkelos translates <italic>mi-mennu</italic> as a singular. The word <italic>mi-mennu</italic> can be rendered <italic>of us</italic> or <italic>of him</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn443"><sup>63</sup> The word <italic>mi-mennu</italic> should have been spelled with two <italic>nuns</italic>. The <italic>dagesh</italic> makes up for the missing <italic>nun</italic> (Weiser). I.E. makes this point here because the word <italic>mi-mennu</italic> has a <italic>dagesh</italic>. He does not want one to think mistakenly that it is a singular because of this <italic>dagesh</italic>. See next note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn444"><sup>64</sup> The Babylonian grammarians, in contradistinction to the Palestinian grammarians, place a <italic>dagesh</italic> in <italic>mi-mennu</italic> when it is singular and omit the <italic>dagesh</italic> when it is plural. I.E. says that the Palestinians who place a <italic>dagesh</italic> in both instances are correct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn445"><sup>65</sup> Man has become like an angel. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on verse 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn446"><sup>66</sup> Adam now thinks that he has become as one of us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn447"><sup>67</sup> If <italic>sent forth</italic> means <italic>drove out</italic>, then Scripture is being redundant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn448"><sup>68</sup> It does not relate that man was driven out, but rather tells that when man was driven out God did the following. It thus does not repeat verse 24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn449"><sup>69</sup> See <italic>Hagigah</italic> 13b. The Talmud says that the Hebrew word <italic>keruv</italic> is like the Aramaic <italic>ke-ravyah, ke</italic> (like), <italic>ravyah</italic> (a child).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn450"><sup>70</sup> <italic>Hagigah</italic> 13b states, &#x201C;One verse says&#x2026;<italic>and they had the face of an ox</italic> (Ezek. 1:10). Elsewhere it is written&#x2026;<italic>the face of a cherub</italic> (Ezek. 10:14). Resh Lakish said: Ezekiel entreated concerning it and changed it into a cherub. He said before Him, Lord of the Universe, shall an accuser become an advocate.&#x201D; I.E. notes that the Talmudic interpretation is not in keeping with the literal meaning of the Bible.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn451"><sup>71</sup> The image of a man, lion, ox and eagle</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn452"><sup>72</sup> The form of the cherubim was known to Biblical man (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn453"><sup>73</sup> Those who put forward this interpretation hold that the phrase refers to the great heat of the sun which guarded the garden (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn454"><sup>74</sup> The entrance to the garden was at the east (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn455"><sup>75</sup> This comment of I.E. is cryptic in the extreme. Our translation follows Weiser&#x2019;s interpretation. Levine puts this comment of I.E. in the context of the latter&#x2019;s philosophy. He writes that according to I.E., &#x201C;wise persons recognize that their mission is to fulfill their soul&#x2019;s will to return to the heavenly realm. Thus the will of a man controls the future of his soul. The will is not perfectly pure. Although man&#x2019;s well being is contingent upon his making the correct choices, volition (<italic>chefetz</italic>, desire) frequently acts contrary to the intellect, due to the paradox of various faculties within man struggling for control. Volition (desire) is animated by the intellectual faculty but it is opposed by lust which originates from the appetitive and sensitive dimensions (Gen. 3:24).&#x201D; Man&#x2019;s goal in life is thus to seek &#x201C;knowledge of God&#x201D; and to subdue &#x201C;all interfering passions&#x201D; (p. 14).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn456"><sup>76</sup> Man&#x2019;s intellect is his Garden of Eden (Kaputa).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn457"><sup>77</sup> The sexual organs, the source of man&#x2019;s desire, is in front of man (Weiser). Perhaps what I.E. means by &#x201C;his desire is in front of him&#x201D; is that man can control himself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn458"><sup>78</sup> They cover man&#x2019;s sexual organs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn459"><sup>79</sup> Man&#x2019;s actions are actual. They show whether man is guided by his desires or by his intellect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn460"><sup>80</sup> According to some medieval philosophers, man&#x2019;s brain is divided into four parts, each governing a different aspect of man&#x2019;s mental life, i.e., sensation, imagination, judgment and memory. According to Kaputa, I.E. held similar ideas. What he is saying is that all these functions have one source, man&#x2019;s intellect, his Garden of Eden.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn461"><sup>81</sup> Man must control his desires.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn462"><sup>82</sup> Man is to live a life guided by his intellect so that he will attain immortality.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 4</title>
<p>1. AND THE MAN. When Adam realized that he would not live forever he saw the need of perpetuating the human race. Eve concurred and therefore exclaimed, upon giving birth to a child, <italic>I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn463">1</xref></sup> Eve used the Tetragrammaton, and not the term <italic>Elohim</italic>, because the Lord&#x2019;s spirit now rested upon the earth via the human race even as it does on the heavenly bodies.<sup><xref rid="fn464">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The term good<sup><xref rid="fn465">3</xref></sup> refers to creation as a whole. We thus read, <italic>And God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good</italic> (Gen. 1:31). Evil is found only in a part of creation.<sup><xref rid="fn466">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND IN PROCESS OF TIME. That Cain tilled the soil, he brought an offering to the place that he had set aside for his devotions. I disagree with those who say that he brought an offering to his father.<sup><xref rid="fn467">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is support for the notion that Cain did not bring his offering from the first of the fruits of the ground in Scripture&#x2019;s stating that <italic>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn468">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND THE LORD HAD RESPECT. <italic>Va-yisha</italic> (and he had respect) follows the paradigm of <italic>va-yichar</italic> (and he was wroth) in <italic>And Cain was very wroth</italic> (va-yichar).<sup><xref rid="fn469">7</xref></sup> <italic>Va-yisha</italic> means, and he accepted. <italic>She&#x2019;u</italic> in <italic>Look away</italic> (she&#x2019;u) <italic>from me</italic> (Is. 22:4) is close in meaning to it. They brought offerings in keeping with the secret meaning of the sacrificial ritual.<sup><xref rid="fn470">8</xref></sup> It is possible that a fire came down from heaven and consumed Abel&#x2019;s sacrifice but not Cain&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>I believe that <italic>yamim</italic> (time) (v. 3) means a full year. Scripture similarly states, <italic>for a full year</italic> (yamim) <italic>shall he have the right of redemption</italic> (Lev. 25:29). A year is called <italic>yamim</italic> (days) because it indicates that the full cycle of days, both long and short, has been completed. <italic>From year to year</italic> (mi-yamim yamimah) (Ex. 13:10) is similar. The meaning of <italic>shenatayim yamim</italic> (two full years) (Gen. 41:1) is two complete years from day to day. Had Scripture read <italic>shenatayim</italic> (two years), then it would possibly not have meant two full years from day to day.<sup><xref rid="fn471">9</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>ad chodesh yamim</italic> (but a whole month) (Num. 11:20) refers to a complete cycle of the moon. I therefore maintain that when the prophet Daniel prophesied <italic>a thousand, two hundred and ninety days</italic> (yamim) (Dan. 12:11), he meant days and not years. I say this because the days (<italic>yamim</italic>) are enumerated.<sup><xref rid="fn472">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. SHALL IT NOT. Many commentators explain <italic>se&#x2019;et</italic> (be lifted up) to mean thy sins will be forgiven.<sup><xref rid="fn473">11</xref></sup> However, it appears to me that <italic>se&#x2019;et</italic> means thy face will be lifted up. For it is previously written, <italic>and his countenance fell</italic> (v. 5). <italic>And his countenance fell</italic> indicates shame, as in <italic>how then should I hold up my face</italic> (esah panai) (II Sam. 2:22).<sup><xref rid="fn474">12</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: if you will do good, then you will lift up your face. <italic>Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face</italic> (tissa fanekha) <italic>without spot</italic> (Job 11:15) is similar.</p>
<p>SIN COUCHETH. Some say that <italic>chattat</italic> (sin) is used here in place of <italic>avon</italic> (iniquity).<sup><xref rid="fn475">13</xref></sup> There are also those who explain this clause to mean that thy iniquity (sin) will couch over thy grave at the day of judgment. They further explain the pronominal suffix of <italic>teshukato</italic> (its desire) as referring to Abel. Its meaning is, why are you wroth that I accepted Abel&#x2019;s sacrifice since he is obligated to obey thee (<italic>ve-elekha teshukato</italic>), and thou art a ruler over him?<sup><xref rid="fn476">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that the pronominal suffix of <italic>teshukato</italic> (its desire) refers to the impulse (<italic>yetzer</italic>) even though this impulse (<italic>yetzer</italic>) is not mentioned in this verse. These commentators explain <italic>sin coucheth at the door</italic> as meaning that your sin lies in wait at the door of your house and is always with you. Others interpret door (<italic>petach</italic>) as referring to the door of the mouth, as in <italic>Keep the doors</italic> (pitche) <italic>of thy mouth</italic> (Micah 7:5).<sup><xref rid="fn477">15</xref></sup> However, in my opinion the word <italic>chattat</italic> (sin) in <italic>sin coucheth at the door</italic> is in the construct, and it is the impulse of man&#x2019;s heart that &#x201C;coucheth&#x201D; with him.<sup><xref rid="fn478">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND UNTO THEE IS ITS DESIRE. If you will it, then your impulse (<italic>yetzer</italic>) will obey you.<sup><xref rid="fn479">17</xref></sup> Additionally, you have the power to rule over it.</p>
<p>8. AND CAIN SPOKE. It appears to me that Cain related to Abel the full account of the rebuke with which God had reproached him.</p>
<p>Those born on a dark day ask, how did Cain kill Abel since no swords were yet in existence? This is a foolish question. He could have choked him or killed him with a stone or a piece of wood inasmuch as there were thousands of stones and chunks of wood around.</p>
<p>[9. WHERE.] <italic>Ay</italic>(where) means the same as <italic>ayeh</italic>. The word <italic>ayfo</italic> (where) is a combination of two words.<sup><xref rid="fn480">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. CRIETH UNTO ME. <italic>Crieth unto Me</italic> is not connected to voice of (<italic>kol</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn481">19</xref></sup> Similarly in <italic>Hark, my beloved</italic> (kol dodi)&#x0021; <italic>behold, he cometh</italic>, (Cant. 2:8), <italic>he cometh</italic> is connected to <italic>my beloved</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn482">20</xref></sup> as I have pointed out in my commentary on Canticles. The meaning of our verse is: I have heard the cry of your brother&#x2019;s blood that was poured out upon the ground. However, Onkelos interprets <italic>thy brother&#x2019;s blood</italic> as referring to the potential descendants of Abel.<sup><xref rid="fn483">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND NOW CURSED ART THOU FROM THE GROUND. Cain, a tiller of the soil, suffered a loss with regard to the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn484">22</xref></sup> He sowed and planted but the earth no longer yielded fruits or harvest. Cain was forced to wander far from the dwelling place of his father, Adam, who lived close to the Garden of Eden. He was never to find rest in one place but was constantly to be on the move.</p>
<p>12. [AND A WANDERER.] Some explain <italic>nad</italic> (wanderer) to mean a mourner, as in <italic>to bemoan</italic> (la-nud) <italic>him</italic> (Job 2:11). However, my opinion is that <italic>nad</italic> is a synonym for <italic>na</italic> (fugitive). <italic>Nedod</italic> (wander) in <italic>Lo, then would I wander</italic> (nedod) <italic>far off</italic> (Ps. 55:8) is analogous.</p>
<p>13. [MY PUNISHMENT<sup><xref rid="fn485">23</xref></sup> IS GREATER THAN I CAN BEAR.] All the commentaries explain this to mean that Cain confessed his sin. They say that the meaning of <italic>neso</italic> (bear) is forgiveness, as in <italic>forgiving iniquity</italic> (noseh avon) (Ex. 34:7).<sup><xref rid="fn486">24</xref></sup> However, I disagree. In Hebrew reward is called <italic>ekev</italic> (heel), and the harsh punishment which comes as a result of iniquity is occasionally referred to as &#x201C;sin.&#x201D; Similarly we find, <italic>for the iniquity</italic> (avon) <italic>of the Amorite is not yet full</italic><sup><xref rid="fn487">25</xref></sup> (Gen. 15:16); <italic>there shall no punishment</italic> (avon) <italic>happen to thee</italic> (I Sam. 28:10); <italic>For the iniquity</italic> (avon) <italic>of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom</italic> (Lamentations 4:6).<sup><xref rid="fn488">26</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse thus is: my punishment (<italic>avon</italic>) is greater than I can bear (<italic>mi-neso</italic>). The next verse substantiates this interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn489">27</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Patzetah</italic> (v.11) is to be rendered opened. <italic>Yiftzeh</italic> (doth open) in <italic>But Job doth open</italic> (yiftzeh) <italic>his mouth in vanity</italic> (Job 35:16) is similar.</p>
<p>14. [AND FROM THY FACE SHALL I BE HID.] All the world is full of God&#x2019;s glory. Nevertheless, there are places more receptive to God&#x2019;s power, and His might is seen there.</p>
<p>15. SEVENFOLD. Until seven generations, for <italic>shivatayim</italic> (sevenfold) does not mean fourteen,<sup><xref rid="fn490">28</xref></sup> nor does it mean three hundred and forty-three.<sup><xref rid="fn491">29</xref></sup> Proof that <italic>shivatayim</italic> means sevenfold is that the prophet states, <italic>And the light of the sun shall be sevenfold</italic> (shivatayim) and then explains his words, viz., <italic>as the light of the seven days</italic> (Is. 30:26).<sup><xref rid="fn492">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>[VENGEANCE SHALL BE TAKEN ON HIM.] The meaning of <italic>yukkam</italic> (vengeance shall be taken on him) is that vengeance shall be exacted from him. <italic>He shall not be punished</italic> (yukkam) (Ex. 21:21) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn493">31</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is that God held back his anger and waited seven generations before punishing Cain.<sup><xref rid="fn494">32</xref></sup> Don&#x2019;t ask, how could Cain&#x2019;s life span extend for seven generations? Behold, his brother Seth lived many years with Noah.<sup><xref rid="fn495">33</xref></sup> It is also possible that Cain&#x2019;s descendants are called Cain after their patriarch in the same way that Jews are called Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn496">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that the sign the Lord set for Cain was a horn. Others say God removed fear from Cain&#x2019;s heart and gave him courage to face the world. It appears to me that God gave Cain a sign that no harm would befall him.<sup><xref rid="fn497">35</xref></sup> Cain finally believed God because of the sign.<sup><xref rid="fn498">36</xref></sup> Scripture, however, does not tell us what the sign was.</p>
<p>16. IN THE LAND OF NOD. The land of Nod is so called because it was in that land that Cain was a wanderer and a fugitive.<sup><xref rid="fn499">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>ON THE EAST SIDE OF EDEN. East of Eden and north of the garden.<sup><xref rid="fn500">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>[17. ENOCH.] The city was called after Enoch, the son of Cain. Similarly the city of Samaria was called after Shemer (I Kings 16:24) and Egypt (<italic>mitzraim</italic>) was named for Mitzraim, son of Ham.<sup><xref rid="fn501">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lamech was the seventh generation from Adam and the sixth from Cain.<sup><xref rid="fn502">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>[19. ADAH AND&#x2026;ZILLAH.] Do not pay attention to Saadiah Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation of Biblical names. Even if we knew Hebrew perfectly, how would we be able to ascertain the events which they commemorate? If the Bible did not state why Moses was named Moses, or Issaschar, Issaschar, would we be able to surmise the meaning of these names?<sup><xref rid="fn503">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>[20. THE FATHER OF SUCH AS DWELL IN TENTS.] The meaning of <italic>avi</italic> (father of) is first. The same is true of the word <italic>av</italic> (father)<sup><xref rid="fn504">42</xref></sup> and the word (<italic>aviv</italic>) (spring).<sup><xref rid="fn505">43</xref></sup> When the word for father is in the construct it always has a <italic>yod</italic> suffixed to it. The same is true with the word for brother.<sup><xref rid="fn506">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. THE HARP AND PIPE. Harp and pipe (<italic>kinnor ve-ugav</italic>) are types of musical instruments. The ability to play these instruments requires great wisdom.<sup><xref rid="fn507">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. THE FORGER. <italic>Lotesh</italic> (the forger) means the sharpener. <italic>Li-litosh</italic> in <italic>to sharpen</italic> (li-litosh) <italic>every man his plowshare</italic> (I Sam. 13:20) is similar.</p>
<p>[23. AND LAMECH SAID&#x2026;] Note, this <sup><xref rid="fn508">46</xref></sup> should have appeared earlier. I have already noted two similar examples of this in my earlier comments.<sup><xref rid="fn509">47</xref></sup> Three additional examples are: <italic>that the man took a golden ring</italic> (Gen. 24:22);<sup><xref rid="fn510">48</xref></sup> <italic>And the Lord said unto Moses, say unto the children of Israel: Ye are a stiff-necked people</italic> (Ex. 33:5);<sup><xref rid="fn511">49</xref></sup> and <italic>And I besought the Lord at that time</italic> (Deut. 3:23).<sup><xref rid="fn512">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>As to our verse, it is to be interpreted as our sages did. The rabbis tell us that Adah and Zillah were afraid to bear children because they feared that their offspring, who were the seventh generation from Cain, would die or be killed as punishment for Cain&#x2019;s sin. Therefore Lamech said to them, &#x201C;I am in truth the seventh generation<sup><xref rid="fn513">51</xref></sup> and if a man would wound me or a child bruise me, then I would kill them.&#x201D; <italic>I have slain</italic> is used in place of <italic>I will slay</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn514">52</xref></sup> Similar examples are: <italic>I will give</italic> (natati)<sup><xref rid="fn515">53</xref></sup> <italic>the price of the field</italic> (Gen. 23:13), and <italic>which I took out</italic><sup><xref rid="fn516">54</xref></sup> <italic>of the hand of the Amorite</italic> (Gen. 48:22). There are many similar instances.<sup><xref rid="fn517">55</xref></sup> Lamech said to his wives, <italic>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold</italic> because Cain deliberately murdered and he, Lamech, did not.<sup><xref rid="fn518">56</xref></sup> In other words, Lamech told his wives that the decree upon Cain was annulled. However, the fact of the matter is that Lamech&#x2019;s children and all his seed perished in the deluge. Thus Cain&#x2019;s name was wiped out because he murdered his brother.</p>
<p>[25. INSTEAD OF ABEL.] That is, in place of Abel.</p>
<p>[26. BEGAN TO CALL.] <italic>Huchal</italic> (began) belongs to those verbs whose second and third root letters are identical.<sup><xref rid="fn519">57</xref></sup> If the <italic>chet</italic> were not a guttural, it would receive a <italic>dagesh</italic>. <italic>Huchal</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>techil&#x2019;ah</italic> (first). The meaning of the clause <italic>then began</italic> (huchal) <italic>men to call upon the name of the Lord</italic> is: then men first started praying. If <italic>huchal</italic> were derived from <italic>chillul</italic> (profane),<sup><xref rid="fn520">58</xref></sup> then <italic>the name of the Lord</italic> would follow profane.<sup><xref rid="fn521">59</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn463"><sup>1</sup> God wanted the human race to go on. By producing a child Eve was doing God&#x2019;s will, hence her remark (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn464"><sup>2</sup> Man is the only being on earth upon whom the Tetragrammaton rests. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 1:26 and 2:12. The continuity of the human species insured that God&#x2019;s spirit would rest upon the earth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn465"><sup>3</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s comment &#x201C;the term good&#x201D; is difficult. According to Krinsky, I.E. refers to Gen. 3:22, &#x201C;To know good and evil.&#x201D; Meijler emends <italic>millat</italic> (term or word) to <italic>milleh</italic> (filled). This would give: God filled the whole with good.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn466"><sup>4</sup> According to Netter, Krinsky, Cherez and Weiser, I.E.&#x2019;s point is to tell us that good refers only to the species; i.e., the species is eternal; however, the individual must die. Cf. Maimonides, <italic>Guide for the Perplexed</italic>, Part III, Chap. 10, and I.E.&#x2019;s introduction to Ecclesiastes. In the latter I.E. maintains that the little evil found in the world is overshadowed by the preponderance of good in creation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn467"><sup>5</sup> Adam had the status of a high priest, and bringing him a gift was equivalent to bringing an offering to God (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn468"><sup>6</sup> Scripture does not mention the same with regard to Cain. Cf. Rashi&#x2019;s comment on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn469"><sup>7</sup> They are both shortened forms of the verb. The final <italic>heh</italic> of the root is dropped and the first root letter is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> because it precedes a root letter (Filwarg). See notes to 3:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn470"><sup>8</sup> Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Lev. 1:1. Weiser explains that I.E. believed that sacrifices were offered to gain some benefit. Cf. I.E. on Ex. 12:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn471"><sup>9</sup> It could have meant close to two years, two years being a round number.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn472"><sup>10</sup> When the word <italic>yamim</italic> stands by itself, it means a complete year (all the days). When numbers are given it refers to days. Otherwise one could not know whether <italic>sheloshah yamim</italic> means three years or three days (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn473"><sup>11</sup> <italic>Se&#x2019;et</italic> means forgiveness as in <italic>noseh avon</italic> (forgiving iniquity) (Ex. 34:7). Cf. Onkelos and Kimchi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn474"><sup>12</sup> Which shows that one who is ashamed cannot hold his face up.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn475"><sup>13</sup> Scripture writes, <italic>Sin coucheth</italic> (chattat rovetz). The problem is that sin is a feminine noun and <italic>rovetz</italic> is a masculine verb. The phrase should read <italic>chattat rovetzet</italic>, hence the comment that <italic>chattat</italic> has been substituted for <italic>avon</italic>. They mean the same thing (Krinsky). The printed texts have <italic>chet</italic>. However, the Bible has <italic>chattat, Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 has <italic>chattat</italic>, and we have followed suit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn476"><sup>14</sup> I.E. explains <italic>teshukah</italic> as meaning obedience. See his comment on Gen. 3:16. Cain was a &#x201C;ruler&#x201D; over Abel because he was the older brother. One cannot explain <italic>and unto thee is its desire</italic> as referring to iniquity since iniquity is not a person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn477"><sup>15</sup> Man can sin even with his mouth (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn478"><sup>16</sup> <italic>Chattat</italic> is in the construct with <italic>yetzer</italic> (impulse). However, the word <italic>yetzer</italic> is not in the text and has to be supplied by the reader. In other words, <italic>chattat</italic> is short for <italic>chattat ha-yetzer</italic>. This eliminates the problem of a feminine noun (<italic>chattat</italic>) having a masculine verb (<italic>rovetz</italic>). The clause should thus be understood: the sin of the impulse of your heart coucheth at the door; that is, it is always with you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn479"><sup>17</sup> I.E. explains <italic>teshukah</italic> (desire) as obedience (see note 14). Hence <italic>its desire</italic> means its obedience, the &#x201C;it&#x201D; referring to <italic>yetzer</italic> (impulse).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn480"><sup>18</sup> Where (<italic>ayeh</italic>) and here (<italic>poh</italic>), i.e., in what place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn481"><sup>19</sup> It is connected to <italic>thy brother&#x2019;s blood</italic>. <italic>Kol</italic> (voice) is singular, <italic>tzo&#x2019;akim</italic> (crieth out) is a plural; thus <italic>tzo&#x2019;akim</italic> cannot refer to <italic>kol</italic>. It is thus connected to <italic>blood of</italic>, which is a plural (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn482"><sup>20</sup> Rather than to voice of (<italic>kol</italic>). <italic>Cometh</italic> is connected to <italic>my beloved</italic> because it is the beloved who leaps and skips, not the voice; the voice neither leaps nor skips (Krinsky). <italic>Hinneh zeh ba</italic> can be translated as, behold, he cometh, or behold it cometh.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn483"><sup>21</sup> Hence the plural <italic>deme</italic> (blood of). Cf. Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn484"><sup>22</sup> I.E. interprets curse to mean a diminution of the good. See his comment on 3:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn485"><sup>23</sup> Literally, <italic>avoni</italic> (my sin).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn486"><sup>24</sup> These commentators translate <italic>avon</italic> literally and render our clause as: my iniquity (<italic>avon</italic>) is beyond (<italic>gadol</italic>) forgiveness (<italic>mi-neso</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn487"><sup>25</sup> The time of their punishment has not arrived.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn488"><sup>26</sup> According to I.E. <italic>avon</italic> (iniquity) should be rendered punishment. The verse thus means: the punishment of my people is severer than the punishment of Sodom (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn489"><sup>27</sup> Cain in verse 14 complains of his unfortunate plight. This shows that verse 13 is to be similarly interpreted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn490"><sup>28</sup> Some render <italic>shivatayim</italic> as seven multiplied by two. They consider it a dual form like <italic>shenatayim</italic>, (two years) which is <italic>shanah</italic> (a year) multiplied by two.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn491"><sup>29</sup> Some render <italic>shivatayim</italic> as seven multiplied by seven, multiplied by seven.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn492"><sup>30</sup> Thus <italic>shivatayim</italic> means seven days or seven times as much.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn493"><sup>31</sup> Literally, vengeance shall not be taken on him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn494"><sup>32</sup> The verse is to be understood as follows: Cain shall be punished after seven generations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn495"><sup>33</sup> Noah was the tenth generation from Adam. Thus Seth lived for more than seven generations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn496"><sup>34</sup> The meaning of the verse being: Cain&#x2019;s descendants would bear his guilt.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn508"><sup>46</sup> Verses 23 and 24. The reason is that I.E. understands verses 23 and 24 to be an attempt by Lamech to induce his wives to cohabit with him. However, verses 20 through 22 tell us that they in fact did so. Hence verses 23 and 24 must describe what happened before verses 20-22. Its meaning is that Lamech had already said to Adah and Zillah. <italic>Va-yomer</italic> is thus a pluperfect (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn509"><sup>47</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 1:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn510"><sup>48</sup> This is followed by: <italic>and said: Whose daughter art thou</italic> (Gen. 24:23).

<ftnote id="fn511"><sup>49</sup> This is preceded by: <italic>And when the people heard these evil tidings</italic> (v. 4). However, the evil tidings are reported in verse 5. Thus verse 5 should precede verse 4. Hence the meaning of <italic>And when the people heard</italic> (v. 4) is: and when the people had heard; i.e., when they heard the following, namely what is reported in the next verse (Meijler).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn512"><sup>50</sup> Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Deut. 3:23. What is reported in this verse took place before Deut. 3:21, viz., <italic>And I commanded Joshua</italic>, etc. Moses besought God before he commanded Joshua not to fear the kings of Canaan. Hence Deut. 3:23 is to be rendered as <italic>And I had besought the Lord</italic>. Ibid. I. E.&#x2019;s commentary.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 5</title>
<p>1. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM. The children and grandchildren that he begot.<sup><xref rid="fn522">1</xref></sup> Adam and only Adam had no human parents, for he was created by God in the likeness of God.<sup><xref rid="fn523">2</xref></sup> Scripture notes that Adam <italic>begat a son in his own likeness, after his image</italic> (v. 3)<sup><xref rid="fn524">3</xref></sup> to teach us that God implanted in Adam the power to reproduce his God like image so that his work would be like that of God.<sup><xref rid="fn525">4</xref></sup> Scripture does not say the same with regard to Cain and Abel, nor does it state how long Cain lived or how old Cain was when he begot his son Enoch. It omits the above clause because the former was murdered and the latter&#x2019;s descendants perished in the deluge.<sup><xref rid="fn526">5</xref></sup> The Torah tells the story of the murderer Cain to stress God&#x2019;s righteousness. God was long-suffering with Cain but he ultimately punished him. This is in keeping with <italic>and that (God) will by no means clear the guilty</italic> (Ex. 34:7).</p>
<p>22. ENOCH. Son of Jared. Scripture says about Enoch, <italic>And Enoch walked with God</italic>. The meaning of this is the same as the meaning of <italic>After the Lord your God shall ye walk</italic> (Deut. 13:5).<sup><xref rid="fn527">6</xref></sup> The same thing is stated concerning Noah, namely, <italic>Noah walked with God</italic> (Gen. 6:9). Others say that <italic>Noah walked with God</italic> means he trained himself to walk with God.<sup><xref rid="fn528">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND HE WAS NOT; FOR GOD TOOK HIM. That is, he died. So, too, <italic>take, I beseech Thee, my life from me</italic> (Jonah 4:3). Scripture similarly states, <italic>I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes</italic> (Ezek. 24:16) and then explains its meaning, namely, his wife died (Ezek. 24:18).</p>
<p>The Bible does not state with regard to Enoch&#x2019;s being taken that Enoch died, nor is there any reference to a plague causing his death. The meaning of <italic>took him</italic> in our verse is similar to <italic>take me</italic> in the psalm of Asaph, <italic>And afterward take me with glory</italic> (Ps. 73:24), and <italic>He shall take me</italic>, in the psalm of the sons of Korach, <italic>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the netherworld; For He shall take me</italic> (Ps. 49:16). The intelligent will understand this.<sup><xref rid="fn529">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. [THIS SAME SHALL COMFORT US.] Lamech was informed by Adam, who was a prophet, that through his newborn child the land would live. Or perhaps they learned the aforementioned through astrology. And so it was, for it was through Noah that the world was preserved. Furthermore, Noah was, as the Bible explicitly states, an expert in agriculture (Gen. 9:20).<sup><xref rid="fn530">9</xref></sup> It is also possible that he got this name after<sup><xref rid="fn531">10</xref></sup> his agricultural successes. We find the same with Jerubbaal.<sup><xref rid="fn532">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Noah (rest) is the opposite of toil (<italic>etzavon</italic>). The meaning of our verse is, this one will comfort us and we will rest (<italic>nanu&#x2019;ach</italic>) from the toil of our hands. Moreover, comfort is a relaxation of the heart&#x2019;s pain.<sup><xref rid="fn533">12</xref></sup> The Hebrews are more concerned with the idea expressed by a word than with its etymology. Proof of the above is the fact that Jerubbaal is referred to as Jerubbesheth.<sup><xref rid="fn534">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Those who ask whom Cain and Seth married raise a worthless question. Scripture tells us that Adam begot sons and daughters. The same is true of all of them.<sup><xref rid="fn535">14</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn522"><sup>1</sup> <italic>Toledot</italic> (generations) comes from the root <italic>yod, lamed, dalet</italic>. In the <italic>hifil</italic> it means to give birth to.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn523"><sup>2</sup> I.E. explains that <italic>in the likeness of God made He him</italic> (Adam) indicates that in contrast to his descendants Adam had no human parents but was created directly by God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn524"><sup>3</sup> All living creatures produce offspring that resemble them. Therefore, why mention that Adam produced offspring resembling him?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn525"><sup>4</sup> The image and likeness spoken of in the verse refer not to man&#x2019;s physical image but to his God-like image. The Bible notes that Adam, like God, was able to produce children in the image of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn526"><sup>5</sup> The lines of both Cain and Abel were wiped out. But the Bible notes these things with regard to Seth because Noah was descended from him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn527"><sup>6</sup> Live righteously. Similarly Enoch lived righteously.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn528"><sup>7</sup> Walked (<italic>hithal&#x2019;ekh</italic>) is in the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic>. The latter is a reflexive; thus <italic>hithal&#x2019;ekh</italic> means he made himself walk; i.e., he trained himself to walk. These commentaries say the same with regard to Enoch (I.E.&#x2019;s fragmentary commentary on Genesis).</ftnote>

<p>TO MULTIPLY. <italic>La-rov</italic> (to multiply) is an infinitive.</p>
<p>2. THE SONS OF GOD. The term <italic>bene Elohim</italic> (the sons of god) refers to the sons of the judges who dispensed God&#x2019;s (<italic>Elohim</italic>) justice.<sup><xref rid="fn536">1</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>Elohim</italic> refers to God Himself and the sons of God are holy ones (saints) living on earth. They are called <italic>sons of God</italic> in the sense of <italic>Ye are the children of the Lord your God</italic> (Deut. 14:1). Others say that <italic>the sons of God</italic> refers to the children of Seth<sup><xref rid="fn537">2</xref></sup> and that <italic>the daughters of man</italic> refers to women of Cain&#x2019;s family.<sup><xref rid="fn538">3</xref></sup> However, it appears to me that <italic>the sons of God</italic> refers to those who know the will of the most High. These men chose women who matched them astrologically and physically. Hence they produced mighty men. It is possible that they took women even against their will.<sup><xref rid="fn539">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. MY SPIRIT SHALL NOT ABIDE. Some say that <italic>yadon</italic> (shall abide) is like the word <italic>nedanah</italic> (sheath thereof), as in <italic>and he put up his sword back into the sheath thereof</italic> (nedanah) (I Chron. 21:27), for the body serves as a sheath for the spirit.<sup><xref rid="fn540">5</xref></sup> Proof of this is found in <italic>my spirit was pained in the midst of my body</italic> (nidneh) (Dan. 7:15). Nevertheless, <italic>nadan</italic> and <italic>yadon</italic> come from different roots.<sup><xref rid="fn541">6</xref></sup> We find the same with the words <italic>nasah</italic> (lifted) and <italic>si&#x2019;o</italic> (his excellency). We read, <italic>Though his excellency</italic> (si&#x2019;o) <italic>mount up to the heavens</italic> (Job 20:6). The root of <italic>si&#x2019;o</italic> is <italic>sin, vav, alef</italic>. Nevertheless, a word derived from <italic>nasah</italic> (lifted) (whose root is <italic>nun, sin, alef</italic>) would have a similar meaning. There are many examples of this.</p>
<p>Others say that <italic>yadon</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>ve-yashov</italic> (returneth), as in <italic>And the dust returneth</italic> (ve-yashov) <italic>to the earth as it was</italic> (Eccles. 12:7).<sup><xref rid="fn542">7</xref></sup> They say that <italic>yadon</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>din</italic> (to judge) because the spirit judges the body.<sup><xref rid="fn543">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR THAT HE IS ALSO. In the word <italic>be-shaggam</italic> (for that also) the <italic>shin</italic> placed before <italic>gam</italic> (also) has the same meaning as the <italic>shin</italic> placed before <italic>kakhah</italic> (thus).<sup><xref rid="fn544">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The term <italic>My spirit refers to God&#x2019;s spirit, for man&#x2019;s spirit comes from God</italic>. Similarly, <italic>And the spirit returneth unto God who gave it</italic> (Eccles. 12:7). The spirit spoken of by Ecclesiastes refers only to the spirit in man. The meaning of the verse is: My spirit shall not abide in man because of his violent ways and because he is (<italic>be-shaggem</italic>) made of flesh, grows until he achieves maturity, and then due to his sexual activity begins his decline.<sup><xref rid="fn545">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEREFORE SHALL HIS DAYS BE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS. Some explain that this refers to man&#x2019;s life span.<sup><xref rid="fn546">11</xref></sup> If we find some living longer than this,<sup><xref rid="fn547">12</xref></sup> they are but a few. Our verse speaks of most people. However, this interpretation is not correct. Behold, Shem lived for six hundred years. Also, the generations that followed him lived many, many years beyond a hundred and twenty. It was only in the days of Peleg (Gen. 10:25) that the life span was shortened. From the days of King David onward it has been limited to seventy or eighty years. The correct meaning of <italic>therefore shall his days be a hundred and twenty years</italic> is as Onkelos explained, namely, that God set a time for mankind to repent. We see the same idea in <italic>Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown</italic> (Jonah 3:4). God gave them one hundred and twenty years in which to repent and save themselves, or to remain unrepentant and perish.</p>
<p>Scripture&#x2019;s statement, <italic>And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begot Shem, Ham and Japheth</italic> (Gen. 5:32), should not disturb you,<sup><xref rid="fn548">13</xref></sup> because the Bible is not in chronological sequence.<sup><xref rid="fn549">14</xref></sup> Note, the Torah states, <italic>and Terah died in Haran</italic> (Gen. 11:32), then goes on to say, <italic>Now the Lord said unto Abram: Get thee out of thy country</italic> (Gen. 12:1). However, we know that Terah did not die until Isaac was thirty-five years old.<sup><xref rid="fn550">15</xref></sup> There are many other similar instances in Scripture.</p>
<p>4. [THE NEPHILIM.] They were so named because anyone who saw them lost heart at their huge stature.<sup><xref rid="fn551">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AFTER THAT.] After the flood. Behold, the sons of Anak (Num. 13:33) were originally from the family of <italic>the sons of God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn552">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND IT REPENTED THE LORD. The Torah spoke in the language of men,<sup><xref rid="fn553">18</xref></sup> for we know that God is not a man that he should repent. This term is used because if a human being acted in the way God did, destroying his creation, it would be said of him that he repented.<sup><xref rid="fn554">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND IT GRIEVED HIM AT HIS HEART.] This verse is the opposite of <italic>Let the Lord rejoice in His works</italic> (Ps. 104:31). God is said to be happy when his creatures benefit from his acts of kindness.<sup><xref rid="fn555">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that <italic>va-yinnachem</italic> (and it repented) should be rendered as set a time,<sup><xref rid="fn556">21</xref></sup> as in <italic>doth comfort</italic> (mitnachem) <italic>himself, purposing to kill thee</italic> (Gen. 27:42).<sup><xref rid="fn557">22</xref></sup> They also say that <italic>His heart</italic> does not refer to the heart of God but to the heart of the prophet.<sup><xref rid="fn558">23</xref></sup> However, if this were the case Scripture should not have read: and it grieved &#x201C;at&#x201D; (<italic>el</italic>) His heart.<sup><xref rid="fn559">24</xref></sup> Secondly, where do we find a prophet called a heart?</p>
<p>7. AND THE LORD SAID. In His heart, or to the angels; others say, to Noah. However, it appears to me that <italic>And the Lord said</italic> is connected to <italic>His heart</italic> of the previous verse.<sup><xref rid="fn560">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. GRACE. <italic>Chen</italic> (grace) means mercy. From it we get the word <italic>techinnah</italic> (supplication).<sup><xref rid="fn561">26</xref></sup> <italic>Chen</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>ketz</italic> (end); both have roots whose second and third letters are the same.<sup><xref rid="fn562">27</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>found grace (mercy or pity) in the eyes of the Lord</italic> is like <italic>No eye pitied thee</italic> (Ezek. 16:5).<sup><xref rid="fn563">28</xref></sup></p>
<h1>NOAH</h1>
<p>9. THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS. <italic>Toledot</italic> (generations) means the events that transpired during his lifetime, as in <italic>what a day may bring forth</italic> (yeled) (Prov. 27:1). <italic>These are the generations of Jacob</italic> (Gen. 37:2) is similar.</p>
<p>A MAN RIGHTEOUS. In his deeds.</p>
<p>AND WHOLE-HEARTED. In his heart. <italic>Tamim</italic> (wholehearted) is an adjective. It belongs to those roots whose second and third letters are the same. All three letters of the root remain in this word.<sup><xref rid="fn564">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IN HIS GENERATIONS.] At the time of the flood, and in the generations after the flood. For Noah lived till the fifty-eighth year of Abraham.<sup><xref rid="fn565">30</xref></sup> Let this be a mnemonic device, our father Abraham was the age of Noah (58)<sup><xref rid="fn566">31</xref></sup> when Noah died.</p>
<p>11. AND THE EARTH WAS CORRUPT. The people of the earth were corrupt. Similarly, <italic>when a land sinneth against Me</italic> (Ezek. 14:13), and <italic>And all countries came into Egypt</italic> (Gen. 41:57).</p>
<p>[BEFORE GOD.] Some say this means they sinned in public. Others say it means people were privately corrupt with regard to secret affairs so that only God was aware of their sins. In my opinion, the Torah speaks the language of men so that people will understand what is being said. The meaning of <italic>before God</italic> is that they acted like a servant, who in the presence of his master, disobeys him and thereby shows that he does not fear him.</p>
<p>Those who say that <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) does not refer to the Almighty are speaking nonsense.<sup><xref rid="fn567">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>VIOLENCE. Theft, oppression and taking women against their will. Our sages are correct in interpreting <italic>for all flesh had corrupted their way</italic> to mean that all flesh engaged in unnatural and perverted sexual acts. Indeed, how precious is their interpretation to the effect that they corrupted with water<sup><xref rid="fn568">33</xref></sup> and were punished by God with water. Just as they placed their waters above and below,<sup><xref rid="fn569">34</xref></sup> so God punished them by a flood whose waters came from above and below.</p>
<p>13. AND GOD SAID UNTO NOAH: THE END OF ALL FLESH. All bodies.</p>
<p>[IS COME BEFORE ME.] The time of their calamity has arrived.</p>
<p>WITH THE EARTH. <italic>Et ha&#x2019;aretz</italic> (with the earth) means from the earth. Similarly, <italic>As soon as I am gone out of the city</italic> (et ha&#x2019;ir) (Ex. 9:29). It may also be rendered, with the earth, as in <italic>with Jacob</italic> (et Yaakov) <italic>every man came with his household</italic> (Ex. 1:1).<sup><xref rid="fn570">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that <italic>mashchitam</italic> (I will destroy them) stands for two words. Similarly, the word <italic>God</italic> in <italic>O God of hosts</italic> (Ps. 80:8) and <italic>thy throne</italic> in <italic>thy throne God</italic> (Ps. 45:7).<sup><xref rid="fn571">36</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: And, behold, I will destroy them and destroy the earth.</p>
<p>14. GOPHER. Gopher is the name of a wood that rides lightly upon the water. It is mentioned nowhere else in Scripture.</p>
<p>ROOMS. So that each animal, cattle and fowl would be alone with its mate.</p>
<p>[ARK.] The Bible uses the term ark and not ship, for it did not have the shape of a ship nor did it have oars.</p>
<p>AND SHALT PITCH IT. Some say that <italic>ve-khafarta</italic> (and shalt pitch) comes from the same root as <italic>kapporet</italic> (cover) (Ex. 25:17), the meaning of <italic>and shalt pitch it</italic> being you shall cover it by coating it.</p>
<p>[PITCH.] Some say that <italic>kofer</italic> is a pitch-like substance. Others say that a certain clay with pitch-like qualities is found in the ground and is to be identified with the <italic>kofer</italic> in our verse. Others identify it with a substance similarly called in Arabic while noting that in Arabic it is spelled with a <italic>kof</italic> rather than a <italic>caf</italic>. In reality, <italic>ve-khafarta</italic> (and shalt pitch) is a denominative of <italic>kofer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn572">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITHIN. On the inside.</p>
<p>15. AND THIS IS HOW THOU SHALT MAKE IT. These are the dimensions which you shall make it. Its height was a tenth of its length, so that it would be able to float on the water and not be overturned by the wind.</p>
<p>16. A LIGHT. <italic>Tzohar</italic> (a light) means an opening through which light would enter. It comes from the same root as <italic>tzohorayim</italic> (noon).<sup><xref rid="fn573">38</xref></sup> The opening was made in the usual place, on top of the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn574">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture tells us that the top of the ark was a cubit in length.<sup><xref rid="fn575">40</xref></sup> We gather from this that it was a sixth of a cubit wide.<sup><xref rid="fn576">41</xref></sup> The ark was triangular in shape.<sup><xref rid="fn577">42</xref></sup> Its top came to a point, and so did its corners. Therefore it did not overturn. The door was on one side<sup><xref rid="fn578">43</xref></sup> and was reached by climbing a ladder.<sup><xref rid="fn579">44</xref></sup> Now, we know that the ark was very large.<sup><xref rid="fn580">45</xref></sup> Furthermore, it is possible that Noah was much taller than we, for the cubits mentioned with regard to the ark are Noah&#x2019;s cubits.<sup><xref rid="fn581">46</xref></sup> It is also possible, since the ark was divided into three stories, that the bottom story was ten cubits high.<sup><xref rid="fn582">47</xref></sup> Some say that the ark had many stories and that Scripture abridged the number.</p>
<p>LOWER, SECOND AND THIRD. These are all adjectives. Those who ask why <italic>shelishim</italic> (third) is not written <italic>selishiyyim</italic> have eyes but do not see.<sup><xref rid="fn583">48</xref></sup> Can&#x2019;t they see that forgiving, archer and thief are adjectives,<sup><xref rid="fn584">49</xref></sup> as are prince, deputy, pious,<sup><xref rid="fn585">50</xref></sup> wise<sup><xref rid="fn586">51</xref></sup> and understanding?<sup><xref rid="fn587">52</xref></sup> Nevertheless, each of these words is vocalized according to its own pattern and form. <italic>Shelishim</italic> (third) follows the paradigm of <italic>negidim</italic> (princes) and <italic>chasidim</italic> (pious). This is so because the singular of <italic>shelishim</italic> is <italic>shalish</italic>, as the singular of <italic>chasidim</italic> is <italic>chasid</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn588">53</xref></sup> It is also possible that the <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>sheniyyim</italic> (second) also<sup><xref rid="fn589">54</xref></sup> applies to the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>shelishim</italic> (third).<sup><xref rid="fn590">55</xref></sup> Perhaps this will satisfy those who raised the question.</p>
<p>17. AND I. Some say that the <italic>dagesh</italic> in <italic>mabbul</italic> (flood) is in place of a missing <italic>nun</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn591">56</xref></sup> as in the word <italic>mabbua</italic> (fountain).<sup><xref rid="fn592">57</xref></sup> They note that the word <italic>mabbul</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>navelah</italic> (fadeth)<sup><xref rid="fn593">58</xref></sup> in <italic>The earth fainteth and fadeth</italic> (navelah) <italic>away</italic> (Is. 24:4).</p>
<p>Others say that <italic>mabbul</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>balul</italic> (mingled) in <italic>mingled</italic> (belulah) <italic>with oil</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn594">59</xref></sup> and that it should have followed the paradigm of <italic>maslul</italic> (highway) (Is. 35:8).<sup><xref rid="fn595">60</xref></sup> The word <italic>massor</italic> (saw) (Is. 10:15)<sup><xref rid="fn596">61</xref></sup> with a <italic>shuruk</italic> and a <italic>cholam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn597">62</xref></sup> interchanging is analogous.</p>
<p>[THE FLOOD OF WATERS.] This is an abridged phrase. It should be read as follows: The flood, a flood of waters.<sup><xref rid="fn598">63</xref></sup> Similarly the meaning of <italic>since the day it was founded</italic> (Ex. 9:18) is: since the day, the day it was founded.<sup><xref rid="fn599">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. BUT I WILL ESTABLISH MY COVENANT. This indicates, although not previously mentioned, that God had sworn earlier to Noah that he and his children would not die in the flood.<sup><xref rid="fn600">65</xref></sup> We find a similar instance in Deuteronomy, viz., <italic>Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us</italic> (Deut. 1:22).<sup><xref rid="fn601">66</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>But I will establish</italic> means I will keep my oath. However, it appears to me that the covenant alludes to the covenant that would be made at the time God set the rainbow in the sky.<sup><xref rid="fn602">67</xref></sup> Covenant means an agreement and a thing which two sides choose. It comes from the same root as <italic>beru</italic> (choose) in <italic>choose</italic> (beru) <italic>you a man for you</italic> (I Sam. 17:8).<sup><xref rid="fn603">68</xref></sup> The word for covenant (<italic>brit</italic>) has this form and vocalization both in the absolute and in the construct. We find the same thing with the word <italic>shevit</italic> (captivity). We thus read, <italic>Thou hast turned the captivity of Jacob</italic> (shevit Yaakov) (Ps. 85:2), and <italic>And his daughters into captivity</italic> (ba-shevit) (Num. 21:29).</p>
<p>Others say that a <italic>brit</italic> (covenant) is a cut boundary.<sup><xref rid="fn604">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>[19. TWO OF EVERY SORT.] After stating two, Scripture goes on to explain that this refers to male and female.<sup><xref rid="fn605">70</xref></sup> After stating generally, <italic>And of every living thing of all flesh</italic>, the Bible then explains that this refers to <italic>Of the fowl after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind</italic> (v. 20). This includes<sup><xref rid="fn606">71</xref></sup> all animals of the field and all large and small animals that are born via sexual intercourse. It excludes living things not born<sup><xref rid="fn607">72</xref></sup> by coupling, and marine animals. Fish are excluded although they are considered &#x201C;flesh.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn608">73</xref></sup> Proof of this can be seen in the words of Moses: <italic>and yet Thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. If flocks and herds be slain for them&#x2026;or if all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, will they suffice them</italic> (Num. 11:21,22).</p>
<p>[SHALT THOU BRING INTO THE ARK.] This is a command to Noah not to desert these creatures but to bring them into the ark with him in order to preserve the seed of each species.</p>
<p>[20. SHALL COME UNTO THEE.] They will come by themselves. Noah therefore did not have to search for them on islands; neither did he have to hunt for all sorts of fowl.</p>
<p>God commanded Noah to prepare food for all the animals in the ark. Foolish ones ask, what did birds of prey eat? What did carnivorous animals such as lions who live on meat eat? Their questions are invalid. One who cannot find meat will eat grass or fruit when hungry. The saying found in Rabbinic literature that there exists a large animal that consumes the grazing of one thousand mountains daily is a good story.<sup><xref rid="fn609">74</xref></sup> Similarly the tradition concerning a bird that blocks out the sun with its wings has a secret meaning to it and is not to be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn610">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>God commanded Noah to make the ark many years before the flood. When the flood approached, God the glorious commanded Noah and his family to go to the ark. God the glorious commanded Noah to take seven males and seven females from every clean animal and fowl because they were needed for sacrifices.</p>

<ftnote id="fn543"><sup>8</sup> Man&#x2019;s spirit (<italic>ru&#x2019;ach</italic>) ultimately determines how man will act. God said that this &#x201C;judge&#x201D; will not remain united with the body; i.e., man would die. Krinsky explains it differently. He says the meaning of the verse is: my spirit (the spirit which I placed in man) will not judge man; i.e., man follows his evil inclinations. He acts without discernment. He follows the way of the flesh rather than that of the spirit. It appears that he will continually do so, therefore&#x2026; Cherez explains, God&#x2019;s spirit judges man.

<ftnote id="fn544"><sup>9</sup> It means that. The <italic>shin</italic> of <italic>be-shaggam</italic> is a particle of relation, short for <italic>asher</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn563"><sup>28</sup> Finding grace in God&#x2019;s eyes means that God took pity on a person (Filwarg). I.E. shows that the Bible connects mercy with the eye. The eye is said to take or not to take pity.</ftnote>

This root gives birth both to <italic>tam</italic> (wholehearted) and <italic>tamim</italic> (wholehearted). In the former, a <italic>mem</italic> is dropped. In the latter, the whole root is found in the word. I.E. employs a pun. He says <italic>tamim</italic> is <italic>tamim</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn604"><sup>69</sup> A <italic>brit</italic> is an agreement with conditions (boundaries) which cannot be violated. <italic>Brit</italic> has the letters <italic>bet, resh, tav</italic>.

<title>CHAPTER 7</title>
<p>4. FOR YET SEVEN DAYS. On the seventh day the rain will fall without letup for forty days. The Lord told this to Noah on the tenth day of the second month.<sup><xref rid="fn611">1</xref></sup> At the end of the forty days from the start of the flood the sun returned to its proper place vis-a-vis the moon.<sup><xref rid="fn612">2</xref></sup> The latter is a secret.<sup><xref rid="fn613">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>[LIVING SUBSTANCE.] The word <italic>yekum</italic> (living substance) is found in the Bible only in our chapter.<sup><xref rid="fn614">4</xref></sup> It is a <italic>peh, yod</italic> and follows the paradigm of the word <italic>keruv</italic> (cherub).<sup><xref rid="fn615">5</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>yekum</italic> is an inverted <italic>ayin, vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn616">6</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>yerivai</italic> in <italic>Strive</italic> (riv) <italic>O Lord, with them that strive with me</italic> (yerivai) (Ps. 35:1).<sup><xref rid="fn617">7</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Living substance</italic> is a general term for every living thing that is upon the face of the earth.</p>
<p>5. AND NOAH DID. As he was commanded. He and his family came to the vicinity of the ark.</p>
<p>7. BECAUSE OF THE WATERS OF THE FLOOD. Because of fear of the waters of the flood. In these seven days many of the clean animals and fowl came of their own volition to the vicinity of the ark. From the others and from everything that creeps, a pair consisting of a male and female of each kind came to the ark.</p>
<p>11. WERE ALL THE FOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT DEEP BROKEN UP. <italic>Mayenot</italic> (fountains of) is in the construct. In <italic>When there were no fountains</italic> (mayanot) (Prov. 8:24), <italic>mayanot</italic> is in the absolute.<sup><xref rid="fn618">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>DEEP. The word <italic>tehom</italic> (deep) may be either masculine or feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn619">9</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>tehom</italic> in <italic>The deep</italic> (tehom) <italic>made it grow</italic> (Ezek. 31:4), is in the feminine. The Bible does not mention the streams because their waters come from the fountains. When the fountains of the deep broke up, their waters gushed upward and the windows of the heavenly storehouse of water were opened and their contents poured down upon the earth. The earth was confounded; there was no way of telling day from night. Proof of the latter is God&#x2019;s promise to Noah after the flood that <italic>and day and night shall not cease</italic> (Gen. 8:22). When the rain ceased falling from the heavens, Noah knew that forty days and forty nights had passed, for God revealed to him this secret.<sup><xref rid="fn620">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN. The word <italic>arubbot</italic> (windows) has the same meaning as <italic>arubbot</italic> (window) in <italic>Behold, if the Lord should make windows</italic> (arubbot) <italic>in heaven</italic> (II Kings 7:2). The term window or storehouse (Deut. 28:12) when referring to heaven is in keeping with human language and practice.<sup><xref rid="fn621">11</xref></sup> Some say that the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>arubbot</italic> (windows) is a root letter<sup><xref rid="fn622">12</xref></sup> and that <italic>arubbot</italic> is similar to <italic>kevudot</italic> (riches).<sup><xref rid="fn623">13</xref></sup> Others say that the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>arubbot</italic> is not a root letter. It is similar to the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>agorat</italic> (piece of) (I Sam. 2:36).<sup><xref rid="fn624">14</xref></sup> Both <italic>arubbot</italic> and <italic>agorat</italic> come from roots whose last two letters are the same.<sup><xref rid="fn625">15</xref></sup> On the seventeenth day of the second month, the day the flood started, Noah and his family entered the ark. At that time Noah brought into the ark the animals, cattle and the creeping things and fowl. <italic>Bird</italic> is a general term for a winged creature.<sup><xref rid="fn626">16</xref></sup> The great miracle was that they all came two by two of their own volition.</p>
<p>16. AND THEY THAT WENT IN, WENT IN MALE AND FEMALE. The meaning of <italic>And they that went in</italic> is: and they that went into the ark.</p>
<p>[AND THE LORD SHUT HIM IN.] The term <italic>shut him in</italic> in our verse has a positive connotation. It has to be so interpreted because being shut in at that time was preferable to not being shut in. However, elsewhere it has a negative implication. Thus we read, <italic>He shutteth up a man</italic> (Job 12:14), and <italic>And whom God hath hedged in</italic> (Job 3:23). That it has a negative connotation is obvious from the first half of the verse.<sup><xref rid="fn627">17</xref></sup> Noah closed the door of the ark and God helped him in that no part of the ark cracked open, for had any part opened, then all would have immediately died.</p>
<p>Why state, <italic>and the flood was forty days upon the earth</italic> (v. 17), after having said, <italic>And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights</italic> (v. 12)? The way to read the verse (v. 17) is as follows: After the flood was forty days upon the earth, <italic>the waters increased and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn628">18</xref></sup> This verse shows that for the first forty days the ark did not move.</p>
<p>19. EXCEEDINGLY. The word <italic>me&#x2019;od</italic> (exceedingly) is repeated in the text in order to stress that the waters prevailed to their maximum potential.</p>
<p>Why state, <italic>and the mountains were covered</italic> (v. 20), after having said, <italic>and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered</italic> (v. 19)? Its meaning is: All the high mountains were covered with water (v. 19), and these mountains were covered by fifteen cubits of water (v. 20).<sup><xref rid="fn629">19</xref></sup> There are those who maintain that there is a very tall mountain in Greece that the waters did not cover.<sup><xref rid="fn630">20</xref></sup> However, we believe the words of our God and we put aside the foolish nonsense of man.</p>
<p>[21. AND ALL FLESH PERISHED.] The meaning of <italic>And all flesh perished</italic> is: and all flesh had perished.<sup><xref rid="fn631">21</xref></sup> There are many such instances in Scripture, such as <italic>And I besought the Lord</italic> (Deut. 3:23), and the true meaning of <italic>And He caused manna to rain upon them for food</italic> (Ps. 78:24).<sup><xref rid="fn632">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>[PERISHED.] <italic>Va-yigva</italic> (perished) means died. I will explain the exact meaning of this term when I comment on <italic>And Abraham expired</italic> (va-yigva), <italic>and died</italic> (Gen. 25:8).</p>
<p>It is clear<sup><xref rid="fn633">23</xref></sup> that <italic>remes</italic> (creeping thing) is a general term that includes fowl, cattle, animals, small thin swarming things and man. It is possible that <italic>all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life</italic> (v. 22) refers to <italic>every man</italic> (v. 21),<sup><xref rid="fn634">24</xref></sup> as we do not find the expression <italic>neshamah</italic> (breath)<sup><xref rid="fn635">25</xref></sup> used in reference to any creature except man. Many say that the soul is termed <italic>neshamah</italic> because it comes from the heaven (<italic>shamayim</italic>). The fact that <italic>shamayim</italic> and <italic>neshamah</italic> have differing roots does not refute the latter interpretation because there are other similar instances.<sup><xref rid="fn636">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND THEY WERE BLOTTED OUT. Their names were erased from the earth because they left no descendants.</p>
<p>[AND NOAH ONLY WAS LEFT.] Only Noah and those with him were left. This verse proves how wrong are some of our ignorant brethren who maintain that the flood did not cover the entire earth.<sup><xref rid="fn637">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND THE WATERS PREVAILED UPON THE EARTH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS. This was so because the fountains were broken up (v. 11) and it rained for a day and stopped for a day for, <italic>and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights</italic> (v. 4) means it will rain for a period of forty days and forty nights without letup. That it did in fact also rain after the first forty days were over is evident from <italic>and the rain from heaven was restrained</italic> (Gen. 8:2).<sup><xref rid="fn638">28</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn611"><sup>1</sup> The flood began on the 17th of the second month. Therefore God&#x2019;s command (to go into the ark) was given to Noah on the 10th, seven days prior to the fall of the rain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn612"><sup>2</sup> And the flood ceased. I.E., who believed in astrology, held that the flood came about as a result of an impropitious conjunction of the sun and moon (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn613"><sup>3</sup> The uninitiated might suspect that I.E. denies divine providence by giving an astrological explanation to the flood (Krinsky).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn616"><sup>6</sup> Its root is <italic>kof, vav, mem</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn618"><sup>8</sup> <italic>Mayenot</italic> in our verse has a <italic>sheva</italic> beneath the <italic>yod. Mayanot</italic> in Prov. 8:24 has a <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath the <italic>yod</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn619"><sup>9</sup><italic>Tehom</italic> in our verse is in the feminine (<italic>tehom rabbah</italic>). Elsewhere (Habakkuk 3:10) <italic>natan tehom kolo</italic> is in the masculine, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 8</title>
<p>1. AND GOD REMEMBERED NOAH. This includes his children and the women. Noah alone is mentioned because he was the most important of them.</p>
<p>AND EVERY LIVING THING. A general term for beasts of the field, fowl that fly, and for everything that swarms upon the earth.</p>
<p><italic>And God remembered</italic> means God remembered the oath that he had sworn to Noah.<sup><xref rid="fn639">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND GOD MADE A WIND TO PASS OVER THE EARTH. The wind blew continuously.<sup><xref rid="fn640">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE WATERS ASSUAGED. They rested and no longer prevailed. <italic>Then was the king&#x2019;s wrath assuaged</italic> (Esther 7:10) is similar. Assuaged in our verse and in Esther is in the <italic>kal</italic>. However, in our verse the <italic>caf</italic> receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> to make up for the missing middle root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn641">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. WERE STOPPED. <italic>Va-yissakheru</italic> (were stopped) is synonymous with <italic>va-yissageru</italic> (were closed). Although both of these words mean the same, they come from different roots.<sup><xref rid="fn642">4</xref></sup> They do not come from one root with the <italic>caf</italic> and <italic>gimel</italic> interchanging, for these two letters do not interchange. The only letters that interchange are the <italic>yod, heh, vav</italic> and <italic>alef</italic>, and the <italic>sin</italic> and <italic>shin</italic>.</p>
<p>AND THE RAIN FROM HEAVEN WAS RESTRAINED. It was restrained in the storehouse of rain.<sup><xref rid="fn643">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND THE WATERS RETURNED. The waters returned at the end of one hundred and fifty days to their reservoirs beneath the earth where they are normally stored. Noah knew that it took one hundred and fifty days for this to happen, for he was a prophet.<sup><xref rid="fn644">6</xref></sup> They err who maintain that since Scripture speaks of one hundred and fifty days making up five months,<sup><xref rid="fn645">7</xref></sup> it must be referring to solar months, for five solar months come to one hundred and fifty-two days.<sup><xref rid="fn646">8</xref></sup> Also anyone who maintains that Noah followed a calendar of intercalated<sup><xref rid="fn647">9</xref></sup> lunar months, with Cheshvan being the second month<sup><xref rid="fn648">10</xref></sup> and the year full, misses the mark.<sup><xref rid="fn649">11</xref></sup> Why go to all this trouble? Even if the Bible explicitly stated that Noah employed solar months or that he counted the months from Tishri<sup><xref rid="fn650">12</xref></sup> this would have no effect on Jewish law, for the laws governing the establishment of the seasons were not given by Noah.<sup><xref rid="fn651">13</xref></sup> It is also possible to say many things concerning the ark&#x2019;s coming to rest.<sup><xref rid="fn652">14</xref></sup> However, such speculations &#x201C;cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain&#x201D; (I Sam. 12:21).</p>
<p>5. IN THE TENTH MONTH, ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH, WERE THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS SEEN. Noah established the first day of the month even though he did not see the new moon, for he had not as yet opened the window of the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn653">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Noah sent out the raven on the tenth day of Shevat. From that day on the raven continuously went to and fro until Noah left the ark, for Scripture states that <italic>it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth</italic>. On the day that the earth dried, Noah and all that were with him left the ark. Seven days after sending the raven, Noah sent the dove. The latter event took place on the seventeenth day of Shevat, which was the tenth month from the start of the flood. Noah observed the quarterly watch.<sup><xref rid="fn654">16</xref></sup> <italic>And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove</italic> (v. 10) is proof of the above.<sup><xref rid="fn655">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>[10. AND HE STAYED.] <italic>Va-yachel</italic> (and he stayed) is, I believe, derived from the word <italic>techillah</italic> (beginning).<sup><xref rid="fn656">18</xref></sup> For if it came from the same root as <italic>tochelet</italic> (hope),<sup><xref rid="fn657">19</xref></sup> it should have been vocalized <italic>va-yichel</italic>, as is the case with <italic>va-yiketz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn658">20</xref></sup> (and he awoke), or vocalized <italic>va-yechel</italic>, as in the case of <italic>va-yeshev</italic> (and he dwelt).<sup><xref rid="fn659">21</xref></sup> However, it is possible it is an irregular verb.<sup><xref rid="fn660">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND AGAIN HE SENT FORTH THE DOVE OUT OF THE ARK. On the twenty-fourth day of Shevat.</p>
<p>11. IN HER MOUTH AN OLIVE-LEAF FRESHLY PLUCKED. Some say that Scripture employs two words with one meaning,<sup><xref rid="fn661">23</xref></sup> as it does in <italic>the dust of the earth</italic> (Dan. 12:2). They interpret <italic>taraf</italic> (freshly plucked) as leaf. <italic>All its sprouting leaves</italic> (tarpe tzimchah) (Ezek. 17:9) is similar. That <italic>taraf</italic> is a noun is evident from the long <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath the <italic>resh</italic>. It is like <italic>zahav</italic> (gold) and <italic>ashan</italic> (smoke).</p>
<p>However, in my opinion the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>be-fihah</italic> (mouth) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn662">24</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>be-rucho</italic> (by his breath) in <italic>By His breath the heavens are serene</italic> (Job 26:13)<sup><xref rid="fn663">25</xref></sup> and the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ve-echad</italic> (at one with Himself) (Job 23:13).<sup><xref rid="fn664">26</xref></sup> In this case <italic>taraf</italic> is a verb meaning plucked and is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath the second radical like <italic>taraf</italic> (torn) in <italic>For He hath torn</italic> (taraf) (Hos. 6:1)<sup><xref rid="fn665">27</xref></sup> and <italic>sha&#x2019;ag</italic> (hath roared) in <italic>The lion hath roared</italic> (sha&#x2019;ag) (Amos 3:8)<sup><xref rid="fn666">28</xref></sup> and other similar cases. It is also possible that <italic>taraf</italic> (freshly plucked) is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> because it is an adjective like <italic>chacham</italic> (wise). It means the same as <italic>taruf</italic> (torn), for an adjective may resemble an active or passive participle.<sup><xref rid="fn667">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND HE STAYED. <italic>Va-yiyyachel</italic> (and he stayed) is a <italic>nifal</italic> and is penultimately accented<sup><xref rid="fn668">30</xref></sup> like <italic>va-yillachem</italic> (and he fought) (Num. 21:1) and <italic>va-yitzamed</italic> (and he was joined) (Num. 25:3).<sup><xref rid="fn669">31</xref></sup> However, there are instances when corresponding <italic>nifals</italic> are accented on the last syllable,<sup><xref rid="fn670">32</xref></sup> as in <italic>va-yippaked</italic> (was empty) in <italic>that David&#x2019;s place was empty</italic> (I Sam. 20:27). The entire root appears in <italic>And he stayed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn671">33</xref></sup> as it does in <italic>shot through</italic> (yiyyareh) (Ex. 19:13).<sup><xref rid="fn672">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND SENT FORTH THE DOVE.] Noah sent out the dove on the first day of Adar. This time it no longer returned to him as it was wont to.</p>
<p>ANY MORE. <italic>Od</italic> (anymore) means forever. <italic>Od</italic> in <italic>his uncleanness is yet</italic> (od) <italic>upon him</italic> (Num. 19:13) and <italic>While the earth remaineth</italic> (od kol yeme ha-aretz) (Gen. 8:22) is similar.</p>
<p>13. THE WATERS WERE DRIED UP FROM OFF THE EARTH. Only the surface of the earth dried; the soil itself was swampy and hence not yet firm enough to walk upon. The earth did not fully dry until later.</p>
<p>Those who insist that Noah used a lunar calendar because Scripture tells us that he spent a year and ten days in the ark and the ten days refer to the excess of the solar year over a lunar year are pressing a point.<sup><xref rid="fn673">35</xref></sup> First of all, for this to be so the year had to be &#x201C;full.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn674">36</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is no reason to assume that Noah spent a year in the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn675">37</xref></sup> He could equally have been in it for a solar year plus ten days.<sup><xref rid="fn676">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. BRING FORTH. <italic>Haytze</italic> (bring forth) is written as if it came from a root whose radicals remain unchanged in conjugation.<sup><xref rid="fn677">39</xref></sup> <italic>Hayshar</italic> (make straight) in <italic>Make Thy way straight before my face</italic> (Ps. 5:9) is similar.</p>
<p>THAT THEY MAY SWARM. Reproduce.</p>
<p>19. AFTER THEIR FAMILIES. After their kind. Some say that the animals bred in the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn678">40</xref></sup> Each family then left the ark by itself and did not intermingle with any other. This interpretation is not farfetched.</p>
<p>20. EVERY CLEAN BEAST. There are ten kinds of clean beasts.<sup><xref rid="fn679">41</xref></sup> We do not know the number of clean fowl because the Bible lists only the unclean ones since the clean fowl are more numerous than the unclean. Noah built the altar on one of the mountains of Ararat.<sup><xref rid="fn680">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. SMELLED. <italic>Va-yarach</italic> (smelled) follows the paradigm of <italic>va-yanach</italic> (rested) in <italic>and rested</italic> (va-yanach) <italic>in all the borders of Egypt</italic> (Ex. 10:14). The <italic>resh</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> because the <italic>chet</italic> which follows it is a guttural. This is in keeping with the rules of Hebrew grammar.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid that one conclude from our verse that God smells. Neither does He eat, as <italic>Who did eat the fat of their sacrifices</italic> (Deut. 32:38)<sup><xref rid="fn681">43</xref></sup> states. The meaning of our verse is that God accepted the burnt offering and it pleased Him. It may be compared to a human being who smells a pleasant scent and enjoys it.</p>
<p>THE SWEET SAVOUR. <italic>Nicho&#x2019;ach</italic> (sweet savour) comes from the same root as <italic>menuchah</italic> (rest).<sup><xref rid="fn682">44</xref></sup> The <italic>chet</italic> is doubled in <italic>nicho&#x2019;ach</italic> as the final <italic>peh</italic> of the root of <italic>ve-na&#x2019;afufe&#x2019;ah</italic> (and her adulteries) is doubled (Hos. 2:4). Its meaning is that the sweet odor assuaged God&#x2019;s anger, or that it caused a power from on high to rest on man.<sup><xref rid="fn683">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN HIS HEART. <italic>El libbo</italic> means in His heart.<sup><xref rid="fn684">46</xref></sup> He then revealed His secret to Noah who was a prophet.</p>
<p>[I WILL NOT AGAIN CURSE THE GROUND.] As I did on account of Adam, as it is written, <italic>cursed is the ground for thy sake</italic> (Gen. 3:17).</p>
<p>THE IMAGINATION. <italic>Yetzer</italic> (the imagination) refers to the nature that man was created with.</p>
<p>NEITHER WILL I AGAIN SMITE. Via a flood.</p>
<p>[AGAIN.] <italic>Od</italic> means forever,<sup><xref rid="fn685">47</xref></sup> or again. <italic>And wept on his neck a good while</italic> (od) (Gen. 46:29) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn686">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. WHILE THE EARTH REMAINETH. This indicates that an end has been fixed for the earth. The Rabbinic interpretation of <italic>It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about</italic> (Ezek. 48:38) is very precious. However, even one in a thousand does not know what it means.<sup><xref rid="fn687">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEED TIME AND HARVEST. The year is divided into two periods<sup><xref rid="fn688">50</xref></sup> and then into four: cold, the antithesis of heat, and summer, the antithesis of winter, corresponding to the four seasons of the year.<sup><xref rid="fn689">51</xref></sup> The four periods are all divided into day and night, for when the days are short the nights are long, and as the nights get shorter the days get longer until both are equal.<sup><xref rid="fn690">52</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn639"><sup>1</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 6:18.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn642"><sup>4</sup> <italic>Va-yissakheru</italic> comes from the root <italic>samekh, caf, resh</italic>; <italic>va-yissageru</italic> comes from the root <italic>samekh, gimel, resh</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn647"><sup>9</sup> That is, lunar months alternating between months of 29 and 30 days. (Cheshvan and Kislev can each have 29 or 30 days. See note 36.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn648"><sup>10</sup> This is the opinion of this commentator. I.E. maintains that Iyyar was the second month. Cf. verse 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn649"><sup>11</sup> Even if Cheshvan and Kislev had 30 days each, the year being full (<italic>shelemah</italic>), the number of days in the five lunar months comes to 148. The flood started on the 17th of Cheshvan, the five months end on the 17th of Nisan. They include 13 days in Cheshvan, 30 days in Kislev, 29 days in Tevet, 30 in Shevat, 29 in Adar and 17 in Nisan: a total of 148 days (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn650"><sup>12</sup> Making Chesvan the second month as the previously quoted second opinion held.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn651"><sup>13</sup> But by Moses. He established the Jewish calendar and taught the Jews to use a lunar calendar and count the months from Nisan.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn654"><sup>16</sup> The month is divided into quarters (watches). At the end of each watch, that day signifies a change in nature and fate (Weiser). Hence Noah waited seven days (a watch) between the raven and the dove; similarly with the dove itself.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn658"><sup>20</sup> Gen. 9:24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn659"><sup>21</sup> The point is, if <italic>va-yachel</italic> is a <italic>peh yod</italic> then it would be vocalized like a word of this classification, i.e., like <italic>va-yiketz</italic> or <italic>va-yeshev</italic>, both of which are <italic>peh yods</italic>. The vocalization <italic>va-yachel</italic> shows that it belongs to the <italic>kefulim</italic>, those roots whose second and third radicals are identical.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn660"><sup>22</sup> It comes from the root <italic>yod, chet, lamed</italic>, meaning to stay, wait with hope, but is vocalized as if it came from the root <italic>chet, lamed, lamed</italic> (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn661"><sup>23</sup> <italic>Aleh</italic> (leaf) and <italic>taraf</italic> (freshly plucked) mean the same. The verse thus reads, an olive-leaf, a frond in its mouth.

<ftnote id="fn662"><sup>24</sup> I.E. says that the phrase should read <italic>taraf-pihah</italic> (its mouth had plucked). He thus insists that the <italic>bet</italic> is superfluous. According to this interpretation <italic>taraf</italic> is a verb.</ftnote>

Noah entered the ark on the 17th day of the second month and left it on the 27th day of the second month of the following year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn674"><sup>36</sup> A solar year has 365 days; a lunar year may have 353, 354 or 355 days, called, respectively, <italic>shanah chasera</italic> (defective year), <italic>shanah ki-sidra</italic> (regular year), and <italic>shenah shelemah</italic> (a full year). In the first instance Cheshvan and Kislev have 29 days each; in the second Cheshvan has 29 days and Kislev 30; in the third both Cheshvan and Kislev have 30 days each. To make the lunar year equal the solar year, the lunar year had to be &#x201C;full&#x201D; plus 10 days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn675"><sup>37</sup> Why say that the year and 10 days that Noah spent in the ark was the equivalent of a solar year and Noah employed a lunar calendar, when it could just as well have been a solar year plus 10 days?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn676"><sup>38</sup> The point is that we do not know what sort of calendar Noah used. Elsewhere I.E. comments that Noah could have employed Egyptian or Persian calendars. As to Jewish law, the calendar to be followed is the one legislated by Moses.</ftnote>

<p>[AND UPON ALL.] Some say that the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>be-khol</italic> (and upon all) and of <italic>u-ve-khol</italic> (and upon all) are in place of a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn694">4</xref></sup> However, it is more likely that this clause is connected to <italic>And the fear of you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn695">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. EVERY MOVING THING. <italic>Remes</italic> (moving thing) is a general term for wild and domesticated animals and for all fowl and fish. Man was now permitted to kill and eat them all.</p>
<p>AS THE GREEN HERB. <italic>Yerek</italic> (green) can be vocalized in two ways.<sup><xref rid="fn696">6</xref></sup> The same is true with smoke. We thus find, <italic>behold a smoking</italic> (ashan)<sup><xref rid="fn697">7</xref></sup> <italic>furnace</italic> (Gen. 15:17), and <italic>as the smoke</italic> (ke-eshen)<sup><xref rid="fn698">8</xref></sup> <italic>of a furnace (Ex</italic>. 19:18).</p>
<p>4. ONLY FLESH WITH THE LIFE THEREOF, WHICH IS THE BLOOD THEREOF, SHALL YE NOT EAT. The meaning of this verse is that you shall not eat flesh with its life (<italic>nefesh</italic>), which is its blood, as in <italic>and thou shalt not eat the life</italic> (nefesh, i.e., the blood) <italic>with the flesh</italic> (Deut. 12:23), and <italic>For as to the life</italic> (nefesh) <italic>of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life</italic> (nefesh) <italic>thereof</italic> (Lev. 17:14). The <italic>nefesh</italic> (life) which moves and feels is the body.<sup><xref rid="fn699">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND SURELY YOUR BLOOD OF YOUR LIVES WILL I REQUIRE. I have permitted you to shed the blood of all living creatures. However, I have prohibited you the spilling of the blood of your lives because you are human. On the contrary, I will avenge that blood (<italic>edreshennu</italic>), as in <italic>For He that avengeth</italic> (doresh) <italic>blood</italic> (Ps. 9:13). Scripture first lays down a general rule, <italic>And surely your blood of your lives will I require</italic>, and then goes into detail and tells us whom God will punish for taking human life.</p>
<p>AND AT THE HAND OF MAN. If many people kill one person or if one man kills another person (even at the hand of every man&#x2019;s brother), I will avenge that death. I will also punish a beast that kills a man by having another animal kill it.<sup><xref rid="fn700">10</xref></sup> Thus man is permitted to kill animals but animals are prohibited from killing humans.</p>
<p>In my opinion it is farfetched to maintain that <italic>and surely your blood of your lives</italic> refers to suicide.<sup><xref rid="fn701">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>[6. WHOSO SHEDDETH MAN&#x2019;S BLOOD, BY MAN SHALL HIS BLOOD BE SHED.] This is a further elaboration.<sup><xref rid="fn702">12</xref></sup> It may also be taken, and this appears most likely, as a command to the sons of Noah to execute murderers. The term <italic>ba-adam</italic> (by man) can be interpreted in one of three ways: in front of witnesses;<sup><xref rid="fn703">13</xref></sup> in front of people; or because a man was killed. There are many other such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn704">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND GOD SPOKE UNTO NOAH, AND TO HIS SONS. God spoke to Noah&#x2019;s sons through Noah. It is also possible that they were all prophets and God addressed all four of them.</p>
<p>9. AND WITH YOUR SEED. <italic>Ve-et zarakhem</italic> is to be rendered: and with your seed.<sup><xref rid="fn705">15</xref></sup> The third <italic>with you</italic> (v. 10) is to be interpreted as meaning: that were <italic>with you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn706">16</xref></sup> It is also possible that <italic>with you</italic> is repeated for additional explanation.<sup><xref rid="fn707">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The covenant spoken of is that all flesh not be cut off anymore by the waters of the flood (v. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn708">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. [NEITHER SHALL ALL FLESH BE CUT OFF.] Flesh refers to the body. The body is so designated because flesh senses and the bones do not. The covenant is a promise that all bodies will never again be destroyed by a flood. God included in His covenant a pledge not to bring a comparable deluge ever again because the first part of His promise, <italic>neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood</italic>, may be taken to imply that there will be other floods but that God will save humanity. It is concerning this covenant that the prophet says, <italic>For as I have sworn that the waters of Noah Should no more go over the earth</italic> (Is. 54:9).</p>
<p>12. THE TOKEN. <italic>Ot</italic> (token) may be either masculine or feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn709">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. MY BOW. Behold, I now set a bow in the clouds. Saadiah Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation that the rainbow was previously in existence is incorrect.<sup><xref rid="fn710">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. WHEN I BRING CLOUDS OVER THE EARTH. The <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>be-aneni</italic> (when I bring clouds) does not have a <italic>dagesh</italic> even though it is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> and therefore should have a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the middle radical of the root, as in <italic>when I speak</italic> (be-dabberi) <italic>with thee</italic> (Ex. 19:9).<sup><xref rid="fn711">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE BOW IS SEEN IN THE CLOUDS. If we would believe what the Greek scholars tell us, that the rainbow is produced by the sun&#x2019;s flames, then we must assume that after the flood God strengthened the sun&#x2019;s light.<sup><xref rid="fn712">22</xref></sup> This is the way that a person who understands the sciences will interpret this verse.</p>
<p>15. [AND THE WATERS SHALL NO MORE BECOME.] The use of the singular <italic>yiheyeh</italic> (shall become) with <italic>mayim</italic> (waters) does not prove that <italic>mayim</italic> is singular.<sup><xref rid="fn713">23</xref></sup> We find the same word used with a plural in <italic>But there were</italic> (va-yehi)<sup><xref rid="fn714">24</xref></sup> <italic>certain men</italic> (Num. 9:6).</p>
<p>[16. AND THE BOW SHALL BE IN THE CLOUD.] The bow is always hidden in the cloud and there seen by God.<sup><xref rid="fn715">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND GOD SAID UNTO NOAH. This is <italic>the covenant</italic> that I disclosed to you and this is the oath <italic>which I have established</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn716">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND HAM IS THE FATHER OF CANAAN. This teaches that both Ham and Canaan were wicked, and as the father does, so do the children. Canaan and not Cush<sup><xref rid="fn717">27</xref></sup> is mentioned in this verse because Canaan was going to be cursed. This chapter<sup><xref rid="fn718">28</xref></sup> was written to inform us that all Canaanites, both male and female, bear a curse from the time of Noah. Abraham thus commanded his servant, <italic>thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites</italic> (Gen. 24:3). Rebecca similarly said, <italic>If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth&#x2026;what good shall my life do me</italic> (Gen. 27:46). Should someone ask, what sins were the Hittites guilty of, let him open his eyes; the Hittites and the Amorites and the others are all descendants of Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn719">29</xref></sup> We therefore read, <italic>unto the land of Canaan</italic> (Josh. 22:32).<sup><xref rid="fn720">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND NOAH&#x2026;BEGAN. <italic>Va-yachel</italic> (began) is derived from <italic>techillah</italic> (beginning). It belongs to those roots whose second and third letters are identical.<sup><xref rid="fn721">31</xref></sup> It is a <italic>hifil</italic>, similar to <italic>va-yasekh</italic> (shut up) in <italic>Or who shut up</italic><sup><xref rid="fn722">32</xref></sup> (va-yasekh) <italic>the sea with doors</italic> (Job 38:8).</p>
<p>THE HUSBANDMAN. A skilled agriculturalist, agriculture being a great science.</p>
<p>The Rabbinic statement that Noah drank from his vineyard on the day he planted it is not to be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn723">33</xref></sup> There is a secret meaning to it. Similarly <italic>and the woman conceived, and bore a son</italic> (Ex. 2:2) did not take place on one and the same day.<sup><xref rid="fn724">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND HE WAS UNCOVERED. <italic>Va-yitgal</italic> (and he was uncovered) comes from the root <italic>gimel, lamed, heh</italic>, meaning to uncover. It is a <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el. Yital</italic> (lift himself up) in <italic>And let him lift himself up</italic> (yital) (Jer. 51:3)<sup><xref rid="fn725">35</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>[HIS TENT.] The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>oholoh</italic> (his tent) is in place of a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn726">36</xref></sup> The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>be-re&#x2019;oh</italic> (as they shouted), in <italic>the noise of the people as they shouted</italic> (be-re&#x2019;oh) (Ex. 32:17), and the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>fera&#x2019;oh</italic> (let them loose) in <italic>for Aaron had let them loose</italic> (fera&#x2019;oh) (Ex. 32:25), are similar.</p>
<p>23. UPON BOTH THEIR SHOULDERS. Each one placed an edge of the blanket on his shoulders. <italic>Shekhem</italic> (shoulders) does not come in the plural.<sup><xref rid="fn727">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>BACKWARD. Opposite of the normal way of walking, which is to go forward.</p>
<p>24. AND NOAH AWOKE. Scripture does not reveal what was done to Noah. Be that as it may, Canaan was the culprit. The sequence of events was as follows: Ham saw his father&#x2019;s nakedness and unlike his brothers did not cover him. On the contrary, he revealed what he saw. Canaan heard that Noah was lying naked in his tent and did something to Noah. However, the Bible does not tell us what he did to him.<sup><xref rid="fn728">38</xref></sup> The meaning of the verse <italic>and (Noah) knew what his youngest son had done unto him</italic> is proof<sup><xref rid="fn729">39</xref></sup> that Canaan was the culprit, for we read, <italic>And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan</italic> (Gen. 10:6).<sup><xref rid="fn730">40</xref></sup> Furthermore, the <italic>his</italic> in <italic>his youngest son</italic> refers to Ham, who is previously mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn731">41</xref></sup> That is why Noah cursed Canaan. The one who says that Ham was the culprit, and that Canaan was cursed because Noah did not want to curse his son (Ham) because God had blessed Noah&#x2019;s sons, is indulging in Midrash.<sup><xref rid="fn732">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. A SERVANT OF SERVANTS. <italic>Eved avadim</italic> (a servant of servants) means a servant like all other servants.<sup><xref rid="fn733">43</xref></sup> If Scripture meant a servant to servants then it would have read <italic>eved ha-avadim</italic>. Proof of this is: <italic>it is most holy</italic> (kodesh kodashim) (Lev. 6:18), and <italic>In a most holy place</italic> (be-kodesh ha-kodashim) (Num. 18:10).<sup><xref rid="fn734">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>[UNTO HIS BRETHREN.] To Cush, Mizraim and Put, the sons of Ham his father. There are some who say that the Cushites are enslaved because Noah cursed Ham. However, they have forgotten that the first king to rule after the flood was a Cushite. Thus it is written, <italic>and Cush begot Nimrod&#x2026;And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar</italic> (Gen. 10:8-10).<sup><xref rid="fn735">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. BLESSED BE THE LORD, THE GOD OF SHEM. We are duty-bound to be bountiful in praise of the Lord, who is the God of Shem, for He will make Canaan a servant of God and Shem.<sup><xref rid="fn736">46</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is, God will compel Canaan to serve Shem, for <italic>lamo</italic> (their) has the same meaning as <italic>la-hem</italic> (to them).<sup><xref rid="fn737">47</xref></sup> The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>lamo</italic> is superfluous and is similar to the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>tevi&#x2019;emo</italic> (<italic>Thou bringest them in</italic>) (Ex. 15:17).<sup><xref rid="fn738">48</xref></sup> Therefore the term &#x201C;to them&#x201D; is not encountered in Scripture, spelled either without a <italic>heh</italic> or a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn739">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Tetragrammaton is invoked in connection with Shem to honor Shem.<sup><xref rid="fn740">50</xref></sup> It is not employed with regard to Japheth because he was not his brother&#x2019;s equal.</p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>Cursed be Canaan</italic> is short for cursed be Canaan&#x2019;s father.<sup><xref rid="fn741">51</xref></sup> He says that <italic>In the presence of Hanamel my uncle</italic> (Jer. 32:12) is similar, as Hanamel was really Jeremiah&#x2019;s uncle&#x2019;s son.<sup><xref rid="fn742">52</xref></sup> However, it is possible that Hanamel was older than Jeremiah and the latter referred to him as &#x201C;my uncle&#x201D; because it was an honor for him to be called by his father&#x2019;s title.<sup><xref rid="fn743">53</xref></sup> Similarly one&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s wife is called aunt in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn744">54</xref></sup> However, in our case there is no reason to refer to Ham by the name of his son.<sup><xref rid="fn745">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>[27. ENLARGE.] Saadiah also explains the word <italic>yaft</italic> (enlarge) as coming from the Hebrew word for beautiful (<italic>yafeh</italic>). However, his comment is not beautiful (<italic>yafeh</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn746">56</xref></sup> <italic>Yaft</italic> means he will enlarge.<sup><xref rid="fn747">57</xref></sup> The Aramaic word for <italic>He shall enlarge</italic> (Deut. 12:20) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn748">58</xref></sup> <italic>Yaft</italic> (enlarge) is a <italic>hifil</italic>. It is like <italic>yard</italic> in <italic>And maketh him rule</italic> (yard) <italic>over kings</italic> (Is. 41:2).<sup><xref rid="fn749">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both Shem and Japheth were blessed in this verse, for the meaning of <italic>And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem</italic> is: may God dwell in the tents of Shem. The previous verse (v. 26) relates the blessing with which Noah blessed God.<sup><xref rid="fn750">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND LET CANAAN BE THEIR SERVANT. To Shem, to Japheth and also to his brothers. Thus Canaan was to be a slave to all of the world, for from Shem, Japheth and Canaan&#x2019;s brothers all of humanity is descended. This came to pass many years after the flood.<sup><xref rid="fn751">61</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn691"><sup>1</sup> <italic>Chatat</italic> (terror or dread) with the pronominal suffix would read <italic>chatattekhem</italic> (your dread). In <italic>chittekhem</italic> a <italic>tav</italic> is missing; in <italic>chatattechem</italic> the whole root is present.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn692"><sup>2</sup> Interpreting <italic>tirmos ha&#x2019;adamah</italic> as <italic>tirmos al ha&#x2019;adamah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn693"><sup>3</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>be-khol asher tirmos ha&#x2019;adamah</italic> means, upon all creeping things which the ground will bring forth (Weiser). In the former, ground (<italic>adamah</italic>) is the object, in the latter the subject. According to the second interpretation, <italic>tirmos</italic> means will give birth to creeping things.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn694"><sup>4</sup> That is, <italic>be-khol</italic>, and <italic>u-ve-khol</italic> should be read as if written <italic>ve-khol</italic> (and all). According to this interpretation the second half of our verse is an independent clause stating: and all wherewith the ground teemeth and all the fish of the sea; into your hand are delivered. According to this interpretation we do not have to add the word &#x201C;because&#x201D; before <italic>into your hand are they delivered</italic>. However, it should be noted that this comment is difficult. <italic>U-ve-khol</italic> has a <italic>vav</italic>. Weiser suggests interpreting I.E.: and the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>u-ve-khol</italic> is superfluous. Cf. Weiser and Cherez.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn695"><sup>5</sup> According to this interpretation the <italic>bet</italic> has the meaning of on; <italic>be-khol</italic> thus means <italic>upon all</italic> rather than <italic>and all</italic> as in the former interpretation. The same is true for <italic>u-ve-khol</italic> (Weiser). According to this explanation the second half of the verse is a continuation of the first half. The entire verse should be read as follows: And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth&#x2026; and upon all (<italic>be-khol</italic>) wherewith the ground teemeth, and upon all (<italic>u-ve-khol</italic>) the fish of the sea; because into your hand are they delivered. According to this interpretation &#x201C;because&#x201D; has to be added to the text (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn696"><sup>6</sup> It is vocalized either with two <italic>segolim</italic> (<italic>yerek</italic>) or two <italic>kematzim</italic>. The point is that green and smoke can follow either of two paradigms, <italic>pe&#x2019;el</italic> (two <italic>segolim</italic>) or <italic>pa&#x2019;al</italic> (two <italic>kematzim</italic>).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn699"><sup>9</sup> The word <italic>nefesh</italic> does not here refer to soul; it means body. However, by extension it also refers to the blood which gives life to the body. Krinsky has an alternate reading: the <italic>nefesh</italic> spoken of here refers to that which moves and feels within the body, i.e., the blood. According to Cherez, I.E. uses the term body for the blood.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn700"><sup>10</sup> This explains, <italic>at the hand of every beast will I require it</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn701"><sup>11</sup> Cf. <italic>Baba Kama</italic> 91b. This verse teaches that a person is prohibited from harming himself. See also Rabbi B. Epstein, <italic>Torah Temimah</italic> on this verse.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn703"><sup>13</sup> The <italic>bet</italic> meaning in front of; <italic>ba-adam</italic>, in front of people, i.e. witnesses or in public. The verse thus reads, <italic>Whoso sheddeth man&#x2019;s blood</italic> before witnesses (or before many people), his blood shall be shed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn704"><sup>14</sup> Taking the <italic>bet</italic> to mean because (Krinsky). The verse thus reads, <italic>Whoso sheddeth man&#x2019;s blood</italic>, because he killed a man, his blood shall be shed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn705"><sup>15</sup> In other words, <italic>et</italic> here has the meaning of <italic>im</italic> (with).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn706"><sup>16</sup> <italic>Ittekhem</italic> (with your) appears three times in verses 9 and 10. The third <italic>with you</italic>, i.e., <italic>and every beast of the earth with you</italic>, appears redundant because it follows <italic>and with every living creature that is with you, the fowl, the cattle</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn707"><sup>17</sup> The Bible repeats itself in order to further explain itself; i.e., the beasts spoken of are those that are with you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn708"><sup>18</sup> Verse 11 reads, <italic>And I will establish My covenant with you; neither shall</italic>, etc. Hence it appears that a covenant was made and then God promised <italic>neither shall</italic>, etc. I.E. points out that <italic>neither shall</italic> opens the covenant (Krinsky).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn737"><sup>47</sup> The second half of the verse literally reads, and let Canaan be a servant to them (<italic>lamo</italic>). I.E. points out that <italic>lamo</italic> means to them (<italic>la-hem</italic>) and refers to God and Shem who are mentioned in the first half of the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn738"><sup>48</sup> The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>tevi&#x2019;emo</italic> is also superfluous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn739"><sup>49</sup> Since the term for them is either <italic>la-hem</italic> or <italic>lamo</italic>, the term <italic>lam</italic> is not found in Scripture (Netter).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn740"><sup>50</sup> The ancestor of the Israelites who worshiped the Lord (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn741"><sup>51</sup> This answers the question: Why was Canaan cursed when it was in fact Ham who allowed his father to lie naked at the doorway of the tent?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn742"><sup>52</sup> Cf. Jer. 32:8. We thus see that Scripture employs such abridgments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn743"><sup>53</sup> The point is that Jeremiah wanted to honor his cousin who was older than he. He did so by calling him uncle. Hence Saadiah cannot offer proof from this verse that Scripture employs this type of abridgment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn744"><sup>54</sup> An uncle is a <italic>dod</italic>, his wife is a <italic>dodah</italic>. She is so called in order to honor her, because she is married to one&#x2019;s uncle. See I.E. to Lev. 18:14. Similarly Lot is called Abraham&#x2019;s brother, rather than his nephew (Gen. 14:14).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn745"><sup>55</sup> What honor is there to Ham if he is referred to as Canaan?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn746"><sup>56</sup> A sarcastic pun, telling us that Saadiah is wrong.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn747"><sup>57</sup> <italic>Yafte</italic>. Compare Deut. 12:20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn748"><sup>58</sup> Onkelos renders <italic>ki yarchiv</italic> as <italic>are yafte</italic> (Deut. 12:20).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn749"><sup>59</sup> The point is that <italic>yaft</italic>, like <italic>yard</italic>, is an abridged word. <italic>Yaft</italic> is short for <italic>yafteh</italic> and <italic>yard</italic> for <italic>yardeh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn750"><sup>60</sup> God rather than Shem is the object of the blessing. Hence in verse 26 Noah blessed God. In verse 27 he blessed Shem and Japheth. Thus the blessing of Shem in verse 27 is not redundant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn751"><sup>61</sup> According to Krinsky, I.E.&#x2019;s words apply to the blessing and curse uttered by Noah, namely, that God would dwell in the tents of Shem, that he would enlarge Japheth, and that Canaan would be a slave.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 10</title>
<p>4. KITTIM. <italic>Kittim</italic> is the name of one of Javan&#x2019;s sons.<sup><xref rid="fn752">1</xref></sup> I therefore explain in my comments on the Book of Daniel that Greeks and Romans<sup><xref rid="fn753">2</xref></sup> constitute one kingdom.<sup><xref rid="fn754">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>NIMROD. Do not attempt to ascertain the meaning of any names encountered in the Bible if Scripture itself does not explain them.<sup><xref rid="fn755">4</xref></sup> Nimrod was the first to display man&#x2019;s power over the wild beasts for he was a mighty hunter. The meaning of <italic>before the Lord</italic> (v. 9) is that Nimrod built altars and offered the animals he hunted as whole offerings to God. This is the literal meaning of the verse. However, its Midrashic interpretation is totally different.<sup><xref rid="fn756">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. WHEREFORE IT IS SAID. This proverb was also used in the days of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn757">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. [OUT OF THAT LAND WENT FORTH ASSHUR.] Asshur was the son of Japheth.<sup><xref rid="fn758">7</xref></sup> The events related in this verse took place after the dispersion following the building of the Tower of Babel. Nimrod was the first king over Babel.<sup><xref rid="fn759">8</xref></sup> According to <italic>Seder Olam</italic>, Nimrod was king over the seventy who built the tower, and it was in his time that the dispersion took place.<sup><xref rid="fn760">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THE SAME IS THE GREAT CITY. It appears to me that this is connected to <italic>and builded Nineveh</italic>. However, it is also possible that it is connected to Resen or Calah.<sup><xref rid="fn761">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND MIZRAIM BEGOT LUDIM. In my opinion, these are the names of countries, each of which was populated by a particular family. This is why all the names (in verses 13 and 14) are in the plural. Proof of this is the name <italic>Pathrusim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn762">11</xref></sup> Additional and definite proof that this interpretation is correct is the phrase <italic>whence went forth</italic> (v. 14), for the word <italic>whence</italic><sup><xref rid="fn763">12</xref></sup> alludes to a place.</p>
<p>[14. AND CAPHTORIM.] Mizraim also begat the Caphtorim.<sup><xref rid="fn764">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The term begat is used in Scripture when referring to the father because the child comes from the strength and power of the father<sup><xref rid="fn765">14</xref></sup> and is in his likeness and image.</p>
<p>19. AS THOU GOEST TOWARD GERAR. The word <italic>gerarah</italic> means to Gerar.<sup><xref rid="fn766">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. THESE ARE THE SONS OF HAM, AFTER THEIR FAMILIES, AFTER THEIR TONGUES. Scripture says the same concerning the children of Japheth<sup><xref rid="fn767">16</xref></sup> and the children of Shem.<sup><xref rid="fn768">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. [THE FATHER OF ALL THE CHILDREN OF EBER.] Scripture informs us that Shem was the father of the Hebrews for no one was greater than he, and the Lord was his God. Similarly it is written, <italic>Thus saith the Lord, the God of the Hebrews</italic> (ivrim) (Ex. 10:3).<sup><xref rid="fn769">18</xref></sup> On the other hand, the Bible tells us that Ham was the father of Canaan<sup><xref rid="fn770">19</xref></sup> for no one was baser that he. It is unfitting for the holy and profane to intermingle. Scripture notes that Shem was <italic>the brother of Japheth the elder</italic><sup><xref rid="fn771">20</xref></sup> to teach us that Japheth, too, was a worthy person.</p>
<p>The Bible lists Shem, who was the youngest, before Japheth,<sup><xref rid="fn772">21</xref></sup> who was the elder,<sup><xref rid="fn773">22</xref></sup> out of respect to Shem. Proof that Japheth was the elder lies in Scripture&#x2019;s stating that Noah was five hundred years old when he begat his first son.<sup><xref rid="fn774">23</xref></sup> There is no room for argument, for it is clear that Noah had no children prior to reaching the age of five hundred. The flood came when Noah was six hundred years old.<sup><xref rid="fn775">24</xref></sup> Therefore if Shem was the eldest he would be one hundred and one years old when Noah and his sons came out of the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn776">25</xref></sup> However, Scripture tells us <italic>Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the flood</italic> (Gen. 11:10).<sup><xref rid="fn777">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that Shem was <italic>the elder brother of Japheth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn778">27</xref></sup> and it is for this reason that Shem is mentioned first. They explain that Shem was born a few days after Noah entered his five hundredth year, for even a day in a year is considered a year.<sup><xref rid="fn779">28</xref></sup> They say that Noah was born in Iyyar<sup><xref rid="fn780">29</xref></sup> and Shem in Sivan.<sup><xref rid="fn781">30</xref></sup> When the flood came Noah was five hundred and ninety-nine plus a number of days old.<sup><xref rid="fn782">31</xref></sup> Hence Shem was not a full ninety-nine years old when the flood started and was a hundred and one years plus a number of months old when his son Arpachshad was born. The meaning of <italic>two years after the flood</italic> (Gen. 11:10) therefore is to be interpreted as meaning that Arpachshad was born in the second year following the beginning of the flood. There are also those who maintain that the wife of Shem conceived five months after the start of the flood when the waters started decreasing.<sup><xref rid="fn783">32</xref></sup> Shem was thus one hundred years old when Arpachshad was born.<sup><xref rid="fn784">33</xref></sup> There are ten similar instances in the Book of Kings.<sup><xref rid="fn785">34</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn752"><sup>1</sup> Even though it is in the plural.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn753"><sup>2</sup> I.E. maintains that the brass sections of the giant statue dreamed of by Nebuchadnezzar allude to the Greek and Roman empires. See Daniel, Chap. 2 and Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s comment there on verse 39. I.E. identifies the Kittim with the Romans. (See his comments on Gen. 27:40). Since Kittim (the Romans) was the son of Javan (the Greeks) one symbol stands for both of them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn754"><sup>3</sup> Nebuchadnezzar dreamed of a statue whose head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay (Dan. 2:32, 34). Each of these metals symbolizes a kingdom. I.E. identifies the brass with the Greeks and the Romans, whom he considers one kingdom because they are one race.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn755"><sup>4</sup> The rabbis connect Nimrod with the word <italic>marad</italic> (to rebel). They tell us that Nimrod was so called because he caused people to rebel against God. See <italic>Erubin</italic> 53a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn756"><sup>5</sup> Cf. Rashi. He ensnared men with his words and caused them to rebel against God. See also Nahmanides: &#x201C;Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s words do not appear to be correct, for our rabbis know by tradition of Nimrod&#x2019;s wickedness.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn757"><sup>6</sup> Hence the use of the present form, <italic>it is said</italic>, that is, we say today, today being the age in which the Torah was written.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn758"><sup>7</sup> This comment is extremely difficult; Scripture nowhere says this. Indeed, in I.E.&#x2019;s alternate commentary to Genesis he writes, &#x201C;We do not know who was the father of Asshur.&#x201D; Some suggest that our text is corrupt, and on the basis of verse 22 emend it to: son of Shem (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn759"><sup>8</sup> There was no Babel before the dispersion. Thus Nimrod&#x2019;s rule over Babel had to be after the dispersion. Hence what Scripture relates about Asshur had to happen after the dispersion (Netter).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn760"><sup>9</sup> This is not found in our editions of the <italic>Seder Olam</italic>. Krinsky points out that there are many citations quoted in the early sources from this work that are missing in our edition of the <italic>Seder Olam</italic>. From the fact that Nimrod was king during the time of the dispersion we see that what Asshur did happened later.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn761"><sup>10</sup> Three cities are mentioned in the verse. Hence <italic>the same is the great city</italic> may be taken to refer to any one of them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn762"><sup>11</sup> Verse 14. The land itself was called the &#x201C;country of Pathros&#x201D; (Jer. 44:1), and its inhabitants called &#x201C;Pathrusim.&#x201D; The same applies to all the names in verses 13 and 14. Hence, Pathros is the name of a place. Similarly all the names in verses 13 and 14 refer to names of places, their inhabitants taking the name of the place wherein they lived.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn763"><sup>12</sup> The Hebrew <italic>mi-sham</italic> indicates a place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn764"><sup>13</sup> <italic>And Caphtorim</italic> is not to be connected to <italic>whence went forth the Philistines</italic>, but to <italic>And Mizraim begot</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn765"><sup>14</sup> An allusion to semen. The word <italic>yalad</italic> (begot) actually means to give birth and it is used when referring to the father (<italic>yalad</italic>) as well as the mother (<italic>yaledah</italic>) for the reason noted by I.E. (Netter).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn766"><sup>15</sup> The <italic>heh</italic> at the end of the name of a place is in place of an <italic>el</italic> (to) before it. Hence <italic>gerarah</italic> means <italic>el</italic> Gerar, to Gerar (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn767"><sup>16</sup> Gen. 10:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn768"><sup>17</sup> Gen. 10:31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn769"><sup>18</sup> I.E. identifies the children of Eber (<italic>ever</italic>) with the Hebrews (<italic>ivrim</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn770"><sup>19</sup> The text reads, Canaan was the father of Ham. The text is obviously corrupt. Ham was the father of Canaan. <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads, <italic>u-khena&#x2019;an aviv cham</italic>. The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>aviv</italic> was dropped in transmission. Thus <italic>aviv</italic> (his father) became <italic>avi</italic> (father of).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn771"><sup>20</sup> This is the literal meaning of <italic>achi yefet ha-gadol</italic>. From the text it is not clear whether Japheth or Shem was the elder; the grammatical construction is such that elder may apply to either. I.E. is trying to explain why Scripture tells us that Shem was Japheth&#x2019;s brother, but does not say the same about Ham.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn772"><sup>21</sup> The Bible lists Noah&#x2019;s sons as Shem, Ham and Japheth (Gen. 5:32; 6:10). According to I.E. the order of their birth was Japheth, Ham and Shem (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn773"><sup>22</sup> Ibn Ezra assumes that elder applies to Japheth (see note 20).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn774"><sup>23</sup> Gen. 5:32.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn775"><sup>24</sup> Gen. 7:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn776"><sup>25</sup> The flood lasted a year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn777"><sup>26</sup> Hence Shem reached the age of 100 two years after the flood and could not have been begotten by Noah when the latter was 500 years old. Therefore Shem was not Noah&#x2019;s eldest son. Japheth was. Thus the elder in verse 21 refers to Japheth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn778"><sup>27</sup> This interpretation explains <italic>achi yefet ha-gadol</italic> to mean the elder brother of Japheth. According to this interpretation Shem is the eldest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn779"><sup>28</sup> Thus 499 years plus a few days is considered 500 years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn780"><sup>29</sup> Noah was 499 years old in Iyyar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn781"><sup>30</sup> Shem was thus born in Noah&#x2019;s 500th year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn782"><sup>31</sup> In other words, Noah was in his 600th year when the flood began.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn783"><sup>32</sup> Thus Arpachshad was born two years after the flood, i.e., in the second year following the start of the flood.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn784"><sup>33</sup> Those who put forth this interpretation agree with the second interpretation. However, they are bothered by one problem. If Shem was 100 years plus some months when Arpachshad was born, why does Scripture say that Shem was 100 years old at the time? It should consider him to be 101 since part of a year is considered a year. They solve this problem by assuming that Shem&#x2019;s wife conceived in the ark five months after the start of the flood, i.e., in Tishri, and gave birth to Arpachshad the following Sivan, some days before Shem&#x2019;s 100th birthday. Shem, according to this interpretation, was born in Sivan. Scripture thus tells us that Shem was a hundred years old when Arpachshad was born, i.e., 99 years plus. The Bible is thus consistent in listing the years (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn785"><sup>34</sup> Where part of a year is considered a year. Krinsky lists the 10 places as: I Kings 15:1, 2, 9; 22:52; II Kings 1:17; 3:1; 8:16; 9:29; 13:10; 14:23; 15:1; 17:1.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 11</title>
<p>1. ONE LANGUAGE. When the word one in the feminine is in the absolute it is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic> beneath the <italic>alef</italic> (<italic>echat</italic>). However, when it is in the construct it is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>alef</italic> (<italic>achat</italic>). In my book on grammar I have explained why the <italic>dalet</italic> is missing in the feminine word for one.<sup><xref rid="fn786">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>A logical reading of Scripture indicates that the dispersion took place one hundred years after the flood, and that Peleg, which means divided, was so named because at the time of his birth the earth was divided (Gen. 10:25).<sup><xref rid="fn787">2</xref></sup> <italic>Peleg</italic> is similar to <italic>palga</italic>, the Aramaic word for half. <italic>Palge</italic> (rivers) in <italic>rivers of water</italic> (palge mayim) (Ps. 119:136) is identical. It refers to the branches into which the river divides. The names given to Ichabod (I Sam. 4:21)<sup><xref rid="fn788">3</xref></sup> and Immanuel,<sup><xref rid="fn789">4</xref></sup> who was the son of the prophet Isaiah (Is. 7:14), are similar.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the words of the <italic>Seder Olam</italic> are also correct, and we will rely upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn790">5</xref></sup> If this is so, then Abraham was one of the builders of the tower of Babel.<sup><xref rid="fn791">6</xref></sup> Do not be amazed at this,<sup><xref rid="fn792">7</xref></sup> for Noah and Shem were also there.<sup><xref rid="fn793">8</xref></sup> Indeed, Shem didn&#x2019;t die till Jacob was over fifty.<sup><xref rid="fn794">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>safah echat</italic> is one language. It appears to me that the one language was Hebrew. Proof of this are the names Adam, Eve, Cain, Seth and Peleg.<sup><xref rid="fn795">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND OF ONE SPEECH.] Unlike today, when there are words which not everybody speaking a given language will understand, the learned and the ignorant in those days spoke alike.</p>
<p><italic>Achadim</italic> (one) is the plural of <italic>echad</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn796">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>[2. AS THEY JOURNEYED EAST.] This verse shows that the mountains of Ararat are in the east.<sup><xref rid="fn797">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THAT THEY FOUND A PLAIN.] Its meaning is, they searched for a good place to build a state. Eventually they found this plain. The meaning of <italic>bikah</italic> (plain) is a flat area; it is the opposite of <italic>the rough places</italic> (Is. 40:4).<sup><xref rid="fn798">13</xref></sup> <italic>As the cattle go down into the valley</italic> (Ba-bikah) (Is. 63:14) is similar. <italic>Bikah</italic> possibly refers to a plain between mountains because a valley appears to be a split in the hills.<sup><xref rid="fn799">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. LET US MAKE BRICK. <italic>Nilbenah</italic> (let us make brick) comes from the same root as <italic>levenim</italic> (bricks). Even though <italic>levenim</italic> ends in a <italic>mem</italic>, it is a feminine word.<sup><xref rid="fn800">15</xref></sup> Such irregular feminine plural endings are also found in the words <italic>nashim</italic> (women) and <italic>pilagshim</italic> (concubines).</p>
<p>They baked the bricks until they became hard. A building made from such material is very strong and will not dissolve in water or fall apart when burned.</p>
<p>AND THEY HAD BRICK FOR STONE. In place of stone.</p>
<p>AND SLIME. In place of mortar. The meaning of <italic>chemar</italic> (slime) is the same as its Arabic cognate.<sup><xref rid="fn801">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The builders of the tower were not fools to believe that they could actually ascend the heavens. Neither were they afraid that God would bring another flood, for Noah and his children, to whom the Almighty swore never to bring another deluge, were there and being descendents of Noah and his children they were subservient to them.<sup><xref rid="fn802">17</xref></sup> Scripture reveals their intention and ultimate goal. They wanted to build a great city to dwell in, and a very tall tower to ensure their fame and glory and to serve as a sign indicating the place of the city to those outside it, such as shepherds. The tower, as long as it stood, would also perpetuate their names after their deaths. This is the meaning of <italic>and let us make us a name</italic>.</p>
<p>The word <italic>havah</italic> (come) means give;<sup><xref rid="fn803">18</xref></sup> its root is <italic>yod, heh, bet</italic>, as is clear from <italic>Cast thy burden</italic> (yehavecha) <italic>upon the Lord</italic> (Ps. 55:23). Because <italic>haveh</italic> is used often, it remains the same in both the feminine and the plural. Compare, <italic>come</italic> (havah),<sup><xref rid="fn804">19</xref></sup> <italic>let us deal wisely with them</italic> (Ex. 1:10), and <italic>Come</italic> (havah),<sup><xref rid="fn805">20</xref></sup> <italic>I pray thee, let me come in unto thee</italic> (Gen. 38:16).</p>
<p>Do not be surprised at the phrase <italic>with its top in heaven</italic>. Moses similarly said, <italic>the cities are great and fortified up to heaven</italic> (Deut. 1:28).<sup><xref rid="fn806">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The builders of the tower hoped that their city and tower would prevent them from dispersing, but this was not God&#x2019;s will. However, they did not know this.<sup><xref rid="fn807">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. [AND THE LORD CAME DOWN.] The Bible states this because all things on earth below are dependent upon the powers on high; all actions are arranged from heaven. Therefore God is referred to as the One <italic>Who rideth upon the heaven</italic> (Deut. 33:26) and the One who is <italic>enthroned in the heavens</italic> (Ps. 123:1).<sup><xref rid="fn808">23</xref></sup> The use of the term <italic>And the Lord came down</italic> is an anthropomorphism.</p>
<p>6. AND THE LORD SAID: BEHOLD, THEY ARE ONE PEOPLE. God said this to the angels. This took place before <italic>And the Lord came down</italic>. Its meaning is: And the Lord came down because he said, <italic>Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language</italic>, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn809">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>ONE PEOPLE. They have one religion. Different religions create jealousy and hatred among people. The same is true with regard to different languages. That is why the king of Persia and Media commanded <italic>that every man should bear rule in his own house, and speak according to the language of his people</italic> (Es. 1:22).<sup><xref rid="fn810">25</xref></sup> The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>hachillam</italic> (what they begin) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> because of the <italic>chet</italic> which follows it.<sup><xref rid="fn811">26</xref></sup> The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>hachiloti</italic> (I have begun) (Deut. 2:31) is similarly vocalized.</p>
<p>[WITHHOLDEN.] <italic>Yibbatzer</italic> means will be withholden. <italic>Betzurot</italic> (fortified) in <italic>fortified</italic> (betzurot) <italic>cities</italic> (Deut. 3:5)<sup><xref rid="fn812">27</xref></sup> is like it.</p>
<p>The meaning of our verse is: If I permit them to go on, they will think that they can do whatever they wish.</p>
<p>[THEY PURPOSE.] <italic>Yazemu</italic> (they purpose) has the same meaning as <italic>zamemu</italic> (devised).<sup><xref rid="fn813">28</xref></sup> However, they come from different roots.</p>
<p>7. COME, LET US GO DOWN. This is what God said to the angels.</p>
<p>[AND THERE CONFOUND THEIR LANGUAGE.] All the grammarians claim that <italic>ve-navelah</italic> (and confound) is a <italic>nifal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn814">29</xref></sup> They compare it to <italic>ve-navekah</italic> (and shall be made empty) in <italic>And the spirit of Egypt shall be made empty</italic> (ve-navekah) (Is. 19:3) and to <italic>navelah</italic> (fadeth) in <italic>The earth fainteth and fadeth away</italic> (navelah) (Is. 24:4). However, their interpretation is farfetched. Why would the Bible say: Come, let us go down and their language will be confounded, when their language was not confounded because God and the angels went down?<sup><xref rid="fn815">30</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-navelah</italic> can only be interpreted as an active verb.<sup><xref rid="fn816">31</xref></sup> Proof of this is Scripture&#x2019;s stating at the close of this incident, <italic>because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth</italic> (v. 9). The following is then the grammatical explanation of <italic>ve-navelah</italic>. It is a <italic>hifil</italic>. Scripture should have employed the entire root and read <italic>ve-navlilah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn817">32</xref></sup> or <italic>ve-navellah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn818">33</xref></sup> if one of the two <italic>lameds</italic> of its double root was swallowed. In the latter case it would have followed the paradigm of <italic>ve-nasebbah</italic> (let us bring back)<sup><xref rid="fn819">34</xref></sup> in <italic>and let us bring back</italic> (ve-nasebbah) <italic>the ark of our God</italic> (I Chron. 13:3). Our word reads <italic>ve-navelah</italic> because one of the <italic>lameds</italic> of the root was dropped without the remaining <italic>lamed</italic> receiving a <italic>dagesh forte</italic> to make up for it. The sages who translated the Torah into Greek correctly rendered <italic>ve-navelah</italic> as I will confound,<sup><xref rid="fn820">35</xref></sup> rather than we will confound.<sup><xref rid="fn821">36</xref></sup> If the above mentioned grammarians are correct, why did the sages omit the <italic>nun</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn822">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that the people building the tower started hating each other and each one invented a new language. Others say that the One who grants knowledge to man caused them to forget their language. In my opinion, they were first scattered. After their dispersion Nimrod ruled over Babel and other kings arose. With the passage of time and the death of the first generation to be scattered, the original language was forgotten.<sup><xref rid="fn823">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>God scattered the people for their own benefit. He similarly said, <italic>and replenish the earth</italic> (Gen. 1:28).<sup><xref rid="fn824">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. [AND THEY LEFT OFF TO BUILD THE CITY.] Its meaning is: they left off from completing the city because part of the city and the tower had by this time been built. This is so for Scripture reads, <italic>the city and the tower, which the children of men builded</italic> (v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn825">40</xref></sup> It is also possible that the meaning of <italic>which the children of men builded</italic> is: which the children of men intended to build.<sup><xref rid="fn826">41</xref></sup> <italic>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel</italic> (Josh. 24:9)<sup><xref rid="fn827">42</xref></sup> is similar. The first of these interpretations appeals to me.</p>
<p>9. BABEL. <italic>Bavel</italic> (Babel) is made up of the words <italic>ba</italic> (came) and <italic>bel</italic> (confusion),<sup><xref rid="fn828">43</xref></sup> with the <italic>alef</italic> missing. <italic>Bagad</italic><sup><xref rid="fn829">44</xref></sup> (Fortune is come) (Gen. 30:11) and <italic>Bamah</italic> (high place) (Ezek. 20:29)<sup><xref rid="fn830">45</xref></sup> are similar.</p>
<p>10. [TWO YEARS AFTER THE FLOOD.] I have already explained the meaning of this in the verse <italic>the elder brother of Japheth</italic> (Gen. 10:21).<sup><xref rid="fn831">46</xref></sup> It is possible that Peleg was given this name on the day of his death, the reason for this being as follows: Shem lived for five hundred years following the flood, Arpachshad lived for four hundred and thirty-eight years, his son Shelah lived four hundred and thirty-three years, and his son Eber four hundred and sixty-four years. Now Peleg lived two hundred and thirty-nine years. Thus Peleg&#x2019;s life span was half that of his ancestors. Reu, the son of Peleg, similarly lived to the same age as Peleg. Reu&#x2019;s son Serug also lived about the same number of years as Peleg and Reu.<sup><xref rid="fn832">47</xref></sup> This, then, is the general rule: no one after Peleg, aside from his son, ever lived to be two hundred and thirty-nine years.<sup><xref rid="fn833">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that those who built the tower numbered seventy and hence were divided into seventy languages upon their dispersion.<sup><xref rid="fn834">49</xref></sup> If you count the sons of Shem, Japheth and Ham you will find them to be seventy.<sup><xref rid="fn835">50</xref></sup> However, they are incorrect. First of all <italic>Pathrusim</italic> and <italic>Casluhim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn836">51</xref></sup> are not the names of two individuals.<sup><xref rid="fn837">52</xref></sup> Furthermore, they neglect to include in the seventy Noah and his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn838">53</xref></sup> According to the <italic>Seder Olam</italic> the builders of the tower numbered thousands and ten thousands.<sup><xref rid="fn839">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>[26. AND BEGOT ABRAM.] Abraham was born in a place called Ur of the Chaldees. <italic>Therefore glorify ye the Lord in the regions of light</italic> (be-urim) (Is. 24:15)<sup><xref rid="fn840">55</xref></sup> is like it. It appears to me that at the time of Abraham&#x2019;s birth Ur of the Chaldees had another name since the Chaldees are descended from Nahor, the brother of Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn841">56</xref></sup> and that in writing the Torah Moses used the name in vogue in his time when he cited Ur of the Chaldees. Proof that Abraham was born in Ur of the Chaldees can be found in the fact that Haran died there and Scripture says, <italic>And Haran died&#x2026;in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees</italic> (v. 20).<sup><xref rid="fn842">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also possible that the Chaldees made a flame (altar) and the place thereof was called Ur (the flame, altar) of the Chaldees. In this instance Ur has the meaning of fire, as in <italic>whose fire</italic> (ur) <italic>is in Zion</italic> (Is. 31:9).<sup><xref rid="fn843">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>[28. IN THE PRESENCE OF.] In front of his father; i.e., Terah witnessed his death. <italic>In the presence of Aaron their father</italic> (Num. 3:4)<sup><xref rid="fn844">59</xref></sup> is analogous.</p>
<p>[29. AND THE NAME OF NAHOR&#x2019;S WIFE, MILCAH.] The Bible gives the name of Nahor&#x2019;s wife in order to let us know the pedigree of Rebekah, Rachel and Leah.<sup><xref rid="fn845">60</xref></sup> Our sages, of blessed memory, identified Iscah with Sarah.<sup><xref rid="fn846">61</xref></sup> If this is a tradition we will accept it.<sup><xref rid="fn847">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>Those who say that Abraham rather than Sarah was sterile are saying the opposite of what Scripture says.<sup><xref rid="fn848">63</xref></sup> Additional proof that they are wrong is the fact that Abraham sired Ishmael and had children with Keturah.</p>
<p>I do not find the explanation of those who say that Sarah was Abraham&#x2019;s sister to be acceptable.<sup><xref rid="fn849">64</xref></sup> If Sarah was really Abraham&#x2019;s sister, Scripture would have stated,<sup><xref rid="fn850">65</xref></sup> And Terah took Abram his son, and Sarai his daughter, the wife of Abram his son. Similarly if Sarah was the sister of Lot<sup><xref rid="fn851">66</xref></sup> the Bible would have stated, &#x201C;and Sarai the daughter of his son,&#x201D; as it does in the case of Lot.<sup><xref rid="fn852">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that Terah&#x2019;s son Nahor left for Haran before his father. On the other hand he may have left for Haran after his father went there.<sup><xref rid="fn853">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that the portion containing the command, <italic>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father&#x2019;s house, unto the land that I will show thee</italic> (Gen. 12:1), was conveyed to Abraham before what is recorded in the verse reading, <italic>And Terah took Abram&#x2026;Lot&#x2026;Sarai&#x2026;to go into the land of Canaan</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn854">69</xref></sup> Similarly elsewhere the Pentateuch states, <italic>And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt</italic> (Num. 1:1); and then, <italic>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year</italic> (Ex. 40:17).<sup><xref rid="fn855">70</xref></sup> Proof of the above<sup><xref rid="fn856">71</xref></sup> is found in <italic>And they went forth&#x2026;to go into the land of Canaan</italic> (v. 31). When Terah came to Haran, the place found favor in his eyes. He settled there and eventually died there. The general rule thus is that the Bible does not always list events in chronological order.</p>
<ftnote id="fn786"><sup>1</sup> The masculine word for one is <italic>echad</italic>; hence the feminine should be <italic>achdat</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn787"><sup>2</sup> People were named for events that occurred at the time of their birth. A careful computation of the years from the flood to the birth of Peleg comes to about 100 years. Arpachshad was born two years after the flood; 35 years later he had Shelah. Shelah was 30 when he begot Eber; Eber was 34 when he begot Peleg. Therefore the dispersion took place about 100 years after the flood (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn788"><sup>3</sup> <italic>And she named the child Ichabod, saying: &#x2018;The glory is departed from Israel,&#x2019; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband</italic> (I Sam. 4:21).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn789"><sup>4</sup> <italic>Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: behold, the young woman shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel (God is with us)</italic> (Is. 7:14).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn790"><sup>5</sup> To the effect that the dispersion took place at the end of Peleg&#x2019;s life. <italic>Seder Olam</italic>, Chap. 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn791"><sup>6</sup> According to the <italic>Seder Olam</italic>, Abraham was 48 years old when the dispersion took place (Chap. 1). Abraham was a descendant of Peleg. If Peleg was born at the time of the dispersion, this would of course preclude Abraham&#x2019;s being at the tower of Babel. However, if Peleg was so named because the dispersion took place at the end of his life, which consisted of 239 years (v. 18 and 19), then by computing the years listed in verses 18-26 we conclude that Abraham was 48 years old at the time of the building of the tower of Babel. The computation is as follows: Peleg was born 239 years before the dispersion since the latter took place at the end of his life. Peleg was 30 when he begat Reu. Reu was 32 when he begat Serug. Serug was 30 when he begat Nahor. Nahor was 29 when he begat Terah. Terah was 70 when he begat Abraham. We thus have a total of 191. Two hundred thirty-nine minus 191 is 48. Hence Abraham was 48 at the time of the dispersion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn792"><sup>7</sup> That is, that Abraham would participate in such a venture. Noah and Shem also took part in it. It is I.E.&#x2019;s belief that the builders of the Tower did not commit any sin. I.E. will elaborate on this later on in his commentary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn793"><sup>8</sup> They, too, were saintly men and yet participated in the building of the tower.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn794"><sup>9</sup> According to the <italic>Seder Olam</italic>, Chap. 1, Jacob studied Torah with Shem for 50 years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn795"><sup>10</sup> All of these are derived from Hebrew roots.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn796"><sup>11</sup> Sometimes the word <italic>achadim</italic> has the meaning of few. Cf. Gen. 27:44, <italic>yamim achadim</italic> (a few days). I.E. emphasizes that here it means one.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn797"><sup>12</sup> The verse literally reads: as they journeyed from the east, i.e., from Mt. Ararat or its vicinity. This shows that Mt. Ararat is in the east (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn798"><sup>13</sup> Is. 40:4 reads, <italic>And the rough places (shall be made) a plain</italic> (le-vikah). We thus see that <italic>bikah</italic> is the opposite of rough places. Hence it must refer to a level area.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn799"><sup>14</sup> <italic>Baka</italic> means split. Thus <italic>bikah</italic> (valley) means a split in the mountains.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn800"><sup>15</sup> A feminine plural ends in a <italic>vav, tav</italic>. The singular of <italic>levenim</italic> is <italic>levenah</italic>, hence the feminine <italic>va-tehi</italic> in conjunction with <italic>ha-levenah</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn803"><sup>18</sup> The root <italic>yod, heh, bet</italic> means give. Cf. Rashi on Gen. 38:16: &#x201C;The expression <italic>havah</italic> denotes preparation except where it is to be rendered giving, and even in those instances where <italic>havah</italic> denotes preparation it is close in meaning to giving.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn809"><sup>24</sup> It is unlikely that God would first go down and then say, <italic>Come, let us go down</italic> (Filwarg). In other words, verse 5 belongs after verse 7 (Cherez).

I.E. probably intended to cite Num. 9:1, rather than Ex. 40:17. The former literally reads: In the second year&#x2026;in the first month. He apparently cited from memory and misquoted. Perhaps he wanted to note that Num. 7 records the setting up of the Tabernacle and the sacrifices then offered by the princes of the tribes. However, Ex. 40:17 tells us that the tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month in the second year following the Exodus. We thus see that what is described in Num. 1 occurred after what is described in Num. 7 (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn856"><sup>71</sup> That <italic>Get thee out</italic>, etc., was told to Abraham before <italic>And Terah took</italic>, etc. If God had not yet told Abraham to go to Canaan, why did Terah take his family there?

<h1>LEKH LEKHA</h1>
<p>1. GET THEE OUT. God commanded Abraham while he was yet in Ur of the Chaldees to leave his country, his place of birth and also his father&#x2019;s house. The reason God told Abraham to leave his father&#x2019;s house is that the Lord knew that, although he set out for Canaan, Terah would settle in Haran.<sup><xref rid="fn857">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Terah did not die until sixty years after Abraham left his father&#x2019;s house in Haran.<sup><xref rid="fn858">2</xref></sup> However, the Bible does not tell us how old he was when he left Ur of the Chaldees.<sup><xref rid="fn859">3</xref></sup></p>

Others say that <italic>the souls that they had gotten in Haran</italic> refers to the people to whom Abraham showed the truth, to worship God.<sup><xref rid="fn865">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND THEY WENT FORTH TO GO.] To the place that God had told them to go.</p>
<p>[6. SHECHEM.] Shechem<sup><xref rid="fn866">10</xref></sup> was the name used by Moses because it was the name by which the city was known in his time. Shechem was not yet born in Abraham&#x2019;s day.<sup><xref rid="fn867">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>TEREBINTH. <italic>Elon</italic> (terebinth) has the same meaning as <italic>elah</italic> (terebinth).<sup><xref rid="fn868">12</xref></sup> They are trees. Others say that <italic>elon</italic> means a field,<sup><xref rid="fn869">13</xref></sup> as in <italic>unto El paran</italic> (Gen. 14:6).</p>
<p>MOREH. Some identify him with Mamre, the confederate of Abraham. However, it is possible they are not to be so identified and Elon Moreh is the name of a place.</p>
<p>AND THE CANAANITE WAS THEN IN THE LAND. It is possible that the Canaanites seized the land of Canaan from some other tribe at that time.<sup><xref rid="fn870">14</xref></sup> Should this interpretation be incorrect, then there is a secret meaning to the text. Let the one who understands it remain silent.<sup><xref rid="fn871">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND THE LORD APPEARED. In a prophetic vision. <italic>Va-yera</italic> (appeared) is a <italic>nifal</italic>. It is vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic> to make up for the <italic>dagesh</italic> which should have been placed in the <italic>resh</italic> as compensation for the missing <italic>nun</italic> of the <italic>nifal</italic> conjugation.<sup><xref rid="fn872">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHO APPEARED UNTO HIM. <italic>Nireh</italic> is a participle belonging to the above-mentioned conjugation (<italic>nifal</italic>). <italic>Na&#x2019;aseh</italic> (prepared) in <italic>Now that which was prepared</italic> (na&#x2019;aseh) <italic>for one day</italic> (Neh. 5:18) is similar.</p>
<p>8. AND HE REMOVED. <italic>Va-yatek</italic> (and he removed) is a transitive verb, in the <italic>hifil</italic>. However, <italic>ve-yetak</italic> (removed) in <italic>Or shall the rock be removed</italic> (ve-yetak) <italic>out of its place</italic> (Job 18:4) is intransitive. The object of <italic>And he removed</italic> is <italic>his tent</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn873">17</xref></sup> <italic>His tent</italic> is also the object of <italic>he pitched</italic>. The meaning (of <italic>va-yatek</italic>) is: he caused to move. <italic>Va-yet</italic> (he pitched) is vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic> to make up for the missing <italic>nun</italic> which is the first root letter of <italic>va-yet</italic> (he pitched).<sup><xref rid="fn874">18</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-yez</italic> (is dashed) in <italic>And their lifeblood is dashed</italic> (ve-yez) (Is. 63:3) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn875">19</xref></sup> Both are transitive verbs.<sup><xref rid="fn876">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>[ON THE WEST.] The word <italic>mi-yam</italic> means on the west. <italic>Yam</italic> (sea) means west because the great Spanish Sea (<italic>yam</italic>, i.e., the Mediterranean) is the western border of the land of Israel. The latter sea is not the Atlantic, the Atlantic being far from the aforementioned country.</p>
<p>Abraham journeyed from east of Beth-el westward until Ai was east of his camp.<sup><xref rid="fn877">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND CALLED UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD.] This means he prayed there. It may also mean that he called upon men to worship the Lord.</p>
<p>9. TOWARD THE SOUTH. <italic>Negev</italic> means south and it means the same in Aramaic.<sup><xref rid="fn878">22</xref></sup> <italic>Negev</italic> in Aramaic means dry as we see from Onkelos, who renders <italic>the waters were dried up</italic> (Gen. 8:13) as <italic>negivu mayya</italic>. The south is called <italic>Negev</italic> (dry) because it is hot there, and the heat parches the land. This is the way <italic>for that thou hast set me in the Southlands</italic> (eretz ha-negev)<sup><xref rid="fn879">23</xref></sup> <italic>give me therefore springs of water</italic> (Josh. 15:19) should be understood.</p>
<p>10. AND THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND. In the land of Canaan.</p>
<p>11. WHEN HE WAS COME NEAR. When he caused his camp to come near.<sup><xref rid="fn880">24</xref></sup> On the other hand, <italic>hikriv</italic> (when he came near) may be intransitive.<sup><xref rid="fn881">25</xref></sup> These two interpretations are possible because there are verbs which can be transitive and intransitive.</p>
<p>[NOW.] <italic>Na</italic> means now. <italic>Na</italic> in <italic>Behold now</italic> (na), <italic>I am old</italic> (Gen. 27:2), and <italic>Woe</italic> (na) <italic>unto us</italic> (Lam. 5:16)<sup><xref rid="fn882">26</xref></sup> are similar. The reverse of Hebrew is the case in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn883">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BEHOLD NOW, I KNOW.] There were women as beautiful as Sarah in her native country,<sup><xref rid="fn884">28</xref></sup> but in Egypt and the southern land there was none as beautiful. The reason for this is that people&#x2019;s appearance is shaped by the climate.<sup><xref rid="fn885">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BUT THEE THEY WILL KEEP ALIVE.] They will provide for all of your needs. Abraham said this because those were days of famine.</p>
<p>13. [THOU ART MY SISTER.] <italic>Achoti</italic> (my sister) is penultimately accented<sup><xref rid="fn886">30</xref></sup> because the word which follows it, <italic>at</italic> (thou), is accented on the first letter. <italic>Kara laylah</italic> (he called night) (Gen. 1:5) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn887">31</xref></sup> The preceding is a general rule in Hebrew grammar.<sup><xref rid="fn888">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>at</italic> (thou) receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> to make up for the missing <italic>nun</italic>, for the word <italic>at</italic> (thou) comes from the same root as <italic>ani</italic> (I).<sup><xref rid="fn889">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>BECAUSE OF THEE. <italic>Bi-glalekh</italic> (because of thee) and <italic>ba-avurekh</italic> (for thy sake) always have a <italic>bet</italic> prefixed to each.<sup><xref rid="fn890">34</xref></sup> The poet who omits this <italic>bet</italic> errs.<sup><xref rid="fn891">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH ME.] They will give me gifts and presents. And so it is written, <italic>And he dealt well with Abram for her sake; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servant, and she-asses, and camels</italic> (v. 16).</p>
<p>[15.] AND PRAISED. The <italic>dagesh</italic> which should have been placed in the first <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>va-yehalelu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn892">36</xref></sup> (and praised) is omitted in order to simplify the word&#x2019;s pronunciation.<sup><xref rid="fn893">37</xref></sup> <italic>Va-etpalelah</italic> (and I prayed) (Dan. 9:4) is identical.<sup><xref rid="fn894">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE WOMAN WAS TAKEN. <italic>Va-tukkach</italic> (and she was taken) is a <italic>hofal</italic>. This is so even though it is not found in the <italic>hifil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn895">39</xref></sup> <italic>Va-tushlekhi</italic> (but thou wast cast out) (Ezek. 16:5) is an example of a <italic>hofal</italic> wherein the entire root is present.<sup><xref rid="fn896">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND THE LORD PLAGUED PHARAOH&#x2026;BECAUSE OF SARAI. The term <italic>al devar</italic> means because. <italic>Al devar</italic>&#x2019;s meaning is <italic>al zeh ha-davar</italic> (on account of this thing).<sup><xref rid="fn897">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>[18. THOU TELL ME.] The root of <italic>higgadta</italic> (thou tell) is <italic>nun, gimel, dalet</italic>.</p>
<p>[19. SO I TOOK HER TO BE MY WIFE.] This indicates that Pharaoh took her to be his wife, to sleep with her. God brought plagues upon him to prevent him from touching her. The Lord sent these plagues to protect the wife of the one whom he loved. The plagues were so severe that Pharaoh was unable to touch Sarah. The following is analogous: <italic>When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies&#x2026;and seest among the captives a woman of goodly form, and thou hast a desire unto her, and takest her to thee to wife</italic>. The Bible then says, <italic>then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head</italic>. It then concludes, <italic>and after that thou mayest go in unto her</italic> (Deut. 21:10-13).<sup><xref rid="fn898">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND GO THY WAY.] The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>va-lekh</italic> (and go thy way) is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn899">43</xref></sup> because it is prefixed to a word with a cantillical note that ends a phrase. The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>va-yayin</italic> (and wine) in <italic>bread and wine</italic> (Gen. 14:18) is similar.</p>
<p>20. AND THEY BROUGHT HIM ON THE WAY. They honorably escorted him.<sup><xref rid="fn900">44</xref></sup> <italic>And Abraham went with them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn901">45</xref></sup> <italic>to bring them on the way</italic> (Gen. 18:16) is similar.</p>
<p>[AND PHARAOH GAVE MEN CHARGE CONCERNING HIM.] It appears to me that this clause indicates that Pharaoh issued a command to his people concerning Abraham. He warned and charged that it be announced that no one harm Abraham and his wife.<sup><xref rid="fn902">46</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn857"><sup>1</sup> Ibn Ezra implies that had Terah gone to Canaan then God would not have commanded Abraham to separate himself from his father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn858"><sup>2</sup> Terah was 70 when Abraham was born (Gen. 11:26). Abraham was 75 when he left Haran (Gen. 12:4). Terah was thus 145 when Abraham left him. Terah lived 205 years (Gen. 11:32). Hence Terah lived another 60 years after Abraham left Haran. Thus the command &#x201C;Get thee out&#x201D; could not have come after Terah&#x2019;s death, as a cursory reading of Scripture would indicate (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn859"><sup>3</sup> <italic>He</italic> refers to Abraham (Cherez). The Bible tells us how old Abraham was when he left Haran (v. 4) but does not tell us his age when he left Ur of the Chaldees. Had the Bible told us this, we would then know how long Abraham dwelt in Haran. Weiser explains <italic>he</italic> as referring to Terah. I.E.&#x2019;s point remains the same.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn860"><sup>4</sup> He told him which land He had in mind.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn861"><sup>5</sup> The meaning of the phrase is: the land which I will show thee will I give to thee (Cohen). Abraham went from place to place. When he came to Canaan God then told him, this is the land that I have chosen for you (Cherez). According to this interpretation God did not at this point reveal to Abraham his ultimate destination.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn862"><sup>6</sup> The term used by Ibn Ezra is <italic>mikneh</italic>, which includes cows, sheep, asses and camels.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn863"><sup>7</sup> <italic>Had gotten</italic> thus means: were born to them (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn864"><sup>8</sup> Previously Ibn Ezra explained <italic>gotten</italic> as meaning born. He now explains it to mean bought (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn865"><sup>9</sup> <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 39:14. Cf. Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn866"><sup>10</sup> Like Ur of the Chaldees.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn867"><sup>11</sup> According to Ibn Ezra, Shechem was named after Shechem son of Hamor. Cf. Gen. 34:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn868"><sup>12</sup> Cf. Is. 6:13 and Hos. 4:13. <italic>Elon</italic> is a type of <italic>elah</italic> (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn869"><sup>13</sup> That is, the field of Paran, as seen from Gen. 14:6. See also Onkelos on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn870"><sup>14</sup> The Canaanite was then, not before this, in the land. Cf. Rashi: &#x201C;The Canaanite was then engaged in conquering the land of Israel from the seed of Shem.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn871"><sup>15</sup> The verse implies that the Canaanite was in the land then but not now (Krinsky). Since the Canaanite was in the land during the days of Moses, this clause would appear to be post-Mosaic.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn872"><sup>16</sup> The <italic>nun</italic> of the <italic>nifal</italic> is omitted in the imperfect. Hence all imperfect <italic>nifal</italic> forms have a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the first letter of the root, i.e., <italic>yikkatev</italic>, rather than <italic>yikhatev</italic>. However, the <italic>resh</italic> of <italic>ra&#x2019;ah</italic> (saw), from the root <italic>resh, alef, heh</italic>, cannot receive a <italic>dagesh</italic>. Hence it is preceded by a <italic>tzere</italic>, rather than a <italic>chirik</italic>. <italic>Va-yera</italic> is an imperfect changed into a perfect by the <italic>vav</italic> conversive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn873"><sup>17</sup> Since <italic>va-yatek</italic> (and he removed) is transitive, it does not mean he removed himself but he removed his tent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn874"><sup>18</sup> The root of <italic>va-yet</italic> (pitched) is <italic>nun, tet, ayin</italic>. We would have expected the word to be vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>. Compare, <italic>va-yitteh</italic>, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn875"><sup>19</sup> The root of <italic>ve-yez</italic> (is dashed) is <italic>nun, zayin, heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn876"><sup>20</sup> <italic>Va-yatek</italic> and <italic>va-yet</italic> (Krinsky) or <italic>va-yet</italic> and <italic>ve-yez</italic> (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn877"><sup>21</sup> I.E. assumes that Abraham journeyed from east to west. He crossed over Ai but stopped before Beth-el. Thus Beth-el was on his west and Ai on his east. However, the interpretation presents a problem. Shechem lies north of Beth-el and Ai. Thus Abraham traveled south not west.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn878"><sup>22</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>negev</italic> is an Aramaic word.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn879"><sup>23</sup> That is, <italic>eretz ha-negev</italic> means a dry land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn880"><sup>24</sup> I.E. takes <italic>hikriv</italic> (he came near) to be a transitive verb, its meaning being: when he caused to come near, i.e., when he caused his camp to come near.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn881"><sup>25</sup> In this case <italic>hikriv</italic> is to be rendered, when he came near.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn882"><sup>26</sup> According to Ibn Ezra this should be rendered: woe now unto us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn883"><sup>27</sup> The Arabic word for now is <italic>malan</italic>, rather than <italic>malna</italic> (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn884"><sup>28</sup> Scripture emphasizes <italic>now I know</italic>, i.e., before I didn&#x2019;t. This is so because in the country from which she came there were other beautiful women. In Egypt Sarah&#x2019;s beauty stood out.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn885"><sup>29</sup> According to I.E. the climate of southern countries is not conducive to the development of beautiful women.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn886"><sup>30</sup> Ordinarily the accent would be placed on the last syllable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn887"><sup>31</sup> Ordinarily the accent would be placed on the last syllable of <italic>kara</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn888"><sup>32</sup> When the cantillical notes connect two words and the second word is penultimately accented, so is the first word even though it is ordinarily ultimately accented.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn889"><sup>33</sup> Hence thou in the feminine should be <italic>ant</italic>, in the masculine <italic>antah</italic> (Netter). The printed editions read, the word <italic>attah</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>ani. Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads, the word <italic>at</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>ani</italic>. Since I.E. deals with the feminine, the reading of Vat. Ebr. 38 is to be preferred.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn890"><sup>34</sup> The forms <italic>gelalekh</italic> (<italic>gelal</italic>) or <italic>avurekh</italic> (<italic>avur</italic>) are not used.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn891"><sup>35</sup> Literally, turns aside from discretion. Ibn Ezra uses a term from Prov. 11:22, <italic>As a ring of gold in a swine&#x2019;s snout, So is a fair woman that turneth aside from discretion</italic>. He implies that the poet who deliberately misuses language is like a fair woman who turns aside from discretion. The reference might be to Rabbi Simon ben Isaac of Mayence, an eleventh century liturgical poet who wrote, <italic>avur ki fanah yom</italic> (now that the day has declined). He should have written <italic>ba-avur fanah yom</italic>. Rabbi Simon&#x2019;s composition is found in the concluding service of the Day of Atonement (Cherez). It should be noted that I.E. employs a pun. <italic>Shar</italic> is a poet. <italic>Sar</italic> means tumeth aside, hence <italic>ha-shar sar</italic>, the poet turneth aside.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn892"><sup>36</sup> <italic>Va-yehalelu</italic> (they praised) is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>. According to the rules of Hebrew grammar a <italic>dagesh</italic> is placed in the middle letter of the root in a verb conjugated in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn893"><sup>37</sup> <italic>Va-yehalelu</italic> is, as noted above, a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> and should thus have a <italic>dagesh</italic> in its middle root letter. However, a <italic>dagesh</italic> would double the <italic>lamed</italic>. Thus the word would read as if there were three <italic>lameds</italic> in it, viz., <italic>va-yehallelu</italic>, and complicate its pronunciation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn894"><sup>38</sup> <italic>Va-etpalelah</italic> is in the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic>. Here, too, a <italic>dagesh</italic> is placed in the middle root letter. However, it is omitted in our word for the reasons indicated in note 37.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn895"><sup>39</sup> <italic>Hofal</italic> is the passive form of <italic>hifil</italic>. If a word is found in the passive voice we would expect it to be found in the active voice as well. However, this is not the case with the root <italic>lamed, kof, chet</italic>, which is found in the <italic>hofal</italic> and not in the <italic>hifil</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn896"><sup>40</sup> In the root <italic>lamed, kof, chet</italic> (take) the <italic>lamed</italic> drops out in the imperfect. In <italic>shin, lamed, caf</italic> (cast) no letter drops out. It belongs to those verbs classified as <italic>shelemim</italic>, whole roots.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn897"><sup>41</sup> Hence <italic>al devar</italic> means because. According to the Midrash <italic>al devar Sarai</italic> means according to Sarah&#x2019;s word. (Cf. Rashi.) Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn898"><sup>42</sup> Ibn Ezra argues that wife here has the meaning of a sexual partner as it does in Deuteronomy. For it first says, &#x201C;and takest her to thee to wife&#x201D; and concludes with &#x201C;thou mayest go into her&#x201D; (Weiser). Krinsky and Cherez argue that I.E. was disturbed by the term <italic>took her</italic> which implies that Pharaoh had intercourse with Sarah. Hence I.E. points out that Scripture is merely relating Pharaoh&#x2019;s intentions; i.e., he <italic>took her</italic> to be his wife but God intervened before he had a chance to sleep with her. I.E. quotes Deut 21:10 where &#x201C;and thou takest her to wife&#x201D; similarly does not mean &#x201C;and sleeps with her&#x201D; because one cannot have intercourse with a captive woman until certain procedures described in Deut. 21 are first undergone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn899"><sup>43</sup> The <italic>vav</italic> would ordinarily be vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn900"><sup>44</sup> <italic>Va-yeshallechu oto</italic> (and they brought him on the way) might conceivably be translated as they sent him away; i.e., they expelled him, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn901"><sup>45</sup> Abraham obviously did not expel the angels, he accompanied them out of respect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn902"><sup>46</sup> In other words, <italic>gave men charge concerning him</italic> is not to be connected to <italic>and they brought him on the way</italic>. <italic>Gave men charge</italic>, etc., means he issued commands that Abraham not be molested; <italic>and they brought him on the way</italic> means they escorted him. I.E. interprets this verse thus because he believes that the word <italic>tzivvah</italic> (commanded, charged) with the preposition <italic>al</italic> (on) involves a prohibition. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 2:16 (Filwarg).</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 13</title>
<p>[1. AND ABRAM WENT UP.] I have grammatically explained the word <italic>va-ya&#x2019;al</italic> (and went up) in my <italic>Book of Foundation</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn903">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND ABRAM WAS VERY RICH. <italic>Ve-avram kaved me&#x2019;od</italic> (literally, Abram was very heavy) means that Abraham had great wealth. Whoever is laden with riches moves heavily (with difficulty).<sup><xref rid="fn904">2</xref></sup> Don&#x2019;t you see that the Hebrew word for honor (<italic>kavod</italic>) comes from the same root as the word for heavy (<italic>koved</italic>) in <italic>A stone is heavy</italic> (koved even) (Prov. 27:3). Conversely, the word for shame (<italic>kalon</italic>) comes from the same root as the word for light (<italic>kal</italic>). Compare, <italic>light of foot</italic> (kal beraglav) (II Sam. 2:18).<sup><xref rid="fn905">3</xref></sup> Abraham possessed herds of cattle and a large amount of gold and silver.<sup><xref rid="fn906">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. ON HIS JOURNEYS. Abraham made many stops on his journey from the south to Beth-el which is in the north. He came <italic>unto the place of the altar</italic> (v. 4) to give thanks to God for ensuring his safe return.</p>
<p>5. AND TENTS. I believe that <italic>ohel</italic> (tent), in the singular, follows the paradigm of <italic>kodesh</italic> (holy). It is always found in Scripture following this form.<sup><xref rid="fn907">5</xref></sup> In the plural, its <italic>alef</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>chataf kamatz</italic>, as in the verse <italic>ye shall dwell in tents</italic> (Jer. 35:7).<sup><xref rid="fn908">6</xref></sup> It is vocalized like the word <italic>kodashim</italic> in <italic>he shall not eat of the holy things</italic> (ba-kodashim) (Lev. 22:4). However, when the <italic>alef</italic> of the Hebrew plural for tents is vocalized with a <italic>cholam</italic>, the singular is vocalized like <italic>goral</italic> (lot).<sup><xref rid="fn909">7</xref></sup> The latter is so even though this form for tent (<italic>ohal</italic>) is not found in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn910">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. TOGETHER. <italic>Yachdav</italic> (together) can refer to two (as in our verse) or to many, as in <italic>And all the people answered together</italic> (yachdav) (Ex. 19:8). This word does not follow the rules of Hebrew grammar.<sup><xref rid="fn911">9</xref></sup> <italic>Yachdav</italic> is not synonymous with <italic>yachad</italic> (together). <italic>Yachdav</italic> means acting like one person.<sup><xref rid="fn912">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>[7. AND THE CANAANITE AND THE PERIZZITE DWELT THEN IN THE LAND.] This is to be understood as its counterpart (Gen. 12:6).<sup><xref rid="fn913">11</xref></sup> It is possible that Perizzi was a son of Canaan and was included in the list of Canaan&#x2019;s sons under a different name. He, like the prophet Samuel&#x2019;s son<sup><xref rid="fn914">12</xref></sup> and grandfather,<sup><xref rid="fn915">13</xref></sup> had two names.<sup><xref rid="fn916">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. THEN I WILL GO TO THE RIGHT. <italic>Ve-e&#x2019;minah</italic> (I will go to the right) comes from the same root as <italic>yamin</italic> (right).</p>
<p>[THEN I WILL GO TO THE LEFT.] The <italic>alef</italic> of the noun <italic>semol</italic> (left) is enunciated in the verb <italic>ve-asme&#x2019;ilah</italic> (then I will go to the left). Now this <italic>alef</italic> is missing in the word <italic>hasmili</italic> (direct thyself to the left) in <italic>Go thee one way to the right, or direct thyself to the left</italic> (Ezek. 21:21). Thus, we cannnot determine whether the <italic>alef</italic> is part of the root of <italic>semol</italic> or not.</p>
<p>10. THE PLAIN OF THE JORDAN. <italic>Kikkar</italic> (plain) means an area with plants. The <italic>caf</italic> is doubled in <italic>kikkar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn917">15</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is possible that one <italic>caf</italic> has been dropped in <italic>kar nirchav</italic> (large pastures) (Is. 30:23).<sup><xref rid="fn918">16</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>bat</italic> (apple of) in <italic>bat ayin</italic> (the apple of the eye) (Ps. 17:8) is short for <italic>bavat</italic> in <italic>bavat eno</italic> (the apple of his eye) (Zechariah 2:12).<sup><xref rid="fn919">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>WELL WATERED. <italic>Mashkeh</italic> (watered) is masculine; <italic>khullah</italic> (well) is feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn920">18</xref></sup> <italic>A fire not blown by man shall consume him</italic> (Job 20:26)<sup><xref rid="fn921">19</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>BEFORE THE LORD DESTROYED SODOM AND GOMORRAH. <italic>Shachet</italic> (destroyed) is an infinitive in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>. The meaning of <italic>li-fene shachet</italic> is: before the Lord destroyed.</p>
<p>11. AND LOT JOURNEYED. From the east,<sup><xref rid="fn922">20</xref></sup> for Sodom is west of Beth-el.</p>
<p>12. AND MOVED HIS TENT. Pitched his tent.</p>
<p>13. NOW THE MEN OF SODOM WERE WICKED. To their fellow man. This is stated in Ezekiel, viz., <italic>neither did she (Sodom) strengthen the hand of the poor and needy</italic> (Ezek. 16:49).</p>
<p>15. FOR ALL THE LAND WHICH THOU SEEST, TO THEE WILL I GIVE IT. By word.<sup><xref rid="fn923">21</xref></sup> <italic>And he shall put them (Israel&#x2019;s sins and transgressions) upon the head of the goat</italic> (Lev. 16:21) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn924">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this chapter Scripture informs us that the terebinths of Mamre are located in Hebron.</p>
<ftnote id="fn903"><sup>1</sup> <italic>Va-ya&#x2019;al</italic> (and he went up) is short for <italic>va-ya&#x2019;aleh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn904"><sup>2</sup> Hence the use of the term <italic>kaved</italic> (heavy) for rich.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn905"><sup>3</sup> We thus see that the root <italic>caf, bet, dalet</italic> in its various forms means heavy. <italic>Kavod</italic> (honor) really means heavy with glory. Similarly <italic>kaved</italic> means heavy with possessions. Conversely, <italic>kalon</italic> comes from &#x201C;light,&#x201D; i.e., not burdened with glory.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn906"><sup>4</sup> Hence the Bible describes Abraham as being <italic>kaved</italic>, heavy because of his possessions (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn907"><sup>5</sup> <italic>Kodesh</italic> is vocalized <italic>cholam, segol</italic>. Similarly, <italic>ohel</italic>. The latter is the term used in the Bible for tent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn908"><sup>6</sup> The plural of <italic>kodesh</italic> is similarly vocalized with a <italic>chataf kamatz</italic> beneath the <italic>kof</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn909"><sup>7</sup> Vocalized <italic>cholam kamatz</italic>. In our verse tents (<italic>ohalim</italic>) is vocalized with a cholam. Hence its singular cannot be <italic>ohel</italic>, for the singular of <italic>ohalim</italic> is <italic>ohal</italic> (<italic>cholam kamatz</italic>). I. E.&#x2019;s point is that the Hebrew word for tent can come in two forms, <italic>ohel</italic> or <italic>ohal</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn910"><sup>8</sup> If this is so, we would expect to find the form <italic>ohal</italic> in Scripture. However, it does not appear there. Nevertheless, I.E. insists that what he says is so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn911"><sup>9</sup> It does not have a <italic>yod</italic> between the <italic>chet</italic> and the <italic>vav</italic> as do all other similar plural forms (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn912"><sup>10</sup> That is, their individuality is blended, as in <italic>And all the people answered together</italic> (yachdav) (Ex. 19:8), which means that all the people answered as if they were one person. <italic>Yachad</italic> implies two people acting at the same time, but each one by himself (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn913"><sup>11</sup> That is, I.E.&#x2019;s comments on <italic>And the Canaanite was then in the land</italic> (Gen. 12:6) also apply here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn914"><sup>12</sup> I Sam. 8:2 states, <italic>Now the name of his (Samuel&#x2019;s) first-born was Joel</italic>. However, I Chron. 6:13 states, <italic>And the sons of Samuel: the first-born Vashni</italic>. Thus Samuel&#x2019;s first-born had two names.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn915"><sup>13</sup> The name of Samuel&#x2019;s great grandfather is given as Elihu (I Sam. 1:1), Eliab (I Chron. 6:12) and Eliel (I Chron. 6:19). Thus he had three names. All these sources agree that Samuel&#x2019;s grandfather&#x2019;s name was Jeroham. Therefore I.E. must have meant Samuel&#x2019;s great-grandfather rather than his grandfather. Krinsky and Weiser suggest that grandfather is short for great-grandfather.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn916"><sup>14</sup> Gen. 10:15-18 lists the 10 sons of Canaan. The Perizzites are not mentioned. I.E. surmises that he is mentioned under a different name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn917"><sup>15</sup> The word for an area with plants being <italic>kar</italic>, as in Is. 30:23. Our word reads <italic>kikkar</italic> because the <italic>caf</italic> is doubled.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn918"><sup>16</sup> The basic word being <italic>kikkar</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn919"><sup>17</sup> A <italic>bet</italic> has been dropped in <italic>bat</italic>, for the full word is <italic>bavat</italic>, with two <italic>bets</italic> (Krinsky). Others interpret: &#x201C;Similarly we do not know whether a <italic>bet</italic> has been dropped out in <italic>bat</italic>, or a <italic>bet</italic> is doubled in <italic>bavat</italic>&#x201D; (Weiser, Cherez). The text supports Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn920"><sup>18</sup> If Scripture were consistent the phrase would have read <italic>khullah mashkah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn921"><sup>19</sup> <italic>Te&#x2019;okhlehu</italic> (shall consume him) is feminine; <italic>nuppach</italic> (blown) is masculine. Hence Scripture uses both a masculine and feminine word in reference to the same thing (fire). It does the same in our verse with regard to <italic>kikkar</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn922"><sup>20</sup> This is I.E.&#x2019;s translation of <italic>va-yissa lot mi-kedem</italic> (and Lot journeyed east). According to I.E., Lot journeyed west to Sodom, away from Abraham who was in Beth-el. The problem with I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation is that Sodom lies east, not west of Beth-el. Because of this difficulty the Midrash homiletically interprets the clause to mean: He removed himself from the ancient one (<italic>mi-kedem</italic>) of the universe saying, I desire neither Abraham or his God (<italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 41:7). As to the problem raised by Sodom lying east of Beth-el, Weiser suggests that in order to reach Sodom from Beth-el one had to journey westward first and then eastward. However, this interpretation is forced. M.S. Siegal in his commentary on Genesis suggests that <italic>mi-kedem</italic> here has the meaning of eastward, or that <italic>mi-kedem</italic> is short for <italic>mi-kedem levet-el</italic>; i.e., Lot journeyed east of Beth-el, where Abram had pitched his tent. As to I.E., he most probably was not aware that Sodom lies east and not west of Beth-el.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn923"><sup>21</sup> Abraham did not take actual possession of Canaan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn924"><sup>22</sup> We thus see that the term &#x201C;give&#x201D; can be applied to a verbal statement (Weiser).</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 14</title>
<p>1. KING OF GOIIM. Goiim like Elam<sup><xref rid="fn925">1</xref></sup> is the name of a state. Elam must be the name of a state because <italic>shushan ha-birah</italic>, which means <italic>Shushan the palace</italic>, was located in it.<sup><xref rid="fn926">2</xref></sup> On the other hand, <italic>king of Goiim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn927">3</xref></sup> may be rendered as king of nations, Scripture not stating their names. The meaning of the verse is that Tidal was king over nations other than Shinar, Ellasar and Elam.</p>
<p>3. ALL THESE CAME AS ALLIES. <italic>Chaveru</italic> (came as allies) is in the <italic>kal</italic>.</p>
<p>THE VALE OF SIDDIM. <italic>Siddim</italic> means the same<sup><xref rid="fn928">4</xref></sup> as <italic>sid</italic> (plaster) in <italic>and plaster them with plaster</italic> (ba-sid)<sup><xref rid="fn929">5</xref></sup> (Deut. 27:2) and <italic>sad</italic> (plaster) in <italic>Thou puttest my feet also in the plaster</italic> (ba-sad)<sup><xref rid="fn930">6</xref></sup> (Job 13:27). <italic>Sad, siddim</italic>, is like <italic>pat</italic> (morsel of bread), <italic>pittim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn931">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>VALE. The word vale is to be understood as if written twice. It is like the word <italic>al</italic> (not) in <italic>O Lord, rebuke me not</italic> (al) <italic>in Thine anger; Neither</italic> (ve-al) <italic>chasten me in Thy wrath</italic> (Ps. 6:2).<sup><xref rid="fn932">8</xref></sup> Our verse should be read as follows: All these came as allies unto the vale of Siddim, the same is the vale of the Salt Sea.<sup><xref rid="fn933">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. [AND IN THE THIRTEENTH YEAR THEY REBELLED.] <italic>U-shelosh esreh</italic> (and the thirteenth) should be interpreted <italic>u-ve-shelosh esreh</italic> (and in the thirteenth).<sup><xref rid="fn934">10</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>sheshet</italic> (six) in <italic>for in six</italic> (sheshet) <italic>days the Lord made the heaven and earth</italic> (Ex. 20:11).<sup><xref rid="fn935">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the author of the <italic>Seder Olam</italic> did not interpret it this way. He combined the years mentioned in our verse.<sup><xref rid="fn936">12</xref></sup> His mind was greater than ours.</p>
<p>5. THE REPHAIM. They were called <italic>Rephaim</italic> (ghosts) because their appearance was so terrifying that whoever saw them died and was considered to be one of the <italic>Rephaim</italic>, one of the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn937">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE EMIM. They were so called because they were frightening.<sup><xref rid="fn938">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. IN THEIR MOUNT SEIR. <italic>Be-hareram</italic> (in their mount) is in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>. Its meaning is: when they went up to Mount Seir.<sup><xref rid="fn939">15</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>be-dabberam</italic> (when they spoke) (Ex. 7:7).<sup><xref rid="fn940">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AGAINST CHEDORLAOMER. With Chedorlaomer.<sup><xref rid="fn941">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. PITS. <italic>Be&#x2019;er</italic> (pit) in the Bible means a bubbling well. Its (pits) vocalization is exceptional because it is in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn942">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY FELL THERE. They deliberately fell there, in their desire to escape.<sup><xref rid="fn943">19</xref></sup> <italic>And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face</italic> (Num. 16:4) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn944">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>FLED TO THE MOUNTAIN. The phrase <italic>herah nasu</italic> is to be rendered: fled to the mountain. The word <italic>herah</italic> (to the mountain) is an irregular form.<sup><xref rid="fn945">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. WHO DWELT IN SODOM. Lot was dwelling in Sodom on that day.<sup><xref rid="fn946">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>[13. AND THERE CAME ONE THAT HAD ESCAPED.] <italic>Palit</italic> (one that had escaped) refers to a Sodomite who escaped and saved himself. <italic>Palit</italic> in <italic>one that had escaped</italic> (palit) <italic>out of Jerusalem came unto me</italic> (Ezek. 33:21) is similar.</p>
<p>There is a Midrashic interpretation concerning the escapee.<sup><xref rid="fn947">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. HE LED FORTH HIS TRAINED MEN. He armed them.<sup><xref rid="fn948">24</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ve-harek</italic> (arm) in, <italic>Arm</italic> (ve-harek) <italic>with the spear</italic> (Ps. 35:3).<sup><xref rid="fn949">25</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>va-yarek</italic> refers to the unsheathing of the sword. Compare, <italic>They empty themselves</italic> (yariku) <italic>upon the earth</italic> (Eccles. 11:3), and <italic>emptied</italic> (merikim) <italic>their sacks</italic> (Gen. 42:35).<sup><xref rid="fn950">26</xref></sup> A spear also has a sheath.<sup><xref rid="fn951">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>HIS TRAINED MEN. Abraham had trained them many times for battle. This is the meaning of the term <italic>chanikhav</italic> (his trained men) even though Scripture does not previously note that Abraham trained young men for war. Those who identify Abraham&#x2019;s trained men with his servant Eliezer on the basis of the numerical value of the latter&#x2019;s name are indulging in Midrash,<sup><xref rid="fn952">28</xref></sup> as Scripture does not speak in <italic>gematria</italic> (numericals). With this type of interpretation one can interpret any name as he wishes, both in a positive and a negative manner. Eliezer is to be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn953">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND MELCHIZEDEK. He was so called because he was king (<italic>melech</italic>) over a righteous (<italic>tzedek</italic>) place.<sup><xref rid="fn954">30</xref></sup> Some identify Melchizedek with Shem.<sup><xref rid="fn955">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>SALEM. This is Jerusalem. <italic>In Salem also is set His tabernacle, And His dwelling place in Zion</italic> (Ps. 76:3) is proof of this.</p>
<p>AND HE WAS PRIEST. This is be rendered as Onkelos does.<sup><xref rid="fn956">32</xref></sup> Similarly, every time the word &#x201C;priest&#x201D; (<italic>kohen</italic>) is found in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn957">33</xref></sup> <italic>That they may minister unto Me</italic> (ve-khihanu li) (Ex. 28:41) is proof of this.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>al divrati Malkitzedek</italic> (after the manner of Melchizedek) (Ps. 110:4) will be found in my commentary on Psalms.<sup><xref rid="fn958">34</xref></sup> Melchizedek spoke properly and did the right thing in first blessing Abraham<sup><xref rid="fn959">35</xref></sup> because he volunteered to rescue the captives.<sup><xref rid="fn960">36</xref></sup> He then blessed God for aiding Abraham and delivering Abraham&#x2019;s adversaries into his hands.</p>
<p>20. HATH DELIVERED. <italic>Miggen</italic> (hath delivered) means handed over. <italic>Temaggeneka</italic> (will she bestow on thee) in <italic>A crown of glory will she bestow on thee</italic> (temaggeneka) (Prov. 4:9) is similar. The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>miggen</italic> is a root letter.</p>
<p>Abraham gave a tithe out of respect for God. He found no one worthier than Melchizedek to bestow his tithe on.</p>
<p>22. I HAVE LIFTED UP MY HAND. This indicates an oath. It is like, <italic>For I lift up my hand to heaven</italic>, etc. (Deut. 32:40).</p>
<p>[GOD MOST HIGH.] For behold, I have used the same name for God in my oath as this priest (Melchizedek) when he blessed me.<sup><xref rid="fn961">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. THAT I WILL NOT TAKE A THREAD. That with which garments are sewn.</p>
<p>A SHOE-LATCHET. A strap used to tie a shoe.</p>
<p>24. SAVE ONLY. Save only that which the young men took. This refers to what Abraham&#x2019;s servants ate.<sup><xref rid="fn962">38</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn925"><sup>1</sup> Which is also mentioned in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn926"><sup>2</sup> Dan 8:2 reads: <italic>I was in shushan the castle</italic> (shushan ha-birah) <italic>which is in the province of Elam</italic>. We thus see that Elam was the name of the state and Shushan the name of the palace.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn927"><sup>3</sup> <italic>Goy</italic> in Hebrew means a nation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn928"><sup>4</sup> <italic>Sid</italic> means lime, whitewash or plaster. Hence the valley of Siddim means the valley of plaster. It was so called because of the plaster pits found there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn929"><sup>5</sup> Spelled <italic>sin, yod, dalet</italic>. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>siddim</italic> means the same as <italic>sid</italic>. However, they come from different roots. <italic>Sid</italic> in Deut. 27:2 comes from the root <italic>sin, vav, dalet</italic>. <italic>Siddim</italic> comes from <italic>sin, dalet, dalet</italic>, which is also the root of the word <italic>sad</italic> in Job 13:27. <italic>Siddim</italic> cannot be the plural of <italic>sid</italic> (Deut. 27:2) because it is spelled without a <italic>yod</italic> and has a <italic>dagesh</italic> in its <italic>dalet</italic>. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>sad</italic> and <italic>sid</italic> mean the same although they come from different roots (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn930"><sup>6</sup> This is I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation of the verse. In Job he explains the verse to mean God had plastered Job&#x2019;s feet with whitewash so that He could follow Job&#x2019;s every step. I.E. points out that <italic>siddim</italic> is the plural of <italic>sad</italic> in Job. The <italic>sin</italic> and <italic>samach</italic> interchange.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn931"><sup>7</sup> We would expect the plural of <italic>sad</italic> (Job. 13:27) to be <italic>saddim</italic>. I.E. points out that this is not necessarily so. Thus the plural of <italic>pat</italic> is <italic>pittim</italic> and not <italic>pattim</italic>. Similarly the plural of <italic>sad</italic> is <italic>siddim</italic> and not <italic>saddim</italic> (Krinsky and Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn932"><sup>8</sup> Here, too, the word <italic>al</italic> is to be read as if written twice. It should be noted that the word <italic>al</italic> does appear twice in our verse. I.E. probably had Ps. 38:2 in mind. There the text literally reads, <italic>O, Lord, rebuke me not</italic> (al) <italic>in Thine anger, chasten me in Thy wrath</italic>. I.E. says that the verse should be read, O Lord rebuke me not (<italic>al</italic>) in Thine anger, chasten me not (<italic>al</italic>) in Thy wrath. I.E. probably cited from memory and misquoted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn933"><sup>9</sup> The text literally reads: <italic>the vale of Siddim, the same is the Salt Sea</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn934"><sup>10</sup> The verse literally reads: <italic>U-shelosh esreh shanah</italic> (and thirteen years). I.E. says, <italic>u-shelosh esreh</italic> should be read as if a <italic>bet</italic> were prefixed to <italic>shelosh</italic>, i.e., <italic>u-ve-shelosh esreh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn935"><sup>11</sup> The verse literally reads: <italic>for six days the Lord made heaven and earth</italic>. Thus <italic>sheshet</italic> is to be read as if written <italic>ve-sheshet</italic> (in six).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn936"><sup>12</sup> Cf. <italic>Seder Olam</italic> I. The <italic>Seder Olam</italic> interprets <italic>u-shelosh esreh shanah</italic> to mean, and 13 years; i.e., they rebelled 13 years. It adds these 13 years to the 12 years mentioned previously in our verse and claims that the Bible deals with a 25-year period, 12 of service and 13 years of rebellion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn937"><sup>13</sup> Rephaim has the meaning of dead, shades or ghosts. Cf. Is. 14:9. They were called <italic>Rephaim</italic> because those who saw them were frightened to death. <italic>Rephaim</italic> were thus considered to be death-inducing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn938"><sup>14</sup> <italic>Emah</italic> means fear.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn939"><sup>15</sup> I.E. explains that <italic>be-hareram</italic> is not a noun with a pronominal suffix meaning their mountain. He holds that it is a verb with the pronominal suffix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn940"><sup>16</sup> Which is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> verb with a pronominal suffix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn941"><sup>17</sup> The Hebrew has <italic>et Chedorlaomer</italic>. <italic>Et</italic> usually indicates the object, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that <italic>et</italic> here has the meaning of <italic>im</italic> (with).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn942"><sup>18</sup> With <italic>chemar</italic> (slime). <italic>Be&#x2019;er</italic> is vocalized <italic>sheva tzere</italic>. In our verse it is vocalized <italic>segol, chataf segol</italic>. I.E. points out that this is so because the word is in the construct with <italic>chemar</italic> (slime). In other words, when <italic>be&#x2019;er</italic> refers to live wells it is vocalized <italic>sheva tzere</italic>; when it refers to pits it is vocalized <italic>segol, chataf segol</italic> (Krinsky, Netter, Cherez). Or what I.E. means is that the word&#x2019;s vowels change because it is in the construct (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn943"><sup>19</sup> That is, they hid themselves.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn944"><sup>20</sup> Moses willingly fell on his face.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn945"><sup>21</sup> We would expect <italic>he-harah</italic> (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn946"><sup>22</sup> His tent was usually outside of Sodom, cf. Gen. 13:12 (Weiser). Krinsky suggests that I.E. intends to say that Lot&#x2019;s tent was close to Sodom on that day, or by that day he had become a dweller in Sodom. On the other hand, Filwarg suggests that I.E. is trying to explain why <italic>yoshev</italic> (dwelt; literally, dwells) is in the present when all the verbs pertaining to this incident are in the past. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that &#x201C;dwelling&#x201D; is to be understood as: was dwelling.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn947"><sup>23</sup> The Midrash identifies the escapee as Og, King of Bashan, the same individual who escaped the flood by hanging on to Noah&#x2019;s ark. Cf. <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 42:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn948"><sup>24</sup> Thus <italic>va-yarek</italic> (he led forth) means he armed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn949"><sup>25</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s translation of this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn950"><sup>26</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>va-yarek et chanikhav</italic> (he led forth his trained men) means, he gave his trained men unsheathed swords (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn951"><sup>27</sup> Hence <italic>ve-harek chanit</italic> (Ps. 35:3) may be rendered as unsheath the spear.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn952"><sup>28</sup> Interpreted numerically, Eliezer comes to 318. Hence the Midrash identifies him with the 318 men mentioned in our verse. Cf. <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 43:2, 44:9.</ftnote>

I.E. hints that the latter phrase cannot be explained this way because Melchizedek spoke and acted properly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn961"><sup>37</sup> Ibn Ezra explains why Abraham referrred to the Lord as <italic>God Most High</italic> (El Elyon). He did this out of respect for Melchizedek, who used the term <italic>El Elyon</italic> in referring to God.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 15</title>
<p>1. IN A VISION. A prophetic vision.</p>
<p>[I AM THY SHIELD.] I was your shield and saved you from the kings. I will also reward you because, of your own free will, leading a small force and relying on Me, you saved your nephew.</p>
<p>[2. CHILDLESS.] The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>ariri</italic> (childless) is like the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>achzari</italic> (cruel).<sup><xref rid="fn963">1</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic> is dropped in the plural. Compare, <italic>they shall be childless</italic> (aririm)<sup><xref rid="fn964">2</xref></sup> (Lev. 20:21). Its meaning is as Onkelos explains it.<sup><xref rid="fn965">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>HE THAT SHALL BE POSSESSOR OF MY HOUSE. <italic>Meshek</italic> (possessor of) follows the paradigm of <italic>meches</italic> (levy) (Num. 31:28). It has a root whose second and third letters are identical. It comes from the same root as <italic>shokek</italic><sup><xref rid="fn966">4</xref></sup> (leap) in <italic>leap upon it</italic> (Is. 33:4). It means the same as the word <italic>devek</italic> (glue)<sup><xref rid="fn967">5</xref></sup> and is also vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn968">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>ben</italic> is to be read as if written twice. The verse is to read as follows: <italic>and he that shall be possessor of my house</italic> (ben meshek beti) is Eliezer, a native of Damascus (<italic>ben damesek Eliezer</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn969">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. OF THY OWN BOWELS. A euphemism for the sexual organ. Bowels is used as a euphemism because the male member is close to them.</p>
<p>6. RIGHTEOUSNESS. Compare, <italic>And it shall be righteousness unto us</italic> (Deut. 6:25). <italic>Tzedakah</italic> (righteousness) is a synonym for justice.<sup><xref rid="fn970">8</xref></sup> However, in Rabbinic literature <italic>tzedakah</italic> has a different meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn971">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THAT BROUGHT THEE OUT OF UR OF THE CHALDEES. This verse proves what I have earlier noted, that God&#x2019;s command to Abraham, <italic>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred</italic>, etc., was given in Ur of the Chaldees, not in Haran.<sup><xref rid="fn972">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abraham had complete faith in God&#x2019;s word that he would beget a son who would be his heir. It was only with regard to the possession of the land that he asked for a sign. He acted like Gideon.<sup><xref rid="fn973">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, all prophecies are conditional. God&#x2019;s oaths, on the other hand, are unconditional.<sup><xref rid="fn974">12</xref></sup> Hence Abraham did not sin in requesting that a covenant be made between God and himself.<sup><xref rid="fn975">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. A SHE-GOAT OF THREE YEARS OLD. Some render <italic>ez meshuleshet</italic> as three she-goats.<sup><xref rid="fn976">14</xref></sup> However, it appears to me that the correct translation of the phrase is: a she-goat three years old.</p>
<p>AND A RAM. A full grown male sheep.<sup><xref rid="fn977">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND A YOUNG PIGEON. <italic>Gozal</italic> is a young dove.<sup><xref rid="fn978">16</xref></sup> It is to be rendered this way because burnt offerings and other sacrifices were brought only from among the animals and birds mentioned here.</p>
<p>10. AND DIVIDED THEM IN THE MIDST. He cut them up and separated the pieces. <italic>Bater</italic> (split) in <italic>Upon the split mountains</italic> (hare bater)<sup><xref rid="fn979">17</xref></sup> (Cant. 2:17) and <italic>betarav</italic> (parts of) in <italic>between the parts thereof</italic> (betarav) (Jer. 34:18) are analogous to <italic>va-yevater</italic> (and divided them).</p>
<p>AND LAID EACH HALF OVER AGAINST THE OTHER. Note that the word <italic>ish</italic> (each)<sup><xref rid="fn980">18</xref></sup> means the same as <italic>ba&#x2019;al</italic>, which means the thing itself. Similarly, <italic>ish</italic> (man) in <italic>The Lord is a man</italic> (ish) of <italic>war</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn981">19</xref></sup> (Ex. 15:3); and <italic>ish</italic> (man) in <italic>the man</italic> (ve-ha-ish) <italic>Gabriel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn982">20</xref></sup> (Dan. 9:21); and <italic>ish</italic> (fellow) in <italic>a base fellow</italic> (ish beliyya&#x2019;al) (II Sam. 20:1). In the latter verse it is in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn983">21</xref></sup> <italic>Ish</italic> is also used in reference to the living creatures seen by Ezekiel,<sup><xref rid="fn984">22</xref></sup> and to the curtains of the Tabernacle, viz., <italic>Five curtains shall be coupled together one</italic> (ishah) <italic>to another</italic> (Ex. 26:3). The meaning of our clause is that he placed the piece of each one (<italic>ish</italic>) over against its counterpart. The term <italic>ish</italic> is to be so interpreted because man and beast are two different beings.<sup><xref rid="fn985">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT THE BIRDS DIVIDED HE NOT. The turtle dove and the young dove. <italic>Tzippor</italic> (birds) is a general term.<sup><xref rid="fn986">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THE BIRDS OF PREY. <italic>Ayit</italic> (birds of prey) is a type of bird. <italic>Ayit</italic> (bird of prey) in <italic>Is my heritage unto Me as a speckled bird of prey</italic> (ha-ayit) (Jer. 12:9) is similar.</p>
<p>UPON THE CARCASSES. On the lifeless bodies.<sup><xref rid="fn987">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ABRAM DROVE THEM AWAY. <italic>Va-yashev</italic> (drove away) has a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>shin</italic> to make up for a missing <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn988">26</xref></sup> He drove them and sent them off the carcasses.<sup><xref rid="fn989">27</xref></sup> <italic>Yashev</italic> (he caused to blow) in <italic>He causeth His wind to blow</italic> (yashev rucho) (Ps. 147:18) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn990">28</xref></sup> On the other hand, he may have flapped at the carcasses to drive the bird of prey off them.<sup><xref rid="fn991">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND IT CAME TO PASS, THAT, WHEN THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN. This clause indicates that Abraham <italic>took him all these</italic> (v. 10) during the day after he awoke from his prophetic vision.<sup><xref rid="fn992">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. THAT THY SEED SHALL BE A STRANGER IN A LAND THAT IS NOT THEIRS. In Hebrew a person who has a family is likened to a branch attached to its source. Therefore such an individual is called an <italic>ezrach</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn993">31</xref></sup> for the meaning of <italic>ezrach</italic> is a branch, as in <italic>a sprouting tree with many branches</italic> (ke-ezrach ra&#x2019;anan) (Ps. 37:35). On the other hand, a stranger is termed <italic>ger</italic> in Hebrew from the word <italic>gargir</italic> (berry), for he is like a berry plucked from a branch. There are some unintelligent people who find this explanation farfetched. However, if they knew the meaning of each letter and its form then they would recognize the truth.<sup><xref rid="fn994">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOUR HUNDRED YEARS. Until the end of this period (four hundred years) starting from this very day.<sup><xref rid="fn995">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. WHOM THEY SHALL SERVE. Whose slaves they shall be.</p>
<p>15. BUT THOU SHALT GO TO THY FATHERS. A euphemism for a natural death.</p>
<p>[IN PEACE.] Unlike your enslaved descendants, you will die in dignity.</p>
<p>16. AND IN THE FOURTH GENERATION THEY SHALL COME BACK HITHER. Many of the commentaries misunderstood the meaning of the word <italic>dor</italic> (generation).<sup><xref rid="fn996">34</xref></sup> The sages of the Talmud said there were ten generations from Adam to Noah.<sup><xref rid="fn997">35</xref></sup> We also find, <italic>to a thousand generations</italic><sup><xref rid="fn998">36</xref></sup> (Deut. 7:9) and Job speaks of four generations (Job 42:16).<sup><xref rid="fn999">37</xref></sup> In my opinion the meaning of <italic>dor</italic> (generation) is dwells. Compare <italic>dur</italic> (dwell) in <italic>Than to dwell</italic> (mi-dur) <italic>in the tents of wickedness</italic> (Ps. 84:11). A generation is measured by a person&#x2019;s life span. Some are long and some are short. Our verse refers to the fourth generation starting from the first that lived as strangers in Egypt. Thus it is written, <italic>thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land</italic> (Deut. 23:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1000">38</xref></sup> And so it was: Kohath, Amram, Moses and Aaron were strangers in Egypt. Their children, who were the fourth generation, returned to the land of Canaan.</p>
<p>FOR THE INIQUITY OF THE AMORITE IS NOT YET FULL. I have explained the meaning of <italic>iniquity</italic> in my comments on <italic>My punishment is greater than I can bear</italic> (Gen. 4:13).<sup><xref rid="fn1001">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Amorites are singled out because they were the most powerful of the Canaanite peoples.<sup><xref rid="fn1002">40</xref></sup> Behold, the great kings whom Moses slew were Amorites.<sup><xref rid="fn1003">41</xref></sup> Furthermore, it was five Amorite kings who united to fight Joshua.<sup><xref rid="fn1004">42</xref></sup> There are other proofs.<sup><xref rid="fn1005">43</xref></sup> Similarly the prophet says concerning the Amorites, <italic>Whose height was like the height of the cedars, And he was strong as the oaks</italic> (Am. 2:9). Whoever says that <italic>Emori</italic> (Amorite) comes from the same root as <italic>amar</italic> (saying) does not contribute anything.<sup><xref rid="fn1006">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN. Until now the sun had not yet set. It is similarly written, <italic>when the sun was about to go down</italic> (v. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn1007">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>THICK DARKNESS. <italic>Alatah</italic> (thick darkness) means darkness. The word <italic>alatah</italic> is also found in Ezekiel (12:6, 7, 12). It means a cloudy night. It might also refer to the darkness that sets in as soon as the last light has disappeared in the clouds.</p>
<p>BEHOLD A SMOKING FURNACE, AND A FLAMING TORCH. An image of a smoking furnace with a flaming torch in it.</p>
<p>BETWEEN THESE PIECES. <italic>Ben ha-gezarim</italic> means between the pieces. This<sup><xref rid="fn1008">46</xref></sup> was the actual taking of the oath. <italic>The words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof</italic> (Jer. 34:18) is similar. We thus read in the next verse, <italic>In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, &#x2018;Unto thy seed have I given this land,&#x2019;</italic> etc.</p>
<p>18. FROM THE RIVER OF EGYPT. This refers to the Shihor, and not the Nile.<sup><xref rid="fn1009">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THE KENITE, AND THE KENIZZITE AND THE KADMONITE. These are children of Canaan. Each one had two names.<sup><xref rid="fn1010">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND THE REPHAIM. This is what <italic>That also is accounted a land of Rephaim</italic> (Deut. 2:20) refers to.<sup><xref rid="fn1011">49</xref></sup> Do not be surprised that Scripture lists the Canaanite and after him the Jebusite.<sup><xref rid="fn1012">50</xref></sup> Note: Each one of the seven nations that dwelled in Canaan were Canaanites. They descended from Canaan, who fathered eleven sons. Elsewhere Scripture lists six Canaanite nations by their specific names and includes the remainder under the term Canaanite.<sup><xref rid="fn1013">51</xref></sup> In our chapter Scripture lists ten of them.<sup><xref rid="fn1014">52</xref></sup> At other times Scripture includes them all in the term Canaanite without enumerating them. Scripture similarly states, <italic>Judah and Israel were many</italic> (I Kings 4:20) even though the term Israel includes Judah.<sup><xref rid="fn1015">53</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn963"><sup>1</sup> It indicates a state (Weiser). It is not a root letter (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn964"><sup>2</sup> The plural is <italic>aririm</italic>, not <italic>aririyyim</italic> (Weiser). The point is, even though childless is always written <italic>ariri</italic> and never <italic>arir</italic>, the second <italic>yod</italic> never appears in the plural (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn965"><sup>3</sup> Onkelos translates <italic>ariri</italic> as childless.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn966"><sup>4</sup> Its root is <italic>shin, kof, kof</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn967"><sup>5</sup> <italic>Meshek</italic> is like <italic>devek</italic>; both indicate attachment and both are vocalized <italic>segol, segol</italic>. According to Cherez, I.E. similarly understands <italic>shokek</italic> in Is. 33:4. In Zephaniah 2:9, I.E. explains <italic>ben meshek</italic> as one who never leaves the house.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn968"><sup>6</sup> It should be noted that <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 omits &#x201C;with a <italic>segol</italic>.&#x201D; It reads: it means the same as glue.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn969"><sup>7</sup> The verse literally reads: <italic>he Damascus Eliezer</italic>. I.E. suggests that the word <italic>ben</italic> be placed before Damascus.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn970"><sup>8</sup> God considered Abraham&#x2019;s action as just and right.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn971"><sup>9</sup> There it has the meaning of charity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn972"><sup>10</sup> Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 12:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn973"><sup>11</sup> Cf. Jud. 6:37. Gideon, also, although he had faith in God, asked Him for a sign (Krinsky). Cherez explains that inheriting the land entailed expelling the Canaanites. The latter were expelled because of their sinfulness (v. 16). As there was a possibility that the Canaanites might repent, Abraham asked for a sign that regardless of what the Canaanites might do, his children would inherit the land. Similarly Gideon asked for a sign that he would be victorious even if the Midianites repented.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn974"><sup>12</sup> God&#x2019;s initial word to Abraham was prophetic. Hence it was conditional. Had God sworn an oath, Abraham would not have asked for a sign (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn975"><sup>13</sup> That the land of Canaan be unconditionally given to his descendants. I.E.&#x2019;s view is in contradistinction to a Midrashic view which held that Abraham sinned in asking for a sign. Cf. <italic>Nedarim</italic> 32a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn976"><sup>14</sup> Onkelos, Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn977"><sup>15</sup> A ram is a male sheep older than a year (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn978"><sup>16</sup> The word <italic>gozal</italic> can also be translated as a fledgling. It can thus refer to any bird. Cf. Deut. 32:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn979"><sup>17</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s rendering, i.e., mountains that are split or divided by valleys. Cf. Segel&#x2019;s commentary on Canticles.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn980"><sup>18</sup> <italic>Ish</italic> usually means a man. However, our verse reads, <italic>ish bitro</italic> (each half) and deals with animals. Hence I.E. explains that <italic>ish</italic> does not necessarily mean man. Here it refers to animals. Its meaning is, the half of each animal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn981"><sup>19</sup> We cannot translate <italic>ish milchamah</italic> as a man of war, as God is not a man. It must mean: the Lord is a being who wages war (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn982"><sup>20</sup> Gabriel is an angel. Therefore the phrase cannot mean the man Gabriel, but rather Gabriel himself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn983"><sup>21</sup> According to Weiser. This is a most difficult comment. It is hard to understand what I.E. is trying to say. Obviously <italic>ish</italic> is in the construct with <italic>beliyya&#x2019;al</italic>. Cherez writes that he does not understand this comment at all. Filwarg emends <italic>ish beliyya&#x2019;al</italic> to <italic>ish-ba&#x2019;al</italic> (II Kings 1:8), the point being that we find <italic>ish</italic> and <italic>ba&#x2019;al</italic> in apposition; i.e., <italic>ish</italic> and <italic>ba&#x2019;al</italic> mean the same. Thus <italic>ish-ba&#x2019;al</italic> is similar to <italic>admat-afar</italic> in Dan. 12:2, where <italic>admat</italic> means the same as <italic>afar</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn984"><sup>22</sup> <italic>Their wings were joined one</italic> (ishah) <italic>to another</italic> (Ezek. 1:9).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn985"><sup>23</sup> <italic>Ish</italic> must be interpreted as meaning a thing, the very thing. Otherwise it could not refer both to man and beast since they are totally different beings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn986"><sup>24</sup> Thus <italic>tzippor</italic> refers both to the turtle dove and to the young dove.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn987"><sup>25</sup> Scripture uses the term <italic>pegarim</italic> (carcasses) and not <italic>betarim</italic> (pieces). The reference is to the carcasses of the turtle dove and the young dove (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn988"><sup>26</sup> Its root being <italic>nun, shin, bet</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn989"><sup>27</sup> <italic>Them</italic> (otom) refers to the <italic>birds of prey</italic>. It should be noted that <italic>ayit</italic> (birds of prey) is in the singular. I.E. takes it as a collective noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn990"><sup>28</sup> The root <italic>nun, shin, bet</italic> means to blow. Similarly in our verse Abraham drove the birds off by causing a wind to blow over them, i.e., by flapping at them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn991"><sup>29</sup> According to this interpretation the <italic>them</italic> refers to the carcasses and <italic>ayit</italic> refers to one bird. The verse is to be interpreted as follows: the bird of prey came down&#x2026;and Abraham flapped at the carcasses and drove &#x201C;it&#x201D; off.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn992"><sup>30</sup> The vision in which Abraham was told to set aside the animals occurred at night (v. 5). He took the animals on the next day, after awakening from his vision. When the sun came down there transpired what our verse describes (Cherez, Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn993"><sup>31</sup> Ex. 12:49. Cf. Lev. 16:29, 18:26, 19:34, 24:16; Num. 9:14. Ps. 37:35 has been rendered in accordance with I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation in Psalms. <italic>Ezrach</italic> means native-born. According to I.E. one born in the land is called an <italic>ezrach</italic> because he is like a branch attached to its tree. It should be added that I.E. points out in his comments on Gen. 2:25 that the Bible compares man to a tree.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn994"><sup>32</sup> Ibn Ezra discusses the meaning and form of letters in his <italic>Sefer Ha-Tzachot</italic>. He explains that <italic>gimel</italic> means finished, or weaned (<italic>gamal</italic>), and <italic>resh</italic> cut. A poor person is called a <italic>rash</italic> because he is cut off from his sources. <italic>Ger</italic> is spelled <italic>gimel, resh</italic>; it thus means a person weaned and cut off from his family (Cherez, Netter).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn995"><sup>33</sup> In Ex. 12:40, I.E. writes that the 400 years started with the birth of Isaac. Some versions have &#x201C;from Isaac&#x2019;s birth&#x201D; in our text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn996"><sup>34</sup> They explain generations as a specific number of years. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s commentary on Job 42:16 in which he notes, <italic>Isaac the windbag erred in saying that a generation spans 35 years</italic>. In Deut. 7:9 he quotes an opinion that a generation is 36 years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn997"><sup>35</sup> <italic>Avot</italic> 5:2. The sages speak of generations in terms of people, not years. Each one of those mentioned had a life span that differed from the other. Hence <italic>dor</italic> cannot refer to a fixed number of years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn998"><sup>36</sup> If a generation is a fixed number of years then a thousand generations is a thousand times that number. In Deut. 7:9, I.E. argues that it cannot be so. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Deut. 7:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn999"><sup>37</sup> In Job the four generations come to 140 years. We thus see that a generation is not a fixed number of years, for each time it is encountered it does not refer to the same number of years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1000"><sup>38</sup> This verse spells out that the Hebrews were strangers in Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1001"><sup>39</sup> Iniquity at times means punishment. That is its meaning in this verse; i.e., I have not yet finished punishing them (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1002"><sup>40</sup> Actually this verse refers to all the inhabitants of Canaan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1003"><sup>41</sup> Deut. 2:24-36; 4:47. The Bible singles out these kings as being mighty (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1004"><sup>42</sup> Josh. 10:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1005"><sup>43</sup> In Scripture that the Amorites were the most powerful inhabitants of Canaan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1006"><sup>44</sup> The Midrash interprets <italic>the iniquity of the Amorite</italic> (avon ha&#x2019;emori) to mean the sin for saying (<italic>avon ha-amirah</italic>): O Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it. <italic>Pesikta Zutarta</italic>, Gen. 15:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1007"><sup>45</sup> This is the literal meaning of <italic>va-yehi ha-shemesh la-vo</italic> (when the sun was going down). We thus see that what transpired until now took place before the sun went down.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1008"><sup>46</sup> The passing of the smoking furnace with the flaming torch inside it between the pieces.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1009"><sup>47</sup> Cf. Josh. 13:3; Jer. 2:18. Josh. 13:3 says that the Shihor lies before Egypt The Nile is in Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1010"><sup>48</sup> Each one had another name and was listed under the other name in Gen. 10:15-18, in which the children of Canaan are enumerated. See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 13:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1011"><sup>49</sup> The point of I.E.&#x2019;s comment is that <italic>Rephaim</italic> in our verse refers to the land of Rephaim and not to the Rephaim per se, since the latter were not Canaanites (Weiser). However, Krinsky explains that the Rephaim were a branch of the Canaanites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1012"><sup>50</sup> Canaan was the father of these nations. Why, then, list him between the Kenites and Jebusites (Meijler)?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1013"><sup>51</sup> Thus Canaan refers to the Canaanite people (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1014"><sup>52</sup> Two are included in the name Canaan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1015"><sup>53</sup> We thus see that the Bible at times is especially explicit. Similarly, although Canaanite can refer to all seven nations, the Bible mentions Canaanite and then notes a number of them.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 16</title>
<p>2. IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL BE BUILDED UP. <italic>Ibbaneh</italic> (I shall be builded up) comes from the same root as <italic>ben</italic> (son).<sup><xref rid="fn1016">1</xref></sup> It is possible that the word for son (<italic>ben</italic>) comes from the root <italic>bet, nun, heh</italic> (to build), with the <italic>heh</italic> dropped because, metaphorically speaking, the father serves as the foundation and the son as the building.<sup><xref rid="fn1017">2</xref></sup> <italic>Chai</italic> (life) in the third person perfect and in the adjectival form is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1018">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ABRAM HEARKENED. Abraham said yes to her.</p>
<p>3. AFTER ABRAM HAD DWELT TEN YEARS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN. Our sages, of blessed memory, transmitted a law that a man shall not remain married more that ten years to a woman who has not borne him a child. They used this verse as sort of a support for this law. It is a good support.</p>
<p>4. WAS DESPISED. The <italic>tzere</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1019">4</xref></sup> in <italic>va-tekal</italic> (was despised) is in place of the <italic>dagesh</italic> which should be placed in the <italic>kof</italic> to make up for one of the missing root letters.<sup><xref rid="fn1020">5</xref></sup> <italic>Va-tekal</italic> is a <italic>nifal</italic>.</p>
<p>7. FOUND HER. <italic>Va-yimtza&#x2019;ah</italic> (found her) is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn1021">6</xref></sup> It should have been vocalized like <italic>va-yisna&#x2019;eha</italic> (and he hateth her) (Deut. 22:16).</p>
<p>8. WHENCE. <italic>Ay</italic> (whence) means where. <italic>Ay</italic> (where) in <italic>Where is</italic> (ay) <italic>Abel thy brother</italic> (Gen. 4:9) is similar. <italic>Mi-zeh</italic> (from this)<sup><xref rid="fn1022">7</xref></sup> is short for <italic>mi-zeh makom</italic> (from this place).<sup><xref rid="fn1023">8</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>ai mi-zeh vat</italic> is: where is the place thou camest from?</p>
<p>I FLEE. The <italic>resh</italic> of <italic>borachat</italic> (I flee) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> because it is followed by a guttural.<sup><xref rid="fn1024">9</xref></sup> These are similar: <italic>borachat</italic> (fleeth) in <italic>The whole city fleeth</italic> (borachat) (Jer. 4:29); <italic>porachat</italic> (budding) in <italic>and as it was budding</italic> (khe-forachat) (Gen. 40:10); <italic>rachat</italic> (shovel) in <italic>with the shovel</italic> (va-rachat) <italic>and with the fan</italic> (Is. 30:24); and <italic>yoda&#x2019;at</italic> (known) in <italic>that hath known man</italic> (yoda&#x2019;at ish) (Num. 31:17). The reason the middle letter of the root of the above words is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> is that it precedes gutturals. They are: <italic>alef, chet, heh, ayin</italic>. This is the rule. There is no exception.</p>
<p>11. BEHOLD THOU. <italic>Hinnakh</italic> (behold thou) is the form used when a female is being addressed, because it is a preposition. It is like the word <italic>im</italic> (with); it follows the paradigm of <italic>immakh</italic> (with you).<sup><xref rid="fn1025">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>ISHMAEL. The <italic>alef</italic> of Ishmael is not pronounced to simplify enunciation.</p>
<p>12. A WILD ASS OF A MAN. He will be free among men.<sup><xref rid="fn1026">11</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Who hath sent out the wild ass free</italic> (Job 39:5). The meaning of our clause is that no stranger will rule over him.<sup><xref rid="fn1027">12</xref></sup> Others say that we should render <italic>perah adam</italic> (a wild ass of a man) by a wild ass and a man.<sup><xref rid="fn1028">13</xref></sup> It is like <italic>The sun and moon stand still in their habitation</italic> ((Hab. 3:11).<sup><xref rid="fn1029">14</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: because he will be a wild ass <italic>his hand shall be against every man</italic>, but because he is a man <italic>every man&#x2019;s hand (shall be) against him</italic>. In my opinion its interpretation is: he will be as a wild ass among men;<sup><xref rid="fn1030">15</xref></sup> i.e., he will overcome men. However, ultimately <italic>every man&#x2019;s hand (shall be) against him</italic>. This is clearly stated in the book of Daniel, for the fourth beast described therein refers to the kingdom of Ishmael.<sup><xref rid="fn1031">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE SHALL DWELL IN THE FACE OF ALL HIS BRETHREN. The latter being the children of Keturah.<sup><xref rid="fn1032">17</xref></sup> It is similarly written, <italic>over against all his brethren did he settle</italic> (Gen. 25:18). Also, the Midianites are of the children of Keturah. However, they are referred to as Ishmaelites in the Pentateuch<sup><xref rid="fn1033">18</xref></sup> and in the Book of Judges.<sup><xref rid="fn1034">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. A GOD OF SEEING. <italic>Ro&#x2019;</italic>i (seeing) follows the paradigm of <italic>oni</italic> (affliction).<sup><xref rid="fn1035">20</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>I am the man that hath seen affliction</italic> (oni) (Lam. 3:1). The meaning of <italic>a God of seeing</italic> is a God who appears in visions.</p>
<p>HAVE I EVEN HERE. The commentaries translate <italic>halom</italic> as now.<sup><xref rid="fn1036">21</xref></sup> However, its correct meaning is here. <italic>Halom</italic> (hither) in <italic>Is there yet a man come hither</italic> (halom) (I Sam. 10:22) is similar.</p>
<p>The meaning <italic>ha-gam halom ra&#x2019;iti achare ro&#x2019;</italic>i (have I even here seen Him that seeth me) is: have I even here seen an angel of God after God saw my affliction, because God constantly seeth me (<italic>ro</italic>&#x2019;i).<sup><xref rid="fn1037">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. BEER-LAHAI. <italic>Beer lahai</italic> means the well of him who will be alive next year.<sup><xref rid="fn1038">23</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ko le-chai</italic> (so to life next year) (I Sam. 25:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1039">24</xref></sup> The well was so called because the Ishmaelites held annual festivities at this well. It is still in existence and is called the well of <italic>zamum</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1016"><sup>1</sup> Hence <italic>ibbaneh</italic> (I shall be builded up) means I shall have a son.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1017"><sup>2</sup> I.E. comments thusly because the root of <italic>ibbaneh</italic> is obviously <italic>bet, nun, heh</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1019"><sup>4</sup> The letters added to the root to indicate that it is in the imperfect are, with the exception of the first person singular, always vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic> in the <italic>nifal</italic>. I.E. literally reads, the missing <italic>yod</italic> between the prefix and the root letter. He is referring to the <italic>tzere</italic> which has a <italic>yod</italic> sound.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1020"><sup>5</sup> A <italic>lamed</italic>. The root of <italic>va-tekal</italic> (was despised) being <italic>kof, lamed, lamed</italic>. This comment is difficult. The <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>va-tekal</italic> is in reality vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic> to make up for the <italic>dagesh</italic> that should have been placed in the <italic>kof</italic> to make up for the missing <italic>nun</italic> of the <italic>nifal</italic> form. Filwarg amends I.E. to read so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1021"><sup>6</sup> Our verse should have read, <italic>va-yimtza&#x2019;eha</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1022"><sup>7</sup> J.P.S. translates <italic>ai mi-zeh</italic> as whence. It literally reads, where (<italic>ay</italic>) from this (<italic>mi-zeh</italic>), hence I.E.&#x2019;s comments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1023"><sup>8</sup> Weiser.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1026"><sup>11</sup> As a wild ass is. No one controls the wild ass or places a burden on him. Similarly Ishmael shall be a free and uncontrolled person. The Hebrew has <italic>pereh adam</italic>, literally, wild ass-man, hence the different interpretations which follow.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 17</title>
<p>1. GOD ALMIGHTY. <italic>Shaddai</italic> is an adjective meaning mighty. <italic>Shaddai</italic> in <italic>like a mighty voice</italic> (ke-kol shaddai)<sup><xref rid="fn1040">1</xref></sup> (Ezek. 1:24) is similar. Also, <italic>Shaddai</italic> in <italic>And mighty will be thy silver</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1041">2</xref></sup> (shaddai betzarekha) (Job 22:25) is similar because the word <italic>betzarekha</italic> (thy silver) has the same meaning as the word <italic>betzer</italic> (silver) in <italic>And lay thy treasure (or silver)</italic> (betzer) <italic>in the dust</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1042">3</xref></sup> (Job 22:24). The word <italic>Shaddai</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>davvai</italic> (faint), in <italic>And my heart is faint</italic> (davvai) (Lam. 1:22). Many derive <italic>Shaddai</italic> from the same root as <italic>shoded</italic> (overpowering),<sup><xref rid="fn1043">4</xref></sup> meaning, He is victorious and overpowering.</p>
<p>The reason God used this name at this time was to impress upon Abraham the fear of God so that he would circumcise himself.</p>
<p>The correct interpretation of the divine names is as follows: <italic>Shaddai</italic> is an adjective describing God&#x2019;s power over creation. The Tetragrammaton, God&#x2019;s revered and awesome name, stands in contrast to it. The world exists by virtue of these two names.<sup><xref rid="fn1044">5</xref></sup> Whoever understands the secret of God&#x2019;s name will accept my interpretation.</p>
<p>AND BE THOU WHOLE-HEARTED. Do not question the reason for circumcision.</p>
<p>5. ABRAHAM. The new name with the addition of the <italic>resh</italic> means the mighty one of a multitude of nations. This is so because the new name did not come to diminish a letter from Abraham&#x2019;s original name but to add one.<sup><xref rid="fn1045">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sarah, unlike Sarai, is a general adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn1046">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Blessed be the Lord before whom all actions are weighed. He commanded Abraham to circumcise himself before Sarah became pregnant so that his seed would be holy.<sup><xref rid="fn1047">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>[10. EVERY MALE AMONG YOU SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED.] <italic>Himmol</italic> (shall be circumcised) is to be read as if it had a <italic>lamed</italic> prefixed to it. It is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn1048">9</xref></sup> It belongs to the verbs having a <italic>vav</italic> as the middle letter of their root.<sup><xref rid="fn1049">10</xref></sup> It is like <italic>va-yamal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1050">11</xref></sup> in <italic>and circumcised</italic> (va-yamal) <italic>the flesh of their foreskin</italic> (v. 23). It follows the paradigm of <italic>le-hikkon</italic> (to be prepared).<sup><xref rid="fn1051">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND YE SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED. <italic>U-nemaltem</italic> (and ye shall be circumcised) is similar to <italic>u-shemartem</italic> (and ye shall keep).<sup><xref rid="fn1052">13</xref></sup> The <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>u-nemaltem</italic> is a root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn1053">14</xref></sup> <italic>Yadon</italic> (shall be sheathed) in <italic>My spirit shall not be sheathed</italic> (yadon) (Gen. 6:3) and <italic>nidneh</italic> (sheath) (Dan. 7:15) are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1054">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED AMONG YOU. <italic>Yimmol</italic> (shall be circumcised) is a <italic>nifal</italic>, as are <italic>himmol yimmol</italic> (must needs be circumcised) (v. 13). Why does Scripture state twice, <italic>He that is born in thy house&#x2026;must needs be circumcised</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn1055">16</xref></sup> This is the answer: Scripture first states that in the future all males, those of thy seed and also those <italic>born in the house or bought with money</italic>, shall be circumcised on the eighth day. It then states, &#x201C; Abraham immediately circumcise all males <italic>born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money</italic> although they are adults.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1056">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THE UNCIRCUMCISED MALE WHO IS NOT CIRCUMCISED. <italic>Yimmol</italic> (is circumcised) is a <italic>kal</italic>. It is like <italic>yiddor</italic> (voweth) in <italic>When a man voweth</italic> (yiddor) <italic>a vow</italic> (Num. 30:3). It comes from the same root as <italic>u-nemaltem</italic> (and ye shall be circumcised) in <italic>and ye shall be circumcised</italic> (u-nemaltem) <italic>in the flesh of your foreskin</italic> (v. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn1057">18</xref></sup> The meaning of the verse is, a male who reaches the age when he is obligated to observe the commandments of the Torah and does not circumcise himself is subject to the penalty of <italic>karet</italic> (being cut off). The verse refers to an adult because while a person is yet a child, the obligation to circumcise him falls upon his father. However, should his father fail to do so, then upon reaching maturity he must circumcise himself. <italic>Karet</italic> (being cut off) is a penalty inflicted by God. Those who err hold that a child that dies uncircumcised does not have a share in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn1058">19</xref></sup> However, the meaning of the word <italic>nefesh</italic> is not as they think, a soul<sup><xref rid="fn1059">20</xref></sup>, but a person; it means a body containing a soul. Similarly, <italic>If anyone</italic> (nefesh) <italic>shall sin</italic> (Lev. 4:2). Some say that <italic>karet</italic> refers to death before the age of fifty-two. Others say it means the eradication of one&#x2019;s name via the death of one&#x2019;s children. Therefore Scripture states, <italic>that soul shall be cut off from his people</italic>, for a person who leaves children is considered to live on even after his death, and his name is not cut off.</p>
<p>16. AND MOREOVER I WILL GIVE THEE. <italic>Natati</italic> (I will give thee) in our verse is like <italic>natati</italic> in <italic>I will give</italic> (natati) <italic>the price of the field</italic> (Gen. 23:13). Observe, although both are perfects, they are to be rendered as imperfects.</p>
<p>17. SHALL A CHILD BE BORN UNTO HIM THAT IS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD. Abraham was amazed at being told that he would have a son because the sperm of an old man is cold<sup><xref rid="fn1060">21</xref></sup> and therefore aged men are infertile. However, he was even more amazed that Sarah, a woman whose menstrual cycle had ceased, would bear a child, since the embryo is made and constructed from the woman&#x2019;s menstrual blood. If you will reflect you will conclude that Sarah&#x2019;s conceiving was a greater wonder than Abraham&#x2019;s begetting a child. For we find instances of men over ninety begetting children in later generations,<sup><xref rid="fn1061">22</xref></sup> and the life span of people in Abraham&#x2019;s time was much longer than in later times.<sup><xref rid="fn1062">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>As soon as the angel left, Abraham immediately circumcised Ishmael and all those born in his house and those bought with money.</p>
<p>26. IN THE SELFSAME DAY. Abraham did not hesitate to carry out the commandment of circumcision. Behold, Abraham&#x2019;s household consisted of three hundred eighteen males <italic>born in his house</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1063">24</xref></sup> aside from those <italic>bought with his money</italic>. After circumcising them, Abraham circumcised himself on that very day.<sup><xref rid="fn1064">25</xref></sup> Now Ishmael his son plus all those born in his house and bought with his money were voluntarily circumcised with him (Abraham) (v. 27). For the meaning of &#x201C;with him&#x201D; (v. 27) is that Abraham did not have to force his household to comply with God&#x2019;s commandment. They all voluntarily hurried to do and fulfill God&#x2019;s will.</p>
<p>27. WERE CIRCUMCISED WITH HIM. <italic>Nimmolu</italic> (were circumcised) is a <italic>nifal</italic>. Its root is <italic>nun, mem, lamed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1065">26</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-nishlo&#x2019;ach</italic> (were sent) in <italic>And letters were sent</italic> (ve-nishlo&#x2019;ach sefarim) (Est. 3:13) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1066">27</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1040"><sup>1</sup> Our translation follows that of I.E. Cf. Kimchi on Ezek. 1:24. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that here, too, <italic>Shaddai</italic> is an adjective meaning mighty.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1041"><sup>2</sup> I.E. on Job. 22:24, 25 renders <italic>betzer</italic> by <italic>kesef</italic> (silver). <italic>And mighty will be thy silver</italic> means you will have a great amount of money.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1042"><sup>3</sup> Hence the verse is to be rendered: And mighty (<italic>Shaddai</italic>) will be thy silver. Thus <italic>Shaddai</italic> is an adjective meaning mighty</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1043"><sup>4</sup> Brown, Driver and Briggs (<italic>Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament</italic>) define <italic>shoded</italic> as: deals violently with, despoils, devastates, ruins. Cf. Jer. 6:26. Thus <italic>shoded</italic> has the connotation of overpowering. In keeping with the concept of I.E., but more important out of respect to God, we have translated <italic>shoded</italic> as overpowering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1044"><sup>5</sup> The Tetragrammaton expresses God&#x2019;s essence, His eternality, and His being the cause of all existence. <italic>Shaddai</italic> emphasizes His power over creation. Thus these two names stand opposite each other; i.e., these names teach that there is an Eternal God who created all (Tetragrammaton) and has the power over all (<italic>Shaddai</italic>). Furthermore, on a more &#x201C;practical&#x201D; level it is via the Tetragrammaton that the world was created, and via the name <italic>Shaddai</italic> that nature is overcome. Others comment that the Tetragrammaton stands for creation and <italic>Shaddai</italic>, for destroying or limiting the creation (Krinsky). See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Ex. 3:15, 6:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1045"><sup>6</sup> <italic>Prima facie</italic> there is no meaning for the <italic>resh</italic> in Abraham. I.E. argues that it does not have a meaning, for the <italic>resh</italic> is an integral part of the new name. Abraham means <italic>avir hamon goyim</italic>, for <italic>av hamon goyim</italic> with the <italic>resh</italic> added gives <italic>avir hamon goyim</italic>. I.E. is in contradistinction to Rashi who comments that the <italic>resh</italic> in Abraham was carried over from Abram and did not signify anything. We have followed <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 in our translation, which reads, <italic>Abraham im tosefet ha-resh avir hamon goyim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1046"><sup>7</sup> Sarai connotes my princess; Sarah connotes princess over all (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1047"><sup>8</sup> By being the seed of a circumcised father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1048"><sup>9</sup> Hence it means shall be circumcised. <italic>Himmol</italic> might be taken to be an imperative, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1049"><sup>10</sup> It is an <italic>ayin, vav</italic>, its root being <italic>mem, vav, lamed</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1050"><sup>11</sup> Whose root is also <italic>mem, vav, lamed</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1051"><sup>12</sup> Cf. Ez. 38:7; Amos 4:12. The root of <italic>le-hikkon</italic> is <italic>caf, vav, nun</italic>. <italic>Le-himmol</italic> is the same form as <italic>le-hikkon</italic>. Both <italic>le-himmol</italic> and <italic>le-hikkon</italic> are <italic>nifal</italic> infinitives.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1052"><sup>13</sup> <italic>U-shemartem</italic> is a <italic>kal</italic>. Similarly <italic>u-nemaltem</italic> (and ye shall be circumcised) is a <italic>kal</italic>, meaning: and ye shall circumcise.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1053"><sup>14</sup> Its root is <italic>nun, mem, lamed</italic>. There are thus two roots meaning to circumcise, viz., <italic>nun, mem, lamed</italic> and <italic>mem, vav, lamed</italic>. (See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on verse 10 and note 10).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1054"><sup>15</sup> There are two roots for the Hebrew word for sheath, viz., <italic>nun, dalet, nun, nidneh</italic> (Dan. 7:15) and <italic>dalet, vav, nun, yadon</italic> (Gen. 6:3). (Rendering Gen. 6:3 according to I.E. See I.E. on Gen. 6:3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1055"><sup>16</sup> Verse 13 seems to repeat what is in verse 12. I.E. asks why.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1056"><sup>17</sup> It might have been thought that since the command speaks of circumcision on the eighth day, those past that age when the command was given were exempt. Thus verse 12 speaks of the future and verse 13 of the present. Thus there is no repetition.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1057"><sup>18</sup> J.P.S. renders both <italic>yimmol</italic> and <italic>u-nemaltem</italic> as <italic>nifals</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1058"><sup>19</sup> It is for this reason that Jews customarily circumcise, prior to burial, a child who dies uncircumcised. Cf. <italic>Shulchan Arukh Yoreh Deah</italic> 263:5. It is clear from I.E.&#x2019;s refutation of the belief that an uncircumcised child does not have a share in the world to come that those who held this view based it on the verse: <italic>And the uncircumcised male&#x2026;that soul</italic> (nefesh) <italic>shall be cut off from his people</italic> (v. 14).

<title>CHAPTER 18</title>
<h1>VA-YERA</h1>
<p>1. AND THE LORD APPEARED. Behold, a few say that God is three men: He is one and He is three and they are inseparable.<sup><xref rid="fn1067">1</xref></sup> They forget that Scripture expressly states, <italic>And the two angels came to Sodom at even</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1068">2</xref></sup> However, the commentaries tell us<sup><xref rid="fn1069">3</xref></sup> that God first appeared to Abraham in a vision after which Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw three angels.<sup><xref rid="fn1070">4</xref></sup> One came to bring happy tidings to Sarah<sup><xref rid="fn1071">5</xref></sup> and the other two went on to Sodom, one to destroy it and one to save Lot.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>And they did eat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1072">6</xref></sup> (v. 8) is that the bread was consumed.<sup><xref rid="fn1073">7</xref></sup> Eaten, in our verse, has the same meaning as the identical word in <italic>whereto the fire hath eaten</italic> (consumed) (Lev. 6:3).</p>
<p>[5. FORASMUCH AS YE ARE COME.] <italic>Ki al ken avartem</italic> (forasmuch as ye are come) means the same as <italic>ho&#x2019;il va-avartem</italic> (since you are come) in Rabbinic Hebrew.<sup><xref rid="fn1074">8</xref></sup> It is like <italic>forasmuch as</italic> (ki al ken) <italic>as they are come under the shadow of my roof</italic> (Gen. 19:8).</p>
<p>SO DO, AS THOU HAST SAID. They responded politely and said to him that a morsel of bread would suffice.<sup><xref rid="fn1075">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. KNEAD IT. <italic>Lushi</italic> (knead it) is like <italic>va-talash</italic> (and kneaded it) (I Sam. 28:24).<sup><xref rid="fn1076">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. WHEN THE SEASON COMETH ROUND. <italic>Ka-et</italic> (when the season) means next year, at this time, and <italic>chayyah</italic> (cometh round), that Sarah will then be alive.<sup><xref rid="fn1077">11</xref></sup> It is like <italic>ko le-chai</italic> (so to life next year) (I Sam. 25:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1078">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHICH WAS BEHIND HIM.<sup><xref rid="fn1079">13</xref></sup> The angel who spoke to Abraham was behind the tent. Abraham sat in the tent door and consequently could not see Sarah. Others say that the door of Sarah&#x2019;s tent was behind the tent of Abraham.<sup><xref rid="fn1080">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND WELL STRICKEN IN AGE. They lived many days.<sup><xref rid="fn1081">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. SHALL I HAVE. <italic>Hayetah li</italic> means shall I have.<sup><xref rid="fn1082">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>PLEASURE. The word <italic>ednah</italic> means pleasure and enjoyment. <italic>Va-yitaddenu</italic> (and luxuriated) in <italic>and luxuriated</italic> (va-yitaddenu) <italic>in Thy great goodness</italic> (Neh. 9:25) is similar. The meaning of our verse is: How can the enjoyment and pleasure of youth be renewed in me, seeing that I have waxed old and aged and my husband, too, is old.</p>
<p>[WITHIN HERSELF.] In her mind. God revealed Sarah&#x2019;s inner thoughts to the angel.</p>
<p>13. WHOM AM OLD. This explains <italic>After I am waxed old</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1083">17</xref></sup> The angel spoke the truth.<sup><xref rid="fn1084">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>umnam</italic> (of a surety) is not a root letter. It is like the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>shilshom</italic> (the day before yesterday) (Gen. 31:5).</p>
<p>Other commentators maintain that Abraham&#x2019;s three guests were prophets. If one should argue, why would God send a message via a prophet to Abraham who himself was a prophet,<sup><xref rid="fn1085">19</xref></sup> since it is only when one prophet is greater than the other, as in the case of Moses who was sent with a prophesy to Aaron,<sup><xref rid="fn1086">20</xref></sup> that God transmits his intentions to a prophet through another prophet,<sup><xref rid="fn1087">21</xref></sup> then they would answer that the three prophets came not to Abraham but to Sarah. Indeed, Scripture explicitly states, <italic>And they said unto him: Where is Sarah thy wife</italic> (v. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn1088">22</xref></sup> After one of the prophets delivered the message to Sarah, the other two went on to Sodom. Also, do not be troubled by the clause <italic>for we will destroy this place</italic> (Gen.19:13),<sup><xref rid="fn1089">23</xref></sup> as we find a similar expression with regard to Moses and Aaron: <italic>And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh</italic> (Ex. 11:10). In reality God did the wonders and they were attributed to Moses and Aaron because they were the agents by which the miracles were performed. Now according to this interpretation, <italic>and they did eat</italic> (v. 8) is to be taken literally.</p>
<p>Similarly, according to this interpretation, the term <italic>Adonai</italic> (Lord) in <italic>My lord</italic>, (Adonai) <italic>if now I have found favor in thy sight</italic> (v. 3) does not refer to the Deity, but means my lords. Hence there is a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>nun</italic>, and it is not vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> as would be the case if it referred to God.<sup><xref rid="fn1090">24</xref></sup> However, in those copies of the Pentateuch where <italic>Adonai</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> the term must be interpreted as: O prophet of God.<sup><xref rid="fn1091">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Also (according to the aforementioned interpretation), the reason Abraham said, <italic>if now I have found favor in thy sight</italic> (v. 3)<sup><xref rid="fn1092">26</xref></sup> is that he first addressed the most important of the three and then the other two.<sup><xref rid="fn1093">27</xref></sup> Those who maintain that the three who visited Abraham were prophets<sup><xref rid="fn1094">28</xref></sup> point out that the prophet Haggai is referred to in Scripture as an angel.<sup><xref rid="fn1095">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that <italic>Adonai</italic> means Lord and that Abraham respectfully requested that God wait until he had attended his guests. There are still others who say that the verses are not in order of their occurrence.<sup><xref rid="fn1096">30</xref></sup> According to this interpretation, <italic>And he lifted up</italic> (v. 2) is to be interpreted: and he had already lifted up his eyes and looked and done so and so. After this, God appeared to him and said, <italic>Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing</italic>, etc. (v. 17), and <italic>Verily the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great</italic>, etc. (v. 20). <italic>But Abraham stood yet before the Lord</italic> (v. 22) when the two angels who left for Sodom arrived there. In any case,<sup><xref rid="fn1097">31</xref></sup> <italic>And the Lord said: Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing</italic>, etc., relates either to what God directly revealed to Abraham or to what He told the angels to relate to Abraham. However, all opinions agree that <italic>And the Lord said: Verily the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and verily their sin is exceedingly grievous</italic>, etc. (v. 20 and 21), definitely records God&#x2019;s words to Abraham. Upon hearing this, Abraham drew near and said, <italic>Wilt thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked</italic>, etc. (v. 23-32).</p>
<p><italic>And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord</italic>, (v. 22) is a parenthetical statement noting that at the very moment that the men came to Sodom, God told Abraham, <italic>Verily, the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great</italic>. This is similar: <italic>As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul: &#x2018;Bid the servant pass on before us - and he passed on - but stand thou still at this time, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God&#x2019;</italic> (I Sam. 9:27).<sup><xref rid="fn1098">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no need to assume that the scribes changed the original reading of our verse<sup><xref rid="fn1099">33</xref></sup> from <italic>but the Lord stood yet before Abraham</italic> to <italic>but Abraham stood yet before the Lord</italic>. Indeed, the verse <italic>And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord</italic> (Gen. 19:27) proves that there was no scribal emendation.<sup><xref rid="fn1100">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will allude to my own beliefs with regard to the appearance of the angels in my commentary on the first Torah portion of Exodus.<sup><xref rid="fn1101">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. [IS ANYTHING TOO HARD FOR THE LORD?] <italic>Ha-yippale</italic> (is it too hard) means is it hidden.<sup><xref rid="fn1102">36</xref></sup> <italic>Fele</italic> (hidden things) in <italic>oseh fele</italic> (doing hidden things) (Ex. 15:11)<sup><xref rid="fn1103">37</xref></sup> is similar. Others say the meaning of <italic>ha-yippale me-adonai davar</italic> is: it is not a wonder in God&#x2019;s eyes to do such a thing.<sup><xref rid="fn1104">38</xref></sup> However, if this were so, then a <italic>mem</italic> would not be prefixed to God&#x2019;s name.<sup><xref rid="fn1105">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. SHALL BE BLESSED IN HIM. <italic>Ve-nivrikhu</italic> (shall be blessed) is a <italic>nifal</italic>. It means that they shall be blessed because of Abraham. However, <italic>ve-hitbarekhu</italic> (Gen. 22:18) has a different meaning. It means: they shall bless themselves in him.<sup><xref rid="fn1106">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. [VERILY THE CRY OF SODOM.] Either the cry of its blasphemy or the cry of those victimized by its violence.</p>
<p>AND, VERILY, THEIR SIN IS EXCEEDINGLY GRIEVOUS. And the earth cannot bear it.</p>
<p>21. [I WILL GO DOWN NOW, AND SEE WHETHER THEY HAVE DONE ALTOGETHER ACCORDING TO THE CRY OF IT.] Some say this verse is to be interpreted as follows: If they have done so then I will destroy them (<italic>kalah</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1107">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND IF NOT, I WILL KNOW. <italic>Eda&#x2019;ah</italic> means I will have pity upon them. They similarly interpret <italic>va-yeda Elohim</italic> (and God took cognizance of them)<sup><xref rid="fn1108">42</xref></sup> (Ex. 2:25). However, I believe that this verse is to be explained as follows: I will go down and see if all of them (<italic>kalah</italic>) have done this evil.<sup><xref rid="fn1109">43</xref></sup> For in truth,<sup><xref rid="fn1110">44</xref></sup> God who is All knows the individual in a general rather than in a detailed manner.<sup><xref rid="fn1111">45</xref></sup> Proof that this interpretation is correct, although it is a great mystery, is Abraham&#x2019;s plea, <italic>Wilt thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked</italic> (v. 23).<sup><xref rid="fn1112">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>ha&#x2019;af</italic> (wilt) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1113">47</xref></sup> even though it is an interrogative <italic>heh</italic>, because it is followed by an <italic>alef</italic>, which is a guttural, and it is the rule in Hebrew to elongate the vowel before gutturals.<sup><xref rid="fn1114">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. THAT WILT SWEEP AWAY. <italic>Tispeh</italic> (thou wilt sweep away) is a transitive verb. It means is thou wilt destroy (or finish). <italic>Aspeh</italic> (finish) in <italic>I will finish</italic> (aspeh) <italic>evils upon them</italic> (Deut. 32:23) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1115">49</xref></sup> Both words (<italic>tispeh</italic> and <italic>aspeh</italic>) mean the same thing even though they belong to different conjugations.<sup><xref rid="fn1116">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND NOT FORGIVE THE PLACE. <italic>Tissa</italic> means forgive. Compare, <italic>nose</italic> (forgiving) in <italic>forgiving iniquity</italic> (nose avon) (Ex. 34:7).</p>
<p>[THE PLACE.] Sodom. For it was on account of Sodom that Abraham approached God in prayer. He did so to save Lot.<sup><xref rid="fn1117">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. THAT BE FAR. <italic>Chalilah</italic> (that be far) means it is not possible. Others say that <italic>chalilah</italic> (that be far) is to be connected to the word <italic>chalul</italic>, which means empty.<sup><xref rid="fn1118">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT SO THE RIGHTEOUS SHOULD BE AS THE WICKED. When two <italic>cafs</italic> are prefixed to two words following each other<sup><xref rid="fn1119">53</xref></sup> we are dealing with an abridged statement. Hence our verse should be understood as follows: that so the righteous should be as the wicked and the wicked be so as the righteous. Similarly, <italic>for thou art even as Pharaoh</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1120">54</xref></sup> (Gen. 44:18); <italic>my people as thy people</italic> (I Kings 22:4);<sup><xref rid="fn1121">55</xref></sup> and <italic>The darkness is even as the light</italic> (Ps. 139:12).<sup><xref rid="fn1122">56</xref></sup> The thrust of Abraham&#x2019;s appeal is: How is it possible for the Judge of all the earth to act unjustly?</p>
<p>[26. WITHIN THE CITY.] That is, who publicly<sup><xref rid="fn1123">57</xref></sup> revere My name. <italic>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, And see now, and know, And seek in the broad places thereof, If ye can find a man, If there be any that doeth justly, and seeketh truth; And I will pardon her</italic> (Jer. 5:1) is similar.</p>
<p>27. [I HAVE TAKEN UPON ME.] <italic>Ho&#x2019;alti</italic> (I have taken upon me) does not mean I began; it means I wanted. <italic>Ho&#x2019;il Moshe</italic> (took Moses upon him) (Deut. 1:5) is similar. The <italic>caf</italic> of <italic>anokhi</italic> (I) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1124">58</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is possible that there are two different words for I in Hebrew.<sup><xref rid="fn1125">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHO AM BUT DUST AND ASHES.] For dust I was and ashes I will be. Abraham was speaking only about the body&#x2019;s foundation, i.e., its skeletal frame.<sup><xref rid="fn1126">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. PERADVENTURE THERE SHALL LACK FIVE. Perhaps a tenth of the number will be lacking.</p>
<p>[WILT THOU DESTROY ALL THE CITY FOR LACK OF FIVE.] Will you destroy the city because of the five who are missing from the fifty?<sup><xref rid="fn1127">61</xref></sup> Abraham then repeated his request and said, &#x201C;Will you destroy the city if a ninth are missing from the number (forty-five) concerning which you stated that if there be found there that many righteous men I will not destroy them.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1128">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>[29. I WILL NOT DO IT FOR THE FORTY&#x2019;S SAKE.] <italic>I will not do it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1129">63</xref></sup> means I will not bring destruction. And so as not to prolong his prayers Abraham combined the two previous subtractions.<sup><xref rid="fn1130">64</xref></sup> Thus Abraham asked if one quarter of the forty was missing would God destroy the city. He then asked if a third of the thirty were missing, would God destroy it. He concluded by asking if God would destroy the city if half of the twenty righteous men were missing. Some say that Abraham did not ask God to spare for less than ten people because there were five cities and thus less than two righteous per city. However, they are mistaken, for Scripture expressly tells us that Abraham spoke only of Sodom.<sup><xref rid="fn1131">65</xref></sup> Now even though our sages, of blessed memory, transmitted as mere tradition the law that there can be no public prayer when fewer than ten men are present,<sup><xref rid="fn1132">66</xref></sup> this verse may be taken as a support of our faith in the law which they passed on to us.<sup><xref rid="fn1133">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. AND ABRAHAM RETURNED UNTO HIS PLACE. To Hebron. This vision took place at the spot where Abraham went to accompany the angels on their way.<sup><xref rid="fn1134">68</xref></sup> From this spot Abraham looked out toward Sodom. <italic>And he (Abraham) looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace</italic> (Gen. 19:28) took place after sunrise. This is so even though the preceding verse opens with <italic>And Abraham got up early in the morning</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1135">69</xref></sup> This is so because Sodom was not destroyed at night. The latter is clearly noted in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1136">70</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1067"><sup>1</sup> This comment of I.E. is cryptic. Krinsky sees in it an allusion to the Christian doctrine of trinity. According to him, <italic>a few say</italic> refers to the Christians. Filwarg disagrees. He insists that I.E. is merely saying that God&#x2019;s revelation took the form of three angels appearing to Abraham. One can argue on behalf of Krinsky that the Christians did use this verse as &#x201C;proof&#x201D; of their doctrine of trinity. And indeed, I.E.&#x2019;s language seems to support Krinsky. On the other hand, would I.E. refer to the Christians as <italic>a few say</italic>, thereby giving some credence to their trinitarian interpretation? Furthermore, Rashbam accepts this interpretation minus, of course, its trinitarian aspects. Commenting on this verse, Rashbam says, <italic>And the Lord appeared to him. How? Three men who were angels came to him</italic>. Thus Rashbam interprets this verse in a way similar to the phrase <italic>a few say</italic> quoted by I.E. Hence <italic>a few say</italic> may very well refer to a Jewish interpretation. However, it should be noted that Saadiah Gaon, in rejecting the doctrine of trinity, writes, &#x201C;Others (finally) conjecturing about the implication of the passage, <italic>And the Lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre</italic> (Gen. 18:1), declare that the thing that appeared to Abraham and was designated by this name was a trinity because Scripture later on explicitly states: <italic>And, lo, three men stood over against him</italic> (Gen. 18:2). Let me explain, then, that these are more ignorant (than the opinions concerning God&#x2019;s essence previously refuted) because they did not wait until they reached the end of the passage. For had they had patience until they heard the verse: <italic>And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord</italic> (Gen. 18:22), they would have realized that the <italic>men</italic> had departed while the light of God remained stationary with Abraham, who was in its presence. The thought therefore that God was identical with these men is completely refuted&#x201D; (<italic>The Book of Beliefs and Opinions</italic>, Rosenblat translation, p. 108). Reading Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s comments side by side with that of Saadiah seems to leave no doubt that both deal with the same group, the Christians. Indeed, it seems that Saadiah was the source of I.E.&#x2019;s comments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1068"><sup>2</sup> Gen. 19:1. This verse clearly shows that the three are separable and thus cannot refer to God. The <italic>few say</italic> state that the three are inseparable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1069"><sup>3</sup> Perhaps the term <italic>mefareshim</italic> (commentators) is used to indicate that what they say is acceptable in contrast to the first ones quoted who are not even deemed Biblical commentators. See preceding notes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1070"><sup>4</sup> Cf. Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1071"><sup>5</sup> That she would have a son.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1072"><sup>6</sup> Angels do not eat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1073"><sup>7</sup> The angels caused the bread to be consumed. Thus it appeared to have been eaten.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1074"><sup>8</sup> In other words, <italic>ki al ken</italic> means the same as the Rabbinic term <italic>ho&#x2019;il</italic> (since). The Hebrew <italic>ki al ken</italic> can also be explained to mean, for this reason; i.e., the verse can be read: I will fetch a morsal of bread and stay your heart&#x2026;for this reason (to eat) are ye come to your servant (Netter), hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1075"><sup>9</sup> We would expect them to say: We will do as thou hast said, rather than <italic>So do</italic>, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1076"><sup>10</sup> That is, <italic>lushi</italic> means to knead, as in I Sam. 28:24. Since the root <italic>lamed, vav, shin</italic> is not often found in Scripture, I.E. quotes an additional verse to illustrate its meaning (Filwarg). Cherez explains that since <italic>lushi</italic> is a transitive verb we would expect to find the object &#x201C;dough,&#x201D; i.e., knead the dough, as in <italic>and the women knead the dough</italic> (Jer. 7:18). Hence I.E. points out that occasionally the word dough is left out, as in I Sam. 28:24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1077"><sup>11</sup> <italic>Ka&#x2019;et chayyah</italic> is not to be rendered as J.P.S. does, but rather, next year at this season and Sarah will then be alive (Weiser, Netter).</ftnote>

The &#x201C;it&#x201D; (<italic>ve-hu</italic>) refers to the door of Sarah&#x2019;s tent. The verse thus reads: and it (the door of Sarah&#x2019;s tent) was behind it (Abraham&#x2019;s tent) (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1081"><sup>15</sup> The verse literally reads: coming into the days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1082"><sup>16</sup> <italic>Hayetah li</italic> literally means I had. I.E. explains that <italic>hayetah</italic> is to be taken as an imperfect even though it is a perfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1083"><sup>17</sup> Sarah said, <italic>achare viloti</italic> (after I am waxed old). The angel quoted her as saying, <italic>ani zakanti</italic> (I who am old). I.E. points out that <italic>zakanti</italic> means the same as <italic>viloti</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1084"><sup>18</sup> See <italic>Baba Metzia</italic> 87a and <italic>Yebamot</italic> 65b, which state that Scripture changed Sarah&#x2019;s actual words for the sake of peace so that Abraham would not take offense.

I.E. disagrees with this interpretation (see note 17).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1085"><sup>19</sup> God could have revealed his prophecy to Abraham directly, as he did to the three prophets who visited him. What need was there to send a prophet to him?</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1096"><sup>30</sup> I.e., Abraham first saw the angels (v. 2-16) and then God appeared to him (v. 1). According to this interpretation the Bible introduces the chapter with a statement that God appeared to Abraham. It then tells us that before God appeared to Abraham angels visited him. Scipture then records what God told Abraham when He appeared to him (v. 17-21). According to the earlier interpretation God first appeared to Abraham and then Abraham saw the angels.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1097"><sup>31</sup> Whichever of the above interpretations we adopt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1098"><sup>32</sup> <italic>And he passed on</italic> is a parenthetical statement. I.E. points out that such statements are found in the Bible. Similarly verse 22 is parenthetical.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1099"><sup>33</sup> According to the Midrash verse 22 originally read: But the Lord yet stood before Abraham. However, out of respect for God the Scribes reversed the passage to read: <italic>But Abraham stood yet before the Lord</italic>. Cf. <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 49:7; <italic>Va-yikra Rabbah</italic> 11:5. For the reason that the Midrash assumed the verse originally read: but the Lord yet stood before Abraham; see Rashi and Krinsky. I.E. claims that there never was, in fact, any scribal emendation, as the literal meaning of the text does not support such an assumption (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1100"><sup>34</sup> This verse clearly states that it was Abraham who stood before the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1101"><sup>35</sup> Following Krinsky. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary on Ex. 3:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1102"><sup>36</sup> According to this interpretation, <italic>ha-yippale me-adonai davar</italic> (is anything too hard for the Lord) means is anything hidden from God. Cf. Rashi, &#x201C;is anything too hidden&#x2026;or concealed from me, that I cannot do it.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1105"><sup>39</sup> The text reads, <italic>ha-yippale me-adonai davar</italic>. <italic>Me-adonai</italic> means from God, and cannot imply, in God&#x2019;s eyes. Otherwise Scripture would have written, <italic>la-adonai</italic>, meaning: is anything wondrous to the Lord? &#x201C;Wondrous from&#x201D; is not used in Hebrew.

<ftnote id="fn1108"><sup>42</sup> That <italic>va-yeda Elohim</italic> means God pitied them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1109"><sup>43</sup> According to I.E. <italic>kalah</italic> (altogether) is to be rendered as all, as in Ex. 11:1 (Krinsky). <italic>Have done this evil</italic> is a paraphrase of <italic>according to the cry of it, which is come unto me</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1110"><sup>44</sup> The reason that Scripture relates that God went down to see if they all did according to the cry that came before him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1111"><sup>45</sup> Ibn Ezra seems to be saying that &#x201C;Ordinarily&#x2026;God does not know the particular individual as such. He knows him only as implied in the whole&#x201D; (Husik, p. 193). Thus it was necessary for God to <italic>go down and see</italic>. Nachmanides criticized Ibn Ezra on this point for introducing alien philosophical concepts into Judaism. Cf. Nachmanides&#x2019; commentary on the Pentateuch, on this verse. Other commentaries could not accept the literal implication of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s words and harmonized his comments to conform to traditional thinking. See Krinsky. Some argue that this comment did not come from I.E.&#x2019;s hand but was inserted in the text by a misguided student.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1112"><sup>46</sup> Abraham asked God not to judge Sodom by his general knowledge but to look upon each of the city&#x2019;s inhabitants as an individual.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1113"><sup>47</sup> An interrogative <italic>heh</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>chataf pattach</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1114"><sup>48</sup> Hence an interrogative <italic>heh</italic> preceding the gutturals <italic>alef, heh, chet, ayin</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>, rather than with a <italic>chataf pattach</italic>. When the preceding letters are vocalized with a long <italic>kamatz</italic>, the interrogative is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1115"><sup>49</sup> I will spend (finish) all evil upon them. That is, there will be no further evil left to bring upon them. Cf. I.E. on Deut. 32:23 (translated according to I.E.).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1118"><sup>52</sup> The first explanation interprets <italic>chalilah</italic> in context. The second connects it to the word <italic>chalul</italic> (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1119"><sup>53</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>ve-haya kha-tzadik ka-rasha</italic> : that so the righteous should be as the wicked.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1120"><sup>54</sup> <italic>Ki kha-mokha ke-faroh</italic> is to be understood as if written: for thou art even as Pharaoh, and Pharaoh is even as thou.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1124"><sup>58</sup> <italic>Anokhi</italic>, meaning I, is a variant of <italic>ani</italic>. J.P.S. renders <italic>va-anokhi</italic> (literally, and I) as <italic>who am</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1125"><sup>59</sup> <italic>Ani</italic> and <italic>anokhi</italic>, and the two are not related.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1126"><sup>60</sup> Man&#x2019;s spirit does not turn to ashes (Weiser). Hence I.E. explains that dust and ashes refer to man&#x2019;s bones, which are made out of earth (Krinsky). Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 3:18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1127"><sup>61</sup> The <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ba-chamishah</italic> means because, i.e., because of five. I.E. makes this comment because <italic>bet</italic> usually means in.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1128"><sup>62</sup> That is, if there are 40 righteous people in Sodom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1129"><sup>63</sup> The text literally reads: I will not do for the sake of the 40. I.E. interprets it as: I will not do a destruction; i.e., I will not bring destruction. Cherez explains, God says, <italic>I will not destroy</italic>, and at other times, <italic>I will not do</italic>. I.E. points out that they mean the same thing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1130"><sup>64</sup> That is, from 50 to 45, from 45 to 40. Then Abraham asked if the Lord would destroy the city if 10 were missing from the number to which God had acceded. He no longer asked concerning five.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1131"><sup>65</sup> According to Cherez and Krinsky. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comment on verse 24. Perhaps we should render for God only promised with regard to Sodom as: <italic>If I find in Sodom</italic>, etc. (v. 26). Thus only the men of Sodom are to be counted in the total.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1133"><sup>67</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the rabbis could have used this verse as a support for the <italic>halakhah</italic> concerning the necessity of 10 men for public prayer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1134"><sup>68</sup> I.E. accepts the opinion that God revealed himself to Abraham after he sent the angels on their way (cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comments on v. 13).

<ftnote id="fn1135"><sup>69</sup> Which implies that Abraham looked upon Sodom before sunrise. See I.E. on Gen. 1:18 where he explains that morning comes before sunrise.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1136"><sup>70</sup> Gen. 19:23,24. Ibn Ezra implies that Abraham got up early in the morning to go to the place from which he could see Sodom. By the time he got there the sun had already risen and Sodom was destroyed (Weiser).</ftnote>

<p>2. BEHOLD NOW, MY LORDS. <italic>Adonai</italic> is to be rendered my lords. It does not refer to God.<sup><xref rid="fn1139">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the word <italic>sur</italic> (turn aside) is followed by a <italic>mem</italic> it means to turn away from.<sup><xref rid="fn1140">4</xref></sup> When it is followed by the word <italic>el</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1141">5</xref></sup> (to) it means turn from your place and come here, or turn from your place and go to a designated place.

<p>AND THEY SAID: &#x201C;NAY.&#x201D; Unless you urge us to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn1142">6</xref></sup> The word <italic>va-yiftzar</italic> (and he urged) indicates the use of many conciliatory words. <italic>Haftzar</italic> (stubbornness) in <italic>And stubbornness</italic> (haftzar) <italic>is as idolatry and teraphim</italic> (I Sam. 15:23)<sup><xref rid="fn1143">7</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>4. COMPASSED. <italic>Nasabbu</italic> (compassed) is a <italic>nifal</italic>.</p>
<p>ALL THE PEOPLE FROM EVERY QUARTER. Those who did not live in the vicinity of Lot&#x2019;s house.</p>
<p>5. THAT WE MAY KNOW THEM. A euphemism for sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>6. TO THE DOOR. <italic>Ha-petchah</italic> means to the door.<sup><xref rid="fn1144">8</xref></sup> The <italic>tav</italic> of the word <italic>delet</italic> (door) is the sign of the feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn1145">9</xref></sup> The word <italic>delet</italic> is also found spelled without the <italic>tav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1146">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. KNOWN MAN. The third person plural perfect is the same in both the masculine and feminine when not written with a <italic>vav</italic> conversive which is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1147">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>THESE. <italic>Ha-el</italic> (these) means the same as <italic>ha-eleh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1148">12</xref></sup> Saadiah Gaon claims that Scripture used the term <italic>ha-el</italic> because one of the three angels was missing.<sup><xref rid="fn1149">13</xref></sup> However, his comment is far-fetched, for the Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch renders both <italic>ha-el</italic> and <italic>ha-eleh</italic> by the same word.<sup><xref rid="fn1150">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. WITH BLINDNESS. <italic>Sanverim</italic> (blindness) has a quadriliteral root. This term is also found in the account of Elisha (II Kings 6:18). It refers to physical and intellectual blindness.<sup><xref rid="fn1151">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. HAST THOU HERE ANY BESIDES? SON-IN-LAW. If you have a son-in-law here.<sup><xref rid="fn1152">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THY SONS, AND THY DAUGHTERS. Or sons-in-law who are considered as your sons and daughters.<sup><xref rid="fn1153">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have here a refutation of the opinion that maintains that one of the two angels was sent to save Lot.<sup><xref rid="fn1154">18</xref></sup> For behold, both angels spoke to Lot. Furthermore, they said to him, <italic>for we will destroy this place</italic> (v. 13).<sup><xref rid="fn1155">19</xref></sup> Also, Lot later said to the angel, <italic>behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown unto me in saving my life</italic>, etc. (v. 19). Now that very angel replied to Lot, <italic>Hasten thou, escape thither, for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither</italic> (v. 22).<sup><xref rid="fn1156">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. WHO MARRIED HIS DAUGHTERS. Lot had two other daughters who perished in Sodom. This is clear from Scripture&#x2019;s statement: <italic>Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here</italic> (v. 15).<sup><xref rid="fn1157">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND WHEN THE MORNING AROSE. Rabbi Jonah, the Spanish grammarian,<sup><xref rid="fn1158">22</xref></sup> said that it is ungrammatical to say <italic>u-khemo alah ha-shachar</italic> (and when arose the morning).<sup><xref rid="fn1159">23</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Jonah seems to have forgotten the verse <italic>ve-ravu kemo ravu</italic> (and they shall increase as they have increased) (Zech. 10:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1160">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEN THE ANGELS HASTENED. <italic>Va-ya&#x2019;itzu</italic> (hastened) means they pressured. Compare, <italic>And the taskmasters were urgent</italic> (atzim), <italic>saying</italic> (Ex. 5:13).</p>
<p>[16. BUT HE LINGERED.] I am amazed by Ben Ephraim&#x2019;s<sup><xref rid="fn1161">25</xref></sup> commentary. He claims that <italic>va-yitmahmah</italic> (but he lingered) is derived from the same root as <italic>mah</italic> (what).<sup><xref rid="fn1162">26</xref></sup> However, he seems to have forgotten that both <italic>hehs</italic> of <italic>va-yitmahmah</italic> are pointed.<sup><xref rid="fn1163">27</xref></sup> In reality <italic>va-yitmahmah</italic> means lingered.

<p>AND THE MEN LAID HOLD UPON HIS HAND. The verse notes that Lot was overcome with fear and had no strength to flee on his own.</p>
<p>[17. WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT THEM FORTH.] <italic>Ke-hotzi&#x2019;am</italic> (when they had brought) is an infinitive. <italic>Ke-hotzi&#x2019;am</italic> should not be confused with <italic>le-hotzi&#x2019;am</italic> (to bring them out), in <italic>to bring them out</italic> (le-hotzi&#x2019;am) <italic>of the land of Egypt</italic> (Jer. 31:32), for in our verse the <italic>mem</italic> suffix stands for the subject, i.e., the angels.<sup><xref rid="fn1166">30</xref></sup> The object of the sentence, Lot and his family, are indicated by the word <italic>otam</italic> (them).</p>
<p>LOOK NOT BEHIND THEE. Neither you nor any that belong to you.<sup><xref rid="fn1167">31</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not eat of it</italic> (Gen. 2:17)<sup><xref rid="fn1168">32</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>18. OH, NOT SO MY LORD. <italic>Adonai</italic> (my lord) does not refer to God. It is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> only because it comes at the end of the verse.<sup><xref rid="fn1169">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Samuel Ha-Nagid the Spaniard, of blessed memory, said that <italic>al</italic> (not so) in <italic>al na</italic> (Oh, not so) is derived from the same root as <italic>ho&#x2019;il</italic> (wanted, was willing).<sup><xref rid="fn1170">34</xref></sup> However, I believe that <italic>al</italic> means no. The meaning of our verse is as follows: When the angels told Lot, <italic>escape to the mountain</italic>, Lot replied, &#x201C;Oh, not so my lords.&#x201D; He then turned to one of the angels and said, <italic>behold now, thy servant</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1171">35</xref></sup> <italic>hath found grace in thy sight</italic>, etc. (v. 19). He did so because he considered this angel to be the more important of the two. The truth is that even among angels there are superiors who lord it over other angels.</p>
<p>The <italic>tav</italic> of the root of <italic>mavet</italic> (death) is dropped in the word <italic>va-matti</italic> (and I die). The reason for this is that in the first person perfect a <italic>tav</italic> and a <italic>yod</italic> are added to the root. When the <italic>tav</italic> of the stem and the <italic>tav</italic> of the suffix come together, the <italic>tav</italic> of the root is lost in the pronunciation.<sup><xref rid="fn1172">36</xref></sup> The word <italic>ve-kharatta</italic> (and cut down) in <italic>them thou mayest destroy and cut down</italic> (ve-kharatta) (Deut. 20:20)<sup><xref rid="fn1173">37</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>20. A LITTLE ONE. The meaning of <italic>mitzar</italic> (a little one) is small. It comes from the same root as <italic>tza&#x2019;ir</italic> (young, little). It is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn1174">38</xref></sup> Even so, it is written without a <italic>heh</italic> at its end.<sup><xref rid="fn1175">39</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>shegal</italic> (consort).<sup><xref rid="fn1176">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. FROM THE LORD. This is a poetic way of saying from Himself.<sup><xref rid="fn1177">41</xref></sup> We similarly find Scripture repeating the term the children of Israel five times in one verse (Num. 8:19).</p>
<p>25. AND THAT WHICH GREW UPON THE GROUND. The trees growing there were consumed.</p>
<p>26. FROM BEHIND HIM. From behind Lot.<sup><xref rid="fn1178">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>A PILLAR. <italic>Nitziv</italic> (pillar) means the same as <italic>matzevah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1179">43</xref></sup> Her bones were burned by brimstone and she was encrusted in salt,<sup><xref rid="fn1180">44</xref></sup> for it is written, <italic>brimstone, and salt&#x2026;like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1181">45</xref></sup> (Deut. 29:22). This verse also shows that Zoar was not destroyed.<sup><xref rid="fn1182">46</xref></sup> The latter is also borne out by the words of the angel.<sup><xref rid="fn1183">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AS THE SMOKE OF. <italic>Ke-kitor</italic> means as the smoke of. <italic>Kitor</italic> is derived from the same root as <italic>ketoret</italic> (incense).<sup><xref rid="fn1184">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>A FURNACE. A place where fire is continually burning.</p>
<p>29. WHEN HE OVERTHREW THE CITIES IN WHICH LOT DWELT. In one of which Lot had been living.<sup><xref rid="fn1185">49</xref></sup> Each of these is similar: <italic>Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in the cities of Gilead</italic> (Jud. 12:7);<sup><xref rid="fn1186">50</xref></sup> <italic>Even upon a colt the foal of she-asses</italic> (Zech. 9:9);<sup><xref rid="fn1187">51</xref></sup> and <italic>And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they</italic> (Lev. 20:14).<sup><xref rid="fn1188">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. AND THE FIRST-BORN SAID. Lot possibly had a wife who predeceased the wife who turned into a pillar of salt.<sup><xref rid="fn1189">53</xref></sup> Lot&#x2019;s daughters thought that the world was destroyed by fire and brimstone in the same manner that it had previously been destroyed by the flood.</p>
<p>33. WHEN SHE LAY DOWN. <italic>Be-shichvah</italic> (when she lay down) is an infinitive even though it is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic> beneath the <italic>shin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1190">54</xref></sup> <italic>Be-shivri</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1191">55</xref></sup> in <italic>When I break</italic> (be-shivri) <italic>your staff of bread</italic> (Lev. 26:26) is similar.</p>

<ftnote id="fn1155"><sup>19</sup> Which shows that both angels destroyed Sodom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1156"><sup>20</sup> We thus see that the very angel who saved Lot was also involved in the destruction of Sodom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1157"><sup>21</sup> Which implies that he took the two daughters who were with him in the house. The term &#x201C;here&#x201D; implies that there were others.

Daughters implies at least two.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1159"><sup>23</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>u-khe-mo ha-shachar alah</italic> (and when the morning arose). The usual Biblical syntax for a clause such as ours is verb, noun, <italic>alah ha-shachar</italic>, rather than <italic>ha-shachar alah</italic> (Krinsky). Hence Ibn Janah&#x2019;s comments that <italic>kemo</italic> cannot come before a verb in the perfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1160"><sup>24</sup> <italic>Kemo</italic> is connected to <italic>ravu</italic>, a verb in the perfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1161"><sup>25</sup> A Kariate Biblical commentator.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1162"><sup>26</sup> It is written twice. S.D. Luzzato explains this as follows: When one rushes his companion, the latter replies, <italic>mah, mah</italic>, i.e., what do you want from me, why are you rushing me? Cf. Luzzato&#x2019;s commentary on Gen. 19:25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1163"><sup>27</sup> The <italic>heh</italic> is silent in <italic>mah</italic> (what). However, it is pointed in <italic>va-yitmahmah</italic> (but he lingered). I.E.&#x2019;s comment is difficult. Only the last <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>va-yitmahmah</italic> is pointed. Filwarg explains that what I.E. means is that the first <italic>heh</italic> has a <italic>sheva</italic> beneath it, while the final <italic>heh</italic> has a <italic>mapik</italic>. Hence <italic>va-yitmahmah</italic> cannot be derived from <italic>mah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1164"><sup>28</sup> Its root is <italic>mem, heh, heh</italic>. This root means to linger.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1165"><sup>29</sup> The <italic>mem</italic> is written twice in the word <italic>va-yitmahmah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1166"><sup>30</sup> While in <italic>le-hotzi&#x2019;am</italic> the <italic>mem</italic> suffix stands for the object.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1167"><sup>31</sup> <italic>Al tabbit</italic> (look not) is in the singular. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>al tabbit</italic> did not only apply to Lot, but to his entire household.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1168"><sup>32</sup> <italic>Thou shalt not eat of it</italic> is a singular. This command did not only apply to Adam. It also applied to Eve. Its meaning is thus: Neither you nor any of yours shall eat of it. Otherwise why would Eve have been punished?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1169"><sup>33</sup> <italic>Adonai</italic> with a <italic>kamatz</italic> usually refers to God. Here it does not. It means my lords. It is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> because the <italic>pattach</italic> changes to a <italic>kamatz</italic> at the end of a verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1170"><sup>34</sup> According to Rabbi Samuel the Nagid the word <italic>al</italic> is an imperative from the root <italic>yod, alef, lamed</italic>, meaning to want or to be willing (Krinsky).

<ftnote id="fn1171"><sup>35</sup> <italic>Avdekha</italic> (thy servant) is in the singular. Hence I.E. says that this was addressed to the angel whom Lot considered to be the most important of the two.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1172"><sup>36</sup> Otherwise <italic>and I die</italic> would be written with two <italic>tavs</italic>, rather than with one. The <italic>tav</italic> of the root is dropped (swallowed is the term used by I.E.) because it is difficult to pronounce two <italic>tavs</italic> in succession.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1173"><sup>37</sup> If the <italic>tav</italic> were not lost, <italic>ve-kharatta</italic> (and cut) would have two <italic>tavs</italic>, rather than one, for in the second person singular perfect a <italic>tav</italic> is added to the root.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1175"><sup>39</sup> City is feminine. Therefore the adjective modifying city should be feminine. A <italic>heh</italic> at the end of an adjective or noun indicates that the word is in the feminine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1176"><sup>40</sup> A consort is of course a female. Yet the noun <italic>shegal</italic> (consort) is written without a <italic>heh</italic> at its end.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1177"><sup>41</sup> The verse reads: <italic>Then the Lord caused to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven</italic>. The second <italic>from the Lord</italic> is redundant. The line should have read: then the Lord caused rain&#x2026;from Himself out of heaven. I.E. points out that it is poetic to repeat &#x201C;the Lord&#x201D; twice. The term I.E. uses for poetic is <italic>tzachot</italic> (elegant). Weiser interprets it to mean, in our context, precise. The Bible wanted to be precise.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1178"><sup>42</sup> In contradistinction to <italic>Targum Jonathan</italic>, who interpreted the word to mean from behind her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1179"><sup>43</sup> <italic>Matzevah</italic> is the term usually used for pillar, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1180"><sup>44</sup> Weiser suggests translating: she became a pillar of salt. He believes <italic>im melech</italic> (with salt) to be an error for <italic>ammud melech</italic> (a pillar of salt).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1181"><sup>45</sup> We thus see that salt as well as brimstone descended upon Sodom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1182"><sup>46</sup> Deut. 29:22 lists the following cities as being overthrown: Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zaboiim. Zoar is not mentioned.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1188"><sup>52</sup> <italic>They</italic> does not mean both women. It is only the second one who is burned. If a man is married to a woman and sleeps with her daughter, the daughter is burned. If he is married to the daughter and sleeps with her mother, then it is the mother who is burned. See I.E. on Lev. 20:14. Hence, although the plural is used, it means one of them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1189"><sup>53</sup> The Bible mentions that Lot had married daughters (v. 14) in addition to the ones whom he had at home (v. 8). It is unlikely that any of the unmarried daughters was older than any one of the married ones. I.E. therefore concludes that the married daughters were from a wife other than the mother of the first-born mentioned in our verse. Since the &#x201C;elder&#x201D; (literally, the first-born) was younger than the married daughters, she was from the second wife. In view of that fact that Scripture refers only to one wife in the account of Lot&#x2019;s fleeing from Sodom, I.E. assumes that Lot&#x2019;s first wife was then no longer alive.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 20</title>
<p>2. OF SARAH HIS WIFE. The word <italic>el</italic> in <italic>el Sarah</italic> (of Sarah) should be rendered <italic>al</italic> (of, concerning).<sup><xref rid="fn1194">1</xref></sup> <italic>El</italic> in <italic>For</italic> (el) <italic>this child I prayed</italic> (I Sam. 1:27) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1195">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The angel appeared to Abimelech in a dream because of God&#x2019;s regard for Abraham&#x2019;s honor.<sup><xref rid="fn1196">3</xref></sup> Scripture tells us that both Abimelech<sup><xref rid="fn1197">4</xref></sup> and Pharaoh<sup><xref rid="fn1198">5</xref></sup> took Sarah;<sup><xref rid="fn1199">6</xref></sup> nevertheless, God brought upon Pharaoh and his house great plagues,<sup><xref rid="fn1200">7</xref></sup> while the plagues brought on Abimelech and his house were of a lesser nature. The reason for this is that Abimelech was more righteous than Pharaoh.</p>
<p>[4. LORD, WILT THOU SLAY EVEN A RIGHTEOUS NATION?] The term <italic>nation</italic> includes Abimelech, his household and his kingdom. That this is so can be seen from Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1201">8</xref></sup> Pay no attention to the dreamer<sup><xref rid="fn1202">9</xref></sup> who changes the terms used in Scripture. The latter explains <italic>goy</italic> (nation) to mean <italic>ish</italic> (a person). I will elaborate a bit upon this in my comments on the verse <italic>to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power</italic> (Ex. 21:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1203">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. TO TOUCH. <italic>Li-nego&#x2019;a</italic> (to touch) means the same as <italic>la-ga&#x2019;at</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1204">11</xref></sup> The same is true<sup><xref rid="fn1205">12</xref></sup> with <italic>li-neto&#x2019;a</italic> (to plant)<sup><xref rid="fn1206">13</xref></sup> and <italic>la-ta&#x2019;at</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1207">14</xref></sup> All of the above are infinitives.<sup><xref rid="fn1208">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. WHAT HAST THOU DONE UNTO US? <italic>Meh</italic> (what) is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic> because it precedes a guttural.<sup><xref rid="fn1209">16</xref></sup> This is the rule in Hebrew grammar.</p>
<p>12. AND MOREOVER SHE IS INDEED MY SISTER, THE DAUGHTER OF MY FATHER. Some say that this verse is to be understood in the same way as <italic>O God of my father Abraham</italic> (Gen. 32:10).<sup><xref rid="fn1210">17</xref></sup> However, I believe that Abraham put Abimelech off with a timely excuse. When we come to the verse <italic>I am Esau thy first-born</italic> (Gen. 27:19), I will offer other examples of the same.<sup><xref rid="fn1211">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. WHEN GOD CAUSED ME TO WANDER. The word <italic>Elohim</italic> is to be rendered as God.<sup><xref rid="fn1212">19</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>hitu oti Elohim</italic> (God caused me to wander) is that God made Abraham journey from place to place without Abraham knowing where he would go next. <italic>To&#x2019;eh</italic> (wandering) in <italic>and, behold he was wandering</italic> (to&#x2019;eh) <italic>in the field</italic> (Gen. 37:15) is similar. <italic>Hitu</italic> (caused me to wander) in our verse is not to be translated as caused me to err.<sup><xref rid="fn1213">20</xref></sup> We find the Bible using the word <italic>to&#x2019;eh</italic> in the sense of erring<sup><xref rid="fn1214">21</xref></sup> in <italic>O Lord, why does Thou make us to err</italic> (tatenu) <italic>from thy ways</italic> (Is. 63:17).<sup><xref rid="fn1215">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>SAY OF ME. <italic>Imri li</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1216">23</xref></sup> is to be rendered: say of me. <italic>And Pharaoh will say of the children of</italic> (le-vene) <italic>Israel</italic> (Ex. 14:3)<sup><xref rid="fn1217">24</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>16. BEHOLD, IT IS FOR THEE A COVERING OF THE EYES. Some say that this alludes to the dimming of her son&#x2019;s (Isaac&#x2019;s) eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn1218">25</xref></sup> However, the latter is a Midrashic interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn1219">26</xref></sup> I believe that the phrase <italic>kesut enayim</italic> (a covering of the eyes) is to be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn1220">27</xref></sup> It is similar to the word not (<italic>al</italic>) in <italic>O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, and chasten me in Thy wrath</italic> (Ps. 38:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1221">28</xref></sup> There are many other such examples in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1222">29</xref></sup> Our verse is to be interpreted as follows: Behold, he, viz., Abraham thy husband, is for thee as a covering of the eyes, i.e., no one will dare lift up his eyes to thee.<sup><xref rid="fn1223">30</xref></sup> He is similarly a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee, namely, the handmaidens who are married to his servants.<sup><xref rid="fn1224">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-nokhachat</italic> (thou are righted) is rather like the Arabic <italic>fa</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1225">32</xref></sup> There are thousands of similar <italic>vavs</italic> in Scripture, an example being <italic>On the third day Abraham lifted up</italic> (va-yissa) <italic>his eyes</italic> (Gen. 22:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1226">33</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-nokhachat</italic> (thou are righted) is a comment by Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn1227">34</xref></sup> who added that Sarah did not ever again claim that Abraham was her brother. The meaning of <italic>ve-et kol</italic> (and before all men) is: after all this; i.e., after all this Sarah was chastened.<sup><xref rid="fn1228">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others explain that <italic>behold, it is for thee</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1229">36</xref></sup> refers to money which Abimelech gave for the purchase of a garment, and it is the word <italic>natati</italic> (I have given) that is to be read as if written twice. The verse is to be interpreted as follows: Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver to buy thee a covering (<italic>kesut</italic>), meaning a garment, that is appealing to the eye (<italic>enayim</italic>) and I have also given gifts to all that are with thee, and I have also given Abraham sheep, cattle, man and maidservants.<sup><xref rid="fn1230">37</xref></sup> However, my above quoted interpretation is better. It means that Abraham is a covering of the eyes to thee, before the servants that you had prior to coming here and before the servants that I have given you. Similarly <italic>ve-et kol</italic> (and before all men) means, and before all men Abraham is your <italic>covering of the eyes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1231">38</xref></sup> According to this interpretation only <italic>ve-nokhachat</italic> (and she was chastened)<sup><xref rid="fn1232">39</xref></sup> are the words of Moses. Hence the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-nokhachat</italic> is a connective <italic>vav</italic> as it is normally. Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>ve-nokhachat</italic> comes from <italic>nokhach</italic> (in front of).<sup><xref rid="fn1233">40</xref></sup> However, he is wrong.<sup><xref rid="fn1234">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND THEY BORE CHILDREN. That is, Abimelech&#x2019;s wife and maidservants. It does not refer to Abimelech.<sup><xref rid="fn1235">42</xref></sup> The following are similar: <italic>and shed the blood of war in peace</italic> (I Kings 2:5);<sup><xref rid="fn1236">43</xref></sup> <italic>He spoke unto them in the pillar of cloud</italic> (Ps. 99:7);<sup><xref rid="fn1237">44</xref></sup> <italic>These are the sons of Adah</italic> (Gen. 36:12);<sup><xref rid="fn1238">45</xref></sup> <italic>for whom I have served thee</italic> (Gen. 30:26),<sup><xref rid="fn1239">46</xref></sup> and <italic>the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor; and they served other gods</italic> (Josh. 24:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1240">47</xref></sup> That <italic>and they bore children</italic> does not apply to Abimelech is obvious from the fact that Abimelech per se is omitted from the verse which follows, <italic>For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham&#x2019;s wife</italic> (v. 18). I dwell on this point because there are commentators who insist that Abimelech&#x2019;s bowels were closed up and he could not eliminate.<sup><xref rid="fn1241">48</xref></sup> However, the presence of the phrase <italic>all the wombs</italic> (v. 18) clearly refutes their interpretation. The term <italic>va-yeledu</italic> (and they bore children) is used when referring to women even though it is a masculine form. Compare, <italic>va-yechemu ha-tzon</italic> (and the flocks conceived) (Gen. 30:39).<sup><xref rid="fn1242">49</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1194"><sup>1</sup> <italic>El</italic> is usually rendered to. Thus our phrase would ordinarily be translated: And Abraham said to Sarah she is my sister. However, this makes no sense. Therefore I.E. points out that <italic>al</italic> also has the meaning of, concerning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1195"><sup>2</sup> If we translated <italic>el</italic> to mean to, this verse would read: to this child I prayed. This would be an impossible rendering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1196"><sup>3</sup> Abimelech was no prophet and consequently would not experience prophetic visions. He did so only because God wanted to safeguard Abraham&#x2019;s wife. It should be noted that Scripture says God appeared to Abimelech. I.E. explains that God came to him via an angel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1197"><sup>4</sup> With regard to Abimelech it is written, <italic>And Abimelech King of Gerar sent, and took Sarah</italic> (v. 2).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1198"><sup>5</sup> <italic>So I took her (Sarah) to be my wife</italic> (Gen. 12:19).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1199"><sup>6</sup> Hence both committed the same sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1200"><sup>7</sup> Gen. 12:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1201"><sup>8</sup> Verse 9, in which we read, <italic>What hast thou done unto us&#x2026;that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin?</italic> Thus Abimelech was worried about his kingdom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1202"><sup>9</sup> A term used by I.E. for one who comes up with a far-fetched interpretation. See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 2:11. According to Weiser the allusion is to Saadiah. Saadiah renders our verse, &#x201C;Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous man?&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1203"><sup>10</sup> Saadiah renders people as person. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Ex. 21:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1204"><sup>11</sup> Our verse employs <italic>li-nego&#x2019;a</italic>. The root of <italic>li-nego&#x2019;a</italic> is <italic>nun, gimel, ayin</italic>. In <italic>la-ga&#x2019;at</italic> the <italic>nun</italic> is dropped; in <italic>li-nego&#x2019;a</italic> it remains. The point is that in this <italic>peh nun</italic> the <italic>nun</italic> is not dropped in one form of the infinitive. It is treated as a <italic>shelemim</italic>, a root that does not drop a letter. We find the same with the root <italic>nun, tet, ayin</italic> (to plant).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1205"><sup>12</sup> The word can be expressed in two ways.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1206"><sup>13</sup> Cf. Is. 51:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1207"><sup>14</sup> Cf. Eccles. 3:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1208"><sup>15</sup> They are also <italic>kal</italic> forms.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1209"><sup>16</sup> The <italic>ayin</italic> of <italic>asita</italic> (thou hast done) is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>. I.E. points out that the Hebrew word for &#x201C;what&#x201D; is always vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic>, (<italic>meh</italic>) whenever it comes before an <italic>ayin</italic> vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>. The usual vocalization of &#x201C;what&#x201D; is with a <italic>pattach</italic> (<italic>mah</italic>), hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1210"><sup>17</sup> That <italic>daughter of my father</italic> is short for the daughter of my brother, the son of my father, in the same way as <italic>O God of my father Abraham</italic> is short for O God of my father&#x2019;s father Abraham (Weiser). Some identify Sarah with Iscah, the daughter of Haran. I.E. rejects this identification. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s commentary on Gen. 11:29. Krinsky suggests that what I.E. means is that grandchildren are considered as children. Thus Sarah, the daughter of Haran, was considered Terah&#x2019;s daughter and hence Abraham&#x2019;s sister. Similarly Jacob is considered Abraham&#x2019;s son.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1211"><sup>18</sup> Jacob also was not telling the full truth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1212"><sup>19</sup> <italic>Hitu</italic> is the plural. Hence at first glance <italic>Elohim</italic> cannot refer to God since there is only one God. I.E. points out that even so, <italic>Elohim</italic> here refers to God. It should be noted that Onkelos apparently took <italic>Elohim</italic> as referring to idols. See also Rashi&#x2019;s note on this verse. Cf. M. Adler&#x2019;s commentary on Onkelos, <italic>Netivat Ha-Ger</italic>, Israel, 1968.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1213"><sup>20</sup> Onkelos renders <italic>to&#x2019;eh</italic> as err.

<ftnote id="fn1214"><sup>21</sup> According to Cherez. For an alternate interpretation see Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1215"><sup>22</sup> The root of err is <italic>tav, ayin, heh</italic>, the same as the root for wander. The word can therefore mean wander or err. Erring is an intellectual wandering.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1220"><sup>27</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 2:8 and the note thereto.

The Hebrew word <italic>hu</italic> can mean either he or it, Hebrew having no neuter term.

<ftnote id="fn1221"><sup>28</sup> The word not (<italic>al</italic>) in Ps. 38:2 is to be read as if written twice: O Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, chasten me not in thy wrath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1222"><sup>29</sup> In which a word written once is to be read as if written twice. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 14:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1223"><sup>30</sup> Because Abraham is your husband. What I.E. seems to be saying is that <italic>covering of the eyes</italic> refers to other men&#x2019;s eyes, i.e., because of Abraham it is as if other men&#x2019;s eyes are covered.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1224"><sup>31</sup> No one will molest any of the handmaidens; i.e., because of Abraham no one will dare lift up his eyes to Sarah or her handmaidens (Filwarg). Weiser explains I.E. as meaning that the handmaidens will honor Sarah and not treat her with disdain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1225"><sup>32</sup> This <italic>vav</italic> is not a connective but is similar to the Arabic <italic>fa</italic> which serves as a particle introducing the principal part of the sentence (Friedlander).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1226"><sup>33</sup> If the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>va-yissa</italic> were a connective <italic>vav</italic>, the verse would read: On the third day and Abraham lifted up his eyes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1227"><sup>34</sup> And not spoken by Abimelech. Abimelech would not first apologize and then reprimand Sarah; hence <italic>and after all this Sarah was chastened</italic> (ve-et kol nokhachat) is a comment by Moses on the affair. It should be noted that I.E. interprets <italic>ve-nokhachat</italic> (thou art righted) as chastened, and <italic>ve-et kol</italic> (and before all man) as: and all, which he explains to mean, and after all this.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1228"><sup>35</sup> I.E. interprets <italic>ve-et kol ve-nokhachat</italic> as: and after all of this, and after this incident, she was chastened. Netter interprets I.E. as saying: even with all this honor done to her, Sarah was chastened. If the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-nokhachat</italic> were a connective <italic>vav</italic>, the phrase would read: and after all this and she was chastened, a very awkward construction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1229"><sup>36</sup> See note 27. According to this interpretation <italic>a covering of the eyes</italic> means a garment appealing to the eyes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1230"><sup>37</sup> This is implied in <italic>ve-et kol</italic> (and all). It is to be interpreted <italic>ve-et kol asher natati</italic>, plus everything that I have already given. It should be noted that this third <italic>natati</italic> is implied in <italic>ve-et kol</italic> and does not pertain to the <italic>natati</italic> which is to be taken as if written twice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1231"><sup>38</sup> That the <italic>covering of the eyes</italic> refers to Abraham.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1232"><sup>39</sup> According to this interpretation Abimelech&#x2019;s statement concludes with: and before all men Abraham is your covering of the eyes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1233"><sup>40</sup> It comes from the root <italic>nun, caf, chet</italic>, meaning in front of; i.e., you are now able to stand before anyone without shame (Weiser, Cherez).</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 21</title>
<p>2. AT THE SET TIME OF WHICH GOD HAD SPOKEN TO HIM. The reference is to the angel who had asked, <italic>Where is Sarah thy wife?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1243">1</xref></sup> The same angel also returned to Abraham, for he had promised to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn1244">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>[3. ISAAC.] God never added any letter to Isaac&#x2019;s name; neither did He ever change it, for God Himself commanded Abraham to call his son Isaac.<sup><xref rid="fn1245">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. MAKING SPORT. Ishmael was acting as a boy is wont to act. Sarah was jealous because he was older than her son.</p>
<p>11. ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SON. <italic>Odot</italic> means account of.</p>
<p>14. AND A BOTTLE OF WATER. <italic>Chemet</italic> (bottle) is a vessel. It is possibly made out of skin or wood. <italic>Chamatekha</italic> (thy venom) in <italic>That puttest thy venom</italic> (chamatekha) <italic>thereto</italic> (Hab. 2:15)<sup><xref rid="fn1246">4</xref></sup> is analogous.</p>
<p>Many are amazed at Abraham&#x2019;s behavior. They ask, how could Abraham chase his son out of his house? How could he send away mother and child empty handed? Where was his kindness? However, I am amazed at those who are amazed at Abraham, for Abraham acted according to God&#x2019;s dictates.<sup><xref rid="fn1247">5</xref></sup> Had he acted contrary to Sarah&#x2019;s wishes and given money to Hagar, then he would have transgressed God&#x2019;s command. However, ultimately, after Sarah&#x2019;s death, he gave gifts to Ishmael&#x2019;s children.<sup><xref rid="fn1248">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>BREAD AND A BOTTLE OF WATER. He gave the bread and bottle of water to Hagar and placed them upon her shoulder. He then told her, &#x201C;Take your son with you,&#x201D; and he sent her away. It is possible that Abraham gave Hagar some gold and silver, although this is not mentioned in Scripture. Abraham at that time lived in Gerar. He gave Hagar enough bread and water to last her till she reached Beersheba.<sup><xref rid="fn1249">7</xref></sup> However, Hagar did not know the way and strayed in the wilderness of Beersheba. Ishmael became ill from lack of water. She took him to her bosom<sup><xref rid="fn1250">8</xref></sup> and when she saw that he was dying of thirst, she cast him under one of the shrubs.</p>
<p>15. UNDER ONE OF THE SHRUBS. One of the trees.<sup><xref rid="fn1251">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AS IT WERE A BOWSHOT. <italic>Ki-metachave</italic> (as it were a shot) is not found elsewhere in the Bible. Its definition is known.<sup><xref rid="fn1252">10</xref></sup> It means the distance an arrow travels after being shot.</p>
<p>20. AN ARCHER. Compare, <italic>Call together the archers</italic> (rabbim) <italic>against Babylon</italic> (Jer. 50:29). Although <italic>roveh</italic> (archer) in our verse and <italic>rabbim</italic> (archers) (in Jer. 50:29) come from different roots, they mean the same thing.<sup><xref rid="fn1253">11</xref></sup> We find a similar case with the words <italic>sarar</italic> and <italic>sarah</italic> (ruled over),<sup><xref rid="fn1254">12</xref></sup> also the words <italic>ravah</italic> and <italic>ravav</italic>, both of which mean increased.<sup><xref rid="fn1255">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>ARCHER. <italic>Kashat</italic> (archer) is an adjective. Compare, <italic>gannav</italic> (thief).<sup><xref rid="fn1256">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>HAVE I EVEN HERE SEEN HIM THAT SEETH ME?<sup><xref rid="fn1257">15</xref></sup> The angel first appeared to her here.<sup><xref rid="fn1258">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. THAT THOU WILT NOT DEAL FALSELY WITH ME. <italic>Tishkor</italic> (thou wilt deal falsely) is a <italic>kal</italic>. This is the only place in the Bible that this word appears in the <italic>kal</italic>.</p>
<p>MY SON&#x2019;S SON. <italic>Nechdi</italic> is to be rendered the son of my son.</p>
<p>29. WHAT MEAN THESE. <italic>Hennah</italic> (these) is feminine.</p>
<p>BY THEMSELVES. <italic>Levaddanah</italic> (by themselves) is spelled with a <italic>heh</italic> at the end of the word. This is the only place in Scripture where the word is so written.</p>
<p>30. A WITNESS. <italic>Le-edah</italic> means a witness. It should be noted that the word for oath (<italic>shevu&#x2019;ah</italic>) comes from the word for seven (<italic>shivah</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1259">17</xref></sup> I will elaborate on this point in my comments on the term <italic>oh hishavah shevu&#x2019;ah</italic> (or sweareth an oath).<sup><xref rid="fn1260">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. A TAMARISK-TREE. <italic>Eshel</italic> (a tamarisk tree) is a tree.<sup><xref rid="fn1261">19</xref></sup> The word <italic>va-yitta</italic> (and he planted) which precedes it is also proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1262">20</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1243"><sup>1</sup> Gen. 18:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1244"><sup>2</sup> <italic>I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son</italic> (Gen. 18:10). I.E. points out that the angel kept his word even though this is not recorded in Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1245"><sup>3</sup> Abraham&#x2019;s name received an additional letter (Gen. 17:5). Jacob&#x2019;s name was changed to Israel (Gen. 32:29). Isaac was the only one of Israel&#x2019;s three patriarchs not to have his name changed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1246"><sup>4</sup> I.E. renders <italic>chamatekha</italic> (thy venom) as thy vessel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1247"><sup>5</sup> God had told Abraham, <italic>in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice</italic> (v. 12).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1248"><sup>6</sup> Gen. 25:6. The children of the concubines included Ishmael. As long as Sarah lived Abraham was bound to obey her with regard to Ishmael. After her death he was free to show his concern for Ishmael, and he did.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1249"><sup>7</sup> I.E. assumes that Beersheba was Hagar&#x2019;s destination and that Abraham gave her enough provisions to last her till she got there. He did not simply cast her out into the desert (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1250"><sup>8</sup> I.E. previously noted that Hagar did not carry Ishmael. He therefore has to explain <italic>and she cast the child</italic> (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1251"><sup>9</sup> To provide him with shade (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1252"><sup>10</sup> Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1253"><sup>11</sup> The root of archer in our verse is <italic>resh, bet, heh</italic> ; in Jeremiah it is <italic>resh, bet, bet</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1254"><sup>12</sup> In Es. 1:22 <italic>sorer</italic> (bear rule) comes from the root <italic>sin</italic>, <italic>resh, resh</italic> ; in Hos. 12:4 <italic>sarah</italic> (he strove or ruled over) comes from the root <italic>sin, resh, heh</italic> (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1255"><sup>13</sup> The root of <italic>ravah</italic> is <italic>resh, bet, heh.</italic> The root of <italic>ravav</italic> is <italic>resh, bet, bet.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1256"><sup>14</sup> <italic>Keshet</italic> is a bow, <italic>kashat</italic> an archer. That this is the case can be seen from its vocalization of a <italic>pattach kamatz.</italic> This vocalization indicates an adjective, as seen from the word <italic>gannav.</italic> Hence <italic>roveh</italic> is not in the construct with <italic>kashat.</italic> The verse is to be read: he was a shooter, an archer (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1257"><sup>15</sup> This phrase is taken from Gen. 16:13. Some suggest that there is a scribal error in our text and that this comment has been misplaced from 16:13. However, see next note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1258"><sup>16</sup> That is, she came to the same place where the angel had first appeared to her after she had been cast out by Sarah when pregnant with Ishmael (Chap. 16). Perhaps the original reading in I.E. was: and he dwelt in the wilderness, the place where she (his mother) once said, &#x201C;Have I even here seen Him that seeth me&#x201D; (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1259"><sup>17</sup> The number seven has a mystical meaning. An oath is somehow connected to this mystery. It is for this reason that Abraham took seven ewe lambs (Weiser). Since <italic>shevu&#x2019;ah</italic> comes from <italic>shivah</italic>, Abraham called the place <italic>be&#x2019;ersheva</italic>, rather than <italic>be&#x2019;er shevu&#x2019;ah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1260"><sup>18</sup> For some reason I.E. did not elaborate on this in his comments on Num. 30:3. See Weiser. Also see I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Zech. 4:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1261"><sup>19</sup> Cf. I Sam. 22:6. Some of the Talmudic sages interpret <italic>eshel</italic> to mean an inn (<italic>Sotah</italic> 10a), hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1262"><sup>20</sup> Aside from the fact that we know from other sources that <italic>eshel</italic> is a tree, our verse also indicates the same.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 22</title>
<p>1. THAT GOD DID PROVE ABRAHAM. Some say that the word <italic>nissah</italic> (did prove, tested) is a variation of <italic>nissa</italic> (lifted up),<sup><xref rid="fn1263">1</xref></sup> with the <italic>sin</italic> replacing the <italic>samekh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1264">2</xref></sup> and the <italic>heh</italic> replacing the <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1265">3</xref></sup> However, the plain meaning of the entire chapter contradicts this interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn1266">4</xref></sup> The word <italic>nissah</italic> is thus to be taken literally. The philosophers teach that there are two kinds of knowledge, knowledge of events prior to their occurrence, and knowledge of what is presently in existence. The latter is the meaning of <italic>God did prove,</italic> and <italic>for now I know</italic> (v. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn1267">5</xref></sup> Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>did prove</italic> means that God tested Abraham in order to demonstrate his piety to mankind; furthermore, he interprets <italic>for now I know that thou art a God-fearing man</italic> (v. 12) to mean that now I have made known to all that thou art a God-fearing man. But didn&#x2019;t Saadiah know that even Abraham&#x2019;s young men were not present when he bound Isaac and placed him on the altar?<sup><xref rid="fn1268">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that <italic>and offer him there for a burnt offering</italic> is to be interpreted as: bring him up to the mountain; this will be considered as if you brought him up as a burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1269">7</xref></sup> However, Abraham did not understand his prophetic vision<sup><xref rid="fn1270">8</xref></sup> and hurried to sacrifice Isaac. God then told him, &#x201C;I did not ask you to slay Isaac.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Still others say that God told Abraham: act as if you were bringing him up as a burnt offering. We find a similar occurrence in connection with the prophet Jeremiah, who was commanded to <italic>Go unto the house of the Rechabites&#x2026;and give them wine to drink</italic> (Jer. 35:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1271">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now these geonim offered the above interpretations because they held that it is not possible that God would issue a command and then take it back.<sup><xref rid="fn1272">10</xref></sup> However, they overlooked the fact that God took the firstborn to serve Him and after a year replaced them with the Levites.<sup><xref rid="fn1273">11</xref></sup> In reality all questions are removed by Scripture&#x2019;s first stating <italic>that God did prove Abraham</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1274">12</xref></sup> The reason God tested Abraham was in order to reward him.<sup><xref rid="fn1275">13</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>for now I know that</italic> (v. 12) is the same as <italic>and if not, I will know</italic> (Gen. 18:21).<sup><xref rid="fn1276">14</xref></sup> I will also explain, if God who knows all hidden things will help me, the secret meaning of this term in my comments on <italic>I know thee by name</italic> (Ex. 33:12).</p>
<p>2. UPON ONE OF THE MOUNTAINS. The temple was later built on this mountain. This is explicitly stated in Scripture: <italic>So Solomon built the house on Mount Moriah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1277">15</xref></sup> It was not a very tall mountain. The threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite was on it.</p>
<p>3. AND HE CLEAVED THE WOOD FOR THE BURNT-OFFERING. And placed them on his ass.<sup><xref rid="fn1278">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. ON THE THIRD DAY. That he set out from Beersheba. Some ask, how could Abraham say, <italic>and (we will) come back to you</italic> (v. 5)?<sup><xref rid="fn1279">17</xref></sup> Others answer them by saying that Abraham intended to return with Isaac&#x2019;s bones, and he disguised his intentions so that his young men would wait for him till he returned and Isaac would not know what was about to happen and flee.<sup><xref rid="fn1280">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our sages, of blessed memory, say that Isaac was thirty-seven years old at the time of his binding.<sup><xref rid="fn1281">19</xref></sup> If this be a tradition, we will accept it. However, from a strictly logical point of view it is unacceptable. If Isaac was an adult at this time, then his piety should have been revealed in Scripture and his reward should be double that of his father for willingly having submitted himself to be sacrificed. Yet Scripture says nothing concerning Isaac&#x2019;s great self-sacrifice. Others say that Isaac was five years old at the time of his binding. This, too, is unacceptable, since Isaac carried the wood for the sacrificial pyre.<sup><xref rid="fn1282">20</xref></sup> It thus appears logical to assume that Isaac was close to thirteen years old and that Abraham overpowered him and bound him against his will. Proof of this can be seen from the fact that Abraham hid his intention from Isaac and told him, <italic>God will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son</italic> (v. 8). Abraham knew that if he said, &#x201C;You are to be the burnt-offering,&#x201D; Isaac would quite possibly have fled.</p>
<p>11. ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM. The repetition of the name expresses urgency.</p>
<p>13. BEHIND HIM A RAM CAUGHT IN THE THICKET. Abraham beheld a ram after (<italic>achar</italic>) it had been caught in the thicket by its horns.<sup><xref rid="fn1283">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the <italic>chet</italic> of <italic>ne&#x2019;echaz</italic> (caught) is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>, then the word &#x201C;was&#x201D; is missing from the text and the meaning of the phrase is, after it was yet caught in the thicket.<sup><xref rid="fn1284">22</xref></sup> There are many other similar instances.<sup><xref rid="fn1285">23</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>achar</italic> is connected to <italic>And Abraham lifted up his eyes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1286">24</xref></sup> But if this were so, the word <italic>achar</italic> would have been followed by <italic>ken</italic> or <italic>zot</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1287">25</xref></sup> as is the case whenever the word <italic>achar</italic> (after) indicates a pause.</p>
<p>14. [IN THE MOUNT WHERE THE LORD IS SEEN.] The meaning of this clause can be ascertained in my comments on <italic>These are the words</italic> (Deut. 1:1).<sup><xref rid="fn1288">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. BY MYSELF HAVE I SWORN. <italic>By Myself</italic> indicates a great and eternal oath.<sup><xref rid="fn1289">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>BECAUSE. <italic>Ya&#x2019;an</italic> (because) is similar in meaning to <italic>anah</italic> (testify or bear witness).<sup><xref rid="fn1290">28</xref></sup> The meaning of the term is: this act will testify and bear witness.<sup><xref rid="fn1291">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THE GATE OF HIS ENEMIES. Cities surrounded by walls having gates.</p>
<p>18. BECAUSE. <italic>Ekev</italic> (because) means a reward that is granted at the end.<sup><xref rid="fn1292">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. SO ABRAHAM RETURNED. Isaac is not mentioned because he was under Abraham&#x2019;s care. Those who say that Abraham slaughtered Isaac and left him on the altar and following this Isaac came to life are contradicting Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1293">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. BEHOLD, MILKAH, SHE ALSO HATH BORNE. This is stated to inform us of Rebekah&#x2019;s pedigree.<sup><xref rid="fn1294">32</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1263"><sup>1</sup> The problem which some commentators found in a literal translation of <italic>nissah</italic> as prove is that it seemed to imply that God did not know what Abraham&#x2019;s response to his request would be. They thus interpreted <italic>nissa</italic> as coming from <italic>nun, sin, alef</italic>, meaning lifted up; i.e., God exalted Abraham by showing him to be a paragon of absolute obedience to the Lord&#x2019;s will. Cf. <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 80:55.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1264"><sup>2</sup> <italic>Nissah</italic> is spelled <italic>nun, samekh, heh</italic> ; <italic>nassah</italic> is spelled <italic>nun, sin, alef</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1265"><sup>3</sup> The <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>nissah</italic>, like the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>nasa</italic>, is silent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1266"><sup>4</sup> The chapter deals with a test, a trial. Hence <italic>nissah</italic> means proved, tested, not exalted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1267"><sup>5</sup> God knew (now I know) what Abraham would do if tested. However, until Abraham offered Isaac, God&#x2019;s knowledge was knowledge of the potential or possible. He tested Abraham (did prove) to actualize His knowledge (Krinsky). He now knew what Abraham did, not only what Abraham would do.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1268"><sup>6</sup> Cf. verse 5. In other words, no one was there to witness his act.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1269"><sup>7</sup> The word translated as offer him &#x007B; <italic>ve-ha&#x2019;alehu</italic>) literally means bring him up.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1270"><sup>8</sup> He thought that God actually wanted him to offer his son as a burnt offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1271"><sup>9</sup> The Rechabites were foresworn by Rechab from drinking wine (Jer., Chap. 35). When God told Jeremiah, <italic>and give them wine to drink</italic> he did not intend that Jeremiah actually make them drink. Similarly God&#x2019;s intention was not that Abraham actually sacrifice Isaac. He wanted Abraham to make all the preparations necessary for the sacrifice, i.e., to bind Isaac, lay him on the altar, etc. He was to do everything as if he were offering him as a sacrifice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1272"><sup>10</sup> God is unchangeable; hence his mind, too, is unchangeable. Therefore they offered the latter two interpretations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1273"><sup>11</sup> The first-born were at first sanctified to God to minister before him (Ex. 13:2). However, the next year the Levites took their place. Cf. Num. 3:40-44.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1274"><sup>12</sup> God did not change His mind. He never intended for Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1275"><sup>13</sup> For his willingness to sacrifice his son in obedience to His will. I.E. now backsteps and explains why God, who is all-knowing, tested Abraham. He had earlier insisted that &#x201C;prove&#x201D; is to be taken literally. He now explains why. He similarly alludes to the meaning of <italic>for now I know</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1277"><sup>15</sup> Cf. I Kings 6:14 and II Chron. 3:1. The verse quoted by I.E. does not appear anywhere in the Bible. It is a composite of these two verses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1278"><sup>16</sup> I.E. derives this from Scripture&#x2019;s stating that after Abraham left his young men with the ass (v. 5), he placed the wood on Isaac (v. 6). This implies that until then the wood was on the ass (Weiser).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1283"><sup>21</sup> Scripture reads: <italic>achar ne&#x2019;achaz</italic>. This is ungrammatical. I.E. suggests that it be interpreted as if written, <italic>achar she-ne&#x2019;echaz</italic> (after it had been caught). J.P.S. renders <italic>achar</italic> (after) as behind him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1284"><sup>22</sup> In our texts the word <italic>ne&#x2019;echaz</italic> (caught) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>. When <italic>ne&#x2019;echaz</italic> is so vocalized it is a third person perfect, meaning it was caught. However, there are texts in which <italic>ne&#x2019;echaz</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>. In this instance <italic>ne&#x2019;echaz</italic> is a participle, meaning it is caught. If this be the case, then the word &#x201C;was&#x201D; has to be inserted in the text to make sense out of the verse, as &#x201C;was&#x201D; followed by a participle is proper Hebrew.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1285"><sup>23</sup> &#x201C;Was&#x201D; followed by a participle indicates a continuous action. Compare, in Rabbinic literature, <italic>hu hayah omer</italic> &#x007B; <italic>Aboth</italic> 1:2), literally translated, he was saying; i.e., he used to say.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1286"><sup>24</sup> The meaning of our verse being: and Abraham lifted up his eyes after this and saw a ram caught in the thicket by its horns. Until now I.E. explains <italic>achar</italic> (after) as being connected to caught. This new interpretation suggests that <italic>achar</italic> concludes the first clause in our verse. This is the opinion of Rashi and Onkelos. According to them our verse reads: And Abraham lifted up his eyes after this.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1287"><sup>25</sup> Cf. <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 and Filwarg. Our text is probably corrupt. The word <italic>achar</italic> is always in the construct. When <italic>achar</italic> is not in the construct it is written, <italic>achar ken</italic> or <italic>achar zot</italic>. Hence our verse should read <italic>achar ken</italic>. Since it does not, <italic>achar</italic> cannot be connected to the preceding clause but rather to what follows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1288"><sup>26</sup> I.E. implies in his commentary on Deut. 1:1 that certain phrases in the Pentateuch, among them this phrase, were added later.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1291"><sup>29</sup> The primary meaning of <italic>ya&#x2019;an</italic> is, what is going to happen will bear witness that, etc. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Is. 7:15 and Friedlander&#x2019;s comment thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1292"><sup>30</sup> <italic>Ekev</italic> means heel. The heel is the bottom of a person; hence it means the reward ultimately given (at the end) for a deed (Krinsky, Weiser, Cherez). Thus the clause should be rendered: as a reward for thou hast harkened to my voice.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 23</title>
<h1>CHAYE SARAH</h1>
<p>1. THE LIFE OF. The word life (<italic>chayyim</italic>) is always encountered in the plural. We never find it in the singular.</p>
<p>[A HUNDRED AND SEVEN AND TWENTY YEARS.] Hebrew usually first lists the larger numbers and then the smaller ones.<sup><xref rid="fn1295">1</xref></sup> But we also find the opposite, an example being Scripture&#x2019;s enumeration of Jacob&#x2019;s years<sup><xref rid="fn1296">2</xref></sup> (Gen. 47:28).</p>
<p>2. KIRIATH-ARBA. Arba was the name of one of the great men of the Anakim.<sup><xref rid="fn1297">3</xref></sup> The identification of Arba with Abraham is homiletical,<sup><xref rid="fn1298">4</xref></sup> as Abraham was not of that race. When Sarah died Abraham was elsewhere; hence Scripture states, <italic>and Abraham came</italic>.</p>
<p>AND TO WEEP FOR HER. The word <italic>livkotah</italic> is to be rendered <italic>to weep for her. And bewail her father</italic> (Deut. 21:13)<sup><xref rid="fn1299">5</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>3. BEFORE HIS DEAD. This alludes to the body.<sup><xref rid="fn1300">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>[SAYING.] The explanation of this term is found elsewhere in this commentary.<sup><xref rid="fn1301">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. I AM A STRANGER. When the word stranger (<italic>ger</italic>) stands by itself, it refers to a transient stranger. <italic>And a sojourner</italic> (ve-toshav) means a resident stranger.<sup><xref rid="fn1302">8</xref></sup> Abraham said to them, &#x201C;I am a sojourner among you. We are all mortal, I do not have a possession (<italic>achuzah</italic>) i.e., an inherited or bought piece of land<sup><xref rid="fn1303">9</xref></sup> for use as a burial plot.&#x201D;</p>
<p>6. MY LORD. Not our lord.<sup><xref rid="fn1304">10</xref></sup> One man spoke. He employed the term my lord because it is impolite to include others when one is speaking as a subordinate.<sup><xref rid="fn1305">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>A MIGHTY PRINCE. Because thou art a prophet. The term <italic>elohim</italic> (mighty) is used in the sense of great.<sup><xref rid="fn1306">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHALL WITHHOLD. <italic>Yikhleh</italic> means shall withhold.<sup><xref rid="fn1307">13</xref></sup> It can be spelled either with a <italic>heh</italic> or an <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1308">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>[7. AND BOWED DOWN.] I have given the grammatical explanation of this word in <italic>The Book of Foundation</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1309">15</xref></sup> Those who say that Abraham bowed down to God speak nonsense.<sup><xref rid="fn1310">16</xref></sup> Scripture explicitly states that Abraham bowed to the children of Heth. Bowing means a bending of the head.<sup><xref rid="fn1311">17</xref></sup> It is a way of showing reverence. Moses also bowed before his father-in-law.<sup><xref rid="fn1312">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. THE CAVE OF MACHPELAH. A cave within a cave.</p>
<p>FOR THE FULL PRICE. The opposite of <italic>male</italic> (full) is <italic>chaser</italic> (lacking).<sup><xref rid="fn1313">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. NAY. Not so, <italic>my lord,</italic> only hear me.<sup><xref rid="fn1314">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND. Abraham bowed before Ephron in the presence of the people of the land in order to honor him.</p>
<p>13. BUT IF THOU WILT, I PRAY THEE, HEAR ME. If you will do this<sup><xref rid="fn1315">21</xref></sup> I pray thee, hear me. Or it may mean, if you will do this, I pray thee, when I will give the price of the field, take it of me.<sup><xref rid="fn1316">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. CURRENT MONEY WITH THE MERCHANT. Merchants accept only the best currency.</p>
<p>17. WERE MADE SURE. The field was made sure and passed permanently into Abraham&#x2019;s possession. This verse and the one that preceded it are to be read as one verse. Similarly the verse opening with <italic>I am a stranger and a sojourner</italic> (v. 4) and the verse which precedes it are to be read as one verse. The ten pairs of verses that Saadiah Gaon listed as being in reality one verse are in fact not to be read as one verse.<sup><xref rid="fn1317">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>[18. IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CHILDREN OF HETH.] The local inhabitants.</p>
<p>[BEFORE ALL THAT WENT IN AT THE GATE OF HIS CITY.] Those who happened to be passing by.</p>
<p>19. AND AFTER THIS, ABRAHAM BURIED SARAH HIS WIFE. After the burial of Sarah the field was made sure as a burial ground possession belonging to Abraham and his descendants.<sup><xref rid="fn1318">24</xref></sup> Scripture tells of the purchase of the field of Machpelah to teach us of the superiority of the land of Israel over all countries, both for the living and the dead. Moreover, it informs us that God&#x2019;s word to Abraham that he would possess the land as an inheritance was fulfilled.<sup><xref rid="fn1319">25</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1295"><sup>1</sup> Verse 1 literally reads, <italic>And the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty and seven years</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1296"><sup>2</sup> Gen. 47:28 literally reads, <italic>So the days of Jacob, the years of his life were seven years and forty and a hundred years</italic>. Here Scripture lists the smaller numbers first.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1297"><sup>3</sup> Cf. <italic>Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim</italic> (Josh. 14:15); <italic>even Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the father of Anak</italic> (Josh. 15:13).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1298"><sup>4</sup> <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 14:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1299"><sup>5</sup> <italic>Livkotah</italic> is made up of two words, <italic>livkot</italic> (to weep) and the object <italic>otah</italic> (her). This combination of pronoun and object can only be made with a transitive verb. However, <italic>livkotah</italic> is intransitive. The meaning of <italic>livkotah</italic> is thus to weep her, an impossible rendering. Hence I.E. comments that the meaning of our word is to weep for her. He points out that the same is true in Deut. 21:13 (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1300"><sup>6</sup> His dead (<italic>meto</italic>) is in the masculine. However, Sarah was a woman. Thus Scripture should have used the feminine (<italic>metato</italic>). I.E. explains that dead refers to the body, <italic>guf</italic>, which is a masculine word (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1301"><sup>7</sup> Ex. 19:3, or perhaps in his comments on verse 17 (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1302"><sup>8</sup> In other words, when sojourner (<italic>toshav</italic>) is coupled with stranger (<italic>ger</italic>) it means a resident stranger (Krinsky). Cherez disagrees. He thinks I.E. is only commenting on the word sojourner (<italic>toshav</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1303"><sup>9</sup> It comes from the root <italic>alef, chet, zayin</italic> (to hold). One holds on to land by inheritance or acquisition. <italic>Achuzah</italic> thus means a holding, the idea being a piece of property with a title.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1304"><sup>10</sup> Scripture states, <italic>And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying&#x2026;Hear us, my lord</italic>. Since they apparently all spoke we would expect the use of the term our lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1305"><sup>11</sup> In other words, <italic>And the children of Heth answered</italic> does not mean they all spoke in unison. One man spoke on behalf of all. Had they all spoken, Scripture would have read <italic>adonenu</italic>. It should be noted that the entire verse, with the exception of <italic>adoni</italic>, is in the plural.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1306"><sup>12</sup> The word <italic>elohim</italic> (translated by J.P.S. as mighty) usually means God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1307"><sup>13</sup> The root <italic>caf, lamed, heh</italic> means to finish (see Gen. 2:1). The root <italic>caf, lamed, alef</italic> means to withhold (see Gen. 8:2; Ps. 40:12). <italic>Yikhleh</italic> is spelled with a <italic>heh</italic> in our verse. Hence I.E. points out that <italic>caf, lamed, heh</italic> can also mean to withhold.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1308"><sup>14</sup> Rashi makes the same point.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1309"><sup>15</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 2:17 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1310"><sup>16</sup> They are troubled by Abraham bowing before another human being.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1311"><sup>17</sup> Abraham did not prostrate himself. The latter is done in prayer and only before God. He merely bowed his head as a sign of respect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1312"><sup>18</sup> Ex. 18:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1313"><sup>19</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>kesef male</italic> (the full price). The word <italic>male</italic> means full. The opposite of full is empty (<italic>rek</italic>). I.E. points out that in our case this does not apply. One cannot say, <italic>kesef rek</italic> (empty money). However, one can say, <italic>chaser kesef</italic> (money is lacking). Hence <italic>male</italic> in our verse means the full amount and it is the opposite of <italic>chaser</italic>, rather than of <italic>rek</italic> (Filwarg). Thus <italic>kesef male</italic> means the full price.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1314"><sup>20</sup> <italic>Nay, my lord, hear me</italic>, could conceivably be taken to mean: My lord should not hear me, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1315"><sup>21</sup> According to I.E. <italic>if thou wilt</italic> is short for thou wilt do this, i.e., give me the field. The verse should be interpreted as follows: But if thou wilt give me the field, I pray thee, hear me, I will give the price of the field; take it of me.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1316"><sup>22</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>I pray thee</italic> (lu) is connected to <italic>I will give</italic> rather than to <italic>hear me</italic> as it is in the first explanation. The verse should be interpreted as follows: But if thou wilt give me the field, hear me, I pray thee, when I give the price of the field, take it of me (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1317"><sup>23</sup> Saadiah Gaon lists 10 pairs of Biblical verses that are to be interpreted as one verse. I.E. disagrees with him. Saadiah&#x2019;s 10 pairs of verses are enumerated by Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1318"><sup>24</sup> I.E. points out that verse 20 does not repeat verse 17. The latter states that the field was made sure as a possession, the former that it was made sure as a burial ground for Abraham and his descendants (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1319"><sup>25</sup> Abraham now began to take actual possession of the land of Israel (Filwarg).</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 24</title>
<p>1. AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN ALL THINGS. With length of days, wealth, honor and sons, these being all the things that men desire to have. If the interpretation that Abraham had a daughter named Bakkol<sup><xref rid="fn1320">1</xref></sup> were correct, then Scripture should have read: and the Lord blessed Abraham &#x201C;with&#x201D; Bakkol.<sup><xref rid="fn1321">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. PUT, I PRAY THEE, THY HAND UNDER MY THIGH. Some say that <italic>my thigh</italic> alludes to Abraham&#x2019;s circumcised member.<sup><xref rid="fn1322">3</xref></sup> However, if this were the case, then Abraham should have made him swear by the covenant of circumcision, and not by the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn1323">4</xref></sup> I believe that it was customary in those days for a person to place his hand under the thigh of his master, its meaning being, &#x201C;If you are subject to my authority, place your hand under my thigh.&#x201D; The lord then sat on his servant&#x2019;s hand. By doing so the servant, as it were, said to the master, &#x201C;My hand is under your authority to do your will.&#x201D; This custom is still followed in India.</p>
<p>3. [THE GOD OF HEAVEN AND THE GOD OF THE EARTH.] God is so described in our verse because it is ordained in heaven who here on earth will be united in matrimony. This thing is a secret.<sup><xref rid="fn1324">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF THE CANAANITES. This includes all of the eleven Canaanite peoples.</p>
<p>4. BUT THOU SHALT GO UNTO MY COUNTRY. To Haran where he had once dwelt.<sup><xref rid="fn1325">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND TO MY KINDRED. Ur of the Chaldees.<sup><xref rid="fn1326">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. PERADVENTURE. <italic>Ulai</italic> (peradventure) has many meanings in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1327">8</xref></sup> <italic>If so</italic> (ulai) <italic>be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up</italic> (Hos. 8:7), is similar.</p>
<p>The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>he-hashev</italic> (must I needs bring back) is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1328">9</xref></sup> because the <italic>heh</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1329">10</xref></sup> of the <italic>hifil</italic> which follows it is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1330">11</xref></sup> If the first <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>he-hashev</italic> were vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>, it would be difficult to pronounce both <italic>hehs</italic> in succession.<sup><xref rid="fn1331">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. [BEWARE.] When the word <italic>hishamer</italic> (beware) is penultimately accented it is related to the word <italic>shemirah</italic> (watching, guarding).<sup><xref rid="fn1332">13</xref></sup> However, when it is ultimately accented it is related to the word <italic>shemarim</italic> (lees).<sup><xref rid="fn1333">14</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>hishamer</italic> (keep calm) in <italic>Keep calm</italic> (hishamer), <italic>and be quiet</italic> (Is. 7:4), which has the same basic meaning as <italic>shemarav</italic> (his lees) in <italic>And he hath settled on his lees</italic> (shemarav) (Jer. 48:11).</p>
<p>7. HE WILL SEND HIS ANGEL BEFORE THEE. This is a prayer. If it were a prophecy Abraham would not have said, <italic>And if the woman be not willing to follow thee</italic> (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn1334">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. THOU SHALT NOT BRING MY SON BACK THITHER. He must remain in the land of Israel. Abraham said, <italic>thou shalt not bring my son back</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1335">16</xref></sup> because he (Abraham) was the root.<sup><xref rid="fn1336">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND HE MADE THE CAMELS TO KNEEL DOWN. He made them kneel upon their knees.<sup><xref rid="fn1337">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. SEND ME, I PRAY THEE. Its meaning is, prepare for me what I desire.<sup><xref rid="fn1338">19</xref></sup> <italic>Because the Lord thy God sent me</italic> (Gen. 27:20) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1339">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. SHE THAT THOU HAST APPOINTED. The servant relied on the efficacy of the prophet&#x2019;s<sup><xref rid="fn1340">21</xref></sup> prayer.<sup><xref rid="fn1341">22</xref></sup> He was certain that God accepted it and sent an angel, the latter being God&#x2019;s very own messenger, to help him by appointing a damsel in a dream.<sup><xref rid="fn1342">23</xref></sup> The servant reasoned that there was no family as charitable as his master&#x2019;s.<sup><xref rid="fn1343">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many are perplexed <sup><xref rid="fn1344">25</xref></sup> because they say that the servant expressed his request improperly.<sup><xref rid="fn1345">26</xref></sup> I, however, do not see anything wrong in what he said, for had it been another damsel, one not of Abraham&#x2019;s family, who offered to give him drink and water his camels, he would have left her and nothing would have been lost, for the verse <italic>and said; Whose daughter art thou</italic> means he had previously said, before he gave the ring and bracelets to Rebekah, <italic>whose daughter art thou</italic> ?<sup><xref rid="fn1346">27</xref></sup> Scripture similarly states, <italic>And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? And she said: The daughter of Bethuel&#x2026;And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands</italic> (v. 47). The sum of the matter is the servant prayed that God would appoint for Isaac a young lady from the family of his master, the sign of God&#x2019;s choice being that the damsel would act graciously as a woman of noble character should.<sup><xref rid="fn1347">28</xref></sup> God heard his prayer. However, the case of Jonathan is totally different.<sup><xref rid="fn1348">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. NEITHER HAD ANY MAN KNOWN HER. It is extremely unlikely that Scripture speaks of abnormal intercourse.<sup><xref rid="fn1349">30</xref></sup> The verse rather refers to a certain intercourse method wherein it is possible to sleep with a virgin and even to impregnate her without deflowering her. However, it is unseemly to describe how this can be done.</p>
<p>21. AND THE MAN LOOKED STEADFASTLY ON HER. <italic>Mishta&#x2019;eh</italic> (looked steadfastly) means the same as <italic>mishtomem</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1350">31</xref></sup> (astonished, awe-struck). It comes from the same root as <italic>sha&#x2019;u</italic> and <italic>tisha&#x2019;eh</italic> (waste) in <italic>Until cities be waste</italic> (sha&#x2019;u) (Is. 6:11),<sup><xref rid="fn1351">32</xref></sup> and <italic>And the land become utterly waste</italic> (tisha&#x2019;eh shemamah) (Is. 6:11).</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>lah</italic> (on her) is because of her.<sup><xref rid="fn1352">33</xref></sup> <italic>Then Daniel&#x2026;was appalled</italic> (eshtomam) <italic>for a while</italic> (Dan. 4:16) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1353">34</xref></sup> The <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>mishta&#x2019;eh</italic> is not part of the root of the word but is the sign of the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic> conjugation. It is like the <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>nitra&#x2019;eh</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1354">35</xref></sup> in <italic>let us look</italic> (nitra&#x2019;eh) <italic>one another in the face</italic> (II Kings 14:8). <italic>Mishta&#x2019;eh</italic> definitely does not come from the root <italic>shin, tav, heh</italic> (drink).<sup><xref rid="fn1355">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. A GOLDEN RING. <italic>Nezem</italic> (ring) can refer either to a nose ring<sup><xref rid="fn1356">37</xref></sup> or to an earring.<sup><xref rid="fn1357">38</xref></sup> The one worn on the nose is attached by a string which is tied around the forehead.<sup><xref rid="fn1358">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>HALF A SHEKEL. <italic>Beka</italic> means half a shekel. It comes from the same root as <italic>nivka</italic> (was cleft).<sup><xref rid="fn1359">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND TWO BRACELETS. <italic>Tzemidim</italic> (bracelets) comes from the same root as <italic>tzamid</italic> (cover of a vessel) in <italic>covering</italic> (tzamid) <italic>close-bound</italic> (Num. 19:15).<sup><xref rid="fn1360">41</xref></sup> A bracelet is called a <italic>tzamid</italic> because each bracelet worn on the hand is made up of two parts.<sup><xref rid="fn1361">42</xref></sup> The form of this ornament is well known.</p>
<p>23. TO LODGE IN. <italic>La-lin</italic> (to lodge in) is in the <italic>hifil</italic>. If it were a <italic>kal</italic> it would read <italic>la-lun</italic>.</p>
<p>32. AND PROVENDER. <italic>Mispo</italic> (provender) is a general term for cattle feed. The Bible could have used barley in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn1362">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. AND THERE WAS SET. <italic>Va-yusam</italic> (and there was set) is in the <italic>hofal</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1320"><sup>1</sup> Our verse reads, and the Lord had blessed Abraham <italic>ba-kol</italic> (in all things). According to the Talmud <italic>ba-kol</italic> is a proper noun. Cf. <italic>Baba Batra</italic> 16b, &#x201C;He (Abraham) had a daughter named Bakkol.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1321"><sup>2</sup> If <italic>ba-kol</italic> is a proper noun then the preposition &#x201C;with&#x201D; is missing. Rather than reading <italic>ba-kol</italic>, the verse should have read, <italic>be-vakkol</italic> (with Bakkol).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1322"><sup>3</sup> One who takes an oath must take hold of a holy object. The circumcised member is such an object. Cf. <italic>Shebuot</italic> 38b and Rashi.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1324"><sup>5</sup> It is one of the secrets of creation (Krinsky). Or the one so ordained is a secret and man must pray that God send him his destined one. Abraham noted this so that his servant would take with utmost seriousness the task laid upon him (Weiser).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1328"><sup>9</sup> The <italic>heh</italic> interrogative (<italic>heh ha-she&#x2019;elah</italic>) is generally vocalized with a <italic>chataf pattach</italic>, a furtive <italic>pattach</italic>. Before <italic>heh, alef, chet, ayin</italic> it is vocalzed with a <italic>pattach</italic>. However, here in <italic>he-hashev</italic> it is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic>, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1329"><sup>10</sup> The point is that before the letters <italic>heh, alef, chet, ayin</italic> vocalized with a long <italic>kamatz</italic>, the <italic>heh</italic> interrrogative is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic>, hence the vocalization <italic>he-hashev</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1330"><sup>11</sup> <italic>Hashev</italic> comes from the root <italic>shin, vav, bet</italic>. The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>hashev</italic> is the sign of the <italic>hifil</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1331"><sup>12</sup> That is, if the <italic>heh</italic> preceding <italic>heh, alef, chet, ayin</italic> vocalized with a long <italic>kamatz</italic> were to be vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>, it would be hard to pronounce both <italic>hehs</italic> in succession. Therefore it is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1332"><sup>13</sup> Thus when <italic>hishamer</italic> is penultimately accented it means be on guard, beware. This is the usual meaning of <italic>hishamer</italic> in Scripture. Cf. Deut. 8:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1333"><sup>14</sup> In this case it means keep calm. Krinsky points out that Is. 7:4 is the only place in Scripture where <italic>hishamer</italic> is accented on the last syllable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1334"><sup>15</sup> There would have been no need to make contingent plans if God had told Abraham that he would appoint a girl for Isaac from his kindred and country.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1335"><sup>16</sup> Isaac never dwelt in the place where the servant was being sent. How, then, could Abraham say, <italic>thou shalt not bring my son back thither</italic> ? One cannot bring back what was never there. Abraham should have said: thou shalt not bring my son thither.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1336"><sup>17</sup> And Isaac, as it were, was the tree. If Abraham was the root, then it is as if Isaac were there. Thus on Seder night we read, <italic>We were Pharaoh&#x2019;s bondmen in Egypt</italic> (Deut. 6:21). If our ancestors were there it is as if their children were there (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1337"><sup>18</sup> <italic>Va-yavrekh</italic> (and he made kneel) is a denominative of <italic>berekh</italic> (knee) (Weiser).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1340"><sup>21</sup> Abraham.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1341"><sup>22</sup> <italic>Thou hast appointed</italic> implies that God had already chosen a bride for Isaac. How did the servant know this? I.E. suggests that the servant believed that God had accepted Abraham&#x2019;s prayer (Krinsky). Or I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the servant did not set up a test to see if the Lord set aside a damsel for Isaac. He trusted that God had because he relied on Abraham&#x2019;s prayer (Filwarg). Throughout this section I.E. refers to the servant as &#x201C;the servant.&#x201D; He apparently was uncertain as to whether to identify him with Eliezer, as the Midrash and other medieval commentators did.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1342"><sup>23</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s comment is vague. Weiser suggests that an angel appeared to Rebekah and directed (appointed) her to go out to the well. According to Krinsky the angel appeared to Rebekah&#x2019;s family in a dream and told them to appoint a damsel for Isaac.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1343"><sup>24</sup> Hence a girl saying, <italic>Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also</italic> would most probably be of Abraham&#x2019;s family (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1344"><sup>25</sup> <italic>Taanit</italic> 4a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1345"><sup>26</sup> In other words they claim that the servant selected an improper omen as proof of God&#x2019;s choice. &#x201C;What would the servant have done if a lame or a blind girl would have offered to give him and his flocks water? What would he have done if she was not of Abraham&#x2019;s family and kindred&#x201D; (<italic>Taanit</italic> 4a)?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1346"><sup>27</sup> Verses 22 and 23 state that the servant first gave Rebekah a golden ring and two bracelets and then said, <italic>Whose daughter art thou</italic> ? This implies that he took Rebekah for Isaac before he knew who she was. This contradicts what I.E. has just said, hence his interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1347"><sup>28</sup> Cf. Cant. 7:2 (<italic>bat nadiv</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1348"><sup>29</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the servant did not really set up a test to determine God&#x2019;s will. He merely offered a prayer that God send him what he was looking for. His choice was not dependent on what the girl would do. If she acted in a certain way then he would investigate further. However, Jonathan set up a test. If such and such would happen he would act thus; if it did not, he would act differently. Jonathan&#x2019;s test related to his attacking the Philistines. Jonathan said, <italic>If they say thus unto us: Tarry until we come unto you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. But if they say thus: Come up unto us; then we will go up; for the Lord hath delivered them unto our hand; and this shall be the sign unto us</italic> (I Sam. 14:9, 10).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1381"><sup>62</sup> Bo and Beer-lahai-roi. The Hebrew reads, <italic>ba mi-bo be&#x2019;er-la-chai ro&#x2019;i</italic>. If the Bible meant Isaac came from Beer-lahai-roi it should have read, <italic>ba mi-be&#x2019;er-la-chai-ro&#x2019;i</italic>. The word <italic>mi-bo</italic> thus presents a problem. This interpretation suggests that the verse be translated: Isaac came from Bo-beer-lahai-roi, the latter being a combination of both names (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1382"><sup>63</sup> I.e., <italic>mi-bo</italic> means from inside. They explain our verse to mean that Isaac came from inside (<italic>mi-bo</italic>) of Beer-lahai roi.

<ftnote id="fn1383"><sup>64</sup> That is, it consists of the infinitive <italic>bo</italic> (come) plus the prepositional <italic>mem</italic>. Thus <italic>mi-bo</italic> means from the way.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1390"><sup>71</sup> The Hebrew reads <italic>ha-ohelah Sarah immo</italic>. Now a word with the emphatic <italic>heh</italic> cannot be in the construct Hence the verse literally reads: the tent Sarah his mother. I.E. maintains that an additional word, tent, has to be added to the text. The text should be read as if written, the tent, tent of Sarah his mother.

<ftnote id="fn1391"><sup>72</sup> The text literally reads: <italic>ve-ha-nevu&#x2019;ah Oded ha-navi</italic> (even the prophecy, Oded the prophet). I.E. suggests, for the reasons given in note 67, that the word <italic>nevu&#x2019;at</italic> (prophecy of) is to be supplied by the reader.

<p>8. [AND ABRAHAM EXPIRED.] Expired refers to a death wherein the soul leaves the body in a moment, without pain or delay. Proof of this is <italic>he (Jacob) gathered up his feet unto the bed</italic> and then immediately expired (Gen. 49:33).<sup><xref rid="fn1402">10</xref></sup> Every expiration (<italic>gevi&#x2019;ah</italic>) is a death, but not every death is an expiration (<italic>gevi&#x2019;ah</italic>). Hence Scripture states, with regard to those who perished in the flood, <italic>And all flesh expired</italic> (Gen. 7:21). <sup><xref rid="fn1403">11</xref></sup> The meaning of, <italic>and (Abraham) died</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1404">12</xref></sup> is that he died at a ripe old age.<sup><xref rid="fn1405">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WAS GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE. Some say that this refers to the soul of life which, even while functioning<sup><xref rid="fn1406">14</xref></sup> in the body, is a separate entity. When it separates from the body it returns to its source.<sup><xref rid="fn1407">15</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>and was gathered to his people</italic> is a mere idiom.<sup><xref rid="fn1408">16</xref></sup> One who follows in the footsteps of his ancestors is said, as it were, to be joining them. <italic>But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace</italic> (Gen. 15:15) is similar.</p>
<p>16. AND BY THEIR ENCAMPMENTS. <italic>Tirotam</italic> (encampments) means palaces. Compare, <italic>a turret of silver</italic> (tirat kasef) (Cant. 8:9).</p>
<p>ACCORDING TO THEIR NATIONS. We find Scripture employing <italic>ummot</italic> (nations) and <italic>ummim</italic> (nations),<sup><xref rid="fn1409">17</xref></sup> both of which are vocalized with a <italic>shuruk</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1410">18</xref></sup> The <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>le-ummatam</italic> (according to their nations) is a preposition,<sup><xref rid="fn1411">19</xref></sup> similar to the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>le-goyehem</italic> (after their nations). It is not the same as the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>ba-le&#x2019;ummim</italic> (upon the peoples) (Ps. 149:7) which is a root letter like the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>le&#x2019;om</italic> (people) in <italic>And the one people</italic> (u-le&#x2019;om) <italic>shall be stronger than the other people</italic> (mi-le&#x2019;om) (v. 23). Whether spelled with a <italic>lamed</italic> or not, it has the same meaning. However, they come from different roots.<sup><xref rid="fn1412">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. OVER AGAINST ALL HIS BRETHREN. Zimram and Jokshan.<sup><xref rid="fn1413">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>HE DID SETTLE.<sup><xref rid="fn1414">22</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>nafal</italic> (fell) is that his portion or his lot fell among his brethren. Or it refers to the fact that most of the Ishmaelites journeyed from place to place. In this case <italic>nafal</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1415">23</xref></sup> is like <italic>nofel</italic> in <italic>Thou fallest away</italic> (nofel) <italic>to the Chaldeans</italic> (Jer. 37:13). However, this is a bit far-fetched in view of the fact that his brethren were in the east (v. 6), and Egypt and Asshur are west<sup><xref rid="fn1416">24</xref></sup> of the land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1417">25</xref></sup> It is possible that this verse deals with Ishmael&#x2019;s death. He died during the lifetime of his brethren, after he fell.<sup><xref rid="fn1418">26</xref></sup> We do not know the cause of Ishmael&#x2019;s death.</p>
<h1>TOLEDOT</h1>
<p>19. AND THESE. After recording the generations of Ishmael, Scripture returns to record the progeny of Isaac, Esau and Jacob. Some say that <italic>Abraham begot Isaac</italic> means that Isaac resembled his father, and all who looked upon him could tell that he was Abraham&#x2019;s son.<sup><xref rid="fn1419">27</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>holid</italic> (begot) means raised and brought up, as in <italic>were born</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1420">28</xref></sup> (yulledo) <italic>upon Joseph&#x2019;s knees</italic> (Gen. 50:23). This interpretation is substantiated by <italic>And he sent them away from Isaac his son</italic> (v. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn1421">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. OF PADDAN. <italic>Paddan</italic> means a field. It has the same meaning in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn1422">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE SISTER OF LABAN. Laban is mentioned because he was better known and more revered than her father. <italic>Elisheba&#x2026;the sister of Nahshon</italic> (Ex. 6:23), is similar.</p>
<p>21. AND ISAAC ENTREATED. <italic>Va-yetar</italic> (entreated) is in the <italic>kal</italic>. However, <italic>hatiru</italic> (entreat) in <italic>Entreat the Lord</italic> (Ex. 8:4) is in the <italic>hifil</italic>. Its meaning is that Isaac appeased<sup><xref rid="fn1423">31</xref></sup> God with his prayers.<sup><xref rid="fn1424">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE LORD LET HIMSELF BE ENTREATED. <italic>Va-ye&#x2019;ater</italic> means and He was appeased. It is a <italic>nifal</italic>.</p>
<p>22. AND THE CHILDREN STRUGGLED TOGETHER. <italic>Va-yitrotzatzu</italic> (and they struggled) comes from the word that means running.<sup><xref rid="fn1425">33</xref></sup> The <italic>tzadi</italic> is doubled.<sup><xref rid="fn1426">34</xref></sup> Its parallel is found in <italic>They run to and fro</italic> (yerotzetzu) <italic>like the lightnings</italic> (Nahum 2:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1427">35</xref></sup> The Bible refers to the fetuses as children<sup><xref rid="fn1428">36</xref></sup> because that is what they ultimately became.<sup><xref rid="fn1429">37</xref></sup> <italic>And stripped the naked of their clothing</italic> (Job 22:6)<sup><xref rid="fn1430">38</xref></sup> is similar. Rebekah asked women who had children if they had had a similar experience. They responded that they did not. Rebekah then said, <italic>if it</italic>, namely, the manner and custom of pregnancy, <italic>be so</italic> as they said, <italic>wherefore do I</italic> undergo such an abnormal pregnancy.<sup><xref rid="fn1431">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND THE LORD SAID UNTO HER. Via a prophet, or through Abraham himself, for Abraham did not pass away until her sons were fifteen years of age.<sup><xref rid="fn1432">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE ELDER. Elder is the subject.<sup><xref rid="fn1433">41</xref></sup> <italic>A son honoureth his father</italic> (Mal. 1:6) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1434">42</xref></sup> I will explain our verse later.<sup><xref rid="fn1435">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. TWINS. The root letter <italic>alef</italic> is missing in the word <italic>tomim</italic> (twins). <italic>Tomim</italic> in this regard is like the word <italic>sheritikha</italic> (release thee)<sup><xref rid="fn1436">44</xref></sup> in <italic>Verily I will release thee</italic> (sheritikha) <italic>for good</italic> (Jer. 15:11), the meaning of which is: I will deal well with thy last years (<italic>she&#x2019;erit</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1437">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. [RUDDY.] The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>admoni</italic> (ruddy) is superfluous. It is similar to the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>akhzari</italic> (cruel).<sup><xref rid="fn1438">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>[LIKE A MANTLE.] <italic>Ke-adderet</italic> (like a mantle) is not in the construct with <italic>se&#x2019;ar</italic> (hairy).<sup><xref rid="fn1439">47</xref></sup> The verse is to be read as follows: all over hairy, like a mantle. However, others say that <italic>ke-adderet</italic> is in the construct with <italic>se&#x2019;ar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1440">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY CALLED HIS NAME. Those who saw him called him thus. The name Esau possibly connotes a unique occurrence (<italic>ma&#x2019;aseh</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1441">49</xref></sup> This birth was extremely wondrous. Every human being leaves the womb in a placenta which covers him.<sup><xref rid="fn1442">50</xref></sup> However, in this instance the two placentas opened simultaneously.<sup><xref rid="fn1443">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. AND HIS NAME WAS CALLED. Someone, or Isaac his father, called him Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn1444">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. A CUNNING HUNTER. Esau was constantly practicing deception, for most animals are trapped through trickery.<sup><xref rid="fn1445">53</xref></sup> Jacob was his antithesis, because he was a man of integrity.<sup><xref rid="fn1446">54</xref></sup> They also differed in that Esau was <italic>a man of the field</italic> and Jacob a man <italic>dwelling in tents</italic>. It is possible that the meaning of <italic>dwelling in tents</italic> is like <italic>dwell in tents and have cattle</italic> (Gen. 4:20).<sup><xref rid="fn1447">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. BECAUSE HE DID EAT OF HIS VENISON. He brought him game to eat.<sup><xref rid="fn1448">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND HE WAS FAINT. <italic>Ayef</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1449">57</xref></sup> (faint) means hungry and thirsty, as in <italic>be-eretz ayefah</italic> (in a weary land) (Is. 32:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1450">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. LET ME SWALLOW. This is the only place in Scripture where the word, <italic>haliteni</italic> (let me swallow) is encountered.<sup><xref rid="fn1451">59</xref></sup> Its meaning is <italic>feed me. Nazid</italic> (pottage) means a cooked dish. However, <italic>va-yazed</italic> (sod) is an <italic>ayin vav</italic>. They are two roots with one meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn1452">60</xref></sup> <italic>Yadon</italic> (shall abide) in <italic>My spirit shall not abide</italic> (yadon) (Gen. 6:3) and <italic>nedanah</italic> (the sheath thereof) (I Chron. 21:27)<sup><xref rid="fn1453">61</xref></sup> are similar.</p>
<p>31. SELL ME. <italic>Mikhrah</italic> (sell me) is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1454">62</xref></sup> like <italic>shilchah</italic> (send) in <italic>Send</italic> (shilchah) <italic>the lad</italic> (Gen. 43:8) and <italic>shikhvah</italic> (lie) in <italic>Lie</italic> (shikhvah) <italic>with me</italic> (Gen. 39:7.<sup><xref rid="fn1455">63</xref></sup> The birthright refers to the double share of the father&#x2019;s wealth which belongs to the first born.<sup><xref rid="fn1456">64</xref></sup> Others maintain that the first born is always superior to his younger siblings in that they must rise before him and serve him as a son serves his father.<sup><xref rid="fn1457">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. [BEHOLD, I AM AT THE POINT TO DIE.] He was daily exposed to danger when he went out hunting, as an animal might kill him. Thus there was a possibility that he would predecease his father.</p>
<p>34. SO ESAU DESPISED. Esau also despised the birthright<sup><xref rid="fn1458">66</xref></sup> because he saw that his father had no wealth. Many are amazed at this because Abraham left Isaac a vast amount of money?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1459">67</xref></sup> Have they never seen a man very rich in his youth and poor in his old age? Proof that Isaac was poor is the fact that he loved Esau because of his need.<sup><xref rid="fn1460">68</xref></sup> Had there been ample food in Isaac&#x2019;s house and Esau the honorable one in his father&#x2019;s sight,<sup><xref rid="fn1461">69</xref></sup> he would not have sold his birthright for a dish of food. Furthermore, why did Isaac have to tell Esau, <italic>Bring me venison</italic> (Gen. 27:7), if he had savory meat at home for his daily meals? Additionally, why did Jacob not have choice garments <sup><xref rid="fn1462">70</xref></sup> and why didn&#x2019;t Rebekah give Jacob gold and silver for his journey (when he fled to Haran), seeing that Jacob was so poor that he had to say, <italic>&#x201C;If God will&#x2026;give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on&#x201D;</italic> (Gen. 28:20). Also, why did Rebekah, who loved him so much, not send him money in view of the fact that he was so impoverished that he had to tend Laban&#x2019;s flock? As to the verse which states, <italic>And the man waxed great&#x2026;And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household</italic> (Gen. 26:13, 14), it refers to the period prior to Isaac&#x2019;s old age. Now, those who are intellectually blind think that wealth is a great distinction for the righteous. However, the prophet Elijah shows that the opposite is the case.<sup><xref rid="fn1463">71</xref></sup> They further ask, why did God withhold wealth from Isaac? Let them tell us why God withheld sight from Isaac&#x2019;s eyes. Let them not put us off with a poor answer based upon a Midrashic homily,<sup><xref rid="fn1464">72</xref></sup> for there is a secret meaning in the matter<sup><xref rid="fn1465">73</xref></sup> and we must not probe into it, for the thoughts of God are deep and beyond the ken of man. Similarly others say, behold Isaac had sheep,<sup><xref rid="fn1466">74</xref></sup> for Rebekah told Jacob, <italic>Go now to the flock</italic> (Gen. 27:9). However, it is possible that he had a few sheep remaining. It is also possible that <italic>Go now to the flock</italic> means go to the place where sheep are sold.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1393"><sup>1</sup> See <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 61:4; also Rashi&#x2019;s comments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1394"><sup>2</sup> &#x201C;Concubines&#x201D; indicates that Abraham had more than one concubine. If Keturah and Hagar were one and the same person the verse would have read concubine. I.E. goes on to note that <italic>pilegesh</italic> (concubine) refers exclusively to a handmaid to forestall the argument that verse 6 refers to male slaves (<italic>pilagshim</italic> has a masculine ending) and therefore negate his argument that Abraham had more than one concubine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1395"><sup>3</sup> The printed editions have, &#x201C;We can explain on concubines as women.&#x201D; If we accept this reading the point that I.E. is apparently making is that even though the word <italic>pilagshim</italic> has a masculine ending it refers to females (Weiser). However, Filwarg and Krinsky, as well as Weiser himself, point out that I.E. may be alluding to Ezek. 23:20, <italic>And she doted on concubinage</italic> (pilagshehem) <italic>with them, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses</italic>. The words <italic>be-saram</italic> (whose flesh) and <italic>zirmatam</italic> (whose issue) are masculine; hence the concubines spoken of in this verse appear to be males. Indeed, Kimchi in his comments on Ezek. 23:20 quotes an opinion which maintains that the concubines referred to in this verse are male slaves. Therefore I.E. points out that <italic>pilagshim</italic> refers only to females. Filwarg suggests amending our texts of I.E. to read <italic>pilagshehem</italic>, as in Ezek. 23:20. In this case the allusion to Ezekiel would be unmistakable. The fact of the matter is that <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads <italic>al pilagshehem</italic>, and we have translated accordingly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1396"><sup>4</sup> Caravaneers. This interpretation connects <italic>asshurim</italic> with <italic>ashur</italic> (step or going). See Job 31:7; Prov. 14:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1397"><sup>5</sup> See Job 16:9, <italic>yiltosh enav</italic> (sharpeneth his eyes). This term, too, pertains to their occupation as caravaneers.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1401"><sup>9</sup> This explanation is that <italic>kedemah</italic> means to Kedemah. Kedemah was a son of Ishmael (v. 15).

<ftnote id="fn1406"><sup>14</sup> I.E. uses the term <italic>kevod ha-nefesh</italic> literally, the glory of life. The &#x201C;glory&#x201D; refers to man&#x2019;s soul which gives life to the body.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1407"><sup>15</sup> According to I.E. man&#x2019;s soul is derived from a universal soul. While in the body the soul does not share the former&#x2019;s corporeal properties.

Krinsky tries to justify this reading by maintaining that I.E. explains why entreat is here in the <italic>kal</italic> and in Ex. 8:4 in the <italic>hifil</italic>. It is here in the <italic>kal</italic> because God wanted their prayers. However, He really did not want to hear prayers on behalf of Pharaoh, hence the <italic>hifil</italic> form in Exodus. The latter being in the causative form implies that Moses burdened God with his prayers on behalf of Pharaoh. Krinsky also suggests that the text be read: he appeased God (vocalizing <italic>ritzah</italic> rather than <italic>ratzah</italic>) with their prayers, that is, with Isaac and Rebekah&#x2019;s prayers.

<ftnote id="fn1436"><sup>44</sup> This is the J.P.S. translation. I.E. renders it your remnant. <italic>She&#x2019;erit</italic> is usually spelled with an <italic>alef</italic>, which is missing in our verse.

<ftnote id="fn1439"><sup>47</sup> That is, the text is not to be interpreted as <italic>kullo ke-adderet se&#x2019;ar</italic> (all over like a hairy mantle) but as <italic>kullo se&#x2019;ar ke-adderet</italic> (all over hairy; like a mantle). In other words, <italic>kullo</italic> (all over) refers to <italic>se&#x2019;ar</italic> (hairy) even though the word <italic>ke-adderet</italic> (like a mantle) separates the two (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1440"><sup>48</sup> In this case the verse reads: all over like a mantle of hair.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1441"><sup>49</sup> Krinsky maintains that I.E., like Rashi, explains Esau to mean <italic>asui</italic>, a participle meaning made, the idea being that Esau was born a complete man. Filwarg explains that Esau&#x2019;s birth was a unique event (<italic>ma&#x2019;aseh</italic>) in that unlike all other children he was born hairy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1442"><sup>50</sup> Thus Jacob and Esau were each in a separate placenta. The fact that Jacob and Esau&#x2019;s individual placentas opened simultaneously made their birth exceptional.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1443"><sup>51</sup> This is obvious since Jacob was born grasping Esau&#x2019;s heel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1444"><sup>52</sup> Literally, he called his name. The subject (he) is not identified, hence, I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1445"><sup>53</sup> Scripture&#x2019;s purpose in telling us at this point that Esau was a hunter is to inform us that Esau was a cunning and deceptive individual (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1446"><sup>54</sup> The Hebrew <italic>ish tam</italic> is translated by J.P.S. as <italic>a quiet man</italic>. However, according to I.E., as Jacob was the antithesis of Esau, the deceiver, the term <italic>tam</italic> should be rendered as honest, sound, as in <italic>that man was whole-hearted</italic> (tam) <italic>and upright, and one that feared God</italic> (Job 1:1).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1447"><sup>55</sup> It does not meant that Jacob was a homebody, but that he was a keeper of herds and flocks. Jacob set up tents in order to be close to the flocks (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1448"><sup>56</sup> The Hebrew reads: <italic>ki tzayid be-fiv</italic>, literally, because game in his mouth. I.E. points out that the word <italic>me-vi</italic> (brought) has to be inserted into the text. The verse should be read as if written: he brought game into his mouth; i.e., he brought him game to eat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1449"><sup>57</sup> The word <italic>ayef</italic> (faint) may imply faint from exertion or faint from lack of food or water. Here it means the latter (Krinsky). However, Weiser maintains that I.E. holds that <italic>ayef</italic> applies only to faintness due to lack of food and water.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1454"><sup>62</sup> <italic>Mikhrah</italic> (sell me) is an elongated imperative, the usual imperative of sell being <italic>mekhor</italic>. The rule in Hebrew grammar is that when a word in the <italic>kal</italic> follows the <italic>efol</italic>, vocalization of its elongated imperative is written with a <italic>kamatz katan</italic>, i.e., <italic>zekhor</italic> (remember) is elongated like <italic>zokhrah</italic> (Neh. 5:19), and <italic>shemor</italic> (keep) to <italic>shomrah</italic> (Ps. 25:20). Hence <italic>mekhor</italic> should become <italic>mokhrah</italic>. I.E. points out that even though <italic>mekhor</italic> follows the <italic>efol</italic> conjugation, it is elongated as an <italic>efal</italic>. In the latter, the elongated imperative is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic> (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1455"><sup>63</sup> These words are conjugated in the <italic>efal</italic> and are thus vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic> in the elongated imperative.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1456"><sup>64</sup> Cf. Deut. 21:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1457"><sup>65</sup> In other words Jacob did not buy the birthright because he wanted a double share but because the birthright had honorary significance. I.E. offers this interpretation either because he believes that Isaac was poor at this time and the double share was insignificant, or because the law of the double share of the first-born took effect only after the revelation at Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1458"><sup>66</sup> The opening line of I.E. is difficult to comprehend. It literally reads: also this birthright because&#x2026; Weiser, Filwarg, and Krinsky suggest that the text is corrupt. We have followed Filwarg&#x2019;s reconstruction since it involves adding only one letter, viz., emending <italic>gam zot</italic> (also this birthright) to <italic>gam baz et</italic> (he also despised the birthright). The point is that in addition to selling the birthright because he was weary, he also despised the birthright because his father had no wealth to leave him (Weiser).</ftnote>

<p>5. AND KEPT MY CHARGE. <italic>Mishmarti</italic> (my charge) is a general term for all that Abraham was obligated to observe from the commandments (<italic>mitzvot</italic>), statutes (<italic>chukkim</italic>) and laws (<italic>torot</italic>). It is possible that the commandments spoken of in our verse refer to <italic>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred</italic> etc. (Gen. 12:1), and <italic>Take now thy son&#x2026;even Isaac&#x2026;and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains</italic> etc. (Gen. 22:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1467">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The statutes spoken of in our text pertain to the works of God that a man should uphold. These statutes are based on logic.<sup><xref rid="fn1468">2</xref></sup> I will elaborate on this term (<italic>chukkim</italic>) in my comments on the verse dealing with the prohibition of wearing <italic>a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together</italic> (Lev. 19:19). The <italic>torot</italic> (laws) mentioned in our verse relate to Abraham&#x2019;s circumcision of himself, his children and his servants. I will fully explain the meaning of the terms <italic>torah</italic> and <italic>mitzvah</italic> in my comments on the verse <italic>and the law and the commandment</italic> (Ex. 24:12).</p>
<p>6. AND ISAAC DWELT IN GERAR. Isaac did as God had commanded him. <sup><xref rid="fn1469">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. OF HIS WIFE. The word <italic>le-ishto</italic> (of his wife) should be rendered: about his wife.<sup><xref rid="fn1470">4</xref></sup> We find a similar meaning for this word in <italic>that men say not of me</italic> (li) (Jud. 9:54).<sup><xref rid="fn1471">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR HE FEARED. <italic>Yare</italic> (he feared) is a perfect,<sup><xref rid="fn1472">6</xref></sup> as is the word <italic>zaken</italic> (old) in <italic>And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old</italic> (zaken) (Gen. 27:1).<sup><xref rid="fn1473">7</xref></sup> The words &#x201C;because he said&#x201D; have been omitted before <italic>lest the men of the place should kill me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1474">8</xref></sup> We find this phrase similarly omitted in <italic>for God hath made me fruitful</italic> (Gen. 41:52).<sup><xref rid="fn1475">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. A HUNDREDFOLD. The word <italic>sha&#x2019;ar</italic> means the same as the Rabbinic term <italic>shi&#x2019;ur</italic> (estimate, reckon). The meaning of <italic>me&#x2019;ah she&#x2019;arim</italic> (a hundredfold) is that Isaac was blessed in that the earth produced one hundred times more than what he sowed was estimated to produce. The word <italic>she&#x2019;arim</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>sha&#x2019;ar</italic> in <italic>For as one that hath reckoned</italic> (sha&#x2019;ar) <italic>within himself</italic> (Prov. 23:7).</p>
<p>13. AND GREW. <italic>Ve-gadel</italic> (and grew) is a perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn1476">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND A GREAT HOUSEHOLD. Isaac had man and maidservants to serve him. <italic>Avuddah</italic> (household) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn1477">11</xref></sup> On the other hand, it may be a noun following the paradigm of <italic>segullah</italic> (treasure).<sup><xref rid="fn1478">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. [WELLS.] When the word <italic>be&#x2019;erot</italic> is in the construct it can be vocalized in one of two ways.<sup><xref rid="fn1479">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. LIVING WATER. Water that is always bursting forth.</p>
<p>20. ESEK. This word is not encountered elsewhere in Scripture. However, its meaning can be ascertained from Rabbinic literature.<sup><xref rid="fn1480">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. DIGGED. <italic>Va-yikhru</italic> means digged. <italic>Kariti</italic>, in <italic>in my grave which I have digged</italic> (kariti) <italic>for me</italic> (Gen. 50:5); <italic>yikhreh</italic> in <italic>or if a man shall dig</italic> (yikhreh) <italic>a pit</italic> (Ex. 21:33); and <italic>koreh</italic>, in <italic>whoso diggeth</italic> (koreh) <italic>a pit shall fall therein</italic> (Prov. 26:27), are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1481">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. BETWIXT US. Our verse contains two synonymous plurals in succession.<sup><xref rid="fn1482">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. BEER-SHEBA. There were two reasons why the city was so called.<sup><xref rid="fn1483">17</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is possible that this Beersheba is not to be identified with the Beersheba previously mentioned (Gen. 21:28-31).<sup><xref rid="fn1484">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. JUDITH. Judith is a proper name.<sup><xref rid="fn1485">19</xref></sup> She did not bear Esau any children.<sup><xref rid="fn1486">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>BASEMATH. Basemath is to be identified with Adah.<sup><xref rid="fn1487">21</xref></sup> She had two names. There are hundreds of similar instances in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1488">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. A BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT. Each one of Esau&#x2019;s wives<sup><xref rid="fn1489">23</xref></sup> was a <italic>morat ru&#x2019;ach</italic> (bitterness of spirit) to Isaac and Rebekah. Some say that <italic>morat</italic> (bitterness) is similar to the word <italic>moreh</italic> (rebellious) in <italic>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious</italic> (moreh) <italic>son</italic> (Deut. 21:18).<sup><xref rid="fn1490">24</xref></sup> However, I believe that <italic>morat</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>marah</italic> (bitter) in <italic>bitter (marah) as wormwood</italic> (Prov. 5:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1491">25</xref></sup> Indeed, it is explicitly written, <italic>and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1492">26</xref></sup> <italic>Isaac, his father</italic> (Gen. 28:8). The account of Esau&#x2019;s wives was recorded so that the Israelites would keep themselves from taking Canaanite women.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1467"><sup>1</sup> I.E. explains that <italic>My commandments</italic> refers to Gen. 12:1 and Gen. 22:2, as these were commandments. <italic>Statutes</italic> pertain to Abraham&#x2019;s emulating God&#x2019;s ways and laws. It should be noted that I.E. explains <italic>chok</italic> to mean a logical law. This is in contradistinction to Rashi, who explains <italic>chukkim</italic> as irrational laws. I.E seems to imply that Abraham did not observe all the laws, statutes and commandments contained in the Torah. This is contrary to the Rabbinic sage Rav, who held that Abraham observed the entire Torah, as seen from the verse <italic>because that Abraham hearkened to My voice, and kept My charge</italic> etc. (<italic>Yoma</italic> 28b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1468"><sup>2</sup> The point is that Abraham, before the revelation on Mt. Sinai, was able to ascertain God&#x2019;s statutes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1469"><sup>3</sup> <italic>Sojourn in this land</italic> (v. 3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1470"><sup>4</sup> The <italic>lamed</italic> here means about. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 20:13. <italic>Le-ishto</italic> might be rendered to his wife, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1471"><sup>5</sup> Here too the <italic>lamed</italic> means about. Thus <italic>li</italic> should be rendered about me, not to me.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1472"><sup>6</sup> <italic>Yare</italic> can also be a participle, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1473"><sup>7</sup> <italic>Zaken</italic> can also be a participle. However, in this verse it cannot be so, for the verse opens with a perfect viz., <italic>va-yehi</italic> (and it came to pass).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1474"><sup>8</sup> The verse reads: <italic>for he feared to say &#x2018;My wife:&#x2019; lest the men of the place should kill me</italic>. According to I.E. this is an abridged verse and should be read as if written: for he feared to say my wife, &#x201C;because he said&#x201D; lest the men of this place, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1475"><sup>9</sup> It should be read: &#x201C;because he said&#x201D; for God hath made me fruitful.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1476"><sup>10</sup> The word grew is written twice in the second part of the sentence. The first time it is written <italic>gadel</italic>, the second time <italic>gadal</italic>. Hence I.E. points out that both are perfects and mean the same. I.E.&#x2019;s comment is pertinent because <italic>gadel</italic> can also be a participle (Krinsky, Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1477"><sup>11</sup> The word <italic>avuddah</italic> is an adjective, with the noun which it is modifying missing. Scripture should have read: <italic>adamah avuddah</italic>, ground worked by man and maidservants (Cherez, Weiser). I.E. interprets thus because the form <italic>avuddah</italic> looks like an adjective.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1478"><sup>12</sup> A collective noun, following the paradigm of <italic>segullah</italic>, or <italic>kedushah</italic>, the point being we find nouns with this vocalization. Hence <italic>avuddah</italic> does not have to be an adjective. In this case the meaning of <italic>avuddah</italic> is simply servants, both male and female.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1479"><sup>13</sup> The word <italic>be&#x2019;erot</italic> (wells) in our verse is in the absolute. In such cases it is always vocalized <italic>sheva, tzere, cholam</italic>. However, when in the construct it can either be vocalized <italic>sheva, tzere, cholam</italic>, as in verse 18, or <italic>segol, chataf segol, cholam</italic> as in Gen. 14:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1480"><sup>14</sup> The word <italic>esek</italic> in the Talmud means strife, cf. <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 8:5. It should be noted that in Rabbinic literature <italic>esek</italic> is spelled with a <italic>samech</italic>, in our verse with a <italic>sin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1481"><sup>15</sup> They all come from the root <italic>caf, resh, heh</italic> and mean to dig.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1482"><sup>16</sup> Our verse reads: Let there be an oath <italic>benotenu</italic> (betwixt us) <italic>benenu u-vennekha</italic> (even betwixt us and thee). I.E. points out that <italic>benotenu</italic> and <italic>benenu</italic> are both plurals from the same root and mean the same. However, they belong to different paradigms. These two forms were employed by Scripture to avoid redundancy (Weiser). According to Filwarg what I.E. is saying is that one of these phrases could have been left out since they mean the same; i.e., <italic>benotenu</italic> (betwixt us) means the same as <italic>benenu u-venekha</italic> (even betwixt us and thee) Scripture repeated itself for emphasis.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1483"><sup>17</sup> In Gen. 21:30 Abraham tells Abimelech, <italic>Verily, these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well</italic>. Scripture then adds, <italic>Wherefore that place was called Beer-Sheba because there they swore both of them</italic>. However, here we are told that Beersheba was so called because of the oath (<italic>shevu&#x2019;ah</italic>) taken by Isaac and Abimelech (cf. Rashi). I.E. points out that Beersheba was so called because of the oaths taken by Abraham and Isaac. Or possibly the two reasons for the name are: Abraham&#x2019;s setting aside the seven (<italic>shevah</italic>) lambs and his oath (<italic>shevu&#x2019;ah</italic>). Isaac merely repeated Abraham&#x2019;s oath (Weiser). Or Abraham called the place Beersheba because of the setting aside of the seven lambs and Isaac called it thus because of the oath (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1484"><sup>18</sup> This would explain the two accounts for the name Beersheba in Scripture. According to this interpretation the two reasons given for Beersheba are the two oaths, viz., Abraham&#x2019;s and Isaac&#x2019;s. Each took place in a different city.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1485"><sup>19</sup> <italic>Yehudit</italic> (Judith) can be taken to be an adjective, viz., <italic>Yehudi</italic>, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1486"><sup>20</sup> In chapter 36 Scripture lists Esau&#x2019;s wives and children. Judith is not mentioned. I.E. explains that this is due to the fact that Judith did not bear any children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1487"><sup>21</sup> In our verse we read, <italic>Basemath, the daughter of Elon, the Hittite</italic>. However, in Gen. 36:2 we read, <italic>Adah, the daughter of Elon, the Hittite</italic>. I.E. explains the discrepancy by saying that she had two names.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1488"><sup>22</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 13:7 and 15:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1489"><sup>23</sup> <italic>And they were</italic> is in the plural; <italic>morat</italic> is a singular. Scripture should have used the plural <italic>morot</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1490"><sup>24</sup> According to this interpretation the verse reads: and each one of them was rebellious (<italic>morat</italic>) against the wishes of (<italic>ru&#x2019;ach</italic>) Isaac and Rebekah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1491"><sup>25</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>morat</italic> is not a verb meaning rebellious but a noun meaning bitter. The meaning of <italic>morat ru&#x2019;ach</italic> is: they were a bitterness of the spirit; i.e., Isaac and Rebekah were displeased with having Canaanite daughters-in-law. In this case one does not have to interpret <italic>morat ru&#x2019;ach</italic> as each one was a <italic>morat ru&#x2019;ach</italic>, because it can be interpreted as both were a bitterness of spirit. Thus there is no problem with <italic>And they were</italic> being in the plural and <italic>morat ru&#x2019;ach</italic> in the singular (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1492"><sup>26</sup> The Hebrew literally reads: were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father; that is, Isaac did not like them. In other words, they were a bitterness of spirit to him because they were Canaanites, not because they rebelled against him.</ftnote>

We must therefore interpret Jacob&#x2019;s words to his father as follows: I am who I am and Esau is thy first born.<sup><xref rid="fn1507">15</xref></sup> Others say that Jacob quietly said, I am, and then loudly said, <italic>Esau is thy first-born</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1508">16</xref></sup> Now these interpretations are nonsence. Prophets are divided into two groups. One group consists of God&#x2019;s messengers concerning commandments;<sup><xref rid="fn1509">17</xref></sup> the other, those who foretell the future. If the latter have to say something that is not quite so,<sup><xref rid="fn1510">18</xref></sup> there is no harm done.<sup><xref rid="fn1511">19</xref></sup> However, a prophet whose task is to reveal commandments never lies. We thus find that King David, whom Scripture calls <italic>the man of God</italic> (II Chron. 8:14) and who said, <italic>The spirit of the Lord spoke by me</italic> (II Sam. 23:2), perverted the truth out of need of the hour when he spoke to Abimelech and said, <italic>Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy</italic> (I Sam. 21:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1512">20</xref></sup> Also, the prophet Elisha did not speak the truth when he said to Hazael, <italic>Go, say unto him, thou shalt surely recover</italic> (II Kings 8:10), even though what he meant was, go say unto him that thou shalt recover from this illness; however, God has shown me that he will be killed.<sup><xref rid="fn1513">21</xref></sup> Similarly the prophet Micaiah uttered a vain prayer out of deference to King Ahab when he told him, <italic>Go up and prosper; and the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king</italic> (I Kings 22:15).<sup><xref rid="fn1514">22</xref></sup> Similarly Daniel said to King Nebuchadnezzar, <italic>My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee</italic> (Dan. 4:16).<sup><xref rid="fn1515">23</xref></sup> Those who explain that <italic>My lord</italic> refers to God are indulging in Midrash.<sup><xref rid="fn1516">24</xref></sup> Similarly Abraham said unto Abimelech, <italic>And moreover she is indeed my sister</italic> (Gen. 20:12);<sup><xref rid="fn1517">25</xref></sup> and unto his young men, <italic>and I and the lad will go yonder and we will worship and come back to you</italic> (Gen. 22:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1518">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND EAT OF MY VENISON. <italic>Okhlah</italic> (eat)<sup><xref rid="fn1519">27</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>zokhrah</italic> (remember)<sup><xref rid="fn1520">28</xref></sup> in <italic>Remember</italic> (zokhrah) <italic>unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people</italic> (Neh. 5:19). The <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>okhlah</italic> is a root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn1521">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. THAT I MAY FEEL THEE. There is no <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>shin</italic> of <italic>va-amushekha</italic> (that I may feel thee) in order to simplify the enunciation of this word.<sup><xref rid="fn1522">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND I WILL EAT OF MY SON&#x2019;S VENISON. The <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>ve-okhelah</italic> (and I will eat) is a first person imperfect prefix. It is vocalized with a <italic>cholam</italic> to compensate for the missing <italic>alef</italic> of the root.<sup><xref rid="fn1523">31</xref></sup> We find the same in the word <italic>omerah</italic> in <italic>I will say</italic> (omerah) <italic>unto God my Rock</italic> (Ps. 42:10).<sup><xref rid="fn1524">32</xref></sup> The <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>tevarakhanni</italic> (may bless me) (v. 19) receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> to make up for the missing <italic>nun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1525">33</xref></sup> which should have been in our word, as we find in <italic>yesovevenhu</italic> (He compassed him about) (Deut. 32:10) and similarly in <italic>yeshacharuneni</italic> (they will seek Me) (Hos. 5:15).<sup><xref rid="fn1526">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>[27. AND KISSED HIM.] When the word kiss is followed by a <italic>lamed</italic> it means to kiss upon the hand, shoulder or neck; when it is not followed by a <italic>lamed</italic> it indicates a mouth to mouth kiss.<sup><xref rid="fn1527">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE SMELLED. The <italic>resh</italic> of <italic>va-yarach</italic> (and he smelled) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> because it precedes a gutteral.<sup><xref rid="fn1528">36</xref></sup> <italic>Va-yana</italic> (was moved) and <italic>va-yanach</italic> (and rested), in <italic>And his heart was moved</italic> (va-yana) (Is. 7:2) and <italic>and rested</italic> (va-yanach) <italic>in all the borders of Egypt</italic> (Ex. 10:14),<sup><xref rid="fn1529">37</xref></sup> are similar. All of the above come from roots whose middle letter is a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1530">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEE. Isaac said this to himself.<sup><xref rid="fn1531">39</xref></sup> The garments gave off a pleasant odor when Isaac thought in his heart that it was Esau before him and that Esau had just come in from the field.<sup><xref rid="fn1532">40</xref></sup> The garments gave off the scent of trees in blossom since it is possible that this episode took place in the first month.<sup><xref rid="fn1533">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>[28. OF THE DEW.] The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>mi-tal</italic> (of the dew) is also to be prefixed to <italic>mishmane</italic> (of the fat places).<sup><xref rid="fn1534">42</xref></sup> <italic>Shall I give my first-born for my transgression</italic>?

<p>29. THY BRETHREN. The children of the concubines.<sup><xref rid="fn1536">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>THY MOTHER&#x2019;S SONS. Esau and his children.</p>
<p>CURSED BE EVERYONE THAT CURSETH THEE.

There are many other analogous expressions in Scripture. <italic>And blessed be everyone that blesseth thee</italic> is also similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1539">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. WHO THEN IS HE. <italic>Mi efoh hu</italic> (who then is he?) should be interpreted as follows: who is he and where is he?<sup><xref rid="fn1540">48</xref></sup> The word <italic>efoh</italic> (then) is made up of two words.<sup><xref rid="fn1541">49</xref></sup> The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>va-varakhehu</italic> (and have blessed him) is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> because <italic>va-avarakhehu</italic> is a perfect. Had the <italic>vav</italic> been vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>, then <italic>va-avarachehu</italic> would be an imperfect.<sup><xref rid="fn1542">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. WITH GUILE. He did not speak the truth.</p>
<p>36. IS NOT HE RIGHTLY. <italic>Ha-khi</italic> is to be rendered as truly. <italic>Ha-khi</italic> in <italic>Thou art truly</italic> (ha-chi) <italic>my brother</italic> (Gen. 29:15) is similar.</p>
<p>NAMED. Someone named him Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn1543">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR HE HATH SUPPLANTED ME. <italic>Va-yakeveni</italic> (for he hath supplanted me) is to be rendered: for he hath deceived me. <italic>Ve-okbah</italic> (in subtlety) in <italic>But Jehu did it in subtlety</italic> (ve-okbah) (II Kings 10:19) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1544">52</xref></sup> It is possible that it comes from the same root as <italic>akov</italic> (deceitful) in <italic>The heart is deceitful</italic> (akov) (Jer. 17:9). <italic>Akov</italic> is the opposite of <italic>mishor</italic> (straight).<sup><xref rid="fn1545">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>RESERVED A BLESSING FOR ME. Kept with yourself (<italic>etzlekha</italic>) a blessing for me. <italic>Atzalta</italic> (reserved) comes from the same root as <italic>ve-atzalti</italic> (and I will take) in <italic>And I will take</italic> (ve-atzalti) <italic>of the spirit which is upon thee</italic> (Num. 11:17).<sup><xref rid="fn1546">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. BEHOLD, I HAVE MADE HIM THY LORD. Via my blessing. Similarly <italic>have I given to him</italic> (v. 33) also means I have verbally given. Some say that <italic>efo</italic> (then) spelled with an <italic>alef</italic> at the end is one word meaning now.<sup><xref rid="fn1547">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS WHEN THOU SHALT BREAK LOOSE. <italic>Tarid</italic> (thou shalt break loose) has the same meaning as <italic>tirdeh</italic> (thou shalt rule) (Lev. 25:43). However, <italic>tarid</italic> and <italic>tirdeh</italic> have different roots.<sup><xref rid="fn1548">56</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>tarid</italic> is similar to <italic>arid</italic> (I cry out) in <italic>I cry out</italic> (arid) <italic>in my complaint</italic> (Ps. 55:3). According to this interpretation the meaning of our clause is: and it shall come to pass when thou shalt cry out, then God will pity you.<sup><xref rid="fn1549">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT THOU SHALT SHAKE HIS YOKE. <italic>U-farakto</italic> (that thou shalt shake) comes from the same root as <italic>mefarek</italic> (rent) in <italic>rent</italic> (mefarek) <italic>the mountains</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1550">58</xref></sup> (I Kings 19:11). The word <italic>mafrakto</italic> (his neck) (I Sam. 4:18) is derived from the same stem.<sup><xref rid="fn1551">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>These blessings present a number of great difficulties. If the blessings were prophecies how is it possible for Isaac not to know whom he was blessing? The wise men of our generation respond to this problem by explaining that when Jacob entered the room, God told him, &#x201C;Bless this one.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1552">60</xref></sup> However, if this was the case Isaac would have told Esau, &#x201C;God commanded me to bless Jacob.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1553">61</xref></sup> Furthermore, if God told Isaac to bless Jacob, why did Isaac bless Esau because he cried?<sup><xref rid="fn1554">62</xref></sup> Others say that Isaac was no prophet and his blessings did not come to pass.<sup><xref rid="fn1555">63</xref></sup> However, they are also mistaken. Scripture explicitly tells us, <italic>And the Lord appeared unto him (Isaac</italic>) (Gen. 26:2, 24).<sup><xref rid="fn1556">64</xref></sup> Moreover, King David in referring to the patriarchs says, <italic>And do My prophets no harm</italic> (I Chron. 16:22).</p>
<p>Others ask, what efficacy could there be in Isaac&#x2019;s blessings since he thought that he was blessing Esau? The truth of the matter is that Isaac was in doubt as to who was really before him. Indeed, he said, <italic>The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau</italic> (v. 22). What Isaac did was bless the one in his presence without regard to whether it was Esau or Jacob, the reason being that both were his sons.</p>
<p>Some ask, how could God say (Gen. 25:23) <italic>And the elder shall serve the younger</italic>? Similarly how could Isaac say, <italic>and thou shalt serve thy brother</italic> (v. 40)?<sup><xref rid="fn1557">65</xref></sup> Saadiah Gaon superficially answers this question by pointing to Scripture&#x2019;s statement, <italic>And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts&#x2026;and went unto a land away from his brother Jacob</italic> (Gen. 36:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1558">66</xref></sup> However, the Gaon seems to have forgotten that the Bible relates, <italic>and (Jacob) bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother (Esau</italic>) (Gen. 33:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1559">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that the prophet&#x2019;s<sup><xref rid="fn1560">68</xref></sup> blessing was akin to a prayer, and God accepted his prayer,<sup><xref rid="fn1561">69</xref></sup> for Isaac&#x2019;s prayer was mainly concerned with the offspring of Jacob and Esau.<sup><xref rid="fn1562">70</xref></sup> Those who have as yet not awakened from their foolish sleep think that we are in the exile of the Edomites (Esau).<sup><xref rid="fn1563">71</xref></sup> However, this is not so. Edom (Esau) was subject to Judah.<sup><xref rid="fn1564">72</xref></sup> Scripture thus states, <italic>In his (Jehoram&#x2019;s) days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah</italic> (II Kings 8:20).<sup><xref rid="fn1565">73</xref></sup> We are also told that Joab<sup><xref rid="fn1566">74</xref></sup> <italic>cut off every male in Edom</italic> (I Kings 11:16). It is because of their subjugation to Judah that they rejoiced on the day of Judah&#x2019;s calamity<sup><xref rid="fn1567">75</xref></sup> and told the Babylonians, <italic>Raze it, raze it even to the foundations thereof</italic> (Ps. 137:7). The taunts of the Edomites on the day of Jerusalem&#x2019;s fall was harder for the Judeans to bear than the afflictions visited upon them by the Babylonians. This is also the meaning of <italic>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom</italic> (Lam. 4:21),<sup><xref rid="fn1568">76</xref></sup> and <italic>Neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction</italic> (Obad. 1:12). Also, Hyrcanus the elder<sup><xref rid="fn1569">77</xref></sup> made the Edomites (Esau&#x2019;s descendants) guard Jerusalem and had them circumcised. Also, in the days of Agrippa<sup><xref rid="fn1570">78</xref></sup> when Jerusalem was taken,<sup><xref rid="fn1571">79</xref></sup> troops of Edomites<sup><xref rid="fn1572">80</xref></sup> came to Judah&#x2019;s aid.<sup><xref rid="fn1573">81</xref></sup> The Romans<sup><xref rid="fn1574">82</xref></sup> who exiled us are from the seed of Kittim. Onkelos similarly explains Kittim to mean Rome in <italic>But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim</italic> (Num. 24:24).<sup><xref rid="fn1575">83</xref></sup> The Kittim are the very kingdom of the Greeks as I have explained in my commentary on the Book of Daniel.<sup><xref rid="fn1576">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>[At first<sup><xref rid="fn1577">85</xref></sup> there were only a few people who believed in the man that was made into a god. The Romans accepted the belief in this man in the days of Constantine who introduced this new religion to the Romans upon the advice of an Edomite priest and placed upon his flag an image of this man. At that time there was no one in the world aside from a small group of Edomites who followed the new religion.<sup><xref rid="fn1578">86</xref></sup> ] Similarly the contemporary inhabitants of Egypt, Sheba<sup><xref rid="fn1579">87</xref></sup> and the land of Elam<sup><xref rid="fn1580">88</xref></sup> are called Ishmaelites even though only a tiny minority of the people living there are true decendants of the Ishmaelites.<sup><xref rid="fn1581">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. AND ESAU HATED. <italic>Va-yistom</italic> (and he hated) is to be rendered: and he harbored hatred. <italic>Va-yistemuhu</italic> (and hated him) (Gen. 49:23) is similar.</p>
<p>AND ESAU SAID IN HIS HEART. It is possible that Esau confided this thought to one of his friends.<sup><xref rid="fn1582">90</xref></sup> Others say that Rebekah knew this through prophecy.<sup><xref rid="fn1583">91</xref></sup> The first interpretation appears correct.</p>
<p>42. DOTH COMFORT HIMSELF. <italic>Mitnachem</italic> (doth comfort himself) comes from the same root as <italic>nechamah</italic> (consolation).<sup><xref rid="fn1584">92</xref></sup> The meaning of our clause is: Esau&#x2019;s sole consolation is that he will be able to kill you. However, the Gaon says that <italic>mitnachem</italic> means to set a time and is similar in meaning to the Arabic <italic>wa&#x2019;ad</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1585">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>44. A FEW DAYS. <italic>Yamim achadim</italic> (a few days) is to be translated as a few years. Compare <italic>yamim</italic> in <italic>for a full year</italic> (yamim) <italic>shall he have the right of redemption</italic> (Lev. 25:29). <italic>Achadim</italic> (a few) means less than ten.<sup><xref rid="fn1586">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>45. WHY SHOULD I BE BEREAVED. Rebekah was anxious lest they kill each other,<sup><xref rid="fn1587">95</xref></sup> or that Esau would be killed for murdering Jacob. There is a Midrashic opinion that both Jacob and Esau died in one day.<sup><xref rid="fn1588">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>46. I AM WEARY OF MY LIFE. <italic>Katzti</italic> (I am weary) has the same meaning as <italic>tzakti</italic> (I am distressed).<sup><xref rid="fn1589">97</xref></sup> Compare <italic>U-nekitzennah</italic> (and vex it) in <italic>Let us go up against Judah and vex it</italic> (u-nekitzennah) (Is. 7:6). Scripture similarly says, <italic>the land whose two kings thou hast cast a horror of</italic> (katz)<sup><xref rid="fn1590">98</xref></sup> <italic>shall be foresaken</italic> (Is. 7:16).</p>
<ftnote id="fn1493"><sup>1</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 12:11.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1496"><sup>4</sup> The translation follows the <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 text. The printed texts have <italic>telyekha</italic> referring to a sword. If this reading is accepted, why does I.E. say a <italic>vav</italic> should have been placed before <italic>telyekha</italic>? The first particular following a general term does not require a <italic>vav</italic>, as I.E. himself implies in his comment on Gen. 26:5. Furthermore, why should a <italic>vav</italic> be placed before <italic>telyekha</italic> if it means a sword and not if it means a quiver? For an attempt to explain the printed texts see Krinsky and Cherez. However, for the impossibility of the printed versions see Filwarg. The reading of <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 seems correct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1497"><sup>5</sup> Since Scripture is listing three separate items, sword, quiver and bow, a conjunctive <italic>vav</italic> should be placed before quiver as it is before bow. The verse should read: take thy sword and thy quiver (<italic>ve-telyekha</italic>) and thy bow.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1498"><sup>6</sup> Here, too, we find three separate individuals listed without a <italic>vav</italic> before the final two. The text should have read: Adam and Seth and Enosh. We thus see that Scripture at times leaves out the conjunctive <italic>vav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1499"><sup>7</sup> <italic>Shoma&#x2019;at</italic> is a participle. It literally means listening. Hence, the word &#x201C;was&#x201D; has to be added and the verse should be understood: Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1500"><sup>8</sup> The word <italic>li-fene</italic> (before) means in the presence of.

<title>CHAPTER 28</title>
<p>9. [SO ESAU WENT UNTO ISHMAEL.] When Esau learned that Isaac blessed Jacob a second time and charged him not to <italic>take a wife of the daughters of Canaan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1591">1</xref></sup> he went unto his uncle Ishmael and married his daughter Basemath, who was also called Mahalath.<sup><xref rid="fn1592">2</xref></sup> She, like Jethro, had two names, for I believe that Jethro and Hobab are one and the same person.<sup><xref rid="fn1593">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE SISTER OF NEBAIOTH. He was the most important of all his brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn1594">4</xref></sup> It is also possible that Ishmael had many wives and that Mahalath was Nabaioth&#x2019;s sister from the same mother.<sup><xref rid="fn1595">5</xref></sup></p>
<h1>VA-YETZE</h1>
<p>10. [AND JACOB WENT OUT FROM BEER-SHEBA.] Saadiah Gaon is of the opinion that <italic>va-yelekh charanah</italic> (and went toward Haran) is to be interpreted as, to go to Haran.<sup><xref rid="fn1596">6</xref></sup> However, this is not so. <italic>Va-yelekh charanah</italic> is to be interpreted literally.<sup><xref rid="fn1597">7</xref></sup> After telling us that Jacob left Beersheba and went to Haran, Scripture returns and tells us what he encountered on the way to Haran.<sup><xref rid="fn1598">8</xref></sup> Jacob did not arrive in Haran on the day he left Beersheba,<sup><xref rid="fn1599">9</xref></sup> because Scripture explicitly tells us that he spent a night on the way.</p>
<p>11. [AND HE LIGHTED UPON THE PLACE.] The reason the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ba-makom</italic> (the place)<sup><xref rid="fn1600">10</xref></sup> is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> is that Moses in writing the Torah did so in order to indicate <italic>the place</italic> that was well known in his time.<sup><xref rid="fn1601">11</xref></sup> Similarly the prophet Hosea said, <italic>And there</italic> (at Beth-el) <italic>he would speak with us</italic> (Hos. 12:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1602">12</xref></sup> Hosea said this because he prophesied in Beth-el concerning Jeroboam the son of Joash.<sup><xref rid="fn1603">13</xref></sup> Hosea used the term &#x201C;with us&#x201D; because Amos, too, prophesied in Bethel.<sup><xref rid="fn1604">14</xref></sup> It is clear from the Book of Amos that Beth-el was a holy place.</p>
<p>According to the plain meaning of the text, <italic>va-yifga</italic> (and he lighted) is not to be translated as, and he prayed, as in <italic>neither make intercession</italic> (tifga) <italic>to Me</italic> (Jer. 7:16),<sup><xref rid="fn1605">15</xref></sup> because we never find in the entire Bible the word <italic>makom</italic> (place) meaning God.<sup><xref rid="fn1606">16</xref></sup> Do not pay any attention to the Midrashic interpretation that explains <italic>makom</italic>, in <italic>makom acher</italic> (Es. 4:14), as referring to God,<sup><xref rid="fn1607">17</xref></sup> because it most certainly does not. Proof of this is found in the word <italic>acher</italic> (another) which follows <italic>makom</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1608">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF THE STONES OF THE PLACE. Its meaning is: one of the stones of the place.<sup><xref rid="fn1609">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNDER HIS HEAD. <italic>Me-ra&#x2019;ashotav</italic> (under his head) is a plural.<sup><xref rid="fn1610">20</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>margelotav</italic> (his feet) (Ruth 3:4; 14).<sup><xref rid="fn1611">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is surprising that Rabbi Samuel Ben Hofni confused the dreams of common men with prophetic dreams.<sup><xref rid="fn1612">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. [AND HE DREAMED, AND BEHOLD A LADDER SET UP ON THE EARTH.] Those who say that the ladder seen by Jacob refers to a statue,<sup><xref rid="fn1613">23</xref></sup> or that it refers to Sinai because it is numerically equivalent to it,<sup><xref rid="fn1614">24</xref></sup> are indulging in Midrash. Rabbi Solomon ibn Gabirol, the Spaniard, says that Jacob&#x2019;s &#x201C;ladder&#x201D; alludes to man&#x2019;s heavenly soul,<sup><xref rid="fn1615">25</xref></sup> and that &#x201C;the angels of God&#x201D; signify thoughts of wisdom.<sup><xref rid="fn1616">26</xref></sup> Rabbi Joshua<sup><xref rid="fn1617">27</xref></sup> explains the dream of the ladder to mean that Jacob&#x2019;s prayers ascended the Heavens via the ladder and in response to his supplications salvation was sent down to him. These commentators have apparently not studied<sup><xref rid="fn1618">28</xref></sup> the prophecies of Zechariah, Amos and Jeremiah.<sup><xref rid="fn1619">29</xref></sup> The way to interpret Jacob&#x2019;s dream is to view it as a parable. It teaches that nothing is hidden from God and that what happens below is contingent on the decree from above.<sup><xref rid="fn1620">30</xref></sup> There is thus, as it were, a ladder linking heaven and earth by which angels ascend to inform God what they have seen on earth after going over it. Scripture also states that other angels come down to fulfill God&#x2019;s commands. The imagery presented is that of a king and his servants.<sup><xref rid="fn1621">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THOU SHALT SPREAD ABROAD. <italic>U-faratzta</italic> (and thou shalt spread abroad) is to be rendered: and thou shalt multiply. <italic>Va-yifrotz ha-ish</italic> (and the man increased) is similar (Gen. 30:43).</p>
<p>16. SURELY THE LORD IS IN THIS PLACE. The meaning of Jacob&#x2019;s statement is that there are places where miracles are seen.<sup><xref rid="fn1622">32</xref></sup> I cannot explain why this is so because it is a deep mystery.<sup><xref rid="fn1623">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THIS IS NONE OTHER THAN THE HOUSE OF GOD. This is a chosen place where a man in time of need will pray and his supplications will be accepted. Many ask, how could Jacob set up a pillar?<sup><xref rid="fn1624">34</xref></sup> However, they have forgotten that Moses set up twelve pillars.<sup><xref rid="fn1625">35</xref></sup> Scripture does not prohibit a pillar set up to honor the Lord. Scripture merely states, <italic>Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar, which the Lord thy God hateth</italic> (Deut. 16:22). I will explain the latter verse when I come to it.<sup><xref rid="fn1626">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND POURED OIL UPON THE TOP OF IT. So that he would recognize it when he returned.</p>
<p>21. [THEN SHALL THE LORD BE MY GOD.] The Lord that shall be my God is the One known by the Tetragrammaton. Scripture clearly states, <italic>And, behold the Lord</italic> (spelled with the tetragramaton) <italic>stood beside him</italic> (v. 13). You will find an explanation of this name of God in my comments on the first Torah portion of Exodus.<sup><xref rid="fn1627">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>[22. GOD&#x2019;S HOUSE.] The meaning of <italic>shall be God&#x2019;s House</italic> is: it will be a fixed place for my prayers and for my tithing; for out of all the money <italic>that thou shalt give me</italic>, I will give a tithe out of respect for God to one who is fit to receive it.<sup><xref rid="fn1628">38</xref></sup> Those who say that the tithe refers to Levi<sup><xref rid="fn1629">39</xref></sup> are indulging in Midrash. This is so because we do not find anywhere in the Torah that a man shall tithe his children. The only tithes that we find in the Pentateuch are cattle, sheep and produce.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1591"><sup>1</sup> Verse 1. This comment forms the conclusion of I.E.&#x2019;s notes on Gen 27:46.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1592"><sup>2</sup> Our verse tells us that Esau married <italic>Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael</italic>. However, Gen. 36:3 tells us that Esau married <italic>Basemath, Ishmael&#x2019;s daughter</italic>. I.E. solves the discrepancy by explaining that the daughter of Ishmael whom Esau married had two names.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1593"><sup>3</sup> Cf. Ex. 18:1, and Num. 10:29. In the former, Moses&#x2019; father-in-law is called Jethro, in the latter, by the name Hobab. In his comments on Ex. 2:18, I.E. says that they refer to one and the same person, as he had two names.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1594"><sup>4</sup> Therefore Mahalath is identified as the sister of Nebaioth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1595"><sup>5</sup> Sister here means sister from the same mother. Hence Scripture tells us that Mahalath was the sister of Nabaioth. The Bible mentions one wife of Ishmael (Gen. 21:21). Hence I.E.&#x2019;s uncertainty.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1596"><sup>6</sup> Verse 10 literally reads: And Jacob went out of Beersheba and went to Haran. The verse thus tells us that Jacob arrived in Haran. If this is the case, why then do the verses that follow tell us what happened to Jacob on the way to Haran? Saadiah solves the problem by claiming that the Bible employs a perfect (<italic>va-yelekh</italic>) in place of an infinitive (<italic>la-lekhet</italic>), with the perfect having the meaning of an infinitive. Saadiah thus translates our verse: Jacob went out of Beersheba to go to Haran.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1597"><sup>7</sup> That is, and he went to Haran.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1598"><sup>8</sup> In other words, verse 10 is a general statement The particulars then follow.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1599"><sup>9</sup> Contrary to the Midrash <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 68:9 which states that Jacob arrived in Haran on the same day that he left Beersheba.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1600"><sup>10</sup> There is a difference between <italic>be-makom</italic> and <italic>ba-makom</italic>. The former means in a place, the latter, in the place. &#x201C;The place&#x201D; implies a specific, well known place. When Jacob came to Beth-el there was as yet nothing significant about the place. Why then does Scripture say that Jacob alighted upon the place?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1601"><sup>11</sup> I.E. suggests that after this incident Beth-el was &#x201C;the place&#x201D; and Moses wrote accordingly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1602"><sup>12</sup> We thus see that from the days of Moses onward, Beth-el was known as a holy place (Netter).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1603"><sup>13</sup> Hosea prophesied there because Beth-el was known as a holy place where an angel appeared to Jacob (Weiser). Cf. I.E. on Hos. 12:5. It was for the same reason that King Jeroboam set up a royal shrine there. Cf. Am. 7:13, <italic>Beth-el&#x2026;is the king&#x2019;s sanctuary and it is a royal house</italic>.</ftnote>

According to I.E., if <italic>va-yifga</italic> is interpreted as, and he prayed, <italic>ba-makom</italic> must be interpreted to mean God. However, this is not necessarily so.

<ftnote id="fn1606"><sup>16</sup> The Rabbinic sages refer to God as <italic>Ha-makom</italic>. I.E. points out that this a Rabbinic not a Biblical term for God.

<ftnote id="fn1607"><sup>17</sup> The Book of Esther does not mention God. In his introduction to Esther I.E. quotes an opinion that God is mentioned in this book in 4:14. I. E. rejects this interpretation as being Midrashic.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1620"><sup>30</sup> It is hard to understand I.E.&#x2019;s point. The other commentators also interpret the vision as a parable.

To avoid this possibility our word (<italic>va-yar</italic>) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>yod</italic>.</p>
<p>3. AND THEY ROLLED THE STONE. The shepherds rolled the stone.<sup><xref rid="fn1639">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. WHENCE. <italic>Me-ayin</italic> (whence) means what place are you from. The word <italic>ayin</italic> without the <italic>mem</italic> prefixed to it could not be used for whence, for <italic>ayin</italic> means nothing.<sup><xref rid="fn1640">11</xref></sup> Nevertheless, we find the word <italic>me-ayin</italic> also used for nothing, as in <italic>Behold, ye are nothing</italic> (me-ayin) (Is. 41:24).</p>
<p>6. AND, BEHOLD, RACHEL HIS DAUGHTER COMETH. The accent is on the last syllable in the word <italic>ba&#x2019;ah</italic> (cometh) because it is a participle. It is similar to words in the <italic>po&#x2019;el</italic> form.<sup><xref rid="fn1641">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>12. AND JACOB TOLD RACHEL. <italic>And Jacob told Rachel</italic> should have been written before <italic>And Jacob kissed Rachel</italic> (v. 11).

<p>[AND FAIR TO LOOK UPON.] Her whole body was fair to look upon,<sup><xref rid="fn1652">23</xref></sup> or <italic>And fair to look upon</italic> refers to the complexion of her face.<sup><xref rid="fn1653">24</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn1634"><sup>5</sup> The root of <italic>va-yishb</italic> is <italic>shin, bet, heh</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1640"><sup>11</sup> <italic>Ayin</italic> means nothing; <italic>me-ayin</italic> whence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1641"><sup>12</sup> <italic>Po&#x2019;el</italic> is the participle form of whole roots (<italic>shelamim</italic>) in the <italic>kal</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1649"><sup>20</sup> Hence they ask, why were Leah&#x2019;s eyes different? I.E. obviously disagreed with the Midrashic interpretation to the effect that Leah&#x2019;s eyes were weak from crying because she had been told that she was destined to marry Esau.

One might think that <italic>zot</italic> refers to <italic>shevu</italic>&#x2019;a, i.e., fulfill this week; hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that <italic>zot</italic> refers to Leah. The reason for the preceding is that <italic>shevu</italic>&#x2019;a is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>; hence it is in the construct with <italic>zot</italic>, i.e., the week of this one. If it meant this week it should have read: <italic>shavu&#x2019;a zot</italic>. Furthermore, the Hebrew word for week is masculine; if the Bible wanted to say this week it would have read <italic>shavu&#x2019;a zeh</italic> since <italic>zot</italic> is feminine (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1656"><sup>27</sup> Rather than with a <italic>tzere</italic>. In such forms the last root letter is vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic>; compare, <italic>yishmereni</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that there are exceptions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1657"><sup>28</sup> That is, <italic>yillaveh</italic> comes from the root <italic>lamed, vav, heh</italic>, meaning to join. Hence, <italic>yillaveh</italic> means will be joined.</ftnote>

It is posssible that Leah gave her handmaiden to Jacob before Naphtali was born, that Rachel conceived before the birth of Zebulun,<sup><xref rid="fn1685">26</xref></sup> and that we do not know when Dinah was born.</p>
<p>26. FOR WHOM I HAVE SERVED THEE. This refers to <italic>my wives</italic>, not <italic>my children</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1686">27</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>and shed the blood of war in peace</italic> (I Kings 2:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1687">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. I HAVE OBSERVED THE SIGNS. <italic>Nichashti</italic> (I have observed the signs) means I have divined,<sup><xref rid="fn1688">29</xref></sup> for Laban was an enchanter and had teraphim.<sup><xref rid="fn1689">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. APPOINT. <italic>Nokvah</italic> (appoint) is an imperative.<sup><xref rid="fn1690">31</xref></sup> It follows the paradigm of <italic>zokhrah</italic> (remember) in <italic>Remember</italic> (zokhrah) <italic>me, O my God, for good</italic> (Neh. 13:31). The meaning of <italic>nokvah</italic> (appoint) is, clearly state, as we see from <italic>Which the mouth of the Lord shall mark out</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1691">32</xref></sup> (yikkovennu) (Is. 62:2).

<p>31. STREAKED.<sup><xref rid="fn1698">39</xref></sup> The streak was on the animal&#x2019;s foot. <italic>Akuddim</italic> (streaked) refers to a cord-like mark that bound the foot<sup><xref rid="fn1699">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>SPECKLED. <italic>Nekuddim</italic> means speckled.</p>
<p>GRIZZLED. <italic>Beruddim</italic> (grizzled) comes from the same root as <italic>barad</italic> (hail). It means having white spots.<sup><xref rid="fn1700">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>[SPOTTED.] <italic>Talu</italic> is a general term for all type of spots.<sup><xref rid="fn1701">42</xref></sup> It comes from the same root as <italic>u-metulla&#x2019;ot</italic> (and clouted) in <italic>and worn shoes and clouted</italic> (u-metulla&#x2019;ot) <italic>upon their feet</italic> (Josh. 9:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1702">43</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>u-metulla&#x2019;ot</italic> is marked.<sup><xref rid="fn1703">44</xref></sup> The term <italic>seh</italic> (v. 32), refers to he-goats.<sup><xref rid="fn1704">45</xref></sup> It is similarly written <italic>the sheep</italic> (seh kevasim) <italic>and the goat</italic> (seh izim) (Deut. 14:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1705">46</xref></sup> Now since <italic>talu</italic> (spotted) is a general term for all type of spots, the meaning of <italic>every speckled and spotted</italic> (talu) <italic>one</italic> is: every he-goat speckled, streaked and grizzled.<sup><xref rid="fn1706">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. AND EVERY DARK ONE AMONG THE SHEEP. <italic>Chum</italic> means black. It is possible that <italic>chum</italic> means black because it is affected by heat (<italic>chom</italic>), for a black object gets hotter than a white object.<sup><xref rid="fn1707">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE SPOTTED AND SPECKLED AMONG THE GOATS. Streaked, grizzled and speckled.</p>

<p>35. AND HE REMOVED THAT DAY THE HE-GOATS THAT WERE STREAKED AND SPOTTED. Spotted (<italic>telu&#x2019;im</italic>) means speckled and grizzled.</p>
<p>[AND ALL THE SHE-GOATS THAT WERE SPECKLED AND SPOTTED.] The interpretation of <italic>telu&#x2019;ot</italic> (spotted) is streaked and grizzled.<sup><xref rid="fn1709">50</xref></sup> This is what Scripture means by <italic>everyone that had white in it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1710">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ALL THE DARK ONES AMONG THE SHEEP. The black sheep. <italic>Chum</italic> (dark, black) is an adjective similar to a <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic>. It follows the paradigm of <italic>sug</italic> (dissembler) in <italic>The dissembler</italic> (sug) <italic>in heart</italic> (Prov. 14:14).<sup><xref rid="fn1711">52</xref></sup> A great grammarian explained the word <italic>haser</italic> (removing)<sup><xref rid="fn1712">53</xref></sup> in <italic>removing</italic> (haser) <italic>from thence</italic> (v. 32) as an infinitive, meaning to remove. The meaning of the aforementioned verse according to this scholar is: I will pass through all thy flock today to remove from thence every&#x2026;and that which I remove will be my hire.<sup><xref rid="fn1713">54</xref></sup> He further explained <italic>And gave them into the hands of his sons</italic> (v. 35) as referring to Jacob&#x2019;s sons.<sup><xref rid="fn1714">55</xref></sup> However, he said that <italic>he set three days journey betwixt himself and Jacob</italic> (v. 36) pertains to Laban.<sup><xref rid="fn1715">56</xref></sup> This comment is wrong in view of the fact that Jacob had no son older than Reuben, and he was not yet seven years old.<sup><xref rid="fn1716">57</xref></sup> This is the way our passage is to be explained: <italic>haser</italic> (v. 32) is, as its form indicates, an imperative meaning &#x201C;remove&#x201D; and the meaning of <italic>and of such shall be my hire</italic> (v. 32) is: such as these which you now remove will in the future be my hire.<sup><xref rid="fn1717">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. SO SHALL MY RIGHTEOUSNESS WITNESS AGAINST ME.

Behold you have already removed from the flock all goats streaked, speckled and grizzled and all black sheep.<sup><xref rid="fn1719">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. AND LABAN SAID: BEHOLD. <italic>Hen</italic> (behold) is identical in meaning to <italic>hinneh</italic>, the <italic>heh</italic> being superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1720">61</xref></sup> It is similar in this regard to <italic>ha-eleh</italic> (these) and <italic>ha-el</italic> (these).<sup><xref rid="fn1721">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. AND HE REMOVED. Laban removed.<sup><xref rid="fn1722">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. AND HE SET. Here, too, Scripture speaks of Laban.<sup><xref rid="fn1723">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. RODS OF. <italic>Makkal</italic> (rods of) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> because it is in the construct.</p>
<p>POPLAR&#x2026;ALMOND&#x2026;AND PLANE TREE. <italic>Livneh</italic> (poplar), <italic>luz</italic> (almond) and <italic>armon</italic> (plane tree) are names of trees. However, <italic>lach</italic> (fresh) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn1724">65</xref></sup> Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>luz</italic> means almond since that is its meaning in Arabic, and Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic belong to the same family.</p>
<p>MAKING THE WHITE APPEAR. He peeled the bark. Compare, <italic>The Lord hath made bare</italic> (chasaf) <italic>His holy arm</italic> (Is. 52:10).<sup><xref rid="fn1725">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. PEELED. The word <italic>pitzel</italic> (peeled) means he made small cuts.<sup><xref rid="fn1726">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THE GUTTERS. Pools containing water for the sheep to drink from.<sup><xref rid="fn1727">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY CONCEIVED. <italic>Va-yechamnah</italic> (and they conceived) is a combination of masculine and feminine forms.<sup><xref rid="fn1728">69</xref></sup> We find the same in the word <italic>va-yisharnah</italic> (and took&#x2026;the straight way) in <italic>And the kine took the straightway</italic> (va-yisharnah) (I Sam. 6:12).<sup><xref rid="fn1729">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>39. AND THE FLOCKS CONCEIVED. <italic>Va-yechemu</italic> means: and they conceived.<sup><xref rid="fn1730">71</xref></sup> This word is irregularly vocalized because of the <italic>chet</italic> which is a guttural. It should have been vocalized as <italic>va-yeshevu</italic> (and they sat down) in <italic>And they sat down</italic> (va-yeshevu) <italic>to eat bread</italic> (Gen. 37:25).<sup><xref rid="fn1731">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t be surprised at Scripture&#x2019;s use of the masculine<sup><xref rid="fn1732">73</xref></sup> when referring to female sheep. Hebrew is strict in differentiating between the masculine and feminine forms only in the singular and not in the plural.</p>
<p>AT THE SIGHT OF THE RODS. <italic>El ha-maklot</italic> should be rendered at the sight of the rod. Many are amazed at what is reported in our verse<sup><xref rid="fn1733">74</xref></sup> and say that it can only be described as an out of the ordinary phenomenon. Really, what Scripture describes is indeed one of the wonders of nature. However, it is a natural law. Even a woman who is created in the image of the angels affects her fetus by what she looks at while she is pregnant.<sup><xref rid="fn1734">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SPOTTED. Grizzled. This is so because <italic>telu&#x2019;im</italic> (spotted) is a general term for all types of spots.<sup><xref rid="fn1735">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. AND JACOB SEPARATED THE LAMBS. Jacob also did one more thing.<sup><xref rid="fn1736">77</xref></sup> He separated the lambs and chose the streaked and the dark ones and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and dark ones so that they would produce similar offspring. This resulted in his having his own droves<sup><xref rid="fn1737">78</xref></sup> which he did not <italic>put unto Laban&#x2019;s flock</italic>. Others say that Jacob separated the lambs from his own flock and that <italic>and put his own droves apart</italic> should have preceded <italic>and Jacob separated the lambs</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1738">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. WHENSOEVER THE STRONGER OF THE FLOCK DID CONCEIVE. In the month of Nisan,<sup><xref rid="fn1739">80</xref></sup> so that all those born would be strong and healthy.<sup><xref rid="fn1740">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>42. BUT WHEN THE FLOCK WERE FEEBLE. In the month of Tishri.<sup><xref rid="fn1741">82</xref></sup> Jacob did this so that Laban would not know that he was employing the sticks to produce spotted goats.<sup><xref rid="fn1742">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>FEEBLE. <italic>Atufim</italic> means feeble; compare, <italic>Their soul fainted</italic> (titattaf) <italic>in them</italic> (Ps. 107:5).</p>
<ftnote id="fn1660"><sup>1</sup> Pray to God as your father did when your mother could not conceive. Cf. Gen. 25:21. This is what Rachel meant by give me children. Rashi explains similarly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1661"><sup>2</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s commentary on Gen. 16:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1662"><sup>3</sup> The suffix &#x201C;me&#x201D; is sometimes written with two <italic>nuns (nni</italic>). To make up for this missing <italic>nun</italic> a <italic>dagesh</italic> is placed in the suffix <italic>ni</italic> (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1663"><sup>4</sup> It is a noun from the root <italic>peh, tav, lamed</italic> following a <italic>nifal</italic> paradigm. From this root we get the verb <italic>niftalti</italic> (I wrestled). The same is the case with the proper name Naphtali (Weiser). Krinsky and Cherez maintain that what I.E. means is that <italic>naphtali</italic> is an infinitive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1664"><sup>5</sup> <italic>Naftulai</italic> thus means twistings of (Weiser). I.E. uses twistings in a specific sense, twisting while fighting.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1665"><sup>6</sup> The point is that Rachel did not actually wrestle with her sister. She strove with her with the determination of a person trying to overpower his opponent. However, the literal meaning of <italic>naftule</italic> is twistings (wrestlings).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1666"><sup>7</sup> The point of the verse is that God deals with a person measure for measure, viz., <italic>With the pure Thou dost show thyself pure, And with the twisted</italic> (ikkesh) <italic>Thou dost deal tortuously</italic> (tittappal). In the latter verse <italic>tittappal</italic> (tortuously) is parallel to <italic>ikkesh</italic> (twisted). Hence <italic>tittappal</italic> implies crookedness or twisting. <italic>Tittappal</italic> is a variation of <italic>titpattal</italic> (Kimchi), and Ps. 18:27 which has the identical theme reads <italic>titpattal</italic>. Thus it seems that the root <italic>peh, tav, lamed</italic> and its variation <italic>tav, peh, lamed</italic> mean to twist (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1667"><sup>8</sup> <italic>Naftule Elohim</italic>, wrestlings of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1668"><sup>9</sup> <italic>Naftule Elohim</italic> (with mighty wrestlings) is to be rendered: Godly wrestlings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1669"><sup>10</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>naftule Elohim</italic> means wrestlings with God&#x2019;s help.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1670"><sup>11</sup> It is a combination of two words <italic>ba</italic> (spelled <italic>bet, alef</italic>) and <italic>gad</italic> (Weiser). Thus, <italic>bagad</italic> is spelled <italic>bet, gimel, doled</italic>. Hence the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>ba</italic> has been dropped.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1671"><sup>12</sup> This is the reading in <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 and many of the printed editions. Some editions read <italic>ba-kol</italic>. The latter is incorrect (Filwarg, Weiser). See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 11:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1672"><sup>13</sup> <italic>Bagad</italic> thus means: a troop has come.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1673"><sup>14</sup> Jupiter was believed to control men&#x2019;s fortune. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s commentary on Is. 65:11. This proves that Gad means Fortune, and <italic>bagad</italic>, Fortune has come.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1674"><sup>15</sup> The stars and planets. Therefore, Is. 65:11 does not contradict I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation that <italic>bagad</italic> means a troop has come.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1675"><sup>16</sup> The <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>be-oshri</italic> is the <italic>bet ha-sibbah</italic> (Weiser). Filwarg renders it: so that I may be called happy, the thought expressed by our verse being, this one was born so that the women may praise me by calling me happy (<italic>for the daughters will call me happy</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1676"><sup>17</sup> The roots of the mandrakes have this shape (Nahmanides).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1677"><sup>18</sup> According to medieval medical theory there are four humors, hot, cold, moist and dry. The body was believed to function according to the balance of these four humors. The humor that was hot was thought to stimulate sexual activity and cold to depress it Cf. Maimonides, <italic>Guide To the Perplexed</italic>, Part I, Chap. 34.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1678"><sup>19</sup> The primary meaning of <italic>tachet</italic> (for) is beneath. However, this translation does not fit here, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comments: that <italic>tachet</italic> is here to be rendered in place of and as a reward for (thy son&#x2019;s mandrakes).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1679"><sup>20</sup> Hence its meaning can only be ascertained from the context.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1680"><sup>21</sup> The <italic>ni</italic> suffix at the end of a verse stands for <italic>oti</italic>. Hence <italic>yizbeleni</italic> should be translated: will dwell me, an impossible construction. Therefore I.E. points out that <italic>ni</italic> here does not have the meaning of <italic>oti</italic> (me) but <italic>immi</italic> (with me). Since the suffix <italic>ni</italic> means <italic>oti</italic> (me), it is usually combined only with a transitive verb, compare, <italic>zevadani</italic> (endowed me); <italic>hikkani</italic> (smite me), <italic>yahargeni</italic> (will kill me) and others (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1681"><sup>22</sup> The Bible omits &#x201C;and she conceived&#x201D; with regard to Dinah (Weiser). &#x201C;And afterwards she bore a daughter&#x201D; implies one birth (Kimchi).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1682"><sup>23</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>asaf</italic> means gathered rather than cut off.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1683"><sup>24</sup> Cf. <italic>Seder Olam</italic> 2, &#x201C;Jacob spent 20 years in Laban&#x2019;s house. Seven before marrying the matriarchs, and seven after marrying them and six years after the birth of the eleven tribes and Dinah. We thus find that the tribes with the exception of Benjamin were born in seven years, each one every seven months.&#x201D; That is, six months and some days (Weiser). The point is that Jacob had acquired eleven sons and Dinah by the time he had finished serving his 14 years for his wives (v. 25). The first seven years he had no wife (v. 20). Hence all his children, with the exception of Benjamin who was born after he had left Laban, were born during seven years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1684"><sup>25</sup> Scripture tells us that Jacob&#x2019;s children were born in sequence; Reuben, Simon, Levi, etc. Since Jacob had twelve children in seven years, he had to have had a child every seven months since there are 84 months in seven years and 84 divided by 12 is 7. The reason I.E. says that Jacob&#x2019;s sons were born six months and some days following conception is to allow for the days of &#x201C;uncleanliness&#x201D; following childbirth during which Jacob abstained from intercourse with those wives who conceived twice in one year (cf. <italic>Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer</italic>, Chap. 36). The <italic>Seder Olam</italic> quoted above employs a round number (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1685"><sup>26</sup> Zilpah could have conceived Gad while Bilhah was pregnant with Naphtali, and Rachel could have conceived before Zebulun was born. The fact that Scripture tells us that Leah gave Zilpah to Jacob after Naphtali was born does not mean that that was the sequence of events. Cf. Cherez and Weiser. The point is there is no reason to assume that Jacob&#x2019;s children were born seven months apart.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1686"><sup>27</sup> The verse reads, <italic>Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee. For whom I have served thee</italic> can conceivably apply to <italic>my children</italic>, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1687"><sup>28</sup> See notes to I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 20:17.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1693"><sup>34</sup> <italic>Yiddevennu</italic> has a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>dalet</italic> to make up for the missing <italic>nun</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1704"><sup>45</sup> According to I.E. this clause should be translated: removing from thence every speckled and spotted he-goat.

Hence <italic>seh</italic> must refer to he-goats (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1705"><sup>46</sup> The term <italic>seh</italic> can thus apply to both goats and sheep. In the first part of our verse it applies to he-goats.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1706"><sup>47</sup> I.E. explains that <italic>nakod</italic> means speckled and <italic>talu</italic> includes the other types of spots, i.e., a mark around the ankle, <italic>akuddim</italic> (streaked), and hail like spots, <italic>beruddim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1707"><sup>48</sup> What I.E. probably means is that black objects absorb heat from the sun more than do white objects. This shows that heat causes blackness.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1713"><sup>54</sup> This is the meaning of: and of such shall be my hire.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1714"><sup>55</sup> Since according to this interpretation Jacob did the removing, he is the subject of verse 35 which reads: <italic>And he removed</italic>; and <italic>his sons</italic> refers to Jacob&#x2019;s sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1715"><sup>56</sup> This is obvious.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1716"><sup>57</sup> The events described in our passage took place after the close of Jacob&#x2019;s 14 years of service to Laban. Reuben, his oldest, was then not yet seven years old. How, then, could Jacob give the sheep to his small children to keep?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1717"><sup>58</sup> Verse 32 does not tell us that Jacob removed the sheep and kept them as his hire and then gave them to his children to keep (v. 35). Rather, it tells us that Jacob told Laban, &#x201C;Remove the spotted&#x2026;sheep and goats from your flock and keep them. However, in the future such as these shall be my hire.&#x201D; Verse 35 tells us that Laban removed them and gave them to his (Laban&#x2019;s sons) to keep.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1718"><sup>59</sup> I.E. connects <italic>before thee</italic> with <italic>so shall my righteousness witness against me</italic>, rather than with <italic>my hire</italic>, which precedes it (Krinsky, Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1719"><sup>60</sup> Hence all such animals found with me must be mine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1720"><sup>61</sup> I.E. makes this comment because the usual term for behold in Scripture is <italic>hinneh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1721"><sup>62</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 19:8. Both <italic>ha-el</italic> and <italic>ha-eleh</italic> mean the same, the <italic>heh</italic> being superfluous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1722"><sup>63</sup> I.E. makes this point because according to the grammarian quoted above, <italic>And he removed</italic> refers to Jacob.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1723"><sup>64</sup> According to the grammarian quoted above, <italic>And he removed</italic> refers to Jacob and <italic>And he set</italic> refers to Laban. Hence I.E. points out that both refer to Laban.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1724"><sup>65</sup> Scripture reads, <italic>livneh lach, ve-luz ve-armon</italic>. Conceivably <italic>lach</italic> could be taken to be the name of a tree. Hence I.E. points out that <italic>lach</italic> is an adjective modifying <italic>livneh</italic>, i.e., fresh</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1725"><sup>66</sup> We thus see that the root <italic>chet, sin, peh</italic> means to lay bare. Hence <italic>machsof ha-lavan</italic> means he laid bare the white (Weiser). He did this by peeling the bark. I.E. makes this point because the root <italic>chet, sin, peh</italic> can also mean to strip. Hence <italic>machsof ha-laven</italic> might be translated, stripping off the white.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1726"><sup>67</sup> The verb <italic>pitzel</italic> is found in Scripture only in verses 37 and 38. According to I.E. it does not exactly mean to peel. See S.D. Luzzato&#x2019;s commentary on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1727"><sup>68</sup> I.E. apparently interpreted <italic>rehatim</italic> (gutters) as being synonymous with <italic>shikatot ha-mayim</italic> (watering troughs) (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1728"><sup>69</sup> The feminine form third person plural is <italic>va-techamnah</italic>. The <italic>yod</italic> is a masculine prefix. Hence <italic>va-yechamnah</italic> combines the masculine (the <italic>yod</italic>) with the feminine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1729"><sup>70</sup> The correct feminine form is <italic>va-tisharnah</italic>. See note 69. The feminine should have been used since <italic>kine</italic> is feminine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1730"><sup>71</sup> It comes from the root <italic>yod, chet, mem</italic>, meaning to be hot, that is, hot with sexual desire and by extension to conceive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1731"><sup>72</sup> According to I.E. the root of <italic>va-yechemu</italic> is <italic>yod, chet, mem</italic>. Being a <italic>peh yod</italic> it should follow that paradigm. Thus the <italic>yod</italic> should be vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic> as the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>va-yeshev</italic>. However, since the <italic>chet</italic> is a guttural and is vocalized with a <italic>chataf segol</italic>, the <italic>yad</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic> (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1732"><sup>73</sup> <italic>Va-yechemu</italic>. Females conceive, hence Scripture should have stated <italic>va-techamna hatzon</italic> rather than <italic>va-yechemu hatzon</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1733"><sup>74</sup> That the sheep&#x2019;s fetuses were influenced by what the sheep looked at.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1734"><sup>75</sup> I.E. believed that it is a law that applies to all females. Hence what is described in our verse is not a supernatural phenomenon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1735"><sup>76</sup> Since <italic>telu&#x2019;im</italic> is a general term for speckled, streaked and grizzled, and speckled and streaked are specifically mentioned in our verse, <italic>telu&#x2019;im</italic> can only refer to grizzled (Krinsky). The Bible sometimes uses a general term for the particular (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1736"><sup>77</sup> In addition to peeling the sticks and having the goats face them while coupling.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1737"><sup>78</sup> Cherez.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1738"><sup>79</sup> The verse should be read as if written: And (Jacob) put his own droves apart and put them not unto Laban&#x2019;s flock, and Jacob separated the lambs (from his own droves) and set the faces of the flocks (of Laban) toward the streaked and all the dark (of Jacob&#x2019;s flock), he did this to all the flocks of Laban. It should be noted that according to this interpretation the meaning of <italic>be-tzon lavan</italic> (in the flock of Laban) is, he did this to all of Laban&#x2019;s flock. See Filwarg and Cherez.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1739"><sup>80</sup> Those born in the month of Nisan (Krinsky, Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1740"><sup>81</sup> The sun is strong then and the sheep born in this month are healthier.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1741"><sup>82</sup> Born in Tishri.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1742"><sup>83</sup> Had Jacob not done this, all the sheep would have been black and all the goats spotted and Laban would have known that something was wrong. Thus Jacob had to produce sheep for Laban. He did so when the offspring would be of inferior quality.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 31</title>
<p>1. THE WORDS OF LABAN&#x2019;S SONS. Laban had sons as Scripture explicitly tells us, <italic>and (Laban) gave them into the hand of his sons</italic> (Gen. 30:35).<sup><xref rid="fn1743">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S COUNTENANCE. I can tell by looking at your father&#x2019;s countenance that he is not (<italic>ennenu</italic>) toward me as beforetime.<sup><xref rid="fn1744">2</xref></sup> On the other hand, <italic>enennu</italic> (he is not) may refer to countenance (<italic>pene</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1745">3</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>The anger</italic> (pene) <italic>of the Lord hath divided them</italic> (chillekam) (Lam. 4:16).<sup><xref rid="fn1746">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. HATH MOCKED ME. <italic>Hetel</italic> is irregular in that it lacks a <italic>dagesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1747">5</xref></sup> It should have a <italic>dagesh</italic> like the word <italic>va-yehattel</italic> (and he mocked) in <italic>that Elijah mocked</italic> (va-yehattel) <italic>them</italic> (I Kings 18:27).<sup><xref rid="fn1748">6</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>hetel</italic> is mocked.<sup><xref rid="fn1749">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>TEN TIMES. The word <italic>monin</italic> (times) is akin to the word <italic>meneh</italic> (number) in <italic>Go number</italic> (meneh) <italic>the people</italic> (II Sam. 24:1).<sup><xref rid="fn1750">8</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: your father deceived me ten times. Or ten signifies many times.<sup><xref rid="fn1751">9</xref></sup> From the statement, <italic>The streaked shall be thy wages</italic>, it is clear that Laban changed Jacob&#x2019;s hire so that it was limited only to streaked goats.<sup><xref rid="fn1752">10</xref></sup> At other times Laban limited Jacob&#x2019;s hire to speckled goats.</p>
<p>9. THUS GOD HATH TAKEN AWAY. <italic>Va-yatzel</italic> (hath taken away) is similar in meaning to <italic>va-yenatzelu</italic> (and they despoiled) in <italic>And they despoiled</italic> (va-yenatzelu) <italic>the Egyptians</italic> (Ex. 12:36).<sup><xref rid="fn1753">11</xref></sup> Both (<italic>va-yatzel</italic> and <italic>va-yenatzelu</italic>) come from the same root as <italic>hatzileni</italic> (deliver me)<sup><xref rid="fn1754">12</xref></sup> (Gen. 32:12), although in the latter case the meaning of the word is a bit different from the first two examples.<sup><xref rid="fn1755">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>What Jacob told his wives was also true.<sup><xref rid="fn1756">14</xref></sup> Jacob dreamed that God would aid him so that his sheep would increase and be strong even without the use of the peeled sticks.<sup><xref rid="fn1757">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. I AM THE GOD OF BETH-EL. Its meaning is: I am the God, God of Beth-el.<sup><xref rid="fn1758">16</xref></sup> The same is the case with <italic>and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil</italic> (Gen. 2:9), which is to be interpreted as if written: and the tree of the knowledge, knowledge of good and evil.<sup><xref rid="fn1759">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. FOR HE HATH SOLD US. It is as if he sold us<sup><xref rid="fn1760">18</xref></sup> in that he did not do with us what a father normally does with his daughters. What he did was to say to you, &#x201C;Guard my flock and take my daughters as your hire.&#x201D;</p>
<p>18. HE HAD GATHERED. <italic>Rakhash</italic> (he had gathered) comes from the same root as <italic>rekhush</italic> (substance).<sup><xref rid="fn1761">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. NOW LABAN WAS GONE TO SHEAR HIS SHEEP. That were in the care of his sons who were three days journey away, as is reported by Scripture (Gen. 30:35, 36). Hence, <italic>it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled</italic> (v. 22).<sup><xref rid="fn1762">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE TERAPHIM. Some say that the teraphim are copper objects used to tell time.<sup><xref rid="fn1763">21</xref></sup> Others say that astrologers have the power to make an image that speaks at certain times.<sup><xref rid="fn1764">22</xref></sup> They offer proof from <italic>For the teraphim have spoken vanity</italic> (Zech. 10:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1765">23</xref></sup> However, this is not the meaning of the aforementioned verse.<sup><xref rid="fn1766">24</xref></sup> I believe that the teraphim are human images made to draw power from above.<sup><xref rid="fn1767">25</xref></sup> I am not permitted to explain this any further.<sup><xref rid="fn1768">26</xref></sup> Proof that the teraphim are human forms can be found in the teraphim which Michal, the daughter of Saul, placed in David&#x2019;s bed thereby fooling the guards into thinking that the teraphim were really David.<sup><xref rid="fn1769">27</xref></sup> As to the verse which states, <italic>For the children of Israel shall sit solitary many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim</italic> (Hos. 3:4),<sup><xref rid="fn1770">28</xref></sup> it can be explained in two ways. One, the prophet says, <italic>Israel shall be without king, and without prince</italic> because God chose only members of the Davidic family to be kings over Israel. Therefore the verse which follows says, <italic>afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king</italic> (v. 5). The verse continues, <italic>and without sacrifice, and without pillar</italic>; this refers to sacrifices and pillars to the idols. In a similar manner, <italic>and without ephod</italic> also refers to idolatry, because the worshippers of Baal made an imitation of the ephod that Moses made.<sup><xref rid="fn1771">29</xref></sup> Hence Scripture reads <italic>ephod</italic> and not &#x201C;the ephod&#x201D; as in <italic>Bring hither the ephod</italic> (I Sam. 23:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1772">30</xref></sup> Therefore <italic>an ephod in his hand</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>. v. 6) does not refer to the ephod made by Moses. I will explain the ephod and offer irrefutable proofs for my interpretation concerning it in the proper place if God will be kind to me and grant me life.<sup><xref rid="fn1773">31</xref></sup> The second interpretation is that <italic>and without ephod or teraphim</italic> means, they will neither serve God (<italic>without ephod</italic>) nor idols (<italic>or teraphim</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1774">32</xref></sup> That teraphim are idols can be ascertained by Laban&#x2019;s referring to them as gods (v. 30).<sup><xref rid="fn1775">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that Rachel stole the teraphim in order to keep her father from idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn1776">34</xref></sup> If this were the case, why did she take them with her and not bury them on the way?<sup><xref rid="fn1777">35</xref></sup> The most likely reason that Rachel stole the teraphim was that Laban, her father, was an astrologer, and Rachel feared that he would look at the stars and discover which way they fled.<sup><xref rid="fn1778">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND JACOB OUTWITTED LABAN. Jacob stole nothing from Laban save his &#x201C;wits.&#x201D; Scripture uses the term heart for wits because the heart is the seat of man&#x2019;s intelligence.<sup><xref rid="fn1779">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND GOD CAME TO LABAN THE ARAMEAN. This occurred before <italic>he overtook him</italic> (v. 23). Therefore its (v. 4) meaning is, and God had already come to Laban the Aramean. I have already pointed out many similar instances. <sup><xref rid="fn1780">38</xref></sup> God appeared to Laban out of respect for Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn1781">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>EITHER GOOD OR BAD. Do not speak to Jacob about returning even if you think it is for his good.<sup><xref rid="fn1782">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND LABAN WITH HIS BRETHREN PITCHED. <italic>Et echav</italic> is to be rendered: with his brethren.<sup><xref rid="fn1783">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word tent written in reference to Jacob also carries over to Laban.<sup><xref rid="fn1784">42</xref></sup> That is, now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban pitched his tent with his brethren in the mountain of Gilead.</p>
<p>28. NOW HAST THOU DONE FOOLISHLY. <italic>Aso</italic> (done) is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn1785">43</xref></sup> It is in the construct<sup><xref rid="fn1786">44</xref></sup> with either this or so. However, they are missing.<sup><xref rid="fn1787">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. IT IS IN THE POWER. <italic>El</italic> is to be rendered power. Compare, <italic>I am become as a man that hath no help</italic> (eyal) (Ps. 88:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1788">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. LONGEST. <italic>Nikhsof</italic> (longest) is an infinitive in the <italic>nifal</italic>. It is similar to <italic>nilchom</italic> (fight) in <italic>or did he ever fight</italic> (nilchom) <italic>against them</italic> (Jud. 11:25). The word <italic>nikhsafta</italic> means thou longest. <italic>Yikhsof</italic> (eager) in <italic>He is like a lion that is eager</italic> (yikhsof) <italic>to tear in pieces</italic> (Ps. 17:12) is similar.</p>
<p>32. HE SHALL NOT LIVE. Because I will put him to death. Some say that this was a prayer<sup><xref rid="fn1789">47</xref></sup> and it was because of this utterance that Rachel died on the way.<sup><xref rid="fn1790">48</xref></sup> If this be so, let them tell us who prayed and thus caused the death of Phinehas&#x2019; wife?<sup><xref rid="fn1791">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. AND LABAN WENT INTO JACOB&#x2019;S TENT, AND INTO LEAH&#x2019;S TENT, AND INTO THE TENT OF THE TWO MAID-SERVANTS. Both maid-servants shared one tent. Or it (v. 33) means into the tent of each one of the two maid-servants.<sup><xref rid="fn1792">50</xref></sup> Afterward<sup><xref rid="fn1793">51</xref></sup> Laban entered Leah&#x2019;s tent a second time. Proof of this is Scripture&#x2019;s statement, <italic>And he went out of Leah&#x2019;s tent</italic>. It is also possible that Jacob&#x2019;s tent was between Leah&#x2019;s and Rachel&#x2019;s tents.<sup><xref rid="fn1794">52</xref></sup> However, it appears to me that the Bible tells us what happened in abridged form<sup><xref rid="fn1795">53</xref></sup> and puts off the mention of Rachel&#x2019;s tent for last. The sequence of events was as follows. Laban searched Jacob&#x2019;s tent, then Leah&#x2019;s tent, then Rachel&#x2019;s tent and then the tent of the two maid-servants. The meaning of our verses (33 and 34) is that Laban searched Jacob&#x2019;s tent, Leah&#x2019;s tent and the tent of the two maid-servants and found nothing because there was nothing of his there. Scripture then tells us that when Laban went out of Leah&#x2019;s tent and into Rachel&#x2019;s tent where the teraphim had been, Rachel had by then taken them and put them in the saddle of the camel.<sup><xref rid="fn1796">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. [IN THE SADDLE.] Some say that <italic>kar</italic> (saddle) is a kind of saddle cloth.<sup><xref rid="fn1797">55</xref></sup> However, I believe that the term <italic>kar ha-gamal</italic> (saddle of the camel)<sup><xref rid="fn1798">56</xref></sup> means a camel, as in <italic>Send ye the camel</italic> (kar) <italic>for the ruler of the land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1799">57</xref></sup> (Is. 16:1); and <italic>u-va-kirkarot</italic> (and upon the camels) (Is. 66:20).<sup><xref rid="fn1800">58</xref></sup> I further hold that the driver or rider of the <italic>kar</italic> (camel) is called the <italic>kari</italic> (II Kings 11:19). Rachel took the teraphim and put them in the place where the camel (<italic>kar ha-gamal</italic>) was kept.<sup><xref rid="fn1801">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SAT UPON THEM. She was not in the tent.<sup><xref rid="fn1802">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. THAT THOU HAST HOTLY PURSUED. <italic>Dalakta</italic> means pursued. <italic>Yidlak</italic> in <italic>the poor is hotly pursued</italic> (yidlak) (Ps. 10:2) is similar.</p>
<p>39. I BORE THE LOSS OF IT. If any of the flock was torn by beasts, I bore the guilt<sup><xref rid="fn1803">61</xref></sup> and I gave you its equivalent.</p>
<p>STOLEN BY DAY. The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>genuveti</italic> (stolen) is superfluous. It is similar to the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>mele&#x2019;ati</italic> (full of) (Is. 1:21).<sup><xref rid="fn1804">62</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: whether stolen by day or by night,<sup><xref rid="fn1805">63</xref></sup> <italic>of my hand didst thou require it</italic>.</p>
<p>42. AND THE FEAR OF ISAAC. Isaac&#x2019;s fear of the Lord aided me, for the merits of a father help his son.</p>
<p>[EMPTY.] The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>rekam</italic> (empty) is not a root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn1806">64</xref></sup> The word is a noun.<sup><xref rid="fn1807">65</xref></sup> The Bible employs this form (<italic>rekam</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1808">66</xref></sup> with the masculine,<sup><xref rid="fn1809">67</xref></sup> feminine<sup><xref rid="fn1810">68</xref></sup> and the plural.<sup><xref rid="fn1811">69</xref></sup> The <italic>mems</italic> of <italic>omnam</italic> (verily, truly)<sup><xref rid="fn1812">70</xref></sup> and <italic>chinnam</italic> (for nothing, gratis) are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1813">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>43. AND WHAT CAN I DO THIS DAY FOR THESE MY DAUGHTERS. Laban was being especially explicit.<sup><xref rid="fn1814">72</xref></sup> The verse should be understood thus: and to these my daughters, what can I do to them?<sup><xref rid="fn1815">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>45. A PILLAR. Because he set it up.<sup><xref rid="fn1816">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>46. A HEAP. A <italic>gal</italic> (heap) is so called because it is formed by rolling stones together.<sup><xref rid="fn1817">75</xref></sup> He also called it Mizpah.<sup><xref rid="fn1818">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>49. [THE LORD WATCH.] The meaning of <italic>yitzef adonai</italic> is : the Lord will watch. <italic>I have appointed thee a watchman</italic> (tzofeh) (Ez. 3:17) is similar.</p>
<p>[WHEN WE ARE ABSENT.] <italic>Ki nissater</italic> (when we are absent) is to be read as if written: <italic>ki nissater anachnu</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1819">77</xref></sup> We will be distant one from another and will not be able to see each other. Nevertheless, God will see each one of us.</p>
<p>[FOR HE SAID.] This refers to Laban. Jacob called it<sup><xref rid="fn1820">78</xref></sup> Mizpah because Laban said to him, the Lord will watch, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1821">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>50. IF THOU SHALT AFFLICT MY DAUGHTERS. Saadiah Gaon explains this to mean: if you will not cohabit with your wives.<sup><xref rid="fn1822">80</xref></sup> Now this is a strange rendition of afflict. Nowhere in Scripture does afflict have this connotation.<sup><xref rid="fn1823">81</xref></sup> What problem is there in interpreting the term according to its plain sense?<sup><xref rid="fn1824">82</xref></sup> Its meaning is: do not do anything evil to my daughters or force them to do things against their will.</p>
<p><italic>Jagar-sahadutha</italic> is Aramaic for Galeed.<sup><xref rid="fn1825">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>51. WHICH I HAVE SET UP. Laban and his brethren.<sup><xref rid="fn1826">84</xref></sup> They cast stones and formed the heap. <italic>Yariti</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>yarah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1827">85</xref></sup> (cast) in <italic>hath He cast</italic> (yarah) <italic>into the sea</italic> (Ex. 15:4). He cast them into one place.<sup><xref rid="fn1828">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>52. THAT I WILL NOT PASS OVER. The covenant made on this heap.<sup><xref rid="fn1829">87</xref></sup> <italic>E&#x2019;evor</italic> (pass over) in our verse has the meaning of violate,<sup><xref rid="fn1830">88</xref></sup> as in <italic>they have transgressed</italic> (averu) <italic>the statute</italic> (Is. 24:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1831">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FOR HARM.] To do harm. Others say that it means, thou shalt not pass over this heap to harm me and I will not pass over this heap to harm thee.<sup><xref rid="fn1832">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>53. [THE GOD OF THEIR FATHER.] Each one said: the God of our Father <italic>judge betwixt us</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1833">91</xref></sup> However, Jacob referred to <italic>the God of Abraham</italic> and Laban <italic>to the god of Nahor</italic>, his grandfather who worshiped idols as is attested by Joshua.<sup><xref rid="fn1834">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND JACOB SWORE BY THE FEAR OF HIS FATHER. <italic>Fear of his father</italic> means the One whom his father feared. Others say that this alludes to the day when Jacob&#x2019;s father Isaac was bound on the altar. The latter interpretation is not far-fetched.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1743"><sup>1</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 30:35.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1744"><sup>2</sup> The verse reads: <italic>Ro-eh anokhi et pene avichen ki enennu elai kitmol shilshom. Pene</italic> (countenance) is a plural. The word <italic>enennu</italic> can be translated: he is not or it is not. If <italic>enennu</italic> is connected to <italic>pene</italic> the Bible should have employed <italic>enam</italic>, which is a plural, rather than <italic>enennu</italic> which is a singular. Hence <italic>enennu</italic> cannot refer to <italic>pene</italic>. It is rather connected to <italic>avikhen</italic> (your father) (Filwarg, Cherez). The verse is thus to be rendered: I see by your father&#x2019;s countenance that he is not toward me as beforetime.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1745"><sup>3</sup> In this case the meaning of the verse is: I see your father&#x2019;s countenance that it (the countenance) is not toward me as beforetime.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1746"><sup>4</sup> Where we find <italic>pene</italic>, a plural, connected to a singular. In this verse the verb pertaining to <italic>pene, chillekam</italic> (hath divided them) is in the singular. We thus see that while <italic>pene</italic> is a plural, it can be treated as a singular (Filwarg, Cherez). Hence <italic>enennu</italic> can refer to face. Weiser explains that <italic>pene</italic> is not really treated as a singular. It is a plural but a singular follows it for emphasis.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1747"><sup>5</sup> A <italic>dagesh</italic> should have been placed in the <italic>tav</italic>. According to I.E. <italic>hetel</italic> is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>. The middle root letter of a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> perfect receives a <italic>dagesh</italic>, and the first root letter is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>. Thus &#x201C;mocked&#x201D; should have been vocalized <italic>hittel</italic>. Hence <italic>hetel</italic> is irregular (Filwarg).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1750"><sup>8</sup> There is no such verse in the Bible. The reference is obviously to II Sam. 24:1. The text there reads, <italic>Go, number Israel and Judah</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1753"><sup>11</sup> They both mean to take. However, there is a difference in nuance between them. In our verse the word is in the <italic>hifil</italic> and it connotes taking what rightfully belongs to one. In Ex. 12:36 it is in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> (the intensive) and it means to take highhandedly, to despoil (Weiser).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1770"><sup>28</sup> This verse implies that there is nothing wrong with teraphim. Quite the contrary, it is juxtaposed with the ephod, a garment used in the service of the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1771"><sup>29</sup> The two interpretations of Hos. 3:4 are: A. The verse deals with idol worship, hence the juxtaposition of ephod and teraphim. B. The verse deals both with the worship of God and with idolatry. According to the latter interpretation <italic>and without ephod or teraphim</italic> means neither the worship of God nor idolatry.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1772"><sup>30</sup> According to I.E. ephod means <italic>an</italic> ephod. <italic>The</italic> ephod, with the definite article prefixed to it, is the ephod made by Moses.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1774"><sup>32</sup> According to this interpretation the ephod mentioned in Hos. 3:4 refers to the one used in the worship of the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1775"><sup>33</sup> We thus see that the teraphim were used in idol worship although they were not originally made for that purpose. This validates I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation that the teraphim refer to idol worship. In Hosea I.E. explains this second interpretation as follows: <italic>and without sacrifice</italic> to God, <italic>and without pillar</italic> to Baal, <italic>and without ephod</italic> to God <italic>or teraphim</italic> to Baal.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1778"><sup>36</sup> The teraphim, which were in human form, drew powers from the stars and revealed hidden things to Laban. Krinsky and Weiser suggest that I.E. is of the opinion that the teraphim had images of stars on them and through them Laban could divine hidden things.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1779"><sup>37</sup> Verse 20 literally reads: And Jacob stole the heart of Laban the Aramean. I.E. points out that unlike Rachel, who stole the teraphim, Jacob stole only Laban&#x2019;s heart; i.e., he fooled him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1780"><sup>38</sup> Of the use of the pluperfect. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 1:9.

<ftnote id="fn1782"><sup>40</sup> This is what Scripture means by good. Laban obviously spoke to Jacob. Indeed, Scripture records their conversation. What God meant was, do not try to convince him to return by threats, or by promises, even if the latter are sincere (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1783"><sup>41</sup> <italic>Et</italic> is the sign of the direct object Hence <italic>et echav</italic> means his brethren. The verse thus might conceivably be rendered: Laban pitched his brethren. However, this is impossible since pitched refers to tents, hence I.E. points out that <italic>et</italic> here is not the sign of the direct object but is to be rendered with.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1784"><sup>42</sup> The object following pitched with reference to Laban is missing, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1786"><sup>44</sup> The <italic>ayin</italic> of <italic>aso</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>chataf pattach</italic>. This is the construct vocalization. Had it been in the absolute, it would have been vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1787"><sup>45</sup> The text is abridged. It should have read <italic>hiskalta asot zeh</italic> or <italic>hiskalta asot ken</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1793"><sup>51</sup> After searching the tents of Jacob, Leah and the two maid-servants.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1794"><sup>52</sup> The question which I.E. deals with here is: Why did Laban search Rachel&#x2019;s tent last? We would expect him to search her tent after that of Leah. I.E. suggests that Jacob&#x2019;s tent was in the middle, between that of Rachel and Leah, and that to the side of Leah&#x2019;s tent stood the tent (or tents) of the maid servants. After searching Jacob&#x2019;s tent, Laban decided to search the tent of his older daughter first. Coming out of Leah&#x2019;s tent he found the tent of the maid servants and searched it On his way back he stepped another time into Leah&#x2019;s tent, found nothing there and proceeded to search Rachel&#x2019;s tent He did not search Rachel&#x2019;s tent after that of Leah because it was not next to it (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1795"><sup>53</sup> It omits telling us that the search of Rachel&#x2019;s tent took place after the search of Leah&#x2019;s tent. Scripture first tells us about those tents where Laban found nothing. It then tells us what happened when Laban searched Rachel&#x2019;s tent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1796"><sup>54</sup> Scripture puts off telling what happened when he searched Rachel&#x2019;s tent in order to be able to elaborate.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1798"><sup>56</sup> I.E. explains <italic>kar ha-gamal</italic> as a double word and that Scripture uses two words having the same meaning even though one word would suffice. See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 8:11 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1801"><sup>59</sup> Rather than: And she put them in the saddle of the camel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1802"><sup>60</sup> She was not in her tent but rather where the camel was. The reason I.E. does not interpret <italic>kar</italic> to mean cushion, or saddle, is that the word <italic>kar</italic> is not so used in Scripture. It is only so used in Rabbinic literature (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1803"><sup>61</sup> I.E. points out that <italic>achatennah</italic> (I bore the loss of it) is a denominative of <italic>chet</italic> (sin). Hence <italic>achatennah</italic> means I was guilty for it, the sin, was on me and I thus had to make it up and replace it.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1816"><sup>74</sup> Jacob called the pillar a <italic>matzevah</italic> because he set it up (<italic>hitziv otah</italic>) (Weiser). Cherez explains that a pillar is so called because it is set up.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1817"><sup>75</sup> Hence the noun <italic>gal</italic> (heap) comes from the verb <italic>galal</italic> (to roll) (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1818"><sup>76</sup> Cf. verse 49. Weiser points out that the suffix of <italic>kare&#x2019;ah</italic> (he called it) is feminine and cannot refer to <italic>gal</italic> (heap) which is masculine. <italic>It</italic> must therefore refer to <italic>matzevah</italic> (pillar) which is feminine. Weiser claims that I.E.&#x2019;s comment was transposed from verse 49 by a scribe who mistakenly thought that <italic>it</italic> referred to the heap. What I.E. is saying is that the heap was called Galeed and the pillar Mizpah. Cherez claims that <italic>it</italic> refers to the place. He called the place by two names, Galeed and Mizpah (place here being treated as feminine).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1819"><sup>77</sup> The text reads: <italic>ki nissater ish me-re&#x2019;ehu</italic>. I.E. says that this should be read as if written: <italic>ki nissater &#x201C;anachnu&#x201D; ish me-re&#x2019;ehu</italic>. The reason for inserting <italic>anachnu</italic> is that the context requires a first person plural pronoun (<italic>anachnu</italic>) following <italic>nissater</italic> (a verb in the first person plural imperfect) since what follows (<italic>ish me-re&#x2019;ehu</italic>) is in the third person.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1825"><sup>83</sup> This comment has been misplaced. Its proper place is in verse 47 (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1826"><sup>84</sup> I.E. explains that <italic>yariti</italic> (which in Hebrew means I have cast) refers to the heap of stones since the pillar was set up by Jacob alone (v. 45). Laban said, <italic>I have cast</italic>, because it was Laban and his brethren who made the heap, for we read, <italic>And they took stones and made a heap</italic> (v. 46).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1827"><sup>85</sup> Its root is <italic>yod, resh, heh</italic> and it means to cast.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1828"><sup>86</sup> I.E. is explaining what to cast a heap means. It means to cast many stones in one place until a heap is formed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1829"><sup>87</sup> This heap thus means the covenant made on this heap.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1830"><sup>88</sup> The root <italic>ayin, bet, resh</italic> means to pass over, hence to violate, to &#x201C;pass over the law, or agreement.&#x201D; The meaning of our verse thus is: that I will not violate the covenant made on this heap.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1831"><sup>89</sup> <italic>Averu chok</italic> (they have violated the statue) is not found in the Bible. The reference is probably to Is. 24:5, <italic>they have transgressed the laws</italic> (averu torot), <italic>violated the statute</italic> (chalefu chok). For an explanation of the misquote, see above note 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1832"><sup>90</sup> In this case the root <italic>ayin, bet, resh</italic> has its primary meaning of to pass over, and heap does not mean the covenant made at the heap but rather the heap which will serve as a border.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1833"><sup>91</sup> The Bible says, <italic>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their Father, judge betwixt us</italic>. One might thus think that both took the same oath and swore by the same Deity. I.E. points out that this is not so. Nahor served idols; hence his god was an idol.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1834"><sup>92</sup> Cf. Josh. 24:2, <italic>Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor; and they served other gods</italic>.

Furthermore, we know that the personality of the individual is taken into account when his sins are considered, be they major or minor transgressions. Therefore, a minor sin committed by a great personality is considered a major transgression. Jacob was afraid that he may have sinned or inadvertently transgressed in his mind and as a result of this God no longer would be with him. Do not be amazed at what I write, for behold, Moses the greatest of men, whom God himself sent to bring Israel out of Egypt erred and God sent an angel to kill him.<sup><xref rid="fn1859">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. I AM NOT WORTHY. <italic>Katonti</italic> (I am not worthy) is vocalized like <italic>yakholti</italic> (I have prevailed) in <italic>gam yakholti</italic> (Gen. 30:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1860">26</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: I am insignificant and of little worth for you to have done all these merciful deeds for me.<sup><xref rid="fn1861">27</xref></sup> I have already explained the meaning of mercy and truth.<sup><xref rid="fn1862">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND SMITE ME. <italic>And smite me</italic> applies to two phrases.<sup><xref rid="fn1863">29</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>And Saul&#x2019;s son had two men that were captains of bands</italic> (II Sam. 4:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1864">30</xref></sup> Our verse should be read as follows: and smite me and smite the mother and the children.</p>
<p>15. TWO HUNDRED SHE-GOATS. Jacob sent ten females for every male of the flock,<sup><xref rid="fn1865">31</xref></sup> four bulls for each cow, and two she-asses for every foal. He did this because he knew their nature.<sup><xref rid="fn1866">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND PUT A SPACE. The word <italic>revach</italic> means a space. <italic>Harevachah</italic> (respite) in <italic>That there was respite</italic> (harevachah) (Ex. 8:11) is close in meaning to it. The meaning of the latter is, there was a separation between one plague and the other. It is similar to <italic>ve-ravach</italic> (found relief) in <italic>so Saul found relief</italic> (ve-ravach le-sha&#x2019;ul) (I Sam. 16:23).<sup><xref rid="fn1867">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND ASKETH THEE SAYING. <italic>U-she&#x2019;elekha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1868">34</xref></sup> (and asketh thee) is vocalized the same as <italic>ahevekha</italic> (he loveth thee).<sup><xref rid="fn1869">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND ALL THAT FOLLOWED. Scripture says this because there were five groups.<sup><xref rid="fn1870">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHEN YE FIND HIM. The <italic>tzadi</italic> of <italic>be-motza&#x2019;akhem</italic> (when ye find) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> because it precedes a guttural.<sup><xref rid="fn1871">37</xref></sup> This is so even though we do not find another example of this in the Bible.<sup><xref rid="fn1872">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. FOR HE SAID. He said in his heart.<sup><xref rid="fn1873">39</xref></sup> These are the words of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn1874">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>[I WILL APPEASE HIM.] <italic>Akhapperah</italic> (I will appease him) means I will cover or hide.<sup><xref rid="fn1875">41</xref></sup> <italic>Panav</italic> (him)<sup><xref rid="fn1876">42</xref></sup> means his anger. <italic>Peneha</italic> (her countenance) in <italic>and her countenance</italic> (u-faneha) <italic>was no more sad</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1877">43</xref></sup> (I Sam. 1:18) is similar.</p>
<p>23. AND PASSED OVER THE FORD OF THE JABBOK. Jacob passed over first.<sup><xref rid="fn1878">44</xref></sup> He then returned and took his wives and children and brought them over the ford. Thus the meaning of <italic>and passed over</italic> is and he had already passed over. He then went back for a final look to see if anything was forgotten.<sup><xref rid="fn1879">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND THERE WRESTLED A MAN. <italic>Va-ye&#x2019;avek</italic> (and there wrestled) comes from the same root as <italic>avak</italic> (dust). They struggled so that dust arose between them.</p>
<p>UNTIL THE BREAKING OF THE DAY. <italic>Ad alot ha-shachar</italic> (until the breaking of the day) means until the darkness of the night went away.<sup><xref rid="fn1880">46</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>shachar</italic> (dawn) refers to the image of light that appears in the clouds before sunrise.<sup><xref rid="fn1881">47</xref></sup> <italic>Shacher</italic> (light) in <italic>wherein there is no light</italic> (shacher) (Is. 8:20) is similar.</p>
<p>26. THAT HE PREVAILED NOT AGAINST HIM. The angel against Jacob.</p>
<p>HE TOUCHED THE HOLLOW OF HIS THIGH. Jacob&#x2019;s thigh.</p>
<p>WAS STRAINED. <italic>Va-teka</italic> (was strained) is similar to <italic>teka</italic> (be moved)<sup><xref rid="fn1882">48</xref></sup> in <italic>Lest My soul be moved</italic> (teka) <italic>from thee</italic> (Jer. 6:8). The hollow of Jacob&#x2019;s thigh moved out of its place.</p>
<p>33. THE SINEW OF THE THIGH-VEIN. The meaning of the term <italic>gid ha-nasheh</italic> (the sinew of the thigh-vein) is known from the tradition received and transmitted to us by the Talmudic sages.<sup><xref rid="fn1883">49</xref></sup> No one but those lacking in understanding and knowledge of nature have any doubt as to its definition. The latter interpret <italic>gid</italic> (sinew) to refer to the penis and hold that <italic>nassheh</italic> (thigh-vein) comes from the same root as <italic>nashim</italic> (women).<sup><xref rid="fn1884">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note, the angel that appeared to Jacob was corporeal.<sup><xref rid="fn1885">51</xref></sup> This will be explained to you, if God will enlighten you, in the chapter that begins, <italic>for My name is in him</italic> (Ex. 23:21).</p>
<ftnote id="fn1835"><sup>1</sup> Laban was not bidding his sons adieu; hence <italic>his sons</italic> must refer to his grandsons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1836"><sup>2</sup> Scripture says <italic>he saw them</italic>; i.e., only Jacob saw them (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1837"><sup>3</sup> Since Jacob was on the way to the land of Israel from Haran, why did he send messengers to Edom? We must assume that Edom is between Syria (Haran) and Israel, and Jacob thus had to reconcile his brother before he passed through his territory. This disproves Saadiah&#x2019;s contention that Seir (Edom) is near Sinai, for Sinai is located southwest of Israel while Haran lies northeast of the land of Israel. The problem with I.E.&#x2019;s note is that Edom was located southeast of Israel, while Haran, as just noted, lies northeast. This is another example of I.E.&#x2019;s lack of knowledge concerning the geography of the Holy Land and its environs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1838"><sup>4</sup> I.E. takes issue with the Midrash <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 75:3 and Rashi who interpret <italic>malakhim</italic> to mean angels rather than human messengers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1839"><sup>5</sup> The root of <italic>echar</italic> is <italic>alef, chet, resh</italic>. In the first person imperfect an <italic>alef</italic> vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic> is prefixed to the root. Our word thus should have been written <italic>e&#x2019;echar</italic> (two <italic>alefs</italic> respectively vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic> and a <italic>chataf segol</italic>). However, it is written <italic>echar</italic> and has only one <italic>alef</italic> and is vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic>. I.E. points out that this <italic>alef</italic> is not a root letter. It is a first person imperfect prefix vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic> rather than a <italic>segol</italic> to make up for the missing root letter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1840"><sup>6</sup> The root of <italic>ahav</italic> (love) is <italic>alef, heh, bet</italic>. Thus the first person imperfect should be <italic>e&#x2019;ehav</italic>. However, the verse has <italic>ehav</italic>, one <italic>alef</italic> vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic>. See above note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1841"><sup>7</sup> The Hebrew has an ox and an ass, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1842"><sup>8</sup> The verse does not say what they were to tell Esau. I.E. points out that following <italic>to tell my Lord</italic>, we must insert: that I wish to do whatever he commands me.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1843"><sup>9</sup> Once we insert that I wish to do, etc., in the text, the meaning of <italic>so that I may find favor in thy sight</italic> becomes clear.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1844"><sup>10</sup> According to Filwarg. Others interpret slightly differently.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1845"><sup>11</sup> Since <italic>va-yetzer</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic> the word does not mean and he was distressed, but rather, it distressed him. Hence I.E. comments &#x201C;this thing distressed him&#x201D;; i.e., his brother&#x2019;s coming distressed him. Others maintain that <italic>va-yetzer</italic> is a <italic>nifal</italic> meaning and he was distressed. Filwarg asks, &#x201C;If <italic>va-yetzer</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic> why isn&#x2019;t it vocalized <italic>va-yatzer</italic> as is the rule with a double root (<italic>tzadi, resh, resh</italic> is the root of <italic>va-yetzer</italic>) in the <italic>hifil</italic>?&#x201D; He suggests that <italic>va-yetzer</italic> is irregular. Weiser suggests that perhaps I.E.&#x2019;s text of the Bible was vocalized <italic>va-yatzer</italic>. For a discussion of the problems concerning this comment of I.E., see Filwarg, Weiser and Cherez.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1846"><sup>12</sup> Which is in the <italic>hifil</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1847"><sup>13</sup> The root of <italic>va-yachatz</italic> is <italic>chet, tzadi, heh. Va-yachatz</italic> is an abridged <italic>kal</italic> imperfect with a conversive <italic>vav</italic>. In such cases the <italic>yod</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>. Compare, <italic>ve-yifen</italic> and <italic>va-yiven</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1848"><sup>14</sup> Here, too, we have an abridged imperfect with the <italic>yod</italic> vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> rather than a <italic>chirik</italic>. The reason is also that it precedes a guttural (the <italic>ayin</italic>). The root of <italic>va-ya&#x2019;al</italic> is <italic>ayin, lamed, heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1849"><sup>15</sup> I.E. makes the point because the word is found in both the masculine and the feminine in our verse. <italic>Machaneh ha-achat</italic> (one camp) is feminine. However, the suffix of <italic>ve-hikkahu</italic> (smite it) is masculine, as is <italic>machanah ha-nishar</italic> (the camp which is left).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1850"><sup>16</sup> The point is that the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-hayah</italic> does not indicate certainty, for how could Jacob be certain one camp would escape? Its meaning is perhaps. Thus rather than translating our verse: then the camp which is left shall escape, it should he rendered: perhaps the camp that is left shall escape.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1851"><sup>17</sup> Here, too, there was no certainty. What Joab said was, if the Arameans be too strong for me perhaps you will be able to save me. Thus <italic>ve-hayita li li-shu&#x2019;ah</italic> (II Sam. 10:11) does not mean, then thou shalt save me.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1852"><sup>18</sup> Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1853"><sup>19</sup> Rashi apparently interpreted <italic>ve-hayah</italic> as indicating certainty, then (<italic>ve-hayah</italic>) the camp that is left shall escape, i.e., despite Esau&#x2019;s will, it shall be saved. I.E. claims that this is not the literal meaning of the verse (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1854"><sup>20</sup> This verse indicates that Jacob&#x2019;s children would not be destroyed. I.E. now argues that one cannot substantiate Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation that Jacob was certain, on the basis of God&#x2019;s promise to him in Gen. 28:14, that at least one of his camps would escape (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1855"><sup>21</sup> How could Jacob be sure that one camp would escape, since the promise may not have applied to the children he now had (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1856"><sup>22</sup> The fact that Jacob was a prophet does not mean that he knew that God&#x2019;s promise recorded in Gen 28:14 applied to his present children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1857"><sup>23</sup> He thought Joseph was dead and was unaware that he had been sold into slavery.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1858"><sup>24</sup> We do not find God saying, <italic>I will surely do thee good</italic>. Hence when Jacob said, <italic>And Thou saidest: I will surely do thee good</italic>, he was restating, <italic>and I will be with thee</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1859"><sup>25</sup> Moses erred in not immediately circumcising his son. As a result God sent an angel to kill him (Ex. 4:24-26). God acted in this manner because a minor sin committed by a man of Moses&#x2019; stature was considered by the Almighty to be a major transgression. Similarly Jacob was afraid that he might have committed a minor sin resulting in God&#x2019;s removal of His divine protection, hence his anxiety.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1860"><sup>26</sup> A <italic>kal</italic> in the perfect is usually vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the middle root letter. However, <italic>katonti</italic> and <italic>yacholti</italic> are vocalized with a <italic>cholam</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1861"><sup>27</sup> The verse literally reads: I am small. I.E. interprets this to mean I am insignificant. Cf. <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 76:4: <italic>Katonti</italic>. Rabbi Abba says, &#x201C;This means I am not worthy.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1862"><sup>28</sup> Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 24:49.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1863"><sup>29</sup> <italic>Ve-hekkani</italic> is in the singular and <italic>prima facie</italic> refers only to Jacob. Thus nothing is stated about what Esau will do to the mother and the children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1864"><sup>30</sup> The Hebrew literally reads: And two men, captains of bands were son of Saul. I.E. says that captains of should be read as if written twice, i.e., And two men, captains of bands, were captains of Saul&#x2019;s son. Cf. Kimchi&#x2019;s comment on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1865"><sup>31</sup> Ten she-goats for every he-goat and 10 ewes for each ram.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1866"><sup>32</sup> He sent as many males as were needed to service the females.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1867"><sup>33</sup> Saul had space. Figuratively speaking, he went out of his straits to an open space. Thus the root <italic>resh, vav, chet</italic> can refer to physical space, or space in time, to relief.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1868"><sup>34</sup> when a <italic>kal</italic> in the third person has the suffix <italic>kha</italic> added to it, the second root letter is usually vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1869"><sup>35</sup> Deut. 15:16. It, too, is vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic> rather than with a <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath the second root letter (the <italic>heh</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1870"><sup>36</sup> Goats, sheep, camels, cattle and asses. Scripture notes that Jacob commanded the foremost, the second and the third group, <italic>and all that followed</italic> what to tell Esau because there were five groups and each group was instructed what to say.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1871"><sup>37</sup> When an infinitive is combined with a pronominal suffix, the second root letter is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>, as in <italic>be-shovbekha</italic> (Deut. 6:7) or <italic>tofsekhem</italic> (Josh. 8:8). However, in our case rather than being vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>, the second root letter is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>. We thus read, <italic>motza&#x2019;akhem</italic> rather than <italic>motzakhem</italic>. I.E. explains that this is so because the <italic>tsadi</italic> precedes a guttural (the <italic>alef</italic>) (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1872"><sup>38</sup> In all other similar cases, i.e., even preceding a guttural, the second root letter is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>. Compare, <italic>shomakhem</italic> (Deut. 5:20), where the <italic>mem</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic> even though it precedes an <italic>ayin</italic>, a guttural (Cherez). Thus I.E. notes that while his explanation is correct with regard to our word it does not hold for similar words in Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1873"><sup>39</sup> Jacob thought this. He did not instruct his messengers to say this to Esau, as one might gather from the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1874"><sup>40</sup> Moses in writing the Torah explained what motivated Jacob to send these gifts to Esau.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1875"><sup>41</sup> The root of <italic>akhapperah</italic> is <italic>caf, peh, resh</italic>, which means to cover.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1876"><sup>42</sup> <italic>Panav</italic> usually means face or countenance. Here it means anger. Jacob said, &#x201C;I will cover his anger&#x201D;; i.e., I will appease him. Weiser suggests that since anger is expressed in the face, face is, by extension, occasionally used as a synonym for anger.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1877"><sup>43</sup> According to I.E. this should be rendered: her anger was no more, i.e., she was pacified.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1878"><sup>44</sup> Scripture reads: <italic>And he rose up that night and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and (he) passed over the ford Jabbok</italic> (v. 23). <italic>And he took them, and sent them over the stream</italic> (v. 24). This is difficult to understand. Why interrupt the sequence of the narrative with <italic>and (he) passed over the ford Jabbok</italic>? Furthermore, if Jacob passed over the ford by himself, how could he take his wives and children over? Hence I.E. interprets that Scripture tells us that Jacob took his wives and children over but prior to this he had gone over himself (to see if it was safe for the others to pass-Nachmanides). Scripture then resumes the narrative by relating, <italic>And he took them and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had</italic> (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1879"><sup>45</sup> After taking his family across the river Jacob went back for a final look. Hence he was left alone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1880"><sup>46</sup> I.E. interprets <italic>alot</italic> (breaking) to mean go up, i.e., to depart, and <italic>shacher</italic> (dawn) to mean darkness, for this is what the root of <italic>shachar</italic> means.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1881"><sup>47</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>shachar</italic> means dawn and <italic>alot</italic> the rising. <italic>Alot ha-shachar</italic> thus means the breaking of dawn.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1882"><sup>48</sup> It comes from the root <italic>yod, kof, ayin</italic> and means was moved (Cherez, Weiser). J.P.S. renders it as alienated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1883"><sup>49</sup> <italic>Chullin</italic> 91a. The rabbis interpret <italic>gid na-nasheh</italic> to mean the sinew that slipped from its place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1884"><sup>50</sup> There was an anti-Rabbinic interpretation that explained the prohibition against eating the <italic>gid ha-nashah</italic> as follows: Therefore the children of Israel do not engage (eat) in abnormal intercourse with women (<italic>gid ha-nasheh</italic>).

<p>AND IF THEY OVERDRIVE THEM. If the drivers<sup><xref rid="fn1915">30</xref></sup> overdrive them, then all the flock will die.</p>
<p>14. AND I WILL JOURNEY ON. This is to be understood as, and I will journey on with them.</p>
<p>GENTLY. The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>le&#x2019;itti</italic> (gently) is either superfluous<sup><xref rid="fn1916">31</xref></sup> or is a first person pronominal suffix.<sup><xref rid="fn1917">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>ACCORDING TO THE PACE OF THE CATTLE. Because of the cattle, whose care is my work.<sup><xref rid="fn1918">33</xref></sup> I believe that the meaning of <italic>melakhah</italic> is what a person can do by himself or through his agent.<sup><xref rid="fn1919">34</xref></sup> Also, one&#x2019;s property is called <italic>melakhah</italic>, as in <italic>whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor&#x2019;s goods</italic> (melekhet) (Ex. 22:7). The word messenger (<italic>malakh</italic>) comes from the same root. A <italic>malakh</italic> (messenger) is so called because he is under the control of the one who sends him. The meaning of the word <italic>regel</italic> (the pace) is the same as <italic>le-ragli</italic> (because of me),<sup><xref rid="fn1920">35</xref></sup> as in <italic>and the Lord hath blessed thee because of me</italic> (le-ragli) (Gen. 30:30).<sup><xref rid="fn1921">36</xref></sup> However, it is possible that <italic>le-regel</italic> should be taken literally, since Jacob led the animals on foot.<sup><xref rid="fn1922">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. [WHAT NEEDETH IT?] I have no need of it.<sup><xref rid="fn1923">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND JACOB CAME IN PEACE. <italic>Shalem</italic> (peace) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn1924">39</xref></sup> The meaning of our clause is, Jacob came in peace to Shechem; i.e., no misfortune befell him on the way. Scripture notes this because it is about to tell of what happened to Dinah.<sup><xref rid="fn1925">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THE PARCEL OF GROUND. A portion in the field.<sup><xref rid="fn1926">41</xref></sup> Scripture mentions this<sup><xref rid="fn1927">42</xref></sup> to inform us of the greatness of the land of Israel. Whosoever has a portion in it is as though he had a portion in the world to come.</p>
<p>20. [AND CALLED IT EL-ELOHE-ISRAEL.]<sup><xref rid="fn1928">43</xref></sup> Saadiah explained that <italic>and called it El-elohe-Israel</italic> means, He called to the Lord, &#x201C;El-elohe-Israel.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1929">44</xref></sup> However, the correct interpretation is that he called the altar El-elohe-Israel (God, the God of Israel). Moses similarly called the altar he erected <italic>Adonai-nissi</italic> (the Lord is my banner) (Ex. 17:15) because of the miracle God performed in that place. Similarly, when the Divine Presence will once again return to Jerusalem, the city will be called <italic>Adonai-shammah</italic> (the Lord is there) (Ezek. 48:35). Jacob similarly called the altar whereupon he served the Lord, El-elohe-Israel (God, the God of Israel) because God came to his aid. The name <italic>El</italic> (God) means the One who is powerful and mighty.<sup><xref rid="fn1930">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>ELOHE-ISRAEL. He saved him on the way and ensured his safe arrival in Canaan, where Succoth<sup><xref rid="fn1931">46</xref></sup> and Shechem are located.<sup><xref rid="fn1932">47</xref></sup> I believe that Jacob spent many years in the city of Shechem, for at the time of Jacob&#x2019;s arrival in Shechem, Dinah was less than seven years old and also Simeon and Levi were yet small children.<sup><xref rid="fn1933">48</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1886"><sup>1</sup> <italic>Va-yishakehu</italic> has dots over it According to a Midrashic opinion this indicates that Esau did not kiss Jacob wholeheartedly. Cf. <italic>Yalkut Shimoni</italic> on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1887"><sup>2</sup> That is, children. The term used by I.E. is taken from Is. 28:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1888"><sup>3</sup> He kissed them and cried (Gen. 45:15). An alternate interpretation is, as Joseph did with his brother Benjamin (<italic>Ibid</italic>. v. 14).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1889"><sup>4</sup> That is, who are these who are obviously yours. I.E. points out that <italic>lakh</italic> can be interpreted as meaning <italic>immekha</italic> (with you) or <italic>shellekha</italic> (yours). Esau knew that these women and children belonged to Jacob. What he wanted to know was their relationship to him; were they servants or children (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1890"><sup>5</sup> <italic>Chanan</italic> usually means to show favor to, to be gracious to. Hence I.E. explains that here <italic>chanan</italic> means gave graciously.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1891"><sup>6</sup> Here, too, <italic>chanan</italic> has the meaning of to graciously give.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1892"><sup>7</sup> This is the reading of <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. Most of the printed texts have <italic>chanan</italic>. This reading is impossible to interpret. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>chinnam</italic> comes from the root <italic>chet, nun, nun</italic> and means something gotten gratis (Filwarg, Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1893"><sup>8</sup> <italic>Chanan</italic> and <italic>chinnam</italic> both come from the root <italic>chet, nun, nun</italic>. See note 7.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1895"><sup>10</sup> <italic>Mi le-khah kol ha-machneh ha-zeh</italic> literally means: who to thee all this camp? This lends itself to the two interpretations offered by I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1896"><sup>11</sup> <italic>Al na</italic> (nay, I pray thee) is short for <italic>al na yomar adoni ken</italic> (I pray my lord not to so speak) (Weiser).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1903"><sup>18</sup> I.E. explains <italic>tzela</italic> as a side (see his comments on Gen. 2:21). <italic>Tzole</italic>&#x2019;a is a denominative. A healthy person walks straight, a sick person leans on one side (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1904"><sup>19</sup> In commemoration of Jacob&#x2019;s victory over the angel, or of God&#x2019;s saving Jacob from being overcome by the angel (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1905"><sup>20</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>nisah</italic> (let us take our journey) means, take your journey. The usual form for let us take our journey is <italic>nissa</italic> with a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>samakh</italic>, not <italic>nisah</italic> which does not have a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>samekh</italic> and has a <italic>heh</italic> at the end. The usual imperative form for take your journey is <italic>sa</italic>. The commentators quoted by I.E. point out that in the elongated imperative the first letter of the root is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic> and the last with a <italic>kamatz</italic>, as in <italic>shilchah</italic>. Cf. Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1906"><sup>21</sup> An elongated imperative. The usual form of the imperative for send is <italic>shelach</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1907"><sup>22</sup> Most roots having a <italic>nun</italic> as their first root letter drop the <italic>nun</italic> in the imperative, thus the imperative of <italic>nun, samekh, ayin</italic> is <italic>sa</italic>. I.E. points out that in <italic>nun, peh, lamed, the nun</italic> does not drop in the imperative. Hence while in <italic>nasa</italic> the <italic>nun</italic> normally drops out in the imperative, it does not in the elongated imperative. Hence <italic>nisah</italic> is similar to <italic>niflu</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1908"><sup>23</sup> In contradistinction to <italic>nisah, ve-nelekhah</italic> (and let us go) which is a plural. I.E. further points out that the meaning of <italic>and I will go before thee</italic> is: I will not move away from thee (Weiser). Compare Rashi, <italic>and I will go before thee</italic>, equally with thee. Krinky suggests that I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation is: even if I perchance go before thee, I will not go far from thee but will keep up with thee.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1909"><sup>24</sup> <italic>Nissse&#x2019;ah</italic> in Ezra 8:31 is an elongated first person plural imperfect meaning: we will depart, we will take our journey. The <italic>vav</italic> prefixed to it changes it to a perfect. Hence <italic>va-nisse&#x2019;ah</italic> means: then we departed. I.E. now says <italic>nisah</italic> in our verse, too, is a first person plural imperfect meaning: let us take our journey. However, he does not explain why there is no <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>samekh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1910"><sup>25</sup> That is, <italic>nisah</italic> is a first person plural imperfect. According to the first interpretation our verse reads: Take your journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee; according to the second: Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1911"><sup>26</sup> Jacob spent 20 years in Laban&#x2019;s house. He was unmarried for the first seven years, after which he married Leah. Thus Reuben, Jacob&#x2019;s eldest son, could not have been much older than 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1912"><sup>27</sup> This is how I.E. renders <italic>alot</italic>. The usual translation of <italic>alot</italic> is: those that give suck.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1913"><sup>28</sup> Mounted them. This applies to the other kinds as well. I.E. is merely using the language of Scripture, viz., <italic>the he-goats which leaped (mounted) upon the flock</italic> (Gen. 31:10). The point is that pregnant animals are called <italic>alot</italic> because they were mounted by male animals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1914"><sup>29</sup> The Hebrew literally reads: upon me.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1915"><sup>30</sup> The &#x201C;they&#x201D; is not identified in the text Hence I.E. points out that it refers to the drivers.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1917"><sup>32</sup> Meaning at my ease or at my slow pace.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1918"><sup>33</sup> <italic>Melakhah</italic> usually means work. I.E. explains why it refers to cattle here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1919"><sup>34</sup> I.E. does not disagree with his original point that <italic>melakhah</italic> here refers to cattle. He now expands on the meaning of the word (Filwarg). According to the first interpretation &#x201C;work&#x201D; refers to cattle because Jacob&#x2019;s work was taking care of cattle. According to the second interpretation &#x201C;work&#x201D; can refer directly to cattle, for one&#x2019;s possessions are one&#x2019;s work.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1920"><sup>35</sup> <italic>Le-regel</italic> (according to the pace) means because. Although the basic meaning of <italic>melachah</italic> is changed in the second interpretation, the meaning of <italic>le-regel</italic> (because) remains unchanged.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1921"><sup>36</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation of Gen. 30:30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1922"><sup>37</sup> Since <italic>melakhah</italic> means cattle, why not interpret <italic>regel</italic> literally as meaning feet, since the animals walked, viz., according to the pace (foot) of the cattle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1923"><sup>38</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>lammah zeh emtzah chen be-ene adoni</italic>. This can be rendered: why then shall I find favor in the eyes of my lord? I.E. explains that this is not the way to interpret the verse. <italic>Lammah zeh</italic> is not to be connected to <italic>emtza chen</italic>, etc. The verse is to be interpreted: <italic>lammah zeh</italic>, why this? That is, why do this when I have no need of it? <italic>Emtza chen be-ene adoni</italic> is another clause meaning: I merely want to find favor in your eyes (Weiser, Krinsky). Cf. Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1924"><sup>39</sup> <italic>Shalem</italic> can be taken to be the name of a place, Salem. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1925"><sup>40</sup> That is why Scripture notes that up to now no misfortune befell him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1926"><sup>41</sup> I.E. explains that Jacob did not buy the <italic>parcel of ground where he had spread his tent</italic>. He rather bought a portion in the field <italic>where he had spread his tent</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1927"><sup>42</sup> That Jacob bought, not rented, a parcel of land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1928"><sup>43</sup> God, the God of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1929"><sup>44</sup> The word <italic>lo</italic> can mean either it or him. Saadiah had difficulty in accepting that Jacob called the altar God, the God of Israel. Hence he did not interpret <italic>lo</italic> as meaning it, i.e., the altar, but rather as Him, i.e., God. He interprets our verse as: And called to Him, God, God of Israel (Krinsky). For a slightly different interpretation see Cherez.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1930"><sup>45</sup> God thereby demonstrated His might Therefore, Jacob called him El, mighty and powerful.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1931"><sup>46</sup> Verse 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1932"><sup>47</sup> Where Jacob now camped.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1933"><sup>48</sup> Jacob stayed in Laban&#x2019;s house for 20 years. He married Leah and Rachel after seven years, and with the exception of Benjamin, all of his children were born in the next seven years (cf. I.E. on Gen. 30:23). Reuben, his eldest, was a little over 12. Simeon and Levi, the next two in order, a bit younger. Dinah, who was born in the 14th year of Jacob&#x2019;s service to Laban, had to be under seven. The question thus arises, could what is described in Chapter 34 apply to such a little girl? Dinah is described as a young lady of age. Furthermore, could children of Simeon and Levi&#x2019;s age, preadolescents, overcome and slay a city? Could pre-adolescents act and talk the way Jacob&#x2019;s sons are described as doing in Chapter 34? I.E. thus suggests that many years passed between the end of Chapter 33 and Chapter 34. During these years Jacob&#x2019;s children had grown. It should be noted that in putting forth this interpretation I.E. is taking issue with the Midrash which states that Simeon and Levi were 13 when they destroyed Shechem. Cf. <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 80.</ftnote>

<p>3. AND SPOKE COMFORTINGLY UNTO THE DAMSEL. He spoke tenderly and comfortingly to her.</p>
<p>5. THAT HE HAD DEFILED. That Shechem had defiled.</p>
<p>14. A REPROACH. It will be a reproach for generations.<sup><xref rid="fn1938">5</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>because he had wrought a vile deed in Israel</italic> (v. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn1939">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>[13. AND SPOKE BECAUSE HE HAD DEFILED.] And spoke to Shechem who had (<italic>asher</italic>) defiled their sister.<sup><xref rid="fn1940">7</xref></sup> We may interpret our verse in this manner because we find Scripture stating, <italic>dabbero le-shalom</italic> (Gen. 37:4), which is to be rendered: speak peaceably unto him (Gen. 37:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1941">8</xref></sup> On the other hand <italic>asher</italic> may mean because. In this case the Bible is telling us that they answered with guile because (<italic>asher</italic>) he had defiled Dinah their sister.<sup><xref rid="fn1942">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO ONE THAT IS UNCIRCUMCISED. One whose sexual member is uncircumcised.<sup><xref rid="fn1943">10</xref></sup> The meaning of the term <italic>orlah</italic> (uncircumcised) is something which is heavy. <italic>Aral</italic> (uncircumcised), in <italic>uncircumcised</italic> (aral) <italic>lips</italic> (Ex. 6:12), and <italic>arelah</italic> (dull), in <italic>their ear is dull</italic> (arelah) (Jer. 6:10), are similar. An <italic>orlah</italic> is something which lays heavy because it is an unnecessary appendage.<sup><xref rid="fn1944">11</xref></sup> Those who say that Abraham blemished himself by undergoing circumcision, and thereby violated God&#x2019;s charge to him, <italic>and be thou whole</italic> (Gen. 17:1), err. The opposite is true.<sup><xref rid="fn1945">12</xref></sup> Proof of this can be offered from the animal kingdom. <sup><xref rid="fn1946">13</xref></sup> As to their query, why remove that which God created, we respond that God also created the umbilical cord.<sup><xref rid="fn1947">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. OUR DAUGHTER. They spoke thus because she was a minor.<sup><xref rid="fn1948">15</xref></sup> They referred to Dinah as our daughter because they spoke on behalf of Jacob.</p>
<p>19.

<p>22. WILL THE MEN CONSENT. <italic>Ye&#x2019;otu</italic> (consent) comes from the same root as <italic>ya&#x2019;atah</italic> (befitteth) in <italic>For it befitteth</italic> (ya&#x2019;atah) <italic>Thee</italic> (Jer. 10:7).<sup><xref rid="fn1953">20</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic> prefix is vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1954">21</xref></sup> to compensate for the missing first root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn1955">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>BE CIRCUMCISED. The word <italic>be-himmol</italic> (be circumcised) has already been explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1956">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shechem and Hamor had evil designs on Jacob and his sons for they said, <italic>Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours</italic> (v. 22)?<sup><xref rid="fn1957">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. ON THE THIRD DAY. The third day is always a difficult day because it is half of a monthly quarter.<sup><xref rid="fn1958">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Simeon and Levi acted with the full consent of their brothers. This is clear from <italic>And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile</italic> (v. 13). The &#x201C;sons of Jacob&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1959">26</xref></sup> refers to all of the brothers. Jacob spilled his anger on Simeon and Levi because they killed the men of Shechem<sup><xref rid="fn1960">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. EVEN ALL THAT WAS IN THE HOUSE. This refers either to the house of Shechem or Hamor.<sup><xref rid="fn1961">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. FEW IN NUMBER. <italic>Mete</italic> (few) means men. Anything that can be numbered is deemed a few.<sup><xref rid="fn1962">29</xref></sup> Hence Rabbi Aaron Ha-Kohen, dean of the Yeshiva,<sup><xref rid="fn1963">30</xref></sup> errs in rendering literally <italic>vi-yehi metav mispar</italic> (in that his men became few) (Deut. 33:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1964">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO MAKE ME ODIOUS.<sup><xref rid="fn1965">32</xref></sup> They will hate me as one loathes something which gives off a horrible odor.</p>

<p>SHOULD ONE DEAL WITH OUR SISTER AS WITH A HARLOT. Should Shechem deal with our sister as with a harlot.<sup><xref rid="fn1966">33</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1934"><sup>1</sup> She did not ask her parents&#x2019; permission (Krinsky). Filwarg asks, &#x201C;How does I.E. know this?&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1935"><sup>2</sup> Contra Rashi who interprets humbled as sodomized.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1936"><sup>3</sup> The root <italic>ayin, nun, heh</italic> means to afflict. Thus <italic>va-ye&#x2019;anneha</italic> (and he humbled her) means he afflicted her. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1937"><sup>4</sup> Intercourse was thus painful, hence the term afflicted her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1938"><sup>5</sup> Cherez interprets I.E. to mean that future generations will look down upon us. They will ask, how could they give their sister to an uncircumcised man?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1939"><sup>6</sup> According to I.E. the vile deed refers to having intercourse with an uncircumcised male (Weiser). Israel in verse 7 refers to a later time when there was a people of Israel. It was then shameful to recall that Dinah had slept with an uncircumcised man (Joseph ben Eliezer Ha-Sephardi).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1940"><sup>7</sup> The Hebrew reads: <italic>va-yedabberu, asher timme et dinah achotam</italic> which literally means: and they spoke who had defiled Dinah their sister. This makes no sense. Hence I.E. points out that Shechem, who is mentioned in the first part of the verse (<italic>et shechem</italic>), is also the object here. We should thus read it as if it were written: <italic>va-yedabberu et shechem asher timme et dinah achotam</italic>, viz., and spoke to Shechem who had defiled their sister. It should be noted that according to this interpretation, <italic>asher</italic> means who.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1941"><sup>8</sup> I.E. claims that <italic>dabber et Shechem</italic> is grammatically similar to <italic>dabbero</italic>. For an explanation of their linguistic similarity see Filwarg. See also notes to Gen. 37:4. For alternate interpretations see Weiser, Cherez and Krinsky.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1943"><sup>10</sup> The Hebrew literally reads: to one who has an <italic>orlah</italic>, hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1944"><sup>11</sup> Krinsky. In the case of the foreskin the heaviness is physical. In the case of lips and ears, metaphoric. I.E. renders &#x201C;uncircumcised lips&#x201D; as heavy lips. There is, as it were, a burden on the lips which makes speaking difficult. The same applies to the ears.</ftnote>

<p>2. PUT AWAY THE STRANGE GODS. Heaven forbid that the prophet would live with women who served strange gods.<sup><xref rid="fn1967">1</xref></sup> The explanation of this verse will be found in the Torah portion <italic>va-yelekh moshe</italic> (And Moses went).<sup><xref rid="fn1968">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND PURIFY YOURSELVES. Wash your bodies.</p>
<p>AND CHANGE YOUR GARMENTS. From this verse we learn that an Israelite must have a clean body and spotless garments when he goes to pray in a place set aside for worship.</p>
<p>5. A TERROR OF. The <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>chittat</italic> (terror of) receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> to compensate for the missing root letter, the <italic>tav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1969">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. [BECAUSE THERE GOD WAS REVEALED TO HIM.] <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) refers to angels.<sup><xref rid="fn1970">4</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it</italic> (Gen. 28:12).<sup><xref rid="fn1971">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. THY NAME SHALL NOT BE CALLED ANYMORE JACOB. You shall no longer be called only Jacob but also Israel.</p>
<p>11. BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY. This is a blessing as in the account of the Creation.<sup><xref rid="fn1972">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. [AND JACOB SET UP A PILLAR.] This may be a pluperfect meaning Jacob had already set up a pillar.<sup><xref rid="fn1973">7</xref></sup> On the other hand, Jacob may now have set up a pillar a second time. I prefer the first interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn1974">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE POURED OUT A DRINK-OFFERING THEREON. He poured wine or water on the pillar. Jacob first washed the pillar with wine or water<sup><xref rid="fn1975">9</xref></sup> and then <italic>poured oil thereon</italic>. Here at Beth-el Jacob kept his vow<sup><xref rid="fn1976">10</xref></sup> and gave a tithe of his wealth in honor of God to a contemporary who was worthy to receive it.<sup><xref rid="fn1977">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. SOME WAY. It is possible that the <italic>caf</italic> of <italic>kivrat</italic> (some way) is a preposition meaning similar to<sup><xref rid="fn1978">12</xref></sup> and that <italic>brat</italic> is a distance measured by walking.<sup><xref rid="fn1979">13</xref></sup> The word does not appear elsewhere in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1980">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. WHEN SHE WAS IN HARD LABOR. <italic>Be-hakshotah</italic> (when she was in hard) is a <italic>hifil</italic>. The meaning of <italic>be-hakshotah be-lidtah</italic> (when she was in hard labor) is: the delivery caused her pain.<sup><xref rid="fn1981">15</xref></sup> <italic>Va-tekash</italic> (and she had hard labor, in v. 16) is similar. <sup><xref rid="fn1982">16</xref></sup> However the latter is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>. <italic>Va-tekash</italic> is similar to <italic>va-tekhal</italic> (and she was done) in <italic>And when she had done</italic> (va-tekhal) <italic>giving him drink</italic> (Gen. 24:19).<sup><xref rid="fn1983">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>20. HER GRAVE. <italic>Kevuratah</italic> (her grave) and <italic>kivrah</italic> (her grave) mean the same.<sup><xref rid="fn1984">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. THAT REUBEN WENT. Our sages explained this beautifully;<sup><xref rid="fn1985">19</xref></sup> for <italic>a prudent man concealeth shame</italic> (Prov. 12:16).</p>
<p>26. THAT WERE BORN TO HIM IN PADDAN-ARAM. Actually only eleven sons were born to Jacob in Paddan-aram<sup><xref rid="fn1986">20</xref></sup> for Benjamin was born in the land of Canaan. Scripture speaks of the majority of his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn1987">21</xref></sup> I will in the future point out many similar cases.<sup><xref rid="fn1988">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND ISAAC EXPIRED. When Isaac died and was gathered to his people Easu and Jacob buried him.<sup><xref rid="fn1989">23</xref></sup> Scripture mentions Esau<sup><xref rid="fn1990">24</xref></sup> before Jacob because the Pentateuch follows the order of their birth. However, in relating the burial of Abraham the Bible reads, <italic>And Isaac and Ishmael</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1991">25</xref></sup> <italic>his sons buried him</italic> (Gen. 25:9) because Ishmael was the son of a handmaid.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1967"><sup>1</sup> Our verse reads: <italic>Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, &#x201C;Put away the strange gods that are among you</italic>.&#x201D; This implies that his wives had strange gods.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1977"><sup>11</sup> Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 28:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1978"><sup>12</sup> In other words, <italic>kivrat</italic> (some way) is to be interpreted <italic>ki-verat</italic>, as a <italic>brat</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1979"><sup>13</sup> This is the reading in <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. The printed editions read: a king&#x2019;s measure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1980"><sup>14</sup> The word <italic>kivrat</italic> does appear in II Kings 5:19. Krinsky suggests that I.E. means it doesn&#x2019;t appear elsewhere in the Pentateuch. Cherez maintains that I.E. means that the word <italic>berat</italic> is not found in Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1981"><sup>15</sup> <italic>Hifil</italic> is a causative form. If this is the case then <italic>be-hakshotah</italic> must be transitive, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that it means caused her hardship. Cf. Kimchi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1982"><sup>16</sup> It, too, is an active form and is to be explained as in note 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1983"><sup>17</sup> Both words are shortened forms of the <italic>pi&#x2019;el. Va-tekash</italic> is short for <italic>va-tekasheh</italic> as <italic>va-tekhal</italic> is short for <italic>va-tekhalleh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1984"><sup>18</sup> <italic>Kever</italic> means a grave, <italic>kevurah</italic> a burial, and <italic>kevuratah</italic> her burial. Thus our verse should have read <italic>kivrah</italic> (her grave) and not <italic>kevuratah</italic> (her burial) since Jacob erected a monument over Rachel&#x2019;s grave. I.E. points out that <italic>kevuratah</italic> can also have the same meaning as <italic>kivrah</italic> (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1985"><sup>19</sup> According to the rabbis Reuben did not actually lay with Billah but rather removed his father&#x2019;s couch from her tent and placed it in the tent of his mother Leah. Scripture considers this act of audacity as if he had actually slept with her. Cf. <italic>Sabbath</italic> 55b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1986"><sup>20</sup> The problem is that our verse states that all of Jacob&#x2019;s sons were born in Paddanaram, when in fact this was not so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1987"><sup>21</sup> <italic>These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram</italic> refers to the majority of his sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1988"><sup>22</sup> Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 47:27.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1989"><sup>23</sup> Chronologically speaking Isaac did not die at this point for he lived until Joseph was 29 years of age (see I.E. on Gen. 37:35). Scripture notes the death of Isaac here because it will no longer deal with him (Filwarg). Thus <italic>And Isaac expired, and died</italic> should be rendered: And when Isaac expired and died, etc. (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1990"><sup>24</sup> Even though Esau sold his birthright to Jacob and was no longer technically the eldest.</ftnote>

<p>1. THE SAME IS EDOM. He is the father of Edom.<sup><xref rid="fn1992">1</xref></sup> Do not be surprised that Scripture here calls <italic>the daughter of Elon the Hittite</italic> whom Esau married Adah, while earlier it refers to her by the name of Basemath (Gen. 26:34), for she had two names.<sup><xref rid="fn1993">2</xref></sup> We find the same with the mother of Abijah.<sup><xref rid="fn1994">3</xref></sup> Indeed, Abijah himself (II Chron. 11:20) is called Abijam in the Book of Kings (I Kings 15:1) and Abijah in Chronicles (II Chron. 11:20).<sup><xref rid="fn1995">4</xref></sup> The Bible refers to them by two different names because both Abijah and his mother had two names each.</p>
<p><italic>These are the names of Esau&#x2019;s sons</italic> (v. 10) refers to his grandchildren.<sup><xref rid="fn1996">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND OHOLIBAMAH THE DAUGHTER OF ANAH, THE DAUGHTER OF ZIBEON THE HIVITE. We find in our chapter a man called Anah who is the brother of Zibeon (v. 20). We further read that Zibeon had a son called Anah (v. 24). Our verse thus relates that Zibeon and his son Anah, or perhaps Zibeon and his brother Anah, slept with the same woman and the offspring did not know who their father was.<sup><xref rid="fn1997">6</xref></sup> However, it is also possible that Oholibamah was the daughter of Anah the son of Zibeon, and Scripture lists her as being the daughter of Anah and Zibeon in order to distinguish between Anah the son of Zibeon and Anah the brother of Zibeon.<sup><xref rid="fn1998">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that our chapter speaks of a Korah the son of Adah<sup><xref rid="fn1999">8</xref></sup> and Korah the son of Oholibamah.<sup><xref rid="fn2000">9</xref></sup> However, I believe that both are one and the same person. Korah was the son of Oholibamah. The reason he is listed among the chiefs of Eliphaz<sup><xref rid="fn2001">10</xref></sup> is that he lived among them. It is also possible, since he was Oholibamah&#x2019;s youngest son, that his mother died when he was still a child and that Adah raised him along with her own family and Scripture includes him with her children. Our case is similar to <italic>the five sons of Michal</italic> (II Sam. 21:8).<sup><xref rid="fn2002">11</xref></sup> Korah thus became Adah&#x2019;s son. Scripture similarly says that Amalek was a son of Adah<sup><xref rid="fn2003">12</xref></sup> because he was the son of the handmaid of her husband.<sup><xref rid="fn2004">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>[CHIEF.] The meaning of <italic>alluf</italic> is a prince or chief. However, this is not the meaning of <italic>alluf</italic> (docile)<sup><xref rid="fn2005">14</xref></sup> in <italic>ke-kheves alluf</italic> (like a docile lamb) (Jer. 11:19). In the latter verse the <italic>caf</italic> prefixed to <italic>keves</italic> (lamb) also pertains to <italic>alluf</italic>; i.e., the verse is to be read as if written <italic>ke-kheves ke-alluf</italic> (like a lamb, like an ox). The latter is normal Hebrew usage,<sup><xref rid="fn2006">15</xref></sup> as can be seen in <italic>I went about as though it had been my friend</italic> (ke-re&#x2019;a) <italic>or my brother</italic> (ke-ach) (Ps. 35:14).</p>
<p>20. SEIR. We do not know his pedigree. Scripture lists the children of Seir to inform us that they were of a different lineage from the children of Esau. The Bible notes this because Israel was prohibited from contending with the children of Esau.<sup><xref rid="fn2007">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE HORITE. <italic>Chori</italic> (Horite) means nobles. It is similar to <italic>chore</italic> (nobles) in <italic>the nobles</italic> (chore) <italic>of Judah</italic> (Jer. 27:20).<sup><xref rid="fn2008">17</xref></sup> It is possible that <italic>chori</italic> (Horites) comes from the same root as <italic>chorai</italic> in <italic>And they that weave cotton</italic> (chorai) (Is. 19:9), in which <italic>chorai</italic> means white stuff. Onkelos similarly renders white by <italic>chivvar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2009">18</xref></sup> Nobles are called <italic>chorim</italic> (the white ones) because they are metaphorically speaking, like the color white,<sup><xref rid="fn2010">19</xref></sup> a color which resembles light.<sup><xref rid="fn2011">20</xref></sup> In contrast to <italic>chorim</italic>, mean men are called <italic>chashukkim</italic> (dark ones), as we read in <italic>He shall not stand before mean men</italic> (chashukkim) (Prov. 22:29).<sup><xref rid="fn2012">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AIAH AND ANAH. The <italic>vav</italic> prefixed to Aiah has the same meaning as the Arabic <italic>fa</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2013">22</xref></sup> We have a similar clause without a <italic>vav</italic> prefixed to Aiah<sup><xref rid="fn2014">23</xref></sup> in Chronicles (I Chron. 1:40).</p>
<p>THE HOT SPRINGS. Onkelos renders <italic>yemim</italic> (hot springs) mighty men as in <italic>The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many, and tall</italic> (Deut. 2:10).<sup><xref rid="fn2015">24</xref></sup> It is possible to compare the two because we find the <italic>yod</italic> and <italic>alef</italic> interchanging<sup><xref rid="fn2016">25</xref></sup> as with the word <italic>yityammeru</italic> (bear themselves loftily) (Ps. 94:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2017">26</xref></sup> However, Saadiah Gaon translates <italic>yemim</italic> as mules. He interprets <italic>who found</italic> to mean who crossbred.<sup><xref rid="fn2018">27</xref></sup> It is also possible that <italic>who found</italic> means who first discovered the technique of crossbreeding, since two different species cannot produce offspring.<sup><xref rid="fn2019">28</xref></sup> The latter interpretation is substantiated by Scripture&#x2019;s stating, <italic>as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2020">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the meaning of <italic>yemim</italic> is plants, as is maintained by many commentators, why should Scripture mention <italic>as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn2021">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND THESE ARE THE CHILDREN OF ANAH: DISHON AND OHOLIBAMAH THE DAUGHTER OF ANAH. Anah the father of Oholibamah is not the same Anah mentioned in the first part of our verse,<sup><xref rid="fn2022">31</xref></sup> because if he is, there would be no need to mention him again. He is rather to be identified with the Anah mentioned in the preceding verse.<sup><xref rid="fn2023">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. AND THESE ARE THE KINGS. Some say that this chapter records a prophecy.<sup><xref rid="fn2024">33</xref></sup> However, Yitzchaki<sup><xref rid="fn2025">34</xref></sup> claims in his book that this chapter was composed during the reign of King Jehoshaphat.<sup><xref rid="fn2026">35</xref></sup> He explained the generations as he saw fit. Was he not rightly named Yitzchak?<sup><xref rid="fn2027">36</xref></sup> Everyone that heareth his interpretation will laugh at him.<sup><xref rid="fn2028">37</xref></sup> For he identified Hadar (v. 39) with Hadad the Edomite (I Kings 11:14)<sup><xref rid="fn2029">38</xref></sup> and also said that Mehetabel (v. 39) is to be identified with the sister of Tahpenes the queen of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2030">39</xref></sup> Far be it for one to believe that our chapter was written in the days of Jehoshaphat as Yitzchaki maintains. Indeed his book is fit to be burned. Why did Yitzchaki maintain that it is impossible for eight Edomite kings to have reigned before Moses<sup><xref rid="fn2031">40</xref></sup> when we find double the number of kings in Israel in about the same number of years?<sup><xref rid="fn2032">41</xref></sup> Furthermore, there were also proportionally many more kings of Judah in the same time period than the eight Edomite kings who reigned till the age of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2033">42</xref></sup> The truth is that king, in <italic>before there reigned any king over the children of Israel</italic>, refers to Moses who was king over Israel, and so it is written, <italic>And there was a king in Jeshurun</italic> (Deut. 33:5).</p>
<p>32. AND BELA THE SON OF BEOR. Bela is not to be identified with Balaam the son of Beor,<sup><xref rid="fn2034">43</xref></sup> and neither is Baalam the son of Laban the Aramean.<sup><xref rid="fn2035">44</xref></sup> The Midrash which states that Baalam is the son of Laban is probably based on the fact that both were sorcerers<sup><xref rid="fn2036">45</xref></sup> because &#x201C;none of the words of our sages of blessed memory ever fall to the ground.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2037">46</xref></sup> We cannot identify Baalam with Bela because Bela was an Edomite and Baalam an Aramean.<sup><xref rid="fn2038">47</xref></sup> We are also not to identify Jobab the son of Zerah (v. 33) with Job, as Yitzchaki<sup><xref rid="fn2039">48</xref></sup> the windbag does.</p>
<p>39. MEHETABEL THE DAUGHTER OF MATRED, THE DAUGHTER OF ME-ZAHAB. This is to be explained<sup><xref rid="fn2040">49</xref></sup> in the same manner as we interpret <italic>Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon</italic> (v. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn2041">50</xref></sup> On the other hand Scripture may be listing Mehetabel&#x2019;s mother and father.<sup><xref rid="fn2042">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>ME-ZAHAB. This was his name.<sup><xref rid="fn2043">52</xref></sup> However, Saadiah Gaon says that Me-Zahab means a goldsmith.<sup><xref rid="fn2044">53</xref></sup> Others say Me-zahab alludes to those who make gold out of copper.<sup><xref rid="fn2045">54</xref></sup> However, the latter is sheer nonsense.<sup><xref rid="fn2046">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. [AND THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE CHIEFS THAT CAME OF ESAU&#x2026;AFTER THEIR PLACES] This means that their territories are well-known today (in the days of Moses). These are the words of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2047">56</xref></sup> Those now mentioned are the offspring of the chiefs mentioned above.<sup><xref rid="fn2048">57</xref></sup> Only those that had their own territories are mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn2049">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>TIMNA. Here it refers to a male.<sup><xref rid="fn2050">59</xref></sup> For we have many names which are used both for male and females. The same holds true for Oholibamah.<sup><xref rid="fn2051">60</xref></sup> It is also possible that the word chief is superfluous,<sup><xref rid="fn2052">61</xref></sup> the interpretation of <italic>the chief of Timna, the chief of Alvah, the chief Jetheth</italic> being, the following are the chiefs of Timna, Eliphaz&#x2019;s concubine, Alvah and Jetheth. Alvah and Jetheth were chiefs of Amelek.<sup><xref rid="fn2053">62</xref></sup> There were seven chiefs of Oholibamah in the day of Moses. Each of these chiefs had his own territory. Hence Moses was explicit and added, <italic>according to their habitations</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2054">63</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1992"><sup>1</sup> The Hebrew literally reads, <italic>he is Edom</italic>, which I.E., based on verse 9, interprets as, he is the father of Edom (Krinsky). Filwarg interprets it as, both Esau and his descendants are called Edom. Our verse teaches that Esau is Edom and verse 9 (which reads, <italic>Esau the father of the Edomites</italic>) that Esau&#x2019;s descendants are called Edom.</ftnote>

Hence the introduction to this list, viz., <italic>These are the names of Esau&#x2019;s sons</italic>, must refer to his grandchildren. Krinsky suggests that there is a scribal error and that the reference is to <italic>And these are the generations of Esau</italic> in verse 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1997"><sup>6</sup> Hence the Bible lists two men, Anah and Zibeon, as being Oholibamah&#x2019;s father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1998"><sup>7</sup> Had Scripture merely said, &#x201C;Oholibamah daughter of Anah&#x201D; we would not know which Anah the Bible is talking about. Cherez explains that Scripture could state that Oholibamah was Zibeon&#x2019;s daughter, when in fact she was his granddaughter because grandchildren are considered children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1999"><sup>8</sup> Verses 15 and 16 list the chiefs of the sons of Esau from his wife Adah, among them <italic>the chief of Korah</italic>. Thus Korah must be Adah&#x2019;s son.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2000"><sup>9</sup> In verse 14 it is related that Oholibamah bore Korah. Thus our chapter speaks of two Korahs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2001"><sup>10</sup> Adah&#x2019;s son. See note 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2002"><sup>11</sup> The five sons of Michal were really the children of Merab. Cf. <italic>San</italic>. 19b., &#x201C;Michal bore these five children? Did not Merab give birth to them?&#x201D; The Talmud answers, &#x201C;Merab bore them but Michal raised them. Hence they are called her children.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2003"><sup>12</sup> Verse 16 lists the chief of Amalek among the children of Adah. However, verse 12 states, <italic>And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau&#x2019;s son and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek</italic>. Thus Amalek was the son of Timna, not the son of Adah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2004"><sup>13</sup> This comment presents a problem. Verse 12 state that Timna was Eliphaz&#x2019;s concubine, not Esau&#x2019;s concubine. Cherez posits a scribal error; i.e., in place of <italic>her husband</italic>, read her son. Weiser suggests that I.E. had a tradition that Timna was first Esau&#x2019;s concubine and then Eliphaz&#x2019;s concubine, hence I.E.&#x2019;s statement, &#x201C;concubine of her husband.&#x201D; The Bible lists Amalek among Adah&#x2019;s children because Adah helped raise him (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2005"><sup>14</sup> I.E. translates <italic>alluf</italic> as ox. <italic>Ke-kheves alluf</italic> does not mean like a great sheep, but rather like a lamb or like an ox.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2006"><sup>15</sup> It is normal Hebrew usage to place two <italic>cafs</italic> in succession, meaning like this or like that.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2007"><sup>16</sup> Cf. Deut. 2:4-5. This prohibition did not apply to the Seirites. Both nations inhabited the same country. However, the children of Esau displaced them (Deut. 2:22).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2008"><sup>17</sup> According to I.E. <italic>These are the sons of Seir the Horite</italic> (ha-chori) should be translated: These are the sons of Seir the noble (the chief).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2009"><sup>18</sup> So Cherez. Weiser renders I.E. as follows: the Targum (Jonathan) similarly translates <italic>chore</italic> to mean nobles.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2010"><sup>19</sup> It is the most beautiful color.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2011"><sup>20</sup> A symbol of good and purity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2012"><sup>21</sup> In Prov. 22:29 <italic>chashukkim</italic> is the antithesis of <italic>kings. Chashukkim</italic> comes from the word <italic>choshekh</italic> (black or dark). We thus see that white is a symbol of <italic>nobility</italic>, and black of poverty (Cherez) or of non-nobility, of meanness (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2013"><sup>22</sup> The Hebrew has a <italic>vav</italic> before Aiah. If this <italic>vav</italic> is a connective <italic>vav</italic> we should translate: And these are the children of Zibeon and Aiah and Anah. I.E. points out that the <italic>vav</italic> before Aiah is not to be translated. It is superfluous and is placed for emphasis (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2014"><sup>23</sup> I Chron. 1:40 reads, <italic>And the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2015"><sup>24</sup> The Emim were mighty men. Onkelos identifies the <italic>Yemin</italic> with them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2016"><sup>25</sup> Hence <italic>yemim</italic> equals <italic>emim</italic>. Nachmanides explains that Onkelos held that Anah was attacked by Emem, who wanted to rob his father&#x2019;s asses, and overcame them. Thus he found the Emim in <italic>the wilderness as he fed the asses of Zibeon, his father</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2017"><sup>26</sup> There is no such word in Scripture. However, we do find <italic>tityammaru</italic> (shall ye revel) (Is. 61:6). Either we have a scribal error (Krinsky) and what I.E. is saying is that <italic>tityammaru</italic> could have been written <italic>titammeru</italic> since Ps. 94:4 employs the term <italic>yitammeru</italic> (bear themselves loftily), or I.E. is saying that Ps. 94:4 could have read <italic>yityammeru</italic> since Is. 61:6 reads <italic>tityammaru</italic> (Weiser). Spelled with a <italic>yod</italic> or an <italic>alef</italic> it means to exalt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2018"><sup>27</sup> He crossbred a horse and an ass and &#x201C;found&#x201D; mules. This is also the opinion of the Talmud. Cf. Jerusalem Talmud, <italic>Berakhot</italic> 8:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2019"><sup>28</sup> Hence crossbreeding was a new discovery.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2020"><sup>29</sup> Since he was occupied with taking care of the asses, he experimented and discovered this technique.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2021"><sup>30</sup> If the Bible wants to tell us that Anah found a certain type of plant (<italic>yemim</italic>) in the desert, what need is there to tell us that he did this <italic>as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father</italic>?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2022"><sup>31</sup> If they are one and the same person Scripture should have read: And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2023"><sup>32</sup> Anah the son of Zibeon mentioned in verse 24. The Anah mentioned in the first part of our verse is Anah the brother of Zibeon mentioned in verse 20. Thus Oholibamah was Zibeon&#x2019;s granddaughter (Krinsky). Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comments on verse 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2024"><sup>33</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>before there reigned any king over the children of Israel</italic>. Saul was Israel&#x2019;s first king. Thus our chapter appears to deal with the post Mosaic period. These commentaries explain that Moses wrote our chapter as prophecy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2025"><sup>34</sup> Some identify him with Isaac ben Solomon Israeli (c. 850-950). He was a philosopher, Biblical commentator and court physician to the caliphs in Egypt and Kairouan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2026"><sup>35</sup> A ninth-century king of Judah. Jehoshaphat was the eighth Hebrew king to reign starting from Saul. In his days the Edomites no longer had kings for they were subject to Judah. This is the reason that once the eighth Hebrew king ascended the throne it was written that the Edomites, too, had eight kings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2027"><sup>36</sup> A play on Gen. 27:36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2028"><sup>37</sup> A play on Gen. 21:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2029"><sup>38</sup> A contemporary of King Solomon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2030"><sup>39</sup> Pharaoh gave his wife Tahpenes&#x2019; sister to Hadad in marriage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2031"><sup>40</sup> Yitchaki claimed that there were too few years between the establishment of the Edomite kingdom and Moses for eight Edomite kings to reign, for from Esau&#x2019;s death, when the Edomite kingdom was established, until the Revelation at Sinai, when Moses reigned, only 193 years passed. The computation of the 193 years is as follows: The Israelites spent 210 years in Egypt, starting with Jacob&#x2019;s descent to Egypt. Jacob lived there 17 years before he died. Esau died on the very day that Jacob did (<italic>Sotah</italic> 13a). We thus subtract 17 from 210 and we get 193 (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2032"><sup>41</sup> The kingdom of Israel lasted for 241 years during which time Israel had 19 kings (Krinsky). I.E. says that Israel had double the number of kings of the Edomites. Either he uses a round number or does not count Zimri (I Kings 16:15) who reigned seven days; Zechariah (II Kings 15:8) who reigned six months; and Shallum who reigned a month (<italic>Ibid</italic>., v. 13). Thus Israel had 16 kings in 241 years. Why, then, is it so hard to believe that eight Edomite kings reigned in 193 years (Krinsky)? Cherez explains that the first 16 kings of Israel reigned 210 years. Thus Israel had 16 kings in 210 years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2033"><sup>42</sup> Judah had 21 kings in 500 years (Krinsky). Hence why couldn&#x2019;t the Edomites have eight kings in 193 years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2034"><sup>43</sup> Cf. Num. 22:5. Adding a <italic>mem</italic> to Bela spells Baalam. Because of this and their father having the same name, some consider them to be the same. Cf. <italic>Targum Jonathan</italic> on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2035"><sup>44</sup> The rabbis identify Beor with Laban. Cf. <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 105a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2036"><sup>45</sup> So Cherez. The point is that since Baalam was a sorcerer and Laban was one, too, Balaam was a &#x201C;son&#x201D; (spiritual not actual) of Laban. For an alternate interpretation see Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2037"><sup>46</sup> A paraphrase of I Sam. 3:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2038"><sup>47</sup> According to Cherez.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2039"><sup>48</sup> This is the same Yitzchaki mentioned in I.E.&#x2019;s comments on verse 31 (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2040"><sup>49</sup> Scripture lists her as having two fathers, Metrad and Me-zahab.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2041"><sup>50</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on verse 2. Metrad was her father and Me-zahab her grandfather (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2042"><sup>51</sup> I.E. does not identify which one was the father and which one the mother (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2043"><sup>52</sup> That is, Me-zahab is a proper name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2044"><sup>53</sup> Our verse should thus be rendered: Mehetabel the daughter of Matred, the daughter of a goldsmith. Cf. Onkelos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2045"><sup>54</sup> That is, Me-zahab means an alchemist.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2046"><sup>55</sup> The interpretation is nonsense (Cherez) or the belief in alchemy is nonsense (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2047"><sup>56</sup> That is, verses 40-43. Until now Moses reported what had been Divinely revealed to him concerning Edom&#x2019;s past. In verses 40-43 he turns to his own generation and in <italic>his own words</italic> adds that the 11 chiefs of Edom (enumerated in verses 40-43) are now ruling each in his own territory.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2048"><sup>57</sup> Verses 15-18 (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2049"><sup>58</sup> In verses 15-18, 14 chiefs are mentioned. In verses 40-43, 11 chiefs are mentioned. The names in verses 40-43 are not the same as those in 15-18. Hence I.E. points out that they were their sons. To explain why only 11 are mentioned in 40-43, I.E. posits that only those with a territory of their own are mentioned. After the death of the 14 mentioned in 15-18 their sons, mentioned in 40-43, became chiefs. Another possibility is that after the 14 mentioned above died, eight kings reigned and then the 11 mentioned in 40-43 became chiefs (Cherez). If the latter is correct, then when I.E. says that those in 40-43 are the offspring of those in 15-18 he means their descendants.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2050"><sup>59</sup> Timna was the name of Eliphaz&#x2019;s concubine (v. 12); hence it is a female name. However, <italic>the chief of Timna</italic> was a male. Hence Timna can be either a male or female name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2051"><sup>60</sup> Oholibamah was the name of one of Esau&#x2019;s wives (v. 2). Hence it is a female name. However, <italic>the chief of Oholibamah</italic> was a male.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2052"><sup>61</sup> That is, Timna is a female name and refers to Timna, Eliphaz&#x2019;s concubine. The superfluous <italic>chief</italic> refers to the word <italic>chief</italic> prefixed to Alvah and Jetheth. The verse should thus be read: the chief of Timna, Alvah and Jetheth. The same applies to Oholibamah (Krinsky) or the word <italic>chief</italic> prefixed to Timna is superfluous. The verse should be read: Timna, the chief of Alva, the chief of Jetheth. The same applies to Oholibamah (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2053"><sup>62</sup> Timna <italic>bore to Eliphaz Amalek</italic> (v. 12). Hence the chiefs of Timna, Alvah and Jetheth were chiefs of Amalek.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2054"><sup>63</sup> Each of these chiefs had territories which bore their names and this was noted by Moses.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 37</title>
<h1>VA-YESHEV</h1>
<p>1. AND JACOB DWELT. The Bible tells us<sup><xref rid="fn2055">1</xref></sup> that the chiefs of Esau dwelt on the mountain of Seir but that Jacob dwelt in the chosen land.<sup><xref rid="fn2056">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>[2.] The meaning of <italic>These are the generations of Jacob</italic> is: these are the events which befell him and the incidents which came upon him. <italic>Toledot</italic> (generations) comes from the same root as <italic>yeled</italic> (bring forth) in <italic>What a day may bring forth</italic> (yeled) (Prov. 27:1).<sup><xref rid="fn2057">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>BEING STILL A LAD, EVEN WITH THE SONS OF BILHAH, AND WITH THE SONS OF ZILPAH. The sons of the concubines (the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah) made Joseph their attendant (servant) since he was their younger brother. This was the <italic>evil report of them</italic> which he brought unto their father. Had the children of Leah, the mistress of the house, made Joseph their attendant, then no wrong would have been done.<sup><xref rid="fn2058">4</xref></sup> The view that <italic>evil report</italic> pertains to limbs torn from living animals is a Midrashic interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn2059">5</xref></sup> That Joseph did not bring an evil report to Jacob concerning Leah&#x2019;s children is clear from the fact that Scripture only mentions the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah in our verse.<sup><xref rid="fn2060">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. BECAUSE HE WAS THE SON OF HIS OLD AGE. This is to be taken literally since Joseph was born to Jacob when the latter was ninety-one years old.<sup><xref rid="fn2061">7</xref></sup> Also, Benjamin, his brother, is referred to by Scripture as <italic>a child of his</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2062">8</xref></sup> <italic>old age</italic> (Gen. 44:20). After Joseph and Benjamin no other children were born to Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn2063">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A COAT OF MANY COLORS. <italic>Ketonet passim</italic> means an embroidered coat.<sup><xref rid="fn2064">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>[MANY COLORS.] The word <italic>passim</italic> (many colors) is similar to the Aramaic word <italic>pas</italic> (part) in <italic>part of</italic> (pas) <italic>a hand</italic> (Dan. 5:5).</p>
<p>4. SPEAK UNTO HIM. <italic>Dabbero</italic> is to be rendered speak unto him.<sup><xref rid="fn2065">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>[PEACEABLY.] Even peaceably.<sup><xref rid="fn2066">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. BINDING. <italic>Me&#x2019;allemim</italic> (binding) comes from the same root as <italic>alummim</italic> (sheaves). The noun sheave is also found in the feminine,<sup><xref rid="fn2067">13</xref></sup> compare, <italic>bearing his sheaves</italic> (alummotav) (Ps. 126:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2068">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>CAME ROUND ABOUT. <italic>Tesubbenah</italic> (came round about) comes from a root whose second and third letters are identical.<sup><xref rid="fn2069">15</xref></sup> The <italic>bet</italic> receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> to compensate for a missing <italic>bet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2070">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. SHALT THOU INDEED REIGN OVER US? OR SHALT THOU INDEED HAVE DOMINION OVER US? Shall we set thee up as a king over us?<sup><xref rid="fn2071">17</xref></sup> Or shalt thou rule over us by force.<sup><xref rid="fn2072">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>[10.] AND HIS FATHER REBUKED HIM. When the word <italic>ga&#x2019;ar</italic> (rebuked) is followed by a <italic>bet</italic> it means to rebuke.<sup><xref rid="fn2073">19</xref></sup> When it is not followed by a <italic>bet</italic> it means to destroy. Compare, <italic>Behold, I will destroy</italic> (go&#x2019;er) <italic>the seed for your hurt</italic> (Mal. 2:3). On the other hand, it is possible that the word <italic>go&#x2019;er</italic> is used metaphorically in the aforementioned verse, its meaning being God will rebuke the seed and it will become frightened and not arise out of the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn2074">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>I AND THY MOTHER. Thy mother refers to Bilhah his mother&#x2019;s handmaiden who raised him.<sup><xref rid="fn2075">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. KEPT THE SAYING. In his mind. This is also the correct meaning of <italic>kept</italic> in <italic>They kept His testimonies</italic> (Ps. 99:7).<sup><xref rid="fn2076">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. HERE AM I. I will do as you say.<sup><xref rid="fn2077">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND A CERTAIN MAN FOUND HIM. According to the plain meaning of the text a passer by found him.<sup><xref rid="fn2078">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. WHERE THEY ARE FEEDING THE FLOCK. If you know.<sup><xref rid="fn2079">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. TO DOTHAN. Dothan is spelled both with and without a <italic>yod</italic> in our verse. In either case it refers to one and the same place.</p>
<p>18. THEY CONSPIRED. <italic>Va-yitnakkelu</italic> (they conspired) means they had evil designs. <italic>Nokhel</italic> (dealeth craftily) in <italic>But cursed be he that dealeth craftily</italic> (nokhel) (Mal. 1:14) is similar.</p>
<p>21. LET US NOT TAKE HIS LIFE. Our verse is similar to<sup><xref rid="fn2080">26</xref></sup> <italic>but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man</italic> (Ex. 33:11), the meaning of which is: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, did the ministry<sup><xref rid="fn2081">27</xref></sup> of a young man. The aforementioned verse must be so understood because Joshua was not at that time a young man.<sup><xref rid="fn2082">28</xref></sup> Similarly our verse should be read as if written: let us not strike him a mortal blow thus taking his life.</p>
<p>23. THAT THEY STRIPPED. <italic>Va-yafshitu</italic> (that they stripped)<sup><xref rid="fn2083">29</xref></sup> is a causative. They told him to take the coat off by himself.<sup><xref rid="fn2084">30</xref></sup> <italic>Ketonet</italic> (coat) in Hebrew refers to a garment worn next to the skin. The brothers thus stripped Joseph of his garments and threw him naked into the pit.<sup><xref rid="fn2085">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND THEY SAT DOWN TO EAT BREAD. The nine brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn2086">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>A CARAVAN OF ISHMAELITES. <italic>Orechat</italic> is to be rendered caravan as Onkelos does. A caravan is so called because it travels on the roads (<italic>orechot</italic>).</p>
<p>SPICERY. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen the Spaniard<sup><xref rid="fn2087">33</xref></sup> explains <italic>nekhot</italic> (spicery) to mean a precious thing. <italic>Bet nekhoto</italic> (his treasure house) in <italic>and showed them all his treasure-house</italic> (bet nekhoto) (II Kings 20:13) is similar. <italic>Nekhot</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2088">34</xref></sup> and <italic>nekhoto</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2089">35</xref></sup> are similar because the <italic>vav</italic> and the <italic>alef</italic> are interchangeable since they are quiescent letters.<sup><xref rid="fn2090">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BALM. The word for balm is encountered in Scripture vocalized with a quiescent <italic>sheva</italic> beneath the <italic>tzadi</italic> (<italic>utzri</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2091">37</xref></sup> We also find it vocalized with a <italic>chataf kamatz</italic> beneath the <italic>tzadi</italic>, viz., <italic>Is there no balm</italic> (ha-tzori) <italic>in Gilead</italic>? (Jer. 8:22). It also appears with the <italic>tzadi</italic> vocalized with a <italic>cholem</italic>, viz., <italic>and honey, and oil, and balm</italic> (ve-tzori) (Ezek. 27:17). Saadiah Gaon explained that <italic>tzeri</italic> (balm)<sup><xref rid="fn2092">38</xref></sup> is a mixture of 75 roots. Others say that <italic>tzeri</italic> is a type of fruit. Still others say that it is either a fruit or the oil of a tree<sup><xref rid="fn2093">39</xref></sup> that, according to Joseph ben Gurion,<sup><xref rid="fn2094">40</xref></sup> was brought from Jericho to Egypt. However, Rabbi Ishmael<sup><xref rid="fn2095">41</xref></sup> says that it means resin. We will rely on the latter opinion.</p>
<p>AND LADANUM. Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>lot</italic> (ladanum) is the same fruit that in Arabic is similarly called with the addition of a <italic>bet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2096">42</xref></sup> Perhaps it is so.</p>
<p>26. WHAT PROFIT. <italic>Mah betza</italic> means what profit. <italic>Betza</italic> (profit) is close in meaning to <italic>chefetz</italic> (desire). <italic>What profit</italic> (betza) <italic>is there in my blood</italic> (Ps. 30:10) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2097">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. HE IS OUR BROTHER OUR FLESH. He is as our flesh<sup><xref rid="fn2098">44</xref></sup> since we all came from one flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn2099">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AND THERE PASSED BY. When the Ishmaelite merchantmen passed by them.<sup><xref rid="fn2100">46</xref></sup> Scripture refers to the Ishmaelites as Midianites because the Midianites are called Ishmaelites. The Book of Judges similarly says concerning the kings of Midian, <italic>because they were Ishmaelites</italic> (Jud. 8:24).</p>
<p>30. AND AS FOR ME, WHITHER SHALL I GO? <italic>Ani</italic> (I) is used twice in this clause<sup><xref rid="fn2101">47</xref></sup> even though one <italic>ani</italic> would have sufficed.<sup><xref rid="fn2102">48</xref></sup> The latter is in keeping with Hebrew style.</p>
<p>33. WITHOUT DOUBT TORN IN PIECES. <italic>Toraf</italic> (torn) is a <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic>. The <italic>tet</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>cholam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2103">49</xref></sup> because it precedes a <italic>resh</italic> which cannot receive a <italic>dagesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2104">50</xref></sup> <italic>Morak</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2105">51</xref></sup> (scoured) in <italic>it shall be scoured</italic> (u-morek), <italic>and rinsed in water</italic> (Lev. 6:21) is similar.</p>
<p>35. AND HIS FATHER WEPT FOR HIM. Our sages interpreted this as referring to Isaac.<sup><xref rid="fn2106">52</xref></sup> The truth is that Isaac did not die until Joseph reached the age of twenty-nine.<sup><xref rid="fn2107">53</xref></sup> Some say that the prophetic spirit was removed from both Jacob and Isaac because of their mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn2108">54</xref></sup> They offer proof from Elisha.<sup><xref rid="fn2109">55</xref></sup></p>

Similarly Job states, <italic>The nether-world</italic> (she&#x2019;ol) <italic>is naked before Him</italic> (Job 26:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2115">61</xref></sup> There are many other verses which prove that <italic>she&#x2019;ol</italic> does not refer to hell.</p>

<ftnote id="fn2055"><sup>1</sup> In the previous chapter, verse 8.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2059"><sup>5</sup> According to the Midrash Joseph told his father that his brothers ate limbs torn from living animals. Cf. <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 84:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2060"><sup>6</sup> Our verse mentions only the sons of Zilpah and the sons of Bilhah. Hence the pronominal suffix of <italic>dibbtam</italic> (report of them) must refer to Zilpah and Bilhah&#x2019;s sons. This comment is either a proof of what I.E. wrote above, viz., that Joseph spoke only about the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah (Krinsky), or its purpose is to negate a Midrashic statement to the effect that Joseph spoke ill only of Leah&#x2019;s children, viz., that he told Jacob that Leah&#x2019;s children refer to the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah as the children of slave girls (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2061"><sup>7</sup> Joseph was 30 when Pharaoh appointed him vizier over Egypt. Jacob came to Egypt nine years later, after the seven years of plenty and two of famine (Gen. 45:11). At that time Jacob was 130 years old (<italic>Ibid</italic>., 47:9) and Joseph 39. Thus Jacob was 91 years older than Joseph (Cherez). I.E. notes that <italic>ben zekunim</italic> is to be taken literally, viz., son of old age, because the Midrash and Onkelos interpret it to mean a wise son. Cf. <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 84:8 and Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2062"><sup>8</sup> That is, Jacob&#x2019;s.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2064"><sup>10</sup> <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads: a coat made of embroidered parts. Some texts omit <italic>embroidered coat</italic>.

For an alternate interpretation see Cherez.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2065"><sup>11</sup> <italic>Dabbero</italic> is the verb <italic>dabber</italic> (speak) plus the pronoun <italic>oto</italic> (him). However, they cannot be combined since one cannot say speak him. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that <italic>dabbero</italic> should be interpreted <italic>dabber lo</italic> (speak to him) (Filwarg). Cherez suggests that what I.E. means is that <italic>dabbero</italic> is not a combination of <italic>dabber oto</italic> but <italic>dabber immo</italic> (speak with him).

<ftnote id="fn2073"><sup>19</sup> Our verse reads <italic>va-yigar bo aviv</italic> (and his father rebuked him). In our verse <italic>ga&#x2019;ar</italic> thus precedes a <italic>bet</italic> and henceforth is to be translated as rebuked.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2074"><sup>20</sup> In other words the term <italic>ga&#x2019;ar</italic> always means to rebuke.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2077"><sup>23</sup> If Jacob called Joseph then the proper response would be here am I, as in <italic>Here am I, for thou didst call me</italic> (I Sam. 3:6). However, in our verse it comes as a response to Jacob&#x2019;s command. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s point that in our verse it has the meaning of: I am at your service (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2078"><sup>24</sup> According to the Midrash it was an angel. Some Midrashim identify the angel as Gabriel. Cf. <italic>Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer</italic>, Chap. 38; <italic>Targum Jonathan</italic>, and Rashi.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2080"><sup>26</sup> Our verse literally reads: <italic>lo nakkennu nefesh</italic> (let us not take his life) which literally means, let us not strike him life. I.E. holds that this is short for, let us not strike him (<italic>lo nakkennu</italic>) a mortal blow (<italic>makkat nefesh</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2081"><sup>27</sup> This has to be added to the text.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2083"><sup>29</sup> <italic>Va-yafshitu</italic> is a <italic>hifil. Hifil</italic> is the causative form. Hence I.E. renders it: and they caused him to strip (Krinsky, Weiser and Cherez). For an alternate interpretation see Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2084"><sup>30</sup> Hence they caused him to strip.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2085"><sup>31</sup> According to Cherez, I.E. interprets the verse as follows: that they stripped Joseph of his coat (<italic>ketonet</italic>), i.e., of the garment worn next to the skin, and also of the coat of many colors. Joseph was thus left standing naked (Cherez). Cf. Rashi. However, Cherez&#x2019;s interpretation seems forced. It appears that I.E. identified the <italic>ketonet passim</italic> with the garment worn next to the skin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2086"><sup>32</sup> Neither Reuben nor Benjamin was there.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2089"><sup>35</sup> Spelled <italic>nun, caf, vav, tav</italic>. The problem is that the word is not so spelled in II Kings 20:13. Krinsky and Cherez suggest that since the word is pronounced <italic>nekhoto</italic>, it is as if a <italic>vav</italic> is placed after the <italic>caf</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2090"><sup>36</sup> The <italic>alef</italic> and <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>nekhot</italic> are not pronounced. Hence they are quiescent. I.E. refers to the <italic>alef, vav, heh, yod</italic> as quiescent letters (<italic>otiyot ha-nach</italic>) because they are not always enunciated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2091"><sup>37</sup> It is so found in our verse but not so found elsewhere in Scripture. I.E.&#x2019;s basic point is that balm is spelled with a <italic>sheva</italic> in our verse, <italic>tzeri</italic>. However, there is an important grammatical aside in this note. I.E. calls our <italic>sheva</italic> a quiescent <italic>sheva</italic>, a <italic>sheva nach</italic>. However, according to standard grammatical usage a <italic>sheva</italic> following a long vowel is vocal. Thus our <italic>sheva</italic> should be a vocal <italic>sheva</italic>, a <italic>sheva na</italic>, and not a quiescent one. Therefore our word should be read <italic>u-tzeri</italic> and not <italic>utzri</italic>. William Chomsky points out that the vocal pronunciation of the <italic>sheva</italic> following a long vowel was introduced by the Kimchis and that the pre-Kimchi grammarians had no such concept. I.E.&#x2019;s note seems to bear this out. Cf. W. Chomsky, &#x201C;The pronunciation of the Sheva,&#x201D; <italic>The Jewish Quarterly Review</italic>, Vol. LXII, October, 1971.

<ftnote id="fn2098"><sup>44</sup> They obviously were not all one flesh. Hence what Judah meant was: he is as our flesh, even though he did not use the word as (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2099"><sup>45</sup> We all come from the same parents who became one flesh, as in I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 2:22 (Weiser). However, they did not all have the same mother. Therefore the interpretation must be as follows: we all came from the same father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2100"><sup>46</sup> The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>va-ya&#x2019;avru</italic> (and there passed by) is to be rendered when rather than and. The meaning of the verse is: when the Midianite (Ishmaelite) merchantmen passed by, they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit (Krinsky). I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the Midianites in our verse refers to the caravan of Ishmaelites of verse 25. Thus <italic>va-ya&#x2019;avru</italic> does not introduce new material. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase: when, etc. (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2101"><sup>47</sup> The Hebrew literally reads: And I, whither shall I go.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2102"><sup>48</sup> Scripture could have read: and whither shall I go.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2103"><sup>49</sup> Rather than a <italic>kubbutz</italic> as is the rule in the <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic>. Hence the reading <italic>toraf</italic> rather than <italic>turaf</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2104"><sup>50</sup> All middle root letters in the <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic> receive a <italic>dagesh</italic>. However, the <italic>resh</italic> cannot receive a <italic>dagesh</italic>; thus the preceding vowel changes from a <italic>kubbutz</italic> to a <italic>cholam</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2105"><sup>51</sup> It, too, is a <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic>, and because the middle letter is a <italic>resh</italic> the preceding letter is vocalized with a <italic>cholam</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2106"><sup>52</sup> <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 84:19. According to the Midrash <italic>his father</italic> refers to Jacob&#x2019;s father. Isaac was overcome with grief over Jacob&#x2019;s trouble.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2107"><sup>53</sup> Thus from this point of view the Midrashic interpretation is possible. I.E.&#x2019;s accounting is as follows: Isaac was 60 when Jacob was born (Gen. 25:26). Jacob was 91 when Joseph was born (see note 7). Thus Isaac was 151 when Joseph was born. Isaac died at the age of 180 (Gen. 35:28), at which time Joseph was 29 years old as Isaac was 151 years older than Joseph. Joseph was 17 when he was sold. Thus Isaac lived 12 years past the year in which Joseph was sold (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2108"><sup>54</sup> The question arises, why didn&#x2019;t Jacob and Isaac, two prophets, know that Joseph was alive?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2109"><sup>55</sup> That a prophet cannot prophesy when in a state of depression. Cf. II Kings 3:15.

<ftnote id="fn2113"><sup>59</sup> In this verse pit is parallel to <italic>she&#x2019;ol. She&#x2019;ol</italic> thus must mean pit.</ftnote>

<p>1. AND IT CAME TO PASS AT THAT TIME. This does not refer to the time that Joseph was sold.<sup><xref rid="fn2119">1</xref></sup> It refers to the events that happened prior to that time. <italic>From thence they journeyed unto Gudgod&#x2026;At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name, unto this day</italic> (Deut. 10:7, 8) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2120">2</xref></sup> The tribe of Levi was chosen to minister unto the Lord in the second year while Israel journeyed to Gudgod in the fortieth year.<sup><xref rid="fn2121">3</xref></sup> I will explain the latter verses in their proper place. Why, then, did Scripture insert this chapter (Chap. 38) at this point when logic dictates that <italic>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt</italic> (Gen. 39:1) should follow <italic>And the Midianites sold him (Joseph) into Egypt</italic> (Gen. 37:36)?<sup><xref rid="fn2122">4</xref></sup> The Bible placed this chapter (38) here to contrast the behavior of Joseph vis-a-vis his master&#x2019;s wife with that of Judah toward his daughter-in-law.<sup><xref rid="fn2123">5</xref></sup> What forced me to offer this interpretation is the fact that only twenty-two years passed between the sale of Joseph and the descent of our ancestors into Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2124">6</xref></sup> Now we learn in this chapter of the birth of Onan, Judah&#x2019;s second son,<sup><xref rid="fn2125">7</xref></sup> and his reaching the age of procreation, which at the very earliest starts at the age of 12. Scripture goes on to state, <italic>And in the process of time</italic> (v. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn2126">8</xref></sup> The chapter then tells us that Tamar conceived and gave birth to Perez.

<p>Our sages said, <italic>that Judah went down</italic> (v. 1) means that Judah was demoted from his leadership.<sup><xref rid="fn2131">13</xref></sup> However, this is a Midrashic interpretation.

<p>AND WRAPPED HERSELF. The meaning of <italic>va-titallaf</italic> (she wrapped herself) is she hid her face. <italic>Va-yitallaf</italic> (Jonah 4:8) is similar.

<p>23. LET HER TAKE IT. Forget about her and let her keep the pledge.</p>
<p>LEST WE BE PUT TO SHAME. Lest I be a laughing stock, for giving a signet, cord and staff for something so insignificant.</p>
<p>[BEHOLD, I SENT THIS KID, AND THOU HAST NOT FOUND HER.] This is a sign that she wants to keep the pledge.<sup><xref rid="fn2152">34</xref></sup></p>

<p>26. FORASMUCH AS I GAVE HER NOT. The expression <italic>ki al ken</italic> (for as much) has the same meaning as the Rabbinic term <italic>ho&#x2019;il</italic> (since), as in <italic>forasmuch</italic> (ki al ken) <italic>as I have seen thy face</italic> (Gen. 33:10). The meaning of our clause is: since I gave her not to Shelah my son. Or its meaning is, she did this because I gave her not to Shelah my son.<sup><xref rid="fn2156">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE KNEW HER AGAIN NO MORE. He did not sleep with her again.</p>
<p>28. THAT ONE PUT OUT A HAND. One of them put out a hand. The latter is not identified by name because he was not yet named. This birth, too,<sup><xref rid="fn2157">39</xref></sup> was out of the ordinary in that both placentas opened simultaneously and when this one drew back his hand, his brother came out.</p>
<p>29. WHEREFORE HAST THOU MADE A BREACH. <italic>Mah paratzta, alekhah paretz</italic> means, wherefore hast thou acted like a man who breaches a fence and goes through it. You are now responsible for the breach.<sup><xref rid="fn2158">40</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>paratzta</italic> is the same as <italic>u-faratzta</italic> (and thou shalt spread abroad) (Gen. 28:14).<sup><xref rid="fn2159">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon explains that <italic>paratzta</italic> is to be interpreted literally as meaning to make a breach but that <italic>paretz</italic> in <italic>alekhah paretz</italic> has the same meaning as <italic>va-yifrotz</italic> (it hath increased) in <italic>and hath increased</italic> (va-yifrotz) <italic>abundantly</italic> (Gen. 30:30).<sup><xref rid="fn2160">42</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2119"><sup>1</sup> As the sequence of chapters would tend to indicate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2120"><sup>2</sup> The two events described in the latter verse did not take place at the same time even though Deut. 10:8 says, <italic>At that time</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2121"><sup>3</sup> Following the Exodus.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2122"><sup>4</sup> That is, Chap. 39 should follow Chap. 37.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2123"><sup>5</sup> Joseph controlled his passions. When Potiphar&#x2019;s wife said to him, <italic>Lie with me</italic> (Gen. 39:7) he refused. On the other hand when Judah saw the harlot in the entrance to Enaim he said to her, <italic>Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee</italic> (Gen. 38:16).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2124"><sup>6</sup> Joseph was 17 when sold. He was 30 when appointed vizier over Egypt. Jacob came to Egypt after seven years of plenty and two of hunger passed. Thus a total of 22 years passed from the sale of Joseph to Jacob&#x2019;s descent into Egypt (Cherez). It is impossible for the events described in Chap. 38 to have occurred in such a short time.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2125"><sup>7</sup> The point is that not only does Scripture tell of the birth of Er, the eldest son of Judah, it also tells of the birth of and marriage of his second son, Onan, as well. Er was at least close to a year older than Onan. Thus at least 13 years had to pass between the sale of Joseph and the marriage of Onan and Tamar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2126"><sup>8</sup> The Hebrew literally reads, <italic>and the days became many</italic>. That is, following Onan&#x2019;s death Tamar, his widow, dwelt in her father&#x2019;s house for a long time.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2127"><sup>9</sup> We thus have to allow at least 13 years for the birth and marriage of Onan. We have to allow for the years that Tamar spent in her father&#x2019;s house. We have to allow 12 years for Perez&#x2019;s coming of age and two each for the birth of his sons. All of this could not have happened in 22 years, even assuming the above minimum figures.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2128"><sup>10</sup> According to the Talmud the early generations produced children at the age of eight. If this is the case then it is possible for all of the above to have taken place in 22 years: namely, Er was married in the ninth year after Joseph&#x2019;s sale. A year later Onan married. Tamar then stayed for many days in her father&#x2019;s house. We can interpret many days to mean a year. Eight years later Perez gave birth to a son and a year later to a second one. Thus it is possible for all that is reported in Chap. 38 to have taken place between the sale of Joseph and the descent into Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote>The Talmud concludes from the account of Bezalel that the early generations had children at the age of eight We read in <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 69b: &#x201C;Whence do we know that the first generations produced children at eight years? This is to be inferred from the following: <italic>Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah</italic> (Ex. 35:30), and it is written:..<italic>And Caleb (the son of Hezron) took unto him Ephrath, who bore him Hur. And Hur begot Uri, and Uri begot Bezalel</italic> (I Chron. 2:19, 20). When Bezalel was engaged in building the Tabernacle he was at least 13 years old as it is written, <italic>came every man from his work which they wrought</italic> (Ex. 36:4) and one is not called a man before the age of 13. And there is a Baraitha which states: The first year Moses prepared all that was necessary for the Tabernacle, and in the second year he erected it and sent the spies. And it is written: <italic>And Caleb the son of Jephunneh said&#x2026;Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea</italic> (Josh. 14:6, 7) Now deduct 14, the age of Bezalel, from the age of Caleb when he was sent as a spy and there remains 26. Deduct two years for the three pregnancies with Uri and Hur and Bezalel, and there remains 24. Hence each of them produced children at the age of 8.&#x201D; It should be noted that the above is based on identifying Caleb ben Hezron (I Chron. 2:18-20) as Caleb ben Jephunneh (Josh. 14:6, 7). However, according to I.E. these two Calebs were not the same. Hence, the entire Talmudic passage quoted above is Aggadic and not in keeping with the plain meaning of the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2129"><sup>11</sup> The commentators were bothered by Judah marrying a Canaanite woman. Hence their interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2130"><sup>12</sup> It means a Canaanite.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2133"><sup>15</sup> The verse reads, <italic>ve-yabbem</italic> (and perform the duty of a husband&#x2019;s brother). A brother-in-law is called a <italic>yavam</italic>. <italic>Yabbem</italic> is its verbal form. It does not make sense to translate <italic>ve-yabbem</italic>, and be a husband&#x2019;s brother, when in fact he is a husband&#x2019;s brother. Thus <italic>ve-yabbem</italic> has to be rendered, show yourself to be a husband&#x2019;s brother (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2134"><sup>16</sup> The child would be called the son of Er (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2135"><sup>17</sup> The Hebrew literally reads: <italic>ve-shichet</italic> (and he destroyed) <italic>artzah</italic> (to the ground). I.E. interprets this to mean he destroyed his semen by pouring it on the ground.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2141"><sup>23</sup> The root of <italic>neton</italic> is <italic>nun, tav, nun</italic>.

However, in <italic>neton</italic> the <italic>nuns</italic> are present. Hence in this case the root <italic>nun, tav, nun</italic> is conjugated as a <italic>shelamim</italic>, a regular verb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2142"><sup>24</sup> Our verse literally reads: Remain a widow, your father&#x2019;s house. I.E. points out that the prepositional <italic>bet</italic> is omitted from before the word <italic>bet</italic> (house) and has to be supplied by the reader. Thus <italic>bet</italic> (house of) had to be read as if written <italic>be-vet</italic> (in the house of).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2143"><sup>25</sup> The verse literally reads: that was found house of the Lord. Here, too, the prepositional <italic>bet</italic> has to be supplied by the reader and the word to be read as if written <italic>be-vet</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2144"><sup>26</sup> I.E. apparently explains comforted in a technical rather than an emotional sense. Following his wife&#x2019;s burial Judah&#x2019;s friends expressed condolences and comforted him. Judah was thus comforted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2145"><sup>27</sup> <italic>Al</italic> means on. Our verse literally reads: And went up on (<italic>al</italic>) his sheep-shearers, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2146"><sup>28</sup> An intransitive verb is not followed by the object. In our verse <italic>va-tekhas</italic> (covered) is not followed by the object. I.E. points out that even though <italic>va-tekhas</italic> is not followed by the object it is transitive and the object has to be supplied by the reader, i.e., translate <italic>va-tekhas</italic>, and she covered herself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2147"><sup>29</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>enaim</italic> is the plural of <italic>ayin</italic> (a spring) and <italic>petach enayim</italic> should thus be rendered: at the entrance of the wells.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2148"><sup>30</sup> We can ascertain that the meaning of <italic>va-titallaf</italic> means to cover the face from our clause, as it is the manner of Scripture to explain later a previously used term (Weiser).</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 39</title>
<p>6. HE KNEW NOT AUGHT SAVE THE BREAD WHICH HE DID EAT. Some say that <italic>the bread which he did eat</italic> is a euphemism for a conjugal relationship.<sup><xref rid="fn2161">1</xref></sup> However, this interpretation is far-fetched. Furthermore, Potiphar was a eunuch.<sup><xref rid="fn2162">2</xref></sup> I believe that what this verse says is that Potiphar put Joseph in charge of everything that he had except for his bread, which Joseph was not permitted even to touch because he was a Hebrew, as we see from the verse <italic>because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians</italic> (Gen. 43:32). Potiphar knew that Joseph was a Hebrew. Potiphar&#x2019;s wife similarly said, <italic>See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us</italic> (v. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn2163">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND JOSEPH WAS OF BEAUTIFUL FORM. Like his mother.</p>
<p>[10. TO LIE BY HER.] To just lie next to her,<sup><xref rid="fn2164">4</xref></sup> or <italic>to be with her</italic>, to converse with her.</p>
<p>11. AND IT CAME TO PASS ON A CERTAIN DAY. On the same day that she had first asked him to lay with her.<sup><xref rid="fn2165">5</xref></sup> It was on this same day a week later, or a month later or a full year later. The latter appears correct to me.</p>
<p>TO DO HIS WORK. To supervise the housework or to oversee his master&#x2019;s wealth, for Joseph was in charge of everything. The Midrash pertaining to <italic>and there was none of the men</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2166">6</xref></sup> is an individual opinion.<sup><xref rid="fn2167">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. HE HATH BROUGHT UNTO US. That is, my husband.<sup><xref rid="fn2168">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THAT HIS WRATH WAS KINDLED. Potiphar nevertheless did not kill Joseph because he wasn&#x2019;t certain as to the truth of his wife&#x2019;s accusation.</p>
<p>21. PRISON. We can not ascertain whether <italic>bet ha-sohar</italic> (the prison) is a Hebrew or Egyptian word in view of the fact that the Bible goes on to explain its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn2169">9</xref></sup> as it does with the Persian word <italic>ha-achashteranim</italic> (that were used in the King&#x2019;s service) which is followed by the Hebrew <italic>bene ha-rammakhim</italic> (bred of the stud)<sup><xref rid="fn2170">10</xref></sup> (Est. 8:10).</p>
<p>22. AND WHATSOEVER THEY DID THERE, HE WAS THE DOER OF IT. Some interpret this to mean that Joseph, like all the other prisoners, was engaged in work to support himself.<sup><xref rid="fn2171">11</xref></sup> However, I believe that the meaning of our verse is: and whatsoever they had to do there he was, as it were, the doer of it, because he was their supervisor. The next verse bears out the latter interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn2172">12</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2161"><sup>1</sup> Cf. Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2162"><sup>2</sup> Cf. verse 1, <italic>Potiphar seris paroh</italic>. I.E. interprets <italic>seris paroh</italic> (an officer of Pharaoh) as Pharaoh&#x2019;s eunuch. If he was a eunuch then <italic>the bread which he did eat</italic> obviously cannot refer to sexual intercourse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2163"><sup>3</sup> Which proves that his master knew that Joseph was a Hebrew.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2164"><sup>4</sup> That is, just to lie next to her, &#x201C;to lie next to her while both are fully clothed&#x201D; (Nahmanides).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2165"><sup>5</sup> The Hebrew literally reads: And a day like this came to pass, i.e., a day like the one described above, that is, the day that she said, &#x201C;lie with me.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2166"><sup>6</sup> The Hebrew literally reads: and there was no man. According to <italic>Tanchuma, Va-yeshev</italic>, 9, Joseph wanted to have intercourse with Potiphar&#x2019;s wife but found himself impotent (Weiser and Krinsky according to one interpretation). Or the reference may be to <italic>Soteh</italic> 36b, that he wanted to have intercourse with Potiphar&#x2019;s wife but his father&#x2019;s image appeared before him and as a result Joseph refrained from sinning. Thus <italic>and there was none of the men of the house there within</italic> but his father&#x2019;s image was there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2167"><sup>7</sup> Hence it is not binding.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2168"><sup>8</sup> Our verse is short for: my husband hath brought unto us (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2169"><sup>9</sup> Were it a Hebrew word there would be no reason to explain <italic>the place where the King&#x2019;s prisoners were bound</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2172"><sup>12</sup> Verse 23 relates that <italic>the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand</italic>, which implies that Joseph did not actually do any work, but supervised the others.</ftnote>

<p>3. AND HE PUT THEM IN WARD IN THE HOUSE OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD. A place where they would be guarded so they would not escape.</p>
<p>4. AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD CHARGED. When these two officers were put in a ward in the house of the captain of the guard, the latter remembered (<italic>pakad</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2175">3</xref></sup> Joseph; i.e., he recalled his abilities<sup><xref rid="fn2176">4</xref></sup> and brought him to his house<sup><xref rid="fn2177">5</xref></sup> and placed him in a dungeon<sup><xref rid="fn2178">6</xref></sup> which is the ward spoken of in our verse. The latter is the opinion of the great grammarian.<sup><xref rid="fn2179">7</xref></sup> However, I believe that the prison was in the house of the captain of the guard and Joseph was there to begin with. Proof of this is Scripture&#x2019;s explicit statement, <italic>And he put them&#x2026;into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound</italic>. What our verse relates is that the captain of the guard commanded (charged)<sup><xref rid="fn2180">8</xref></sup> Joseph to be with the butler and baker and serve them because they had high status in Pharaoh&#x2019;s palace insomuch as they were officers of the king.</p>
<p>5. AND THEY DREAMED. The meaning<sup><xref rid="fn2181">9</xref></sup> of <italic>each man according to the interpretation of his dream</italic> is that each one of them saw in his dream details that could be interpreted to foretell what would happen in the future.<sup><xref rid="fn2182">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. SAD. <italic>Zo&#x2019;afim</italic> (sad) means agitated, as is the meaning of the word <italic>zapo</italic> (its rage) in <italic>and the sea ceased from its raging</italic> (mi-zapo) (Jon. 1:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2183">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND JOSEPH CAME IN UNTO THEM. It is possible that Joseph used to sleep in the dungeon at night.<sup><xref rid="fn2184">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. [DO NOT INTERPRETATIONS BELONG TO GOD.] Its meaning is that the interpretations of dreams belong to the Lord because He knows the future. He has revealed what is going to come to pass in a dream to one whom He selected and it therefore makes no difference whether I interpret the dream for good or ill. Since this is so, and all interpretations belong to God, do not be concerned about telling me your dreams.<sup><xref rid="fn2185">13</xref></sup> The Rabbinic statement that all dreams follow the interpretation is the opinion of an individual sage.<sup><xref rid="fn2186">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. ITS BLOSSOMS SHOT FORTH. <italic>Nitzah</italic> (its blossoms) is the same as <italic>henetzu</italic> (be in flower) in <italic>And the pomegranates be in flower</italic> (hanetzu) (Cant. 7:13).</p>
<p>AND THE CLUSTERS THEREOF BROUGHT FORTH RIPE GRAPES. <italic>Hivshilu</italic> (brought forth ripe) is the oppposite of <italic>boser</italic> (sour grapes).<sup><xref rid="fn2187">15</xref></sup> <italic>Bashal</italic> (is ripe) in <italic>For the harvest is ripe</italic> (bashal) (Joel 4:13) is similar. The two words are similar even though <italic>hivshilu</italic> in our verse and <italic>bashal</italic> belong to different conjugational paradigms.<sup><xref rid="fn2188">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND PRESSED THEM. <italic>Va-eschat</italic> (pressed) is similar to <italic>shochate</italic> (slay) in <italic>That slay</italic> (shochate) <italic>the children in the valleys</italic> (Is. 57:5). Saadiah Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation of <italic>va-eschat</italic> is wrong.<sup><xref rid="fn2189">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THE INTERPRETATION OF IT. <italic>Pitrono</italic> (the interpretation of it) means its explanation. The term <italic>pitrono</italic> is not found in Scripture except in reference to a dream.<sup><xref rid="fn2190">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some ask, how did Joseph know that the three branches refer to three days and not to three months or three years? Because <italic>yom hulledet et paroh</italic> (v. 20)<sup><xref rid="fn2191">19</xref></sup> possibly means the day on which Pharaoh was born.<sup><xref rid="fn2192">20</xref></sup> For today there are kings who make a party on their birthday and invite their servants and distribute gifts to them. It is also possible that the queen was pregnant.<sup><xref rid="fn2193">21</xref></sup> The first interpretation appeals to me.</p>
<p>13. SHALL PHARAOH LIFT UP THY HEAD. <italic>Yissa</italic> means shall lift up.<sup><xref rid="fn2194">22</xref></sup> In its correct sense, <italic>yissa</italic> means to lift up by counting. <sup><xref rid="fn2195">23</xref></sup> Proof of this is Scripture stating, <italic>and he lifted up</italic> (va-yissa) <italic>the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants</italic> (v. 20).<sup><xref rid="fn2196">24</xref></sup> I will explain this term in my comments on the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic> (Ex. 30:12).<sup><xref rid="fn2197">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>THINE OFFICE. <italic>Kannekha</italic> means thy previous station, thy place,<sup><xref rid="fn2198">26</xref></sup> thy state.<sup><xref rid="fn2199">27</xref></sup> <italic>Kannekha</italic> most likely comes from the same root as <italic>ken</italic> (a base, a pedestal) (I Kings 7:29). The word <italic>kanno</italic> (in his place) in <italic>Then shall stand up in his place</italic> (kanno) (Dan. 11:20) is analogous.</p>
<p>15. OUT OF THE LAND OF THE HEBREWS. I will explain this in my comments on <italic>If thou buy a Hebrew servant</italic> (Ex. 21:2).</p>
<p>When the term <italic>hinneh</italic> (behold) is found in Scripture following a dream, its meaning is <italic>as it were</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2200">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. THREE BASKETS OF WHITE BREAD. Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>chori</italic> means white bread, as in <italic>the nobles</italic> (chore)<sup><xref rid="fn2201">29</xref></sup> <italic>of Judah</italic> (Neh. 6:17).</p>
<p>[19.] WITHIN YET. <italic>Be&#x2019;od</italic> (within yet) is to be translated before again.<sup><xref rid="fn2202">30</xref></sup> Its meaning is: such a time<sup><xref rid="fn2203">31</xref></sup> will not again pass without this happening.</p>
<p>SHALL PHARAOH LIFT UP THY HEAD FROM OFF THEE. He will lift it up from its place. It means he will remove it or raise it up on a pole.<sup><xref rid="fn2204">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. BIRTHDAY. <italic>Hulledet</italic> (birth) is an infinitive in the <italic>hofal</italic>.</p>
<p>21. UNTO HIS BUTLERSHIP. <italic>Mashkehu</italic> (his butlership) here is a noun.<sup><xref rid="fn2205">33</xref></sup> However, <italic>mashkehu</italic> in <italic>when thou wast his butler</italic> (mashkehu) (v. 13) is a verb.</p>
<p>23. YET DID NOT THE CHIEF BUTLER REMEMBER JOSEPH. He did not verbally mention him to Pharaoh.<sup><xref rid="fn2206">34</xref></sup> The words <italic>tizkeru</italic> (shall ye mention) and <italic>zakhar</italic> (he remembered), in <italic>And the burden of the Lord shall ye mention</italic> (tizkeru)<sup><xref rid="fn2207">35</xref></sup> <italic>no more</italic> (Jer. 23:36) and <italic>he remembered</italic> (zakhar) <italic>Vashti</italic> (Est. 2:1), are similar.</p>
<p>BUT FORGOT HIM. In his heart.<sup><xref rid="fn2208">36</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2173"><sup>1</sup> According to Cherez. Weiser suggests rendering: They committed an offense punishable by the state.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2174"><sup>2</sup> Words vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath their first letter in the singular are vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic> under their first letter in the plural; i.e., <italic>nagid</italic> becomes <italic>negidim</italic>. <italic>Saris</italic> does not follow this rule. Its plural is <italic>sarisim</italic>, not <italic>serisim</italic>. Hence the word presents a problem. I.E. suggests that <italic>saris</italic> belongs to the group of nouns vocalized <italic>pattach-chirik</italic>. The latter retain their <italic>pattach</italic> in the plural; i.e., <italic>kabbir</italic> becomes <italic>kabbirim</italic>. I.E. points out that <italic>saris</italic> should have been vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>samekh</italic> but due to the fact that a <italic>resh</italic> cannot receive a <italic>dagesh</italic> (a <italic>dagesh</italic> usually follows a <italic>pattach</italic>), the <italic>samekh</italic> was vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> to compensate for the missing <italic>dagesh</italic>. Hence <italic>saris</italic> retains its <italic>kamatz</italic> in the plural.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2175"><sup>3</sup> In this interpretation <italic>va-yifkod</italic> (charged) is translated as remembered. Thus according to this interpretation, <italic>And the captain of the guard charged</italic> (va-yifkod) <italic>Joseph</italic> is to be rendered: And the captain of the guard remembered (<italic>va-yifkod</italic>) Joseph.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2176"><sup>4</sup> He remembered that Joseph was able to relate to nobles (Weiser). Filwarg interprets: remembered the Jospeh episode, i.e., that Joseph, like the butler and the baker, offended his master. Krinsky explains: he remembered Joseph&#x2019;s words protesting his innocence and decided to place him in a prison whose conditions were better. The Hebrew reading of I.E. is <italic>zakhar devarav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2177"><sup>5</sup> According to this interpretation Joseph was originally in a different prison and was now brought to the one in the home of the captain of the guard.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2178"><sup>6</sup> Cf. verse 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2179"><sup>7</sup> Jonah Ibn Janah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2180"><sup>8</sup> I.E. so translates <italic>va-yifkod</italic> as charged.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2181"><sup>9</sup> Reading <italic>ta&#x2019;am</italic> rather than <italic>ke-ta&#x2019;am</italic> (Filwarg, Krinsky). The aforementioned is borne out by <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 which reads, <italic>ve-ta&#x2019;am</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2182"><sup>10</sup> There was no part of the dream that did not allude to something. There was no nonsensical part in the dream. Every part of the dream had a meaning and was interpretable (Filwarg based on the reading of I.E. quoted by Nahmanides which is borne out by <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38). Our printed texts read, &#x201C;Each one saw the interpretation of the dream and what happened to him&#x201D; The problem with this reading is, if they saw the interpretation of their dream in their nocturnal vision why, then, did they turn to Joseph for its interpretation? Hence we have translated according to <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2183"><sup>11</sup> Both words come from the same root.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2184"><sup>12</sup> The prison had a number of levels. Joseph&#x2019;s quarters were in the lowest. He spent his nights in the dungeon and his days with the other prisoners (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2185"><sup>13</sup> The point is, only God knows the future and what He knows will come to pass. Hence my interpretation can in no way influence the outcome of your dream. What will be, will be.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2186"><sup>14</sup> Rabbi Elazar in <italic>Berakhot</italic> 55b. According to the latter a dream&#x2019;s meaning depends on its interpretation. This contradicts I.E. Hence, I.E. says that Rabbi Elazar&#x2019;s opinion is not binding.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2187"><sup>15</sup> I.E. could not find a synonym for ripe. The only way he could define it was by contrasting it with its opposite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2188"><sup>16</sup> <italic>Hivshilu</italic> is in the <italic>hifil, bashal</italic> is in the <italic>kal</italic>. Both mean ripened.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2189"><sup>17</sup> This is a very difficult comment to unravel. The most acceptable interpretation is offered by Filwarg. According to Filwarg, I.E. maintains that <italic>va-eschat</italic> does not mean to press or squeeze as Saadiah Gaon says (this interpretation is accepted by J.P.S. and all others) since the word is not found elsewhere in the Bible. The word <italic>sachat</italic>, meaning to squeeze, is found in Rabbinic literature, but there it is spelled with a <italic>samakh</italic> and not with a <italic>sin</italic>. I.E. notes that the word <italic>shachat</italic> spelled with a <italic>shin</italic> or <italic>sachat</italic> spelled with a <italic>sin</italic> as in our verse means the same, to cut, hence to slay by cutting the throat. Thus our verse should be rendered: And I cut the grape so that its juice ran. It is also possible that in I.E.&#x2019;s copy of Isaiah <italic>shochate</italic> was spelled with a <italic>sin</italic>, i.e., he read <italic>sochate</italic>, and what I.E. is doing is noting that <italic>va-eschat</italic> is like <italic>sochate</italic>. For additional interpretations see Cherez and Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2190"><sup>18</sup> Hence it means the interpretation of a dream. It cannot he used in any other context (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2191"><sup>19</sup> Translated according to Filwarg, Weiser and Cherez. According to Krinsky the question raised in I.E. is not answered. The way Krinsky read I.E. is: I.E. asks, &#x201C;How did Joseph know that the three branches refer to three days?&#x201D; He then goes on to explain the meaning of the clause <italic>yom hulledet et paroh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2192"><sup>20</sup> Joseph knew that Pharaoh&#x2019;s birthday would be in three days and it was obvious to him that the branches referred to this festive event (Filwarg, Weiser, Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2193"><sup>21</sup> And that <italic>yom hulledet et paroh</italic> means the day that a child was born to Pharaoh. It was known that the queen was in her ninth month and Joseph reasoned that the &#x201C;three branches&#x201D; referred to the days left till she delivered.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2194"><sup>22</sup> Pharaoh will raise the chief butler from his fallen state.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2195"><sup>23</sup> See note 25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2196"><sup>24</sup> Here the term <italic>va-yissa</italic> must mean and he counted because Pharaoh did not exalt the chief baker.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2197"><sup>25</sup> In his short commentary on Ex. 30:12, I.E. points out that one who counts people lists them in a row and places the most important at the top. Thus when Pharaoh will count his servants he will have a list of his butlers and bakers made. The name of the chief butler will head the list of butlers and that of the baker the list of bakers. Thus to &#x201C;lift up&#x201D; means to count. However, it does so only in a specific sense. It is not a mere synonym for counting. It should be noted that some commmentaries maintain that I.E. is of the opinion that to lift up is another way of saying to count. Cf. Krinsky and Cherez.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2198"><sup>26</sup> Hebrew <italic>mekhunatekha</italic>. Compare, <italic>mekhunatah</italic> in Zech. 5:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2199"><sup>27</sup> Hebrew <italic>matkuntekha</italic>. Compare, <italic>matkunto</italic> in II Chron. 24:13. I.E. is saying is that <italic>kannekha</italic> (thine office) is similar to <italic>mekhunatah</italic> and <italic>matkunto</italic>. However, I.E. changes the pronominal suffixes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2200"><sup>28</sup> <italic>Hinneh</italic> (behold) applies to something real. However, when used to describe what one saw in a dream it means: as it were, as if. Cf. Gen. 28:12; 37:7-10; 41:2-6, 18-23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2201"><sup>29</sup> Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Gen. 36:20 where he writes, &#x201C;Nobles are called <italic>chorim</italic> (literally, the white ones) because they are metaphorically speaking as the color white which resembles light.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2202"><sup>30</sup> <italic>Od</italic> means again. The <italic>bet</italic> prefixed to it means before. Thus <italic>be&#x2019;od</italic> means before again (within yet), and the meaning of <italic>be&#x2019;od sheloshet yamim</italic> (within yet three days) is before three days again pass. I.E. makes this point because Onkelos translates <italic>be&#x2019;od</italic>, after yet. Thus Onkelos renders <italic>be&#x2019;od sheloshet yamim</italic> at the end of three days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2203"><sup>31</sup> Three days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2204"><sup>32</sup> The point is that the Hebrew word <italic>yissa</italic> may mean to remove or to raise up (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2205"><sup>33</sup> Here <italic>mashkehu</italic> means his drink. The meaning of our verse is: And he restored the chief butler back to being in charge of his drink. In verse 13 it means, gives him to drink.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2206"><sup>34</sup> According to I.E. <italic>zakhar</italic> (usually translated remembered) here means mentioned, as in <italic>make mention of me</italic> (ve-hizkartani) <italic>unto Pharaoh</italic> (v. 14).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2207"><sup>35</sup> Literally, shall ye remember.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2208"><sup>36</sup> Thus the verse tells us that the butler not only failed to mention Joseph to Pharaoh, he totally forgot about him.</ftnote>

<h1>MI-KETZ</h1>
<p>1. AND IT CAME TO PASS AT THE END OF TWO FULL YEARS. Scripture does not indicate the point from which these two years are reckoned. <italic>And it came to pass at the end of forty years</italic> (II Sam. 15:7), <italic>And within threescore and five years</italic> (Is. 7:8), and <italic>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year</italic> (Ezek. 1:1)<sup><xref rid="fn2209">1</xref></sup> are similar. However, it is possible that Scripture&#x2019;s point of reckoning is the chief butler&#x2019;s release from prison or the day that Joseph was put into prison.</p>
<p>[FULL.] I have already explained the meaning of <italic>yamim</italic> (full).<sup><xref rid="fn2210">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT PHARAOH DREAMED. That is, was dreaming. Compare, <italic>And Rebekah heard</italic> (Gen. 27:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2211">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. IN THE REED-GRASS. Some say that <italic>achu</italic> (reed-grass) means a valley with plants.<sup><xref rid="fn2212">4</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>achu</italic> is the name of a certain type of plant and<sup><xref rid="fn2213">5</xref></sup> the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ba-achu</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn2214">6</xref></sup> It is similar to the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>va-merorim</italic> in, <italic>He hath filled me with bitterness</italic> (va-merorim) (Lam. 3:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2215">7</xref></sup> According to both of these interpretations <italic>achu</italic> here and <italic>achim</italic> in <italic>For though he be fruitful among the reed-plants</italic> (achim) (Hos. 13:15) are related and come from one root.<sup><xref rid="fn2216">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. EARS OF CORN. <italic>Shibbolim</italic> (ears of corn) is a feminine plural even though it ends in a <italic>mem</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2217">9</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>nashim</italic> (women) and <italic>pilagshim</italic> (concubines).<sup><xref rid="fn2218">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND BLASTED. <italic>U-shedufot kadim</italic> means they were blasted by a wind coming from the east for <italic>kadim</italic> means east. East is so termed because the sun rises there first.<sup><xref rid="fn2219">11</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Ha-mele&#x2019;ot</italic> (full) has the same meaning as <italic>ha-beri&#x2019;ot</italic> (rank).<sup><xref rid="fn2220">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. THAT HIS SPIRIT WAS TROUBLED. <italic>Va-tippa&#x2019;em</italic> (was troubled) is a <italic>nifal</italic>. It is similar to <italic>nifamti</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2221">13</xref></sup> in <italic>I am troubled</italic> (nifamti) <italic>and cannot speak</italic> (Ps. 77:5). Others say<sup><xref rid="fn2222">14</xref></sup> that both <italic>va-tippa&#x2019;em</italic> and <italic>nifamti</italic> come from the same root as <italic>pa&#x2019;am</italic> (anvil)<sup><xref rid="fn2223">15</xref></sup> in <italic>that smiteth the anvil</italic> (pa&#x2019;am) (Is. 41:7). Its meaning is that his spirit was like a beaten body.<sup><xref rid="fn2224">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>MAGICIANS OF. <italic>Chartume</italic> (magicians of) comes from a quadriliteral root.<sup><xref rid="fn2225">17</xref></sup> However, it is possibly an Aramaic or Egyptian word. It means a scientist.<sup><xref rid="fn2226">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ALL THE WISE MEN THEREOF. Men learned in astrology and dream interpretation.</p>
<p>9. MY FAULTS. Even though I will recall my faults.<sup><xref rid="fn2227">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. PHARAOH WAS WROTH WITH HIS SERVANTS. I believe that Pharaoh is an adjective<sup><xref rid="fn2228">20</xref></sup> and not a proper name. It is an Egyptian word. It is a title as Hiram in Tyre.<sup><xref rid="fn2229">21</xref></sup> Similarly in our day all great Arab kings are called &#x201C;prince of the believers.&#x201D; Hence we find a Pharaoh in the days of Abraham and a Pharaoh in the days of Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn2230">22</xref></sup> We also read that a Pharaoh died and a new Pharaoh arose.<sup><xref rid="fn2231">23</xref></sup> Similarly we find a Pharaoh in the days of Jeremiah.<sup><xref rid="fn2232">24</xref></sup> Do you not see that Scripture itself explains that Pharaoh is a term for the king of Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn2233">25</xref></sup> as evidenced by the terms Pharaoh Hophra and Pharaoh Neco,<sup><xref rid="fn2234">26</xref></sup> wherein Hophra and Neco are proper nouns.<sup><xref rid="fn2235">27</xref></sup> Do not raise any objection from the Midrash concerning Solomon&#x2019;s throne,<sup><xref rid="fn2236">28</xref></sup> for the king of Egypt did not take it to Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2237">29</xref></sup> Additional proof<sup><xref rid="fn2238">30</xref></sup> is found in the statement of the chief butler, <italic>Pharaoh was wroth</italic>, and in Joseph&#x2019;s statements, <italic>God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace</italic> (v. 16); <italic>He hath shown unto Pharaoh</italic> (v. 28); and <italic>Let Pharaoh do this</italic> (v. 34).<sup><xref rid="fn2239">31</xref></sup> It is not in keeping with proper etiquette to mention the king by name.</p>
<p>ME AND THE CHIEF BAKER. The word me is mentioned twice in this verse in keeping with Hebrew usage. Compare, <italic>and as for me, whither shall I go</italic> (Gen. 37:30).<sup><xref rid="fn2240">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. EACH MAN ACCORDING TO THE INTERPRETATION OF HIS DREAM. I have previously explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn2241">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. I WAS RESTORED. By Pharaoh.<sup><xref rid="fn2242">34</xref></sup> Or its meaning is, Joseph&#x2019;s word<sup><xref rid="fn2243">35</xref></sup> or Joseph&#x2019;s interpretation restored me and hanged him.<sup><xref rid="fn2244">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THEY BROUGHT HIM HASTILY. Pharaoh&#x2019;s messengers.</p>
<p>AND HE SHAVED HIMSELF. Someone shaved him.<sup><xref rid="fn2245">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. IT IS NOT IN ME. <italic>Biladai</italic> (it is not in me) is a compound of two words.<sup><xref rid="fn2246">38</xref></sup> <italic>It is not in me</italic> refers to <italic>And I have heard say of thee that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it</italic> (v. 15). When Joseph heard Pharaoh say this he replied, <italic>it is not in me, but God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace via my interpretation</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2247">39</xref></sup> Others say that when Joseph heard Pharaoh say, <italic>thou canst interpret dreams</italic>, Jospeh replied, I am not (it is not in me) the interpreter; God is, and He will give the king an answer of peace.<sup><xref rid="fn2248">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WILL GIVE AN ANSWER.] The meaning of <italic>ya&#x2019;aneh</italic> (will give an answer) is, He will always provide. Compare, <italic>ma&#x2019;aneh</italic> in <italic>for God answereth him</italic> (ma&#x2019;aneh) <italic>in the joy of his heart</italic> (Eccles. 5:19), and <italic>ta&#x2019;aneh</italic> in <italic>And the earth shall respond</italic> (ta&#x2019;aneh) (Hos. 2:24). Nevertheless, the word is close to its primary meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn2249">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>[19. POOR AND VERY ILL-FAVORED.] In relating the dream Pharaoh added the word <italic>dallot</italic> (poor), and in place of <italic>mareh</italic> (favored) he used the term <italic>to&#x2019;ar</italic> (favored) because their meanings are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2250">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. BUT THEY WERE STILL ILL-FAVORED. Each one of the kine was ill-favored.<sup><xref rid="fn2251">43</xref></sup> Here Pharaoh expanded in his description of his dream and added that after the ill-favored kine had eaten the fat kine, <italic>they were still ill-favored as at the beginning</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2252">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. WITHERED. The word <italic>tzenumot</italic> (withered) is not found elsewhere in Scripture. Its meaning is the same as that of <italic>rekot</italic> (empty).<sup><xref rid="fn2253">45</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>tzenumot</italic> means images,<sup><xref rid="fn2254">46</xref></sup> for that is its meaning in Arabic.</p>
<p>29. GREAT PLENTY. <italic>Sava</italic> (plenty) is a noun. It is like <italic>ra&#x2019;av</italic> (famine).<sup><xref rid="fn2255">47</xref></sup> Hence the one who says in his Sabbath prayers<sup><xref rid="fn2256">48</xref></sup> <italic>u-ve-sova kilkaltanu</italic> errs because <italic>sova</italic> spelled with a <italic>vav</italic> is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn2257">49</xref></sup> The correct way to read this prayer is without a <italic>vav</italic>, viz., <italic>u-ve-sava</italic> (and in plenty) <italic>kilkaltanu</italic> (thou sustained us).</p>
<p>31. [AND THE PLENTY SHALL NOT BE KNOWN IN THE LAND.] Joseph based this on <italic>but they were still ill-favored as at the beginning</italic> (v. 21).</p>
<p>32. AND FOR THAT THE DREAM WAS DOUBLED. <italic>Hishanot</italic> (was doubled) is a <italic>nifal</italic>. It comes from the same root as <italic>shenayim</italic> (two). Its meaning is the dream coming twice, once with kine as its symbol and then with ears of corn as its symbol, also attests<sup><xref rid="fn2258">50</xref></sup> that <italic>the thing is established by God</italic>. Furthermore, the occurrence of the two dreams in one night is proof that <italic>God will shortly bring it to pass</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2259">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. LET PHARAOH DO THIS. <italic>Ya&#x2019;aseh paro</italic> (literally let Pharaoh do) is short for let Pharaoh do according to the following council. Or <italic>ya&#x2019;aseh</italic> (do) means get, like <italic>asah</italic> in <italic>My power and the might of my hand hath gotten</italic> (asah) <italic>me this wealth</italic> (Deut. 8:17).<sup><xref rid="fn2260">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND TAKE UP THE FIFTH PART OF THE LAND. Let him buy a fifth of the produce of the land.</p>
<p>35. AND LAY UP CORN. The overseers.</p>
<p>Some say that <italic>bar</italic> (corn) refers to corn in its ears.<sup><xref rid="fn2261">53</xref></sup> However, I think that <italic>bar</italic> is the term applied to the corn after it has been fanned and cleansed.<sup><xref rid="fn2262">54</xref></sup> To the one who says that the Egyptian air is damp because of the Nile and it is impossible for corn to last there for seven years, we reply that it is possible to mix corn with preservatives.<sup><xref rid="fn2263">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. CAN WE FIND SUCH A ONE AS THIS. <italic>Nimtza</italic> (we find) is a <italic>nifal</italic> perfect and the meaning of <italic>ha-nimtza kha-zeh ish</italic> (can we find such a one as this) is, was such a one as this ever found in the world. It is also possible that the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>nimtza</italic> is a first person plural prefix.<sup><xref rid="fn2264">56</xref></sup> In this case the word <italic>ha-nimtza</italic> (can we find) relates to what Pharaoh said to his servants.<sup><xref rid="fn2265">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. THOU SHALT BE OVER MY HOUSE. Thou shalt be chief over my house.</p>
<p>SHALL BE RULED. The <italic>shin</italic> of <italic>yishak</italic> (shall be ruled) has a <italic>dagesh</italic> to compensate for the missing <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>neshek</italic> (arms),<sup><xref rid="fn2266">58</xref></sup> its meaning being Joseph will be commander of the army.<sup><xref rid="fn2267">59</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>yishak</italic> is related to <italic>neshikah</italic> (kiss).<sup><xref rid="fn2268">60</xref></sup> However, the latter is far fetched.</p>
<p>ONLY IN THE THRONE WILL I BE GREATER THAN THOU. It is known that <italic>egdal</italic> (I will be greater) is an intransitive verb. The meaning of <italic>rak ha-kisse egdal mi-mekka</italic> is, I will not be greater than you except for the dignity of the throne.<sup><xref rid="fn2269">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>gedelani</italic> (he grew up with me) in <italic>Nay from my youth he grew up with me</italic> (gedelani) <italic>as with a father</italic> (Job 31:18) is not a transitive verb<sup><xref rid="fn2270">62</xref></sup> but an intransitive verb meaning he grew up with me. The juxtaposition of an intransitive verb (<italic>egdal</italic>) with the direct object (<italic>kisse</italic>) is found elsewhere in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2271">63</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fadeth</italic> (ke-elah novelet aleha) (Is. 1:30);<sup><xref rid="fn2272">64</xref></sup> and <italic>and ye perish in the way</italic> (ve-tovedu derekh) (Ps. 2:12).<sup><xref rid="fn2273">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. SEE, I HAVE SET THEE OVER ALL THE LAND. I have set thee above all the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>42. VESTURES OF FINE LINEN. I have explained the meaning of <italic>shesh</italic> (fine linen) in my comments on the Torah portion <italic>ve-yikchu li terumah</italic> (that they take for me an offering).<sup><xref rid="fn2274">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>A GOLD CHAIN. <italic>Revid</italic> (chain) is like <italic>marvadim</italic> (coverlets) in <italic>I have decked my couch with coverlets</italic> (marvadim) (Prov. 7:16).<sup><xref rid="fn2275">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>43. THE SECOND. <italic>Mishneh</italic> (the second) comes from the same root as <italic>shenayim</italic> (two). The king is like the numeral one, next comes the <italic>mishneh</italic> which means second to him, and afterward the <italic>shalish</italic> (adjutant) which means the same as <italic>shilishi</italic> (third).<sup><xref rid="fn2276">68</xref></sup></p>

<p>ABRECH. Every man called before him, I will bend the knee (<italic>avrekh</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2279">71</xref></sup> and I will bow down.

<p>Rabbi Jonah, the Spanish grammarian,<sup><xref rid="fn2281">73</xref></sup> said that <italic>avrekh</italic> is an infinitive, with an <italic>alef</italic> taking the place of the <italic>heh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2282">74</xref></sup> as we find in the word <italic>ashkem</italic> in <italic>sending them betimes</italic> (ashkem) <italic>and often</italic> (Jer. 25:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2283">75</xref></sup> However, I believe that the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>ashkem</italic> is a first person future prefix.<sup><xref rid="fn2284">76</xref></sup></p>

<p>PRIEST OF ON. The term <italic>kohen</italic> (priest) can be applied to one who serves the Lord or to one who serves idols, for I believe that when this term is used in Scripture it means one who ministers.<sup><xref rid="fn2292">84</xref></sup></p>

<p>51. FOR GOD HATH MADE ME FORGET. Its meaning is, because he said <italic>God hath made me forget</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2296">88</xref></sup> Rabbi Judah, the first Hebrew grammarian,<sup><xref rid="fn2297">89</xref></sup> says that <italic>nashani</italic> (made me forget) follows the paradigm of <italic>channani</italic> (dealt graciously with me) (Gen. 33:11).<sup><xref rid="fn2298">90</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen, the Spaniard, says that (in <italic>nashani</italic>) a <italic>pattach</italic> has been substituted for the <italic>chirik</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2299">91</xref></sup></p>

<p>57. TO JOSEPH TO BUY CORN. The clause is inverted<sup><xref rid="fn2305">97</xref></sup> and must be understood as: And all the countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2209"><sup>1</sup> In all these verses Scripture doesn&#x2019;t indicate the point from which the reckoning starts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2210"><sup>2</sup> Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 4:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2211"><sup>3</sup> The Hebrew literally reads: that Pharaoh dreams (<italic>u-faroh cholem</italic>), hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 27:5 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>

However, if <italic>achu</italic> is the name of a plant then the <italic>bet</italic> is superfluous, for one cannot say they fed in the plant (whatever plant <italic>achu</italic> might be). According to the latter interpretation our verse is to be translated: and they fed upon <italic>achu</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2215"><sup>7</sup> Hebrew usage requires the verse to read <italic>merorim</italic> rather than <italic>va-merorim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2216"><sup>8</sup> I.E. literally reads, &#x201C;It (<italic>achim</italic> in Hosea) is its brother (<italic>achiv</italic>) the son of his mother.&#x201D; I.E. plays with <italic>achim</italic> (valley or plant) and <italic>ach</italic> (brother). His point is that both come from the same root, that our word is in the singular, and that in Hosea it is in the plural (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2217"><sup>9</sup> Which ordinarily indicates that a word is a masculine plural.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2218"><sup>10</sup> Both of which are feminine plural nouns with masculine endings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2219"><sup>11</sup> <italic>Kedem</italic> means first. Cf. Is. 23:7; Ezek. 38:17. I.E. makes this point because <italic>kedem</italic> can also mean front. However, a circular object (the earth) has no front (Krinsky). <italic>Shedufot kadim</italic> can be rendered as blasted by the east. Hence I.E. points out that east refers to an east wind.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2220"><sup>12</sup> Verse 5 reads <italic>beri&#x2019;ot ve-tovot</italic> (rank and good). Similarly verse 7 reads, <italic>ha-beri&#x2019;ot ve-ha-mele&#x2019;ot</italic> (rank and full). I.E. points out that <italic>beri&#x2019;ot</italic> when referring to ears of corn means full because the term <italic>bari</italic> (rank), which means fat, can only be used when referring to animals; i.e., one cannot speak of a fat plant. Hence I.E. points out that here <italic>bari</italic> means full (Filwarg). Thus <italic>beri&#x2019;ot ve-tovot</italic> means the same as <italic>mele&#x2019;ot ve-tovot</italic>. On the other hand I.E.&#x2019;s comment may pertain only to verse 7. In this case I.E. is pointing out that the Bible there uses two synonyms, <italic>mele&#x2019;ot</italic> and <italic>beri&#x2019;ot</italic>, for full (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2221"><sup>13</sup> Which is a <italic>nifal</italic>. The <italic>nun</italic> of the <italic>nifal</italic> is missing in <italic>va-tippa&#x2019;em</italic> because it is an imperfect with a conversive <italic>vav</italic>, and the <italic>nun</italic> of the <italic>nifal</italic> is dropped in the future and is compensated by a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the first letter of the root.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2222"><sup>14</sup> The &#x201C;others&#x201D; do not dispute what has been said until now. They explain the meaning of the word, whereas the first interpretation gave the conjugation of the word (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2223"><sup>15</sup> The meaning of <italic>va-tippa&#x2019;em rucho</italic> (that his spirit was troubled) thus is: that his spirit was beaten.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2224"><sup>16</sup> It was pained and troubled. Spirit is immaterial and cannot be beaten. However, it may be compared to a beaten body. His spirit was beaten as if it were a body (Weiser). Hence the verb <italic>va-tippa&#x2019;em</italic> (was beaten) can govern <italic>rucho</italic> (his spirit).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2228"><sup>20</sup> What I.E. means by &#x201C;adjective&#x201D; is an adjectival noun, a descriptive term like <italic>melekh</italic> (king). Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 1:1 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2229"><sup>21</sup> According to I.E., Hiram is not a proper noun. It is a term like Pharaoh or <italic>melekh</italic>. We thus find a Hiram in the days of David (II Sam. 5:11) and in the days of Solomon (I Kings 5:15) (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2230"><sup>22</sup> They obviously were not the same person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2231"><sup>23</sup> Ex. 1:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2232"><sup>24</sup> Jer. 44:30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2233"><sup>25</sup> The Bible in a number of places explains that Pharaoh is a king of Egypt. Cf. Ex. 6:13, 29; Jer. 44:30. Filwarg questions this reading and suggests emending it. According to Filwarg we should translate, &#x201C;Do you not see that Scripture does not explain the term Pharaoh. It does not do so because Pharaoh is a title for the kings of Egypt.&#x201D; According to Filwarg, I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the Bible usually does not identify the Pharaoh because it is known to be a title for the king of Egypt. If Pharaoh was a proper name, king of Egypt would follow it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2234"><sup>26</sup> Jer. 44:30; 46:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2235"><sup>27</sup> Therefore Pharaoh must be an adjective.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2236"><sup>28</sup> According to the Midrash, <italic>Va-yikra Rabbah</italic> 20, Pharaoh Neco means Pharaoh the lame. Thus <italic>Neco</italic> is an adjective. According to the Midrash this Pharaoh tried to sit on Solomon&#x2019;s throne, which had been brought to Egypt by an earlier Pharaoh named Shishak, and had his leg bitten and broken by a lion, hence the name Pharaoh Neco, Pharaoh the lame.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2237"><sup>29</sup> King Solomon&#x2019;s throne was never brought to Egypt as it is not included among the spoil taken by Shishak. Cf. I Kings 14:25, 26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2238"><sup>30</sup> That Pharaoh is not a proper noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2239"><sup>31</sup> Thus these verses prove that Pharaoh is not a proper noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2240"><sup>32</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 37:30 and the notes thereto. Our verse reads, <italic>and put me&#x2026;me and the chief baker</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2241"><sup>33</sup> I.E. explains the meaning of <italic>each man according to the interpretation of his dreams</italic> in his comments on Gen. 40:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2242"><sup>34</sup> The verse literally reads: me he restored (<italic>oti heshiv</italic>), him he hanged (<italic>oto talah</italic>). The question is, to whom does &#x201C;he&#x201D; refer. According to the first interpretation it refers to Pharaoh, according to the second, to Joseph.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2243"><sup>35</sup> Since Joseph said it, it was as if he had done it (Filwarg). Or Joseph&#x2019;s saying it was the cause of it (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2244"><sup>36</sup> Joseph, by so interpreting, caused it to happen (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2245"><sup>37</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>va-yegakkach</italic>. If Joseph shaved himself Scripture would have used the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el va-yitgallach</italic> rather than the <italic>pi&#x2019;el va-yegallach</italic> (Cherez), the meaning of which is, and he shaved. However, <italic>va-yegallach</italic> presents a problem. The subject is missing. Hence I.E. notes that it should be rendered: and someone shaved him. According to Krinsky, I.E. is of the opinion (for the aforementioned reasons) that our verse is abridged and the reader has to supply the subject. Our verse should thus be rendered: and the shaver shaved him. I.E.&#x2019;s note consists of one word, <italic>ha-megalle&#x2019;ach</italic> (the shaver).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2246"><sup>38</sup> It is a compound of <italic>bal</italic> (not) and <italic>ade</italic> (unto).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2247"><sup>39</sup> The problem is what does <italic>biladai</italic> (it is not in me) refer to. According to this explanation <italic>biladai</italic> refers to the power to interpret dreams. The power to interpret dreams is not in me, it comes from God (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2248"><sup>40</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>biladai</italic> means not I, and refers to the interpreter (Cherez). It should be noted that I.E. is vague and that Krinsky, Kaputa and others interpret differently.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2249"><sup>41</sup> Its primary meaning is to answer. When one provides, he, as it were, answers (Cherez). For an alternate translation see Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2250"><sup>42</sup> In verse 3 we read that Pharaoh saw <italic>ill-favored</italic> (ra&#x2019;ot mareh) <italic>and lean fleshed</italic> kine in his dream. In our verse Pharaoh describes them as <italic>poor and very ill-favored</italic> (ve-ra&#x2019;ot to&#x2019;ar me&#x2019;od) <italic>and lean fleshed</italic>. I.E. says there is no discrepancy in the descriptions because adding a word or using a synonym does not change the meaning. He further expands on this point in his comments on Ex. 20:1 where he uses this argument to explain why there are two different versions of the Ten Commandments in the Pentateuch.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2251"><sup>43</sup> <italic>Marehen</italic> (favored) is a plural; <italic>ra</italic> (ill) is a singular. Thus <italic>marehen ra</italic> is a combination of singular and plural. I.E. explains this by noting that it means each one of the kine was ill-favored. This is how the medieval grammarians explained this type of combination (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2252"><sup>44</sup> When the dream was first described in verse 4, it was not indicated that after swallowing the seven fat kine, the seven lean ones <italic>were still ill-favored as at the beginning</italic>. Here, unlike verse 19, the addition is significant. The entire verse consists of Pharaoh&#x2019;s elaboration of his dream.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2253"><sup>45</sup> Joseph in verse 27 refers to the ears as <italic>rekot</italic> (empty). In our verse they are described as <italic>tzenumot</italic>. According to I.E., Joseph substituted a synonym. I.E. explains these substitutions in his comments on verse 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2254"><sup>46</sup> In a manner of speaking images are imitations. Similarly applying this concept these things were in the shape of ears but empty on the inside (Krinsky). Or images have no practical use, neither did these ears (Cherez). Weiser suggests that what I.E. says is that images are hard; these, too, were hard and could not serve as food. According to the latter interpretation I.E. agrees with Rashi who interprets <italic>tzenumot</italic> as hard.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2255"><sup>47</sup> Both <italic>sava</italic> and <italic>ra&#x2019;av</italic> are nouns.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2256"><sup>48</sup> In the <italic>nishmat</italic> prayer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2257"><sup>49</sup> The prayer reads, <italic>during famine</italic> (ra&#x2019;av) <italic>thou didst feed us, and didst sustain us in plenty</italic> (p. 419, <italic>The Authorized Prayer Book</italic>, trans. by J. H. Hertz). Plenty is parallel to famine. As <italic>ra&#x2019;av</italic> is a noun so its parallel must be a noun. Hence the correct reading is <italic>sava</italic> and not <italic>sova</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2258"><sup>50</sup> Not only do the kine and the ears allude to seven years of plenty and famine, they also indicate that the decree is established by God; i.e., it is unchangeable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2259"><sup>51</sup> The dream could have come on two different nights. The fact that it occurred twice in one night is proof that God is bringing it about soon. Our verse reads: <italic>The dream was doubled&#x2026;twice</italic>. This appears redundant; hence I.E. explains <italic>was doubled</italic> came in two versions, <italic>twice</italic>, twice in one night. <italic>It is because the thing is established by God</italic> corresponds to <italic>was doubled</italic>; and <italic>and God will shortly bring it to pass</italic> corresponds to <italic>twice</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2260"><sup>52</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>ya&#x2019;aseh paro</italic> means let Pharoah get. Also according to this interpretation the object is missing. It should be read: Let Pharaoh get wheat (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2261"><sup>53</sup> Grain that has not been purified from its stubble (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2262"><sup>54</sup> Grain whose impurities have been removed. I.E. is paraphrasing Jer. 4:11. Our texts read, fanned or cleansed. <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads, fanned and cleansed. We have followed the latter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2263"><sup>55</sup> According to <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 90:5 this is precisely what Joseph did.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2264"><sup>56</sup> A <italic>nun</italic> is prefixed to the Hebrew root in the first person plural imperfect. According to this interpretation <italic>nimtza</italic> is a <italic>kal</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2265"><sup>57</sup> The meaning of the phrase is, can we find such a one as this. The point is that <italic>nimtza</italic> can either be a third person singular <italic>nifal</italic> perfect or a first person plural <italic>kal</italic> imperfect. In the first instance it means was found, and relates to <italic>kha-zeh ish</italic> (such a one as this); in the second, it means we will find, and it relates to Pharaoh and his servants.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2266"><sup>58</sup> <italic>Yishak</italic> is a denominative of <italic>neshek</italic> (arms), and means will be armed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2267"><sup>59</sup> I.E. translates <italic>and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled</italic> as, and according unto thy word shall all my people be armed. Hence Joseph will be chief of the army.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2268"><sup>60</sup> All the people will pay homage to Joseph by kissing him on the mouth (<italic>pikha</italic>) (Filwarg). Krinsky suggests translating it, thy word shall all my people kiss. Literally, <italic>pikha</italic> means thy mouth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2269"><sup>61</sup> <italic>Egdal</italic> being intransitive refers to Pharaoh and not the throne.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2270"><sup>62</sup> Meaning, brought me up. If <italic>gedelani</italic> was transitive it would disprove I.E.&#x2019;s contention that <italic>egdal</italic> is intransitive since they are both <italic>kals</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2271"><sup>63</sup> That is, found elsewhere in Scripture with a similar meaning, i.e., meaning, with regard to (Weiser, Krinsky). Usually only a transitive verb is connected to a direct object (Weiser). Hence I.E. points out that our verse is not unique.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2272"><sup>64</sup> <italic>Novelet</italic> (fadeth) is intransitive, <italic>aleha</italic> (its leaves) is the object. I.E. renders <italic>novelet alehah</italic> as, which is withering with regards to its leaves.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2273"><sup>65</sup> <italic>Ve-tovedu</italic> (you shall perish) is intransitive. <italic>Derekh</italic> (way) is the object. According to I.E. the meaning of <italic>ve-tovenu derekh</italic> is, and you shall perish with regard to the way. Similarly the meaning of our verse is, I will be greater than you with regard to the throne (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2274"><sup>66</sup> I.E. in Ex. 25:24 writes that <italic>shesh</italic> is white linen made from a type of flax which grows in Egypt.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2276"><sup>68</sup> I.E. points out that <italic>mishneh</italic> means second in rank and <italic>shalish</italic> third in rank (Netter). <italic>Mishneh</italic> can be taken to refer to the chariot, as Rashi interprets. Hence I.E. points out that <italic>mirkevet ha-mishneh</italic> (the second chariot) is to be rendered: the chariot of the second in rank (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2277"><sup>69</sup> Some interpret <italic>mirkevet</italic> (chariot) to mean a horse or mule. Cf. Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2278"><sup>70</sup> We read in I Kings 10:29, <italic>And a chariot</italic> (merkavah) <italic>came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty</italic>. Now four times 150 gives 600. Hence each chariot had four horses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2279"><sup>71</sup> <italic>Avrekh</italic> is a first person singular. However, the verb preceding it, <italic>va-yikre</italic>&#x2019;u (and they cried), is a plural.

This is also the opinion of Kimchi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2283"><sup>75</sup> Wherein <italic>ashkem</italic> is to be interpreted as if written <italic>hashkem</italic>. I.E. quotes Jer. 25:4, <italic>sending them betimes and often</italic>.

The reference therefore must be to Jer. 25:3 (speaking betimes and often) where the word for betimes is written <italic>ashkem</italic> with an <italic>alef</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn2284"><sup>76</sup> In other words a <italic>heh</italic> has not been substituted for an <italic>alef</italic>, its meaning being: I arose and spoke (Krinsky).

<ftnote id="fn2292"><sup>84</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>kohen</italic> does not mean a priest of the Lord; it means any priest. Hence <italic>kohen on</italic> means priest of On.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2298"><sup>90</sup> <italic>Channani</italic> comes from the root <italic>chet, nun, nun</italic>. Similarly <italic>nashani</italic> comes from the root <italic>nun, shin, shin</italic>. They are both <italic>kals</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2299"><sup>91</sup> According to this opinion, <italic>nashani</italic> is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> coming from the root <italic>nun, shin, heh</italic>. Compare, <italic>tzivvani</italic> whose root is <italic>tzadi, vav, heh</italic>. The problem is that the first letter of a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> perfect is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>, and <italic>nashani</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>, hence Rabbi Moses&#x2019; explanation that a <italic>pattach</italic> has been substituted for a <italic>chirik</italic>. Thus <italic>nashani</italic> is a variant of <italic>nishani</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2304"><sup>96</sup> The Egyptians purchased the corn. Hence Joseph sold it.

I.E.&#x2019;s apparent solution to the problem is to explain that <italic>va-yishbor</italic> can apply either to the seller or to the buyer as the transfer of corn (<italic>shever</italic>) is effectuated by two individuals, the one giving (selling) the corn and the other buying it.

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 42</title>
<p>1. NOW JACOB SAW. Scripture interchanges<sup><xref rid="fn2306">1</xref></sup> the way the senses<sup><xref rid="fn2307">2</xref></sup> are referred to because they are all perceived in one central place.<sup><xref rid="fn2308">3</xref></sup> Thus Scripture says, <italic>See the smell of my son</italic> (Gen. 27:27);<sup><xref rid="fn2309">4</xref></sup> and <italic>And the light is sweet</italic> (Eccles. 11:7).<sup><xref rid="fn2310">5</xref></sup> <italic>Now Jacob saw</italic> is similar,<sup><xref rid="fn2311">6</xref></sup> for afterward Scripture states, <italic>Behold I have heard that there is corn in Egypt</italic> (v. 2).</p>
<p>WHY DO YOU LOOK ONE UPON ANOTHER. <italic>Lammah titra</italic>&#x2019;u (why do you look one upon another) means, don&#x2019;t show yourselves as having an abundance of food.<sup><xref rid="fn2312">7</xref></sup> Or it may mean, do not quarrel with each other, as in <italic>Come, let us look one another</italic> (nitra&#x2019;eh) <italic>in the face</italic> (II Chron. 25:17).<sup><xref rid="fn2313">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND BUY FOR US. <italic>Ve-shivru lanu</italic> means, and buy corn for us.<sup><xref rid="fn2314">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. HARM. Death.</p>
<p>6. THAT SOLD. <italic>Ha-mashbir</italic> (that sold) comes from the same root as <italic>shever</italic> (corn). It means the seller. It is a causative verb.<sup><xref rid="fn2315">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. BUT MADE HIMSELF STRANGE UNTO THEM. <italic>Va-yitnakker</italic> (but made himself strange) comes from the same root as <italic>nokhri</italic> (stranger). Its meaning is, he showed himself to be a stranger.</p>
<p>ROUGHLY. <italic>Kashot</italic> (roughly) is an adjective. Its meaning is rough words.<sup><xref rid="fn2316">11</xref></sup> <italic>Answereth impudent</italic> (Prov. 18:23) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2317">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE KNEW THEM. When Joseph first saw the group he recognized them as his brothers. <sup><xref rid="fn2318">13</xref></sup> He then looked at each one of them and recognized them individually. The latter is the meaning of <italic>And Joseph knew his brethren</italic> (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn2319">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. THE NAKEDNESS OF THE LAND. Nakedness is a figure of speech for shame, since it is customary to hide one&#x2019;s nakedness because of its unseemliness.<sup><xref rid="fn2320">15</xref></sup> Or nakedness refers to secrets, since one&#x2019;s nakedness is covered. Joseph thus said to them, &#x201C;You have come to learn the secrets of the land.&#x201D; I prefer the latter interpretation.</p>
<p>11. WE. <italic>Nachnu</italic> (we) is spelled without an <italic>alef</italic>. This is the correct form of the word.<sup><xref rid="fn2321">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>UPRIGHT. <italic>Kenim</italic> means truthful. It is possible that <italic>kenim</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>ken</italic> (so) in <italic>So</italic> (ken) <italic>do, as thou hast said</italic> (Gen. 18:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2322">17</xref></sup> Or <italic>kenim</italic> comes from the same root<sup><xref rid="fn2323">18</xref></sup> as <italic>ken</italic> (truth) in <italic>The daughters of Zelophehad speak right</italic> (ken) (Num. 27:7).<sup><xref rid="fn2324">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND YE SHALL BE BOUND. <italic>He&#x2019;aseru</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2325">20</xref></sup> should be rendered: ye shall be bound. It is similar to <italic>u-mot</italic> (and die) in <italic>and die in the mount</italic> (Deut. 32:50).<sup><xref rid="fn2326">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. FAMINE OF YOUR HOUSES. Needed because of the famine of your houses.<sup><xref rid="fn2327">22</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>havi&#x2019;u shever ra&#x2019;avon batekhem</italic> (carry corn for the famine of your houses) is, carry to your houses the corn needed because of the famine.<sup><xref rid="fn2328">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. VERILY. <italic>Aval</italic> (verily) has the same meaning as <italic>aval</italic> in <italic>Verily</italic> (aval) <italic>Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son</italic> (Gen. 17:19). It means verily (Gen. 28:16).<sup><xref rid="fn2329">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. THE INTERPRETER. <italic>Ha-melitz</italic> means the interpreter. It is related to <italic>melitzah</italic> (figure of speech) (Prov. 1:6).</p>
<p>Joseph imprisoned Simeon because when many sin, the oldest is punished more severely than the others. He did not punish Reuben because he (Reuben) saved him.<sup><xref rid="fn2330">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that the words <italic>zahav</italic> (gold) and <italic>kesef</italic> (silver) are never encountered in the plural.<sup><xref rid="fn2331">26</xref></sup> However, he forgot that Scripture employs the term <italic>kaspehem</italic> (money) (v. 25).<sup><xref rid="fn2332">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>[26. AND THEY LADED THEIR ASSES WITH THEIR CORN.] Which they had bought.</p>
<p>27. AND AS ONE OF THEM OPENED. <italic>Va-yiftach ha-echad</italic> means, and one of them opened. The reference is possibly to Reuben, as he was the first born. In this case <italic>ha-echad</italic> (one of them) means the first in number.<sup><xref rid="fn2333">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. THE FAMINE OF YOUR HOUSES. Needed for the famine that is in your houses.<sup><xref rid="fn2334">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. ALL THESE THINGS. AU these troubles.</p>
<p>[37. THOU SHALT SLAY.] Some say that <italic>thou shalt slay</italic> means thou shalt punish.<sup><xref rid="fn2335">30</xref></sup> Others say that this was a prayer to God.<sup><xref rid="fn2336">31</xref></sup> The sum of the matter is this, if Reuben would have spoken correctly Jacob would not have ignored him.<sup><xref rid="fn2337">32</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2306"><sup>1</sup> Scripture occasionally uses hear for see and see for smell.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2307"><sup>2</sup> The five senses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2308"><sup>3</sup> I.E. in his commentary on Eccles. 11:7 says that there is a place on the forehead where the senses are perceived.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2309"><sup>4</sup> Rather than smell the smell of my son.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2310"><sup>5</sup> Even though light cannot be tasted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2311"><sup>6</sup> Now Jacob saw means, now Jacob heard.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2312"><sup>7</sup> Cf. Rashi, &#x201C;Why do you show yourselves before the children of Ishmael and the children of Esau as having plenty to eat?&#x201D; Why do you show yourselves is thus short for, why do you show yourselves as having an abundance of food.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2313"><sup>8</sup> I.E. translates <italic>nitra&#x2019;eh</italic> in II Chron. 25:17 as fight. Thus the root <italic>resh, alef, heh</italic> which usually means to see, at times also means to fight or quarrel. Hence <italic>titra</italic>&#x2019;u is similar to <italic>nitra&#x2019;eh</italic>, i.e., it means to quarrel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2314"><sup>9</sup> I.E. notes that <italic>shivru</italic> means to buy grain. He points this out because in Gen. 41:56 it means to sell grain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2315"><sup>10</sup> That is, it is a <italic>hifil</italic>. He caused the wheat to be sold (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2316"><sup>11</sup> The word &#x201C;words&#x201D; has to be added to the text Thus rough (<italic>kashot</italic>) is short for rough words (Weiser). The Hebrew literally reads: and spoke rough (<italic>kashot</italic>) with them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2317"><sup>12</sup> Here, too, the word &#x201C;words&#x201D; is missing in the Hebrew. The verse should be understood as if written, answereth impudent words.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2318"><sup>13</sup> This is the meaning of <italic>and he knew them</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2319"><sup>14</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>And He knew them</italic>. Verse 8 states, <italic>And Joseph knew his brethren</italic>. I.E. interprets our verse as referring to the brothers as a group and verse 8 to each individual brother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2320"><sup>15</sup> Nakedness thus means shame. Weiser takes I.E.&#x2019;s comment at face value and explains that shame refers to the shame of the country. Cherez explains that shame refers to the areas of the country open to invasion. Be that as it may, according to this interpretation, the nakedness of the land means the shame of the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2321"><sup>16</sup> According to I.E. <italic>nachnu</italic> is primary, <italic>anachnu</italic> secondary, as the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>anachnu</italic> is superfluous (Filwarg, Weiser, Cherez). Cf. I.E. on Lam. 3:42.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2322"><sup>17</sup> The meaning of <italic>kenim anachnu</italic> (we are upright men) is we are so, we are as we appear, that is, people who came to buy grain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2323"><sup>18</sup> &#x201C;Comes from the same root&#x201D; means akin to or the same.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2324"><sup>19</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>kenim anachnu</italic> means, we are truthful men.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2325"><sup>20</sup> <italic>He&#x2019;aseru</italic> is an imperative meaning bind yourselves. Now one cannot bind oneself, that is, put oneself in prison (Krinsky). Also, Simeon was bound, he did not bind himself (Filwarg). Hence I.E. points out that even though <italic>he&#x2019;aseru</italic> is an imperative, here it has the meaning of an imperfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2326"><sup>21</sup> <italic>Die</italic> is an imperative, but it has the meaning of an imperfect; i.e., it means you will die. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 1:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2327"><sup>22</sup> The verse literally reads, <italic>shever ra&#x2019;avon</italic> (com famine). This makes no sense, so I.E. interprets, com because of the famine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2328"><sup>23</sup> The verse literally reads, <italic>havi&#x2019;u shever ra&#x2019;avon batekhem</italic> (carry com famine your houses). I.E. says that <italic>havi</italic>&#x2019;u (carry) is to be connected to <italic>batekhem</italic> (your houses). Thus the meaning of the clause is: carry to your houses the com needed because of the famine (Krinsky, Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2329"><sup>24</sup> The word <italic>aval</italic> also means but, however. Hence I.E. points out that here it means verily.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2330"><sup>25</sup> Reuben was the eldest. However, he saved Jospeh and Joseph had no reason to imprison him. Hence he punished Simeon who was second to the eldest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2331"><sup>26</sup> The reference must be to Scripture since we find plurals for gold and silver in Rabbinic literature. See <italic>Baba Metzia</italic> 42a; <italic>Shemot Rabbah</italic> 35.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2332"><sup>27</sup> The singular would be <italic>kaspam</italic> (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2333"><sup>28</sup> The term one (<italic>ha-echad</italic>) has the definite article prefixed to it. Thus it means the number one or the first one, that is, the eldest. If Scripture had meant one of them, it would have read <italic>echad</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2334"><sup>29</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on verse 19 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2335"><sup>30</sup> <italic>Thou shalt slay</italic> is hyperbolic. Reuben did not expect Jacob to kill his grandchildren.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2336"><sup>31</sup> Reuben directed the words <italic>Thou shalt slay</italic> to God, as if to say, Lord strike my sons dead <italic>if I bring not him to thee</italic> (to Jacob). This interpretation, too, seeks to get around the problem of Reuben telling his father to kill his grandchildren if he fails to return Benjamin safely.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2337"><sup>32</sup> Had Reuben made sense, Jacob would have responded affirmatively to him (Weiser). Or we should render, if Reuben had spoken correctly then Jacob would not have shushed him by saying, <italic>My son shall not go down with you</italic> (Krinsky).</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 43</title>
<p>8. BOTH WE. It is Hebrew style to add <italic>gam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2338">1</xref></sup> (also) even to the first of a series of items.<sup><xref rid="fn2339">2</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Rule over us, also</italic> (gam) <italic>thou, also</italic> (gam) <italic>thy son, also</italic> (gam) <italic>thy son&#x2019;s son</italic> (Jud. 8:22).</p>
<p>11. DO THIS. Do according to the following counsel.<sup><xref rid="fn2340">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF THE CHOICE FRUITS OF THE LAND. <italic>Zimrat</italic> (choice fruits) refers to all types of praiseworthy things. It comes from the same root as <italic>zemirot</italic> (songs) (Is. 24:16).<sup><xref rid="fn2341">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>BALM AND&#x2026;SPICERY. I have previously explained these terms.<sup><xref rid="fn2342">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>NUTS. <italic>Batenim</italic> does not appear elsewhere in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2343">6</xref></sup> Some say it means nuts.</p>
<p>12. DOUBLE. <italic>Mishneh</italic> means second.<sup><xref rid="fn2344">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>OVERSIGHT. <italic>Mishgeh</italic> (oversight) is a noun whose third root letter is a <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2345">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. [AND GOD ALMIGHTY.] This phrase means the one who has the power to do all these things.</p>
<p>IF I BE BEREAVED. As I was bereaved by the death of Joseph, I think that I will be bereaved of all my children.<sup><xref rid="fn2346">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. THAT HE MAY SEEK OCCASION AGAINST US. <italic>Le-hitgolel</italic> (that he may seek occasion) comes from the same root as <italic>bi-gelal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2347">10</xref></sup> in <italic>that for</italic> (bi-gelel) <italic>this thing</italic> (Deut. 15:10).</p>
<p>AND FALL UPON US. As a man falls intentionally upon another and then says you tripped me.<sup><xref rid="fn2348">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. OH. <italic>Bi adoni</italic> (Oh, my lord) is a supplicatory expression. I believe it is an abridged statement. It is like, <italic>bi ani adoni he-avon</italic> (upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity) (I Sam. 25:24). <italic>Avon</italic> (iniquity) here<sup><xref rid="fn2349">12</xref></sup> has the same meaning as <italic>avon</italic> in <italic>My iniquity</italic> (avoni) <italic>is greater than I can bear</italic> (Gen. 4:13).<sup><xref rid="fn2350">13</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>bi adoni he-avon</italic> is, do to me as you wish but first listen to me.</p>
<p>23. HATH GIVEN YOU TREASURE IN YOUR SACKS. It is possible that someone had a treasure in his house, hid it among the wheat in his storehouse and then forgot about it, and it was placed in your sacks by chance.<sup><xref rid="fn2351">14</xref></sup> This must be the case because I have your money.</p>
<p>24. INTO JOSEPH&#x2019;S HOUSE. The <italic>heh</italic> at the end of <italic>betah</italic> (into the house of) means to. The latter is Hebrew style.<sup><xref rid="fn2352">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. IS YOUR FATHER WELL, THE OLD MAN. Our verse has a noun (<italic>shalom</italic>) in place of an adjective (<italic>shalem</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2353">16</xref></sup> It is abridged, and should be read as if written, <italic>ha-shalom la-avikhem</italic> (is your father in peace). <italic>Ve-attah shalom</italic> (and peace be unto thee) (I Sam. 25:6) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2354">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AND THEY BOWED THE HEAD. <italic>Va-yikkedu</italic> (and they bowed the head) means, and they placed their head to the ground. Thus <italic>va-yishtachavu</italic> (and made obeisance) means, and they had bowed.<sup><xref rid="fn2355">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. GOD BE GRACIOUS UNTO THEE. <italic>Yochnekhah</italic> (be gracious unto thee) does not fit into any paradigm.<sup><xref rid="fn2356">19</xref></sup> Perhaps it differs from the usual paradigms because of the <italic>chet</italic> which is a guttural.<sup><xref rid="fn2357">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. YEARNED. <italic>Nikhmeru</italic> (yearned) means burned and inflamed, as does <italic>nikhmeru</italic> (hot) in <italic>our skin is hot</italic> (nikhmoru) <italic>like an oven</italic> (Lam. 5:10).</p>
<p>34. AND PORTIONS WERE TAKEN. <italic>Masot</italic> (portions) means gifts.<sup><xref rid="fn2358">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>TIMES. <italic>Yadot</italic> (times) means portions.</p>
<p>AS ANY OF THEIRS. Benjamin&#x2019;s gifts were five times as great as the gift of any one of the brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn2359">22</xref></sup> It is far-fetched to believe that Joseph gave Benjamin five gifts for every gift that he gave to each one of his brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn2360">23</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2338"><sup>1</sup> The Hebrew literally reads: <italic>gam anachnu</italic> (also we), <italic>gam attah</italic> (also you), <italic>gam tappenu</italic> (also our little ones).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2339"><sup>2</sup> <italic>Gam</italic> means also. Hence it does not belong before the first of a series of items. Nevertheless, it is Hebrew style to place <italic>gam</italic> before the first particular in a series for purposes of emphasis (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2340"><sup>3</sup> <italic>Zot</italic> (this) is feminine. The question thus arises, why did Jacob use the feminine <italic>zot asu</italic> (do this) rather than the masculine <italic>zeh asu</italic>? I.E.&#x2019;s solution is that the word <italic>zot</italic> refers to <italic>etzah</italic> (council) which is feminine. It should be noted that <italic>etzah</italic> is not in the Biblical text (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2341"><sup>4</sup> Things that one sings about, things that one praises. Krinsky explains I.E. as meaning the choicest fruits because of which the land is praised.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2342"><sup>5</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 37:25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2343"><sup>6</sup> Hence we cannot be sure what it means.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2344"><sup>7</sup> In addition to the money that you are returning, bring a second sum of money for the purchase of new food (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2345"><sup>8</sup> Its root is <italic>shin, gimel, heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2346"><sup>9</sup> According to Krinsky. The verse reads, <italic>va-ani ka&#x2019;asher shakholti shakholti</italic>. The literal translation of the latter is, and as for me, as I was bereaved (<italic>shakholti</italic>), I was bereaved. I.E. explains that the second <italic>shakholti</italic> although a perfect, is to be rendered as an imperfect Thus our verse reads, and as for me, as I was bereaved, so will I be (I think I will be, I fear I will be) bereaved. He explains it to mean: as I was bereaved of Joseph, I now fear that I will be bereaved of all my children. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s commentary on Es. 4:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2347"><sup>10</sup> Hence it is similar in meaning to it He is seeking a cause, a reason.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2348"><sup>11</sup> That is, he is seeking to blame us for something we are not guilty of.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2349"><sup>12</sup> &#x201C;Here&#x201D; refers to I Sam. 25:24 and by extension to our verse which is short for <italic>bi adoni he-avon</italic> (Filwarg). Or &#x201C;here&#x201D; refers to our verse in which the word <italic>avon</italic> is to be inserted (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2350"><sup>13</sup> Where <italic>avon</italic> (iniquity) means punishment. Cf. I.E. comments on Gen. 4:13. Thus <italic>bi adoni he-avon</italic> means, upon my lord be the punishment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2352"><sup>15</sup> A <italic>heh</italic> suffixed to a noun has the same meaning as the preposition <italic>el</italic> (to) placed before it. Hence <italic>betah yosef</italic> means into Joseph&#x2019;s house.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2353"><sup>16</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>ha-shalom avikhem</italic> (is your father well). I.E. argues that according to the rule of Hebrew grammar the Bible should have read; <italic>ha-shalem avikhem</italic> and not <italic>ha-shalom avikhem</italic> since the former means, is your father well (<italic>shalem</italic>) while the latter means, is your father peace (<italic>shalom</italic>), an impossible statement. His solution is to suggest that <italic>ha-shalom avikhem</italic> is short for <italic>ha-shalom la avikhem</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2354"><sup>17</sup> I Sam. 25:6 reads, <italic>ve-attah shalom</italic>. According to I.E. it should have read, <italic>ve-attah shalem</italic> (and thou art well) since <italic>shalem</italic> is an adjective while <italic>shalom</italic> is a noun. Hence here, too, the verse is abridged and should be read as if written <italic>ve-attah shalom lekha</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2355"><sup>18</sup> Scripture reads, <italic>va-yikkedu, va-yishtachavu</italic>. I.E. interprets <italic>va-yishtachavu</italic> as a pluperfect, they had bowed, since the bowing obviously preceded the placing of the head on the ground.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2356"><sup>19</sup> The word comes from <italic>chet, nun, nun</italic>. Had it followed the paradigm of Hebrew double <italic>ayin</italic> roots, it would have been written <italic>yechannekha</italic>; compare, <italic>yechannenu</italic> in Ps. 67:2 (Krinsky, Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2357"><sup>20</sup> To simplify its enunciation the <italic>kamatz</italic> was transferred from the <italic>chet</italic> to the <italic>yod</italic> and the <italic>dagesh</italic> dropped from the <italic>nun</italic> (Krinsky).</ftnote>

<p>2. MY GOBLET. <italic>Gavi</italic>&#x2019;a (goblet) means a cup.</p>
<p>5. AND WHEREBY HE INDEED DIVINETH. He used this cup to test you to see if you are thieves.<sup><xref rid="fn2361">1</xref></sup> <italic>Nachesh</italic> (divineth) in our verse is similar to <italic>nichashti</italic> (I have observed the signs) (Gen. 30:27).<sup><xref rid="fn2362">2</xref></sup> This is also the explanation of <italic>know ye not that such a man as I will indeed divine</italic> (v. 15).<sup><xref rid="fn2363">3</xref></sup> Its meaning is, why were you not afraid to steal my goblet? I placed the goblet before you to test you. I looked aside and you stole it.<sup><xref rid="fn2364">4</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Jonah says that <italic>bo</italic> (whereby) means for it. He interprets <italic>nachesh yenachesh bo</italic> as: he would indeed inquire of diviners for it. Similarly the meaning of <italic>I will indeed divine</italic> (v. 15) is: a man in my position has diviners. Some say that the cup had designs on it and that Joseph looked at the cup in the presence of his brothers and announced which of them was the oldest and which one was born next.<sup><xref rid="fn2365">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. [CLEAR OURSELVES.] There is a <italic>tet</italic> in place of the <italic>tav</italic> of the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic> conjugation in the word <italic>nitztaddak</italic> (clear ourselves) because the first root letter is a <italic>tzadi</italic>.</p>
<p>GOD HAS FOUND OUT THE INIQUITY OF THY SERVANTS. They spoke by way of parable.<sup><xref rid="fn2366">6</xref></sup> We committed a sin and it was, as it were, lost and long forgotten, but found today. Or <italic>the iniquity of thy servants</italic> means the punishment of thy servants, as in <italic>My iniquity is greater than I can bear</italic> (Gen. 4:13).<sup><xref rid="fn2367">7</xref></sup></p>
<h1>VA-YIGGASH</h1>
<p>18. FOR THOU ART EVEN AS PHARAOH. <italic>Ki kha-mokha ke-faro</italic> means: thou art as the king<sup><xref rid="fn2368">8</xref></sup> and the king is as you. This is true in all instances where two <italic>cafs</italic> are prefixed to two words following each other.<sup><xref rid="fn2369">9</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ke-ammi khe-ammekha</italic> (my people as thy people) (II Kings 3:7).<sup><xref rid="fn2370">10</xref></sup> The use of two <italic>cafs</italic> in this manner is an abridged form.<sup><xref rid="fn2371">11</xref></sup></p>

<p>28. SURELY HE IS TORN IN PIECES. Proof of which is, <italic>And I have not seen him since</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2361"><sup>1</sup> According to I.E. divineth means tested.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2362"><sup>2</sup> However, in Gen. 30:27 I.E. explains <italic>nichashti</italic> to mean divines. Weiser explains I.E.&#x2019;s comment on our verse as meaning tested by divination. However, this is not what I.E. seems to be saying. I.E. was apparently inconsistent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2363"><sup>3</sup> That is, a man such as I will test you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2364"><sup>4</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>bo</italic> in <italic>ve-hu nachesh yenachesh bo</italic> (and whereby he indeed divineth) means whereby, the meaning of the aforementioned being, and whereby he indeed tests.</ftnote>

The point being <italic>and whereby he divineth</italic> and <italic>I will indeed divine</italic> are to be taken literally. Joseph, of course, did not practice magic. However, his servants and his brothers had no way of knowing this. Also according to this interpretation <italic>bo</italic> means whereby.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2366"><sup>6</sup> Found implies that God was unaware of the sin till the present, and he now found it. However, nothing is hidden from the Lord. Hence <italic>God found</italic> is God, as it were, found (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2367"><sup>7</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 4:13. I.E. points out that iniquity (<italic>avon</italic>) at times has the meaning of punishment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2372"><sup>12</sup> Joseph was at this time 39 years old (see I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 37:3 and the notes thereto), and he was six years younger than Reuben since he was born in the 14th year of Jacob&#x2019;s stay in Laban&#x2019;s house while Reuben was born in the eighth year of that same stay. Reuben was thus 45 at this time.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2373"><sup>13</sup> <italic>That I may set my eyes upon him</italic> may be interpreted to mean, that I will take care of him, as in Jer. 24:6 and 39:12, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. See also Nahmanides.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2374"><sup>14</sup> Our text literally reads: For if he should leave his father, &#x201C;he&#x201D; would die. The &#x201C;he&#x201D; is vague. The Talmudic sage Isi ben Judah (<italic>Yoma</italic> 92a,b) lists five verses wherein it is impossible to determine concerning what or of whom the verse speaks. Our verse and Ruth 4:8 are not included. I.E. asks, why not. It should be noted that according to Nahmanides&#x2019; reading, I.E. explains that the &#x201C;he&#x201D; in <italic>he would die</italic> refers to Jacob. In that case I.E. only questions why Ruth 4:8 is not included in Isi ben Judah&#x2019;s list.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2375"><sup>15</sup> It isn&#x2019;t clear whether the &#x201C;he&#x201D; in <italic>And he drew off his shoe</italic> refers to Boaz or the near kinsman.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 45</title>
<p>1. REFRAIN HIMSELF. <italic>Le-hitappek</italic> (refrain himself) means to bear.</p>
<p>BEFORE ALL THEM THAT STOOD BY HIM. Its meaning is, until all that stood by him left. Joseph was therefore compelled to call and have them withdrawn.<sup><xref rid="fn2376">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND HE WEPT ALOUD. The word reads <italic>bi-vechi</italic> (wept) even though it is a pausal.<sup><xref rid="fn2377">2</xref></sup> <italic>Oni</italic> (affliction) in <italic>I am the man that hath seen affliction</italic> (oni) (Lam. 3:1) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2378">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. BUT GOD. Sent me.</p>
<p>A FATHER. A teacher. Father in <italic>he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe</italic> (Gen. 4:21) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2379">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. LEST THOU COME TO POVERTY. <italic>Tivvaresh</italic> (come to poverty) means thou be cut off. <italic>Le-horish</italic> in <italic>to drive out</italic> (le-horish) <italic>nations</italic> (Deut. 4:38) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2380">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THAT IT IS MY MOUTH. It is well known that <italic>peh</italic> (mouth) spelled <italic>peh, heh</italic> is in the absolute. However, when it appears in the construct the silent <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2381">6</xref></sup> changes to a silent <italic>yod</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2382">7</xref></sup> as in <italic>The mouth of</italic> (pi) <italic>the righteous</italic> (Ps. 37:30). The same form (<italic>pi</italic>) is also used for the plural, as in <italic>But the mouth</italic> (pi) <italic>of the wicked</italic> (Prov. 10:11).<sup><xref rid="fn2383">8</xref></sup> Now when the <italic>yod</italic> that takes the place of the <italic>heh</italic> comes together with the <italic>yod</italic> of the first person pronominal suffix, one of the <italic>yods</italic> is dropped,<sup><xref rid="fn2384">9</xref></sup> as in <italic>my mouth</italic> (fi) <italic>that speaketh</italic>. The meaning of <italic>my mouth that speaketh unto you</italic> is: I speak directly to you in Hebrew without the use of an interpreter.</p>
<p>14. NECK. Scripture employs both the plural and singular forms for the neck.<sup><xref rid="fn2385">10</xref></sup> We also find the word for neck spelled with a <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2386">11</xref></sup> However, its <italic>alef</italic> is never dropped.<sup><xref rid="fn2387">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. LADE. <italic>Ta&#x2019;anu</italic> means load. The word <italic>meto&#x2019;ane</italic> in <italic>thrust through</italic> (meto&#x2019;ane) <italic>with the sword</italic> (Is. 14:19) is close in meaning to it.<sup><xref rid="fn2388">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>BEASTS. <italic>Be&#x2019;irekhem</italic> means your cattle. <italic>Be&#x2019;irenu</italic> in <italic>we and our cattle</italic> (u-ve-irenu) (Num. 20:4) is similar.</p>
<p>18. THE FAT OF THE LAND. Its meaning is <italic>shuman ha&#x2019;aretz</italic> (fat of the land).<sup><xref rid="fn2389">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. CHANGES OF RAIMENT. Two garments, each different from the other, two being the minimum for a plural.<sup><xref rid="fn2390">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. [IN LIKE MANNER.] That is, of the finest changes of raiment<sup><xref rid="fn2391">16</xref></sup> that were found in Egypt.</p>
<p>CORN. <italic>Bar</italic> (corn) means grain.</p>
<p>AND BREAD. That is to be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn2392">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND VICTUAL. The term <italic>mazon</italic> (victual) refers to peas, beans, lentils, millet, spelt, figs, raisins and dates, for only these, excluding wheat<sup><xref rid="fn2393">18</xref></sup> and barley, are termed <italic>mazon</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2394">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. [SEE THAT YE FALL NOT OUT BY THE WAY.] Don&#x2019;t be angry with each other because of my being sold into slavery.<sup><xref rid="fn2395">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. AND HIS HEART FAINTED. <italic>Va-yafag</italic> (fainted) comes from the same root as <italic>fugat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2396">21</xref></sup> in <italic>Give thyself no respite</italic> (fugat) (Lam. 2:18). It means his heart stopped and was still. It has the same meaning as <italic>and his heart died within him</italic> (I Sam. 25:37). Jacob reacted in this manner because he didn&#x2019;t believe them.<sup><xref rid="fn2397">22</xref></sup> However, when he saw the wagons, his spirit revived. Do not be surprised at the term <italic>his heart stopped</italic> for it is the style of the prophets to speak in hyperbole. Compare, <italic>neither was there breath left in me</italic> (Dan. 10:17).</p>
<p>28. IT IS ENOUGH; JOSEPH MY SON IS YET ALIVE. This happiness is enough for me.<sup><xref rid="fn2398">23</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2376"><sup>1</sup> Joseph could not bear to wait until all those in his presence left. He therefore had the hall cleared.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2377"><sup>2</sup> In such cases the word is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic> beneath the first <italic>bet</italic> and a <italic>segol</italic> beneath the second <italic>bet</italic>. Our word is vocalized <italic>chirik, sheva</italic> (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2378"><sup>3</sup> <italic>Oni</italic> in Lam. 3:1 is vocalized with a <italic>chataf kamatz</italic> even though it is a pausal. At such times the word is usually vocalized with a <italic>cholam</italic>. Cf. Deut. 16:3. We thus see that Scripture occasionally vocalizes a pausal as a non pausal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2379"><sup>4</sup> Jubal obviously was not the biological father of all harp and pipe players.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2380"><sup>5</sup> The point is that the root <italic>yod, resh, shin</italic>, which usually means to inherit, can also mean to cut off, to destroy. I.E. renders Deut. 4:38 to destroy nations. He renders our verse, lest thou be destroyed (cut off).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2381"><sup>6</sup> The <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>peh</italic> is not sounded.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2382"><sup>7</sup> <italic>Peh</italic> becomes <italic>pi</italic> (my mouth) or <italic>fi</italic> when the rules of grammar call for the omission of the <italic>dagesh</italic>. I.E. refers to the <italic>yod</italic> following a <italic>chirik</italic> as a silent <italic>yod</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2383"><sup>8</sup> <italic>Resha&#x2019;im</italic> (wicked) is in the plural. Thus the <italic>mouth of the wicked</italic> should be rendered, the mouths of the wicked men (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2384"><sup>9</sup> My mouth should be written <italic>peh, yod, yod</italic>, one <italic>yod</italic> serving as the first person pronominal suffix and the other substituting for the <italic>heh</italic>. However, one <italic>yod</italic> is dropped to simplify enunciation. Thus <italic>pi</italic> can mean either my mouth or mouth of.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2385"><sup>10</sup> The singular of neck is <italic>tzavvar</italic>. Cf. Is. 8:8 and Jer. 28:10; <italic>tzavvare</italic> is a plural. However, the plural is occasionally also used for the singular when this noun is employed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2386"><sup>11</sup> Cf. <italic>tzavveronayikh</italic> (thy neck) in Cant. 4:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2387"><sup>12</sup> According to Weiser. The problem is that there is no <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>tzavveronayikh</italic>. Filwarg suggests that in I.E.&#x2019;s copy of the Bible <italic>tzavveronayikh</italic> had an <italic>alef</italic>. Also, Kimchi in his book of roots says that <italic>tzavveronayikh</italic> is spelled with an <italic>alef</italic>. Weiser suggests that what I.E. means is that <italic>tzavveronayikh</italic> should have been written with an <italic>alef</italic> but for some reason it was dropped.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2388"><sup>13</sup> I.E. renders this, laden with wounds of the sword (Krinsky). It is noteworthy that in Isaiah, I.E. says that it is farfetched to connect <italic>ta&#x2019;anu</italic> to <italic>meto&#x2019;ane</italic>; therefore he connects <italic>meto&#x2019;ane</italic> with an Arabic word meaning pierced.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2389"><sup>14</sup> What I.E. apparently intends to say is that since the choicest part of an animal is its <italic>shuman</italic> (fat), it follows that the <italic>fat of the land</italic> is a metaphor for the best of the land (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2390"><sup>15</sup> <italic>Chalifot semalot</italic> (changes of raiment) is in the plural. The minimum of the plural is two. Hence two garments are implied. Had Scripture intended more than two their number would have been listed, as in the case of Benjamin. <italic>Chalifot</italic> (changes) implies each garment was different from the other. He didn&#x2019;t give them two identical garments (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2391"><sup>16</sup> <italic>Ke-zot</italic> (in like manner) not only applies to what follows but also to what comes before, viz., garments (Weiser). Or <italic>ke-zot</italic> applies only to what comes before; i.e., the verse is to be understood: And to his father he sent in like manner ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, viz., the finest changes of raiment that were found in Egypt (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2392"><sup>17</sup> <italic>Lechem</italic> (bread) can mean food, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2393"><sup>18</sup> I.E. reads <italic>dagan</italic> (grain) but he means wheat (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2394"><sup>19</sup> Wheat and barley are not deemed <italic>mazon</italic> but <italic>bar</italic> (Krinsky, Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2395"><sup>20</sup> I.E. renders <italic>tirgizu</italic> (fall out) as be angry (Cherez); i.e., don&#x2019;t be angry and thus quarrel with each other, the idea being, don&#x2019;t be angry that you sold me and thus quarrel with each other about who was responsible. It should be noted that in Ps. 4:5 I.E. renders <italic>rigzu</italic> as fear.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2396"><sup>21</sup> That is, stop.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2397"><sup>22</sup> Jacob reacted in this manner because what his sons said reminded him that Joseph was dead.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2398"><sup>23</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>Enough, Joseph my son is yet alive</italic>. I.E. suggests that enough is short for &#x201C;this happiness is enough for me&#x201D; (Weiser). What Jacob was saying was, I am not concerned with the fact that he is a ruler over Egypt; the fact that he is alive is joy enough for me (Krinsky). Cherez suggests rendering I.E., I have great happiness since Joseph is yet alive.</ftnote>

<p>3. TO GO DOWN. <italic>Me-redah</italic> (to go down) is an infinitive. Its first root letter is missing.<sup><xref rid="fn2399">1</xref></sup> <italic>Me-redah</italic> is similar to <italic>tenah</italic> in <italic>Whose majesty is rehearsed</italic> (tenah) <italic>above the heavens</italic> (Ps. 8:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2400">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. [AND I WILL ALSO SURELY BRING THEE UP AGAIN.] This means you will be buried in the land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2401">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND JOSEPH SHALL PUT HIS HAND UPON THINE EYES. At the time of your death. It is customary for the living to close the eyes of the deceased upon their death.</p>
<p>7. HIS DAUGHTERS. This refers only to Dinah.<sup><xref rid="fn2402">4</xref></sup> It is possible that Dinah had maid servants of her own age who grew up with her in Jacob&#x2019;s house and who because of Dinah are called Jacob&#x2019;s daughters. Jacob&#x2019;s &#x201C;daughters&#x201D; can be compared to Michal&#x2019;s &#x201C;children&#x201D; (II Sam. 21:8).<sup><xref rid="fn2403">5</xref></sup> The same interpretation is to be given to <italic>and his sons&#x2019; daughters</italic> since Jacob had only one granddaughter.<sup><xref rid="fn2404">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. THE SON OF A CANAANITISH WOMAN. This proves that Jacob&#x2019;s sons married Aramean, Egyptian, Edomite and Midianite women.<sup><xref rid="fn2405">7</xref></sup> Shaul&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s nationality is singled out in order to indicate that Simeon did wrong in marrying a Canaanitish woman. It is for this reason that Scripture records the death of Er and Onan (v. 12). Scripture records their demise in order to indicate that they died because they were the sons of a Canaanitish woman (Gen. 38:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2406">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND NAAMAN. This Naaman was a son of Benjamin. I note this because Benjamin also had a grandson called Naaman (Num. 26:40).</p>
<p>23. AND THE SONS OF DAN: HUSHIM. It is possible that Dan had two sons and one of them died and Scripture did not mention him.<sup><xref rid="fn2407">9</xref></sup> It is also possible that the verse employs &#x201C;sons&#x201D; for stylistic reasons.<sup><xref rid="fn2408">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>[27. ALL THE SOULS OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB, THAT CAME INTO EGYPT, WERE THREESCORE AND TEN.] An exegate says that <italic>three score and ten</italic> is a round number, since in fact they numbered sixty-nine.<sup><xref rid="fn2409">11</xref></sup> However, this commentator erred, since we find Scripture stating, with regard to Leah&#x2019;s offspring who numbered thirty-two, <italic>all the souls of his sons and daughters were thirty and three</italic> (v. 15). <sup><xref rid="fn2410">12</xref></sup> The Midrash tries to solve the problem by saying that Jochebed was born between the ramparts when they entered Egypt. <sup><xref rid="fn2411">13</xref></sup> However, this, too, presents a problem, viz., why doesn&#x2019;t Scripture record the great wonder of Jochebed giving birth to Moses when she was one hundred and thirty years old?<sup><xref rid="fn2412">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, why does Scripture note that Sarah was ninety when she bore a son?<sup><xref rid="fn2413">15</xref></sup> And as if we didn&#x2019;t have enough problems with the above, the liturgical poets composed a hymn for Simchat Torah reading, <italic>Jochebed my mother will be comforted after me</italic> thereby indicating that Jochebed was two hundred and fifty years old at the time of Moses&#x2019; death.<sup><xref rid="fn2414">16</xref></sup> As to the Midrash which states that Ahijah the Shilonite lived for hundreds of years,<sup><xref rid="fn2415">17</xref></sup> it is an aggadic statement or an individual opinion.<sup><xref rid="fn2416">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that the way to solve our problem is by recognizing the fact that the Bible includes Jacob among the seventy who came into Egypt and starts the count of the seventy from him. The verse (15) is to be interpreted as if it read: all the souls of his sons and his daughters plus himself were thirty-three. Proof that this is the way to interpret this verse is that Scripture previously states, <italic>And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons</italic> (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn2417">19</xref></sup> Should one argue and say, &#x201C;Does not Scripture explicitly state, <italic>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls</italic> (Ex. 1:5)?<sup><xref rid="fn2418">20</xref></sup> Know that Scripture isn&#x2019;t concerned with noting that one of the seventy did not come from Jacob&#x2019;s loins, as it didn&#x2019;t bother to leave out Benjamin when it said, <italic>These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram</italic> (Gen. 35:26), even though Benjamin was not born there. We have two proofs in our own Torah portion that this is the style of Scripture. First, the Pentateuch states, <italic>And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons</italic> (v. 8). The Torah thus includes Jacob among the sons of Israel. It does so because Scripture speaks of the majority of those who came to Egypt. Secondly, Scripture states, <italic>all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were three score and ten</italic> (Gen. 46:27). However, Manasseh and Ephraim did not come into Egypt, they were there to begin with, having been born in Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2419">21</xref></sup> In the same vein another verse<sup><xref rid="fn2420">22</xref></sup> reads, <italic>Thy fathers went down into Egypt with three score and ten souls</italic> (Deut. 10:22).<sup><xref rid="fn2421">23</xref></sup> However, as noted, Manasseh and Ephraim did not go down to Egypt. This verse<sup><xref rid="fn2422">24</xref></sup> is also proof that Jacob is counted among the seventy, for he had a soul<sup><xref rid="fn2423">25</xref></sup> and he was the most important of them all.<sup><xref rid="fn2424">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND JOSEPH MADE READY HIS CHARIOT. Joseph commanded it ready.<sup><xref rid="fn2425">27</xref></sup> <italic>So Solomon built the house, and finished it</italic> (I Kings 6:14),<sup><xref rid="fn2426">28</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>34. FOR EVERY SHEPHERD IS AN ABOMINATION UNTO THE EGYPTIANS. This verse shows that in those days the Egyptians did not eat meat and they did not permit anyone to slaughter sheep. This is still the custom among the Indians. The Egyptians considered shepherds an abomination because they drank milk.<sup><xref rid="fn2427">29</xref></sup> The people of India until this very day do not eat or drink anything derived from a living creature.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2399"><sup>1</sup> <italic>Me-redah</italic> is made up of the infinitive <italic>redah</italic> (go down) plus the prepositional <italic>mem</italic>. The root of <italic>redah</italic> is <italic>yod, resh, dalet</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2400"><sup>2</sup> The root of <italic>tenah</italic> is <italic>nun, tet, nun</italic>. Both <italic>redah</italic> (whose <italic>yod</italic> is missing) and <italic>tenah</italic> (whose <italic>nun</italic> is missing) are infinitives whose first root letters are missing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2401"><sup>3</sup> Jacob never came back from Egypt. Hence I.E. interprets our verse as referring to Jacob&#x2019;s body.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2402"><sup>4</sup> Jacob had no other daughters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2403"><sup>5</sup> Michal&#x2019;s &#x201C;children&#x201D; were in fact the children of Merab. Scripture refers to them as Michal&#x2019;s children because she raised them.

<ftnote id="fn2404"><sup>6</sup> Serah, the daughter of Asher (v. 17). There, too, &#x201C;daughters&#x201D; refers to the maid-servants who grew up with her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2405"><sup>7</sup> The fact that Scripture singles out Shaul as being the son of a Canaanitish woman indicates that only he was the son of a Canaanitish woman, but not the others mentioned here. That Simeon did wrong in marrying her is obvious since Abraham told his servant not to take a Canaanitish woman for Isaac, and Isaac told the same to Jacob.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2406"><sup>8</sup> The Canaanite women were evil. Er and Onan followed in their mother&#x2019;s footsteps and were punished by God. Scripture thus mentions their death as an object lesson (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2407"><sup>9</sup> Scripture says &#x201C;sons&#x201D; but lists only one son, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2408"><sup>10</sup> Since Scripture used <italic>sons of</italic> with regard to the other children, it employs the same form here for the sake of consistency (Weiser). Nahmanides (v. 7) writes, &#x201C;It is Biblical style to refer to an individual in the plural form when mentioning the genealogy of any people. For example, <italic>And the sons of Dan: Hushim</italic>; (Gen. 46:23) <italic>And of the sons of Palu: Eliab</italic> (Num. 26:8).&#x201D; This is apparently what I.E. had in mind (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2409"><sup>11</sup> The names of Jacob&#x2019;s descendants listed in our chapter come to 69, not 70.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2410"><sup>12</sup> Verses 8-14 list the children of Leah and their offspring. Thirty-two individuals are listed by name. However, in giving their total Scripture says they were thirty-three. Now 70 is a round number with regard to 69. However, 33 is not a round number with regard to 32. It should be noted that it is the one person missing from the list of Leah&#x2019;s offspring that is missing from our list of 70; i.e., if Leah&#x2019;s thirty-three were listed here, we would have 70.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2411"><sup>13</sup> <italic>Baba Batra</italic> 123a-b. The point being that when Jacob was going down to Egypt, Jochebed was yet in her mother&#x2019;s womb and could not be counted as a person. However, as soon as the Israelites come to Egypt she was born. Hence 70 descendants of Jacob came to Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2412"><sup>14</sup> According to Talmudic tradition the Israelites were in Egypt for 210 years (<italic>Seder Olam</italic>). Moses was 80 at the time of the Exodus (Ex. 7:7); thus Moses was born 130 years after the descent into Egypt. If his mother was born at the beginning of the descent then she had to be 130 years old at the time of Moses&#x2019; birth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2413"><sup>15</sup> When the Torah doesn&#x2019;t see fit to note that Jochebed was 130 when she brought a child into the world.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2414"><sup>16</sup> If this is really so, why wasn&#x2019;t Jochebed&#x2019;s longevity mentioned in Scripture?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2415"><sup>17</sup> Cf. <italic>Baba Batra</italic> 121b and <italic>Seder Olam</italic> 1. There it is stated that the prophet Ahijah, who prophesied during the reign of King Jeroboam, saw Amram the father of Moses. Ahijah thus lived close to 600 years. This is therefore a greater miracle than that of Jochebed, and yet Scripture doesn&#x2019;t mention it. Hence this Midrash can serve as support for the liturgical poets that Scripture omits certain miracles (Cherez). Krinsky explains that the liturgical poets can argue that if Ahijah could live 600 years, why is it hard to believe that Jochebed was still alive at the time of Moses&#x2019; death?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2416"><sup>18</sup> It is therefore not binding and cannot be offered as proof.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2417"><sup>19</sup> We thus see that Jacob is included in the number of those who came to Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2418"><sup>20</sup> Jacob obviously cannot be included in those that came out of his loins.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2419"><sup>21</sup> Yet Scripture lists them among those who came to Egypt (v. 20).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2420"><sup>22</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2421"><sup>23</sup> <italic>Nefesh</italic> has been translated as souls, in keeping with I.E.&#x2019;s translation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2422"><sup>24</sup> The reference is either to verse 27 (Krinsky) or both verse 27 and Deut. 10:22 (Cherez), or possibly only to Deut. 10:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2423"><sup>25</sup> <italic>All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were three score and ten</italic>. Since Jacob had a soul he is included in the souls that came into Egypt and similarly with Deut. 10:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2424"><sup>26</sup> Hence it is unlikely that he would not be included in the number of those that went down (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2425"><sup>27</sup> A man of Joseph&#x2019;s position would not personally make ready his chariot, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. However, since he commanded that his chariot be made ready it is as if he himself did it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2426"><sup>28</sup> Solomon obviously did not personally build the house. He ordered it built.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2427"><sup>29</sup> Although the Egyptians allowed shepherds in their country, they did not allow them to slaughter sheep. However, they permitted them to drink milk, although they detested them for it.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 47</title>
<p>1. IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN. The land of Goshen refers to the entire land, <italic>the land of Rameses</italic> (v. 11) to an area within it.<sup><xref rid="fn2428">1</xref></sup> The <italic>ayin</italic> in Rameses is vocalized with a quiescent <italic>sheva</italic>. I believe that the city Raamses (Ex. 1:11) which is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>ayin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2429">2</xref></sup> is not to be identified with the Rameses in which the Israelites dwelt, for Raamses was one of the store cities that the Israelites built for Pharaoh.<sup><xref rid="fn2430">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. RULERS OVER MY CATTLE. Such as horses and mules.<sup><xref rid="fn2431">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. LANGUISHED. <italic>Va-telah</italic> (languished) follows the paradigm of <italic>va-teta</italic> (and strayed) (Gen. 21:14).<sup><xref rid="fn2432">5</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>ke-mitlahle&#x2019;ah</italic> (as a madman) (Prov. 26:18) is like <italic>ki-metate&#x2019;ah</italic> (as a mocker) (Gen. 27:12).<sup><xref rid="fn2433">6</xref></sup> Its meaning is, the land was like a person who has lost his wits.<sup><xref rid="fn2434">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. WAS ALL SPENT. <italic>Va-yittom</italic> (was all spent) comes from a root whose second and third letters are identical.<sup><xref rid="fn2435">8</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>va-yiddom</italic> (stood still) in <italic>And the sun stood still</italic> (va-yiddom) (Josh. 10:13).<sup><xref rid="fn2436">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. GIVE. According to the rules of Hebrew grammar the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>havu</italic> should have been vocalized with a <italic>chataf pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2437">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>IF MONEY FAIL. <italic>Afes</italic> (fail) is a perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn2438">11</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>yare</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2439">12</xref></sup> in <italic>for he feared</italic> (yare) <italic>to dwell in Zoar</italic> (Gen. 19:30).</p>
<p>19. [WHEREFORE SHOULD WE DIE&#x2026;BOTH WE AND OUR LAND.] One should not be surprised that the Bible employs the term death to the land. We also find the reverse in <italic>Thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon&#x2026;and Thou givest them all life</italic> (Neh. 9:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2440">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>BE NOT DESOLATE. <italic>Tesham</italic> (be desolate) comes from the same root as <italic>tishamenah</italic> in <italic>and the high places shall be desolate</italic> (tishamenah) (Ezek. 6:6). <italic>Tesham</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>teda</italic> (she will know).<sup><xref rid="fn2441">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Midrash tells us that the hunger ceased because of Jacob&#x2019;s merit.<sup><xref rid="fn2442">15</xref></sup> However, it is possible that the hunger lasted for seven years but that it was less intense in the final three years than during the first four years.<sup><xref rid="fn2443">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND AS FOR THE PEOPLE, HE REMOVED THEM. He uprooted each and every Egyptian from his place.<sup><xref rid="fn2444">17</xref></sup> Some say that Scripture speaks of the people of Egypt&#x2019;s main city. Joseph removed them from the capital to villages so that they would till the soil.<sup><xref rid="fn2445">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. THE PRIESTS. This is to be rendered as Onkelos does.<sup><xref rid="fn2446">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND THEY GOT THEM POSSESSIONS THEREIN. They bought property with title.<sup><xref rid="fn2447">20</xref></sup></p>
<h1>VA-YECHI</h1>
<p>29. AND JACOB LIVED. The terms <italic>put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh</italic> and <italic>kindly and truly</italic> have been explained in the account dealing with Eliezer.<sup><xref rid="fn2448">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. BUT WHEN I SLEEP WITH MY FATHERS. This is a euphemism for death.<sup><xref rid="fn2449">22</xref></sup> Or it may mean: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt (v. 29), but I will sleep (be buried) with my fathers.<sup><xref rid="fn2450">23</xref></sup> The latter will come to pass because thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.<sup><xref rid="fn2451">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. AND ISRAEL BOWED DOWN. He payed homage to Joseph because he held royal position. However, I believe it means he bowed to God in praise. Our verse is different from the verse which records the bowing of Abraham (Gen. 23:7), for in the latter case it is explicitly stated that Abraham bowed to the children of Heth.<sup><xref rid="fn2452">25</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2428"><sup>1</sup> In our verse we are told that the Israelites lived in the land of Goshen. However, verse 11 tells us that they lived in the land of Rameses. I.E. solves this discrepancy by explaining that the land of Goshen was divided into a number of subdivisions one of which was called Rameses (Weiser). Thus the Israelites dwelt both in the land of Rameses and in the land of Goshen.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2429"><sup>2</sup> Rameses and Raamses have identical consonants. They differ only with regard to the vocalization of the <italic>ayin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2430"><sup>3</sup> It was not even in existence when the Israelites came to Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2431"><sup>4</sup> I.E. explains thus because he held that the Egyptians did not keep sheep. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 46:34 (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2432"><sup>5</sup> The root of <italic>va-tela</italic> is <italic>lamed, heh, heh</italic>. The root of <italic>va-teta</italic> is <italic>tav, ayin, heh</italic>. Both words drop the final root letter and are similarly vocalized.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2433"><sup>6</sup> Both of these words also follow similar patterns in their quadriliteral form. In Prov. 26:18 and in Gen. 27:12 these words appear as quadriliteral; i.e., their first root letters are similarly doubled forming the stems <italic>lamed, heh, lamed, heh</italic> and <italic>tav ayin, tav ayin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2434"><sup>7</sup> Its inhabitants couldn&#x2019;t think clearly because of exhaustion (Krinsky). Thus according to I.E. <italic>va-telah</italic> means crazed. Cf. I.E. on Prov. 26:18 and Kimchi on our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2435"><sup>8</sup> Its root is <italic>tav, mem, mem</italic> and it is a <italic>kal</italic> (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2436"><sup>9</sup> Its root is <italic>dalet, mem, mem</italic>. It, too, is a <italic>kal</italic> (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2437"><sup>10</sup> The root of <italic>havu</italic> is <italic>yod, heh, bet</italic>. Such a word drops its first root letter in the plural masculine imperative and its second root letter is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>. Compare, <italic>yada</italic> and <italic>yatza</italic> which in the imperative plural masculine become <italic>de</italic>&#x2019;u and <italic>tze</italic>&#x2019;u. Thus <italic>havu</italic> should have a <italic>chataf pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>heh</italic>. However, it does not. The <italic>heh</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>. It is therefore irregular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2438"><sup>11</sup> A third person perfect is usually vocalized <italic>kamatz, pattach</italic>. However, some words are conjugated according to the paradigm of <italic>pa&#x2019;el</italic>. These words are vocalized <italic>kamatz, tzere</italic> both in the third person masculine perfect and in the present tense. Thus <italic>afes</italic> can either be a perfect or a participle, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2439"><sup>12</sup> See above note. I.E. points out that <italic>yare</italic> is a third person masculine perfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2440"><sup>13</sup> Translated according to I.E. In this verse we find life, which is the opposite of death, applied to heaven and earth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2441"><sup>14</sup> According to I.E. the root of <italic>tesham</italic> is <italic>yod, shin, mem</italic> (Filwarg). The <italic>yod</italic> drops out and the letters prefixed to the root which indicate that the word is an imperfect are vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic>, as in the case of the imperfect of the word <italic>yada</italic> from the root <italic>yod, dalet, ayin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2442"><sup>15</sup> <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 89:11. See also <italic>Tosephta, Sotah</italic> 10, &#x201C;Before Jacob came down to Egypt there was a famine there&#x2026;after he came there Scripture tells us, <italic>Then Joseph said unto the people&#x2026;Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings</italic> (Gen. 47:23-24), which indicates that the famine ceased.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2443"><sup>16</sup> I.E. wants to reconcile the Midrash with Joseph&#x2019;s prophecy that there would be seven years of hunger. He does so by accepting the fact that there were seven years of hunger and interprets the Midrashic statement as meaning that the hunger eased. It should be noted that <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 has the reading: &#x201C;The Midrash tells us that the hunger ceased because of Jacob&#x2019;s merit. This is possible. It is also possible that the hunger continued during the last three years of the famine but that it was less intense than during the first four years.&#x201D; According to Weiser, I.E. is of the opinion that Joseph&#x2019;s collection of the money (v. 14 and 15); of the cattle (v. 16 and 17); and of buying the land (v. 18 and 19) took place successively during the last three years of the famine and that it eased during these years. For another interpretation see Filwarg, Weiser and Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2444"><sup>17</sup> The verse reads, <italic>ve-et ha-am he-evir oto le-arim</italic> (And as for the people, he removed them city by city). <italic>Am</italic> (people) is a plural. <italic>Oto</italic> (him) is a singular, hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation (Krinsky). This is the way I.E. explains the combination of singulars and plurals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2445"><sup>18</sup> <italic>Ve-et ha-am he-evir oto le-arim</italic> literally means: And as for the people, he removed them to the cities, hence I.E.&#x2019;s second interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2446"><sup>19</sup> Onkelos renders <italic>kohanim</italic> pagan priests.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2447"><sup>20</sup> The text reads, <italic>va-ye&#x2019;achazu vah</italic> (and they got them possessions therein). <italic>Va-ye&#x2019;achazu</italic> is a denominative of <italic>achuzah</italic> which means property with a title.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2450"><sup>23</sup> According to this interpretation, <italic>ve-shakhavti im avotai</italic> (but when I sleep with my fathers) means, but I will be buried with my fathers.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2452"><sup>25</sup> Gen. 23:7 tells us that Abraham bowed before the children of Heth. Some interpret that verse to mean that Abraham bowed before God. I.E. on Gen. 23:6 rejects that interpretation on the grounds that Scripture explicitly states, <italic>And Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth</italic>. However, here Scripture does not explicitly state that Jacob bowed down to Joseph. Hence we may interpret that Jacob bowed to God. Cf.

<p>4. [BEHOLD, I WILL MAKE THEE FRUITFUL.] According to Saadiah Gaon Jacob told Joseph: God appeared to me and told me, <italic>Behold I will make thee fruitful</italic>. However, following this promise I had no other children, and Rachel died. I now know that the Divine promise of <italic>Behold, I will make thee fruitful</italic> was said concerning your children.<sup><xref rid="fn2457">5</xref></sup> This interpretation is totally unpalatable.

However, any children that will be born to you in addition to Ephraim and Manasseh<sup><xref rid="fn2461">9</xref></sup> shall be called after the name of their just noted brothers, namely, they will receive their inheritance among them (v. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn2462">10</xref></sup> I take issue with the one who interprets <italic>And thy issue, that thou begettest after them</italic> (v. 6) as referring to the children of Machir the son of Manasseh who <italic>were born upon Joseph&#x2019;s knees</italic> (Gen. 50:23). If his interpretation is correct, why does Scripture say, <italic>they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance</italic> (v. 6)?<sup><xref rid="fn2463">11</xref></sup> And what if one argues, but we do not find that Joseph had any other children after Manasseh and Ephraim?<sup><xref rid="fn2464">12</xref></sup> It is not convincing. It is quite possible that Joseph had additional children but they are not mentioned because they received their inheritance among their brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn2465">13</xref></sup> There are many other such instances in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2466">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. [AND AS FOR ME, WHEN I CAME FROM PADDAN.] Rachel died suddenly and I was not able to transport her to the cave of Machpelah and inter her there, as I did with Leah. Jacob told this to Joseph so that he would not be angry with him for requesting that he do for him what he didn&#x2019;t do for his mother.</p>
<p>8. [AND ISRAEL BEHELD JOSEPH&#x2019;S SONS.] After stating in our verse, <italic>And Israel beheld Joseph&#x2019;s sons</italic>, how could Scripture go on to say, <italic>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see</italic> (v. 10)? The answer is, <italic>so that he could not see</italic> means he was not able to see clearly and recognize their faces.</p>
<p>12. AND JOSEPH BROUGHT THEM OUT FROM BETWEEN HIS KNEES. This verse should have followed <italic>And he blessed them that day</italic>, etc. (v. 20).<sup><xref rid="fn2467">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FROM BETWEEN HIS KNEES.] Jacob sat on the edge of the bed.<sup><xref rid="fn2468">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>[11. I HAD NOT THOUGHT.] <italic>Pillalti</italic> (I thought) means, my mind never judged that I would ever see you. It comes from the same root as <italic>pelilim</italic> (judges) (Deut. 32:31).<sup><xref rid="fn2469">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND JOSEPH TOOK THEM BOTH. Its meaning is: And Joseph had taken them both.<sup><xref rid="fn2470">18</xref></sup> I have already noted many other such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2471">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. GUIDING HIS HANDS WITTINGLY. His hands, as it were, understood what he wanted to do.<sup><xref rid="fn2472">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR MANASSEH WAS THE FIRST-BORN. <italic>Even though</italic> (ki) <italic>Manasseh was the first-born</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2473">21</xref></sup> The word <italic>ki</italic> in <italic>O Lord, let the Lord&#x2026;go in the midst of us, even though</italic> (ki) <italic>it is a stiff-necked people</italic> (Ex. 34:9) is similar. There are many similar instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2474">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>[16. THE ANGEL WHO HATH REDEEMED ME.] The meaning of this will be found in the Torah portion <italic>Ve-eleh shemot</italic> (Ex. 23:20).</p>
<p>AND LET MY NAME BE NAMED IN THEM. All of Israel will be called Ephraim<sup><xref rid="fn2475">23</xref></sup> and Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn2476">24</xref></sup> Scripture also states, <italic>A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuseth to be comforted for her children, Because they are not</italic> (Jer. 31:15),<sup><xref rid="fn2477">25</xref></sup> because Jacob considered Rachel to be his true mate.<sup><xref rid="fn2478">26</xref></sup> Hence Scripture says, <italic>The sons of Rachel Jacob&#x2019;s wife</italic> (Gen. 46:19).<sup><xref rid="fn2479">27</xref></sup> Similarly, as soon as Rachel bore a son, Jacob said to Laban, <italic>Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country</italic> (Gen. 30:25). He also gave the birthright to Joseph because he was the first born of his true mate. When Reuben showed himself unfit for the birthright he transferred it to Joseph who was Rachel&#x2019;s first born, rather than to Dan or Gad because they were sons of the handmaidens.<sup><xref rid="fn2480">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>[17. HIS RIGHT HAND.] The right hand is more honored and is stronger than the left.<sup><xref rid="fn2481">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. A MULTITUDE OF NATIONS. Many nations shall descend from him<sup><xref rid="fn2482">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. BY THEE SHALL ISRAEL BLESS. All the Israelites.<sup><xref rid="fn2483">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE SET EPHRAIM BEFORE MANASSEH. In the enunciation of the blessing.<sup><xref rid="fn2484">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. ONE PORTION. Some say that <italic>shekhem</italic> (portion) alludes to the city of Shechem which was in the portion of the land allotted to Joseph. <italic>With my sword and with my bow</italic> refers to God, as in David&#x2019;s statement, <italic>The lord is my rock&#x2026;My shield and my horn of salvation</italic> (Ps. 18:3; II Sam. 22:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2485">33</xref></sup> However, I believe that <italic>shekhem</italic> means a portion and <italic>shekhem echad</italic> is to be rendered one portion. The word <italic>shekhem</italic> is related to the words <italic>shikhmam</italic> (their shoulders) and <italic>shekhem</italic> (shoulder) in, <italic>upon their shoulders</italic> (shichmam) (Ex. 12:34), and <italic>To serve Him with one consent</italic> (shekhem echad) (Zeph. 3:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2486">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>ABOVE THY BRETHREN. More than thy brethren.<sup><xref rid="fn2487">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHICH I TOOK.] Its meaning is: which the Israelites will take with their sword and with their bow.<sup><xref rid="fn2488">36</xref></sup> Jacob singled out the Amorites because there were none among the seven Canaanite nations equal in strength to them. Observe, after the two mighty Amorite kings were slain<sup><xref rid="fn2489">37</xref></sup> Joshua said (Josh. 7:7), <italic>Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast Thou at all brought this people over the Jordan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2490">38</xref></sup> <italic>to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2491">39</xref></sup> <italic>to cause us to perish</italic>? Jacob&#x2019;s statement, <italic>Which I took</italic>, presents no problems<sup><xref rid="fn2492">40</xref></sup> because the Patriarchs considered the land as theirs from the moment that God verbally gave it to Abraham.<sup><xref rid="fn2493">41</xref></sup> God similarly gave it to Jacob, as we read, <italic>The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed</italic> (Gen. 28:13).</p>
<ftnote id="fn2453"><sup>1</sup> The subject of <italic>va-yomer</italic> (and he said) is omitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2454"><sup>2</sup> Scripture similarly omits the subject. The translation of Num. 26:59 is a literal one.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2455"><sup>3</sup> The subject of <italic>va-yagged</italic> (and he told) is omitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2456"><sup>4</sup> <italic>And he told</italic> refers to a messenger sent by Jacob to Joseph requesting that he come to see him. This messenger came back <italic>and he told Jacob&#x2026;Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2457"><sup>5</sup> Hence <italic>Ephraim and Manasseh&#x2026;shall be mine</italic> (v. 5).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2458"><sup>6</sup> How did Jacob know the promise referred to Joseph&#x2019;s children and not to Reuben&#x2019;s children when both are his descendants and the Divine promise, <italic>Behold, I will make thee fruitful</italic> could apply to both?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2459"><sup>7</sup> The vision in which God told Jacob, <italic>Behold, I will make thee fruitful</italic>, is recorded in Gen. 35:9-16. Benjamin&#x2019;s birth follows immediately in verse 18. Hence it may refer to him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2460"><sup>8</sup> Since the land was given to me, I may pass it on as I see fit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2461"><sup>9</sup> Viz., <italic>And thy issue, that thou begettest after them</italic>. I.E. explains <italic>holadta</italic> (literally, you begat) as an imperfect, you will beget.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2462"><sup>10</sup> They will be included in the Ephraimites and Manassites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2463"><sup>11</sup> Machir&#x2019;s children received Machir&#x2019;s share in the land. Hence Scripture should have stated &#x201C;after the name of their father&#x201D; in their inheritance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2464"><sup>12</sup> If Scripture tells us, <italic>and thy issue, that thou begettest after them</italic>, then it must be true. If we cannot apply it to Joseph&#x2019;s sons other than Manasseh and Ephraim, since he had no others, then the Bible must be referring to grandchildren.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2465"><sup>13</sup> Since they were included in the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, there was no reason to mention them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2466"><sup>14</sup> Where names were left out because they had no significance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2467"><sup>15</sup> So Krinsky, Weiser and Cherez. The point being that Manesseh and Ephraim were between Joseph&#x2019;s knees until the conclusion of the blessing. Hence our verse should have followed verse 20. However, the problem remains, why is this verse misplaced? Filwarg interprets I.E. as saying that Scripture first summarizes what transpired during the blessing and then goes into detail, that is, Scripture in verses 9-12 tells us that Joseph brought his children to Jacob and that Jacob placed them between his knees, kissed them and blessed them and that Joseph took them from between his knees, and bowed in gratitude before his father for blessing his children. Then in verses 13-20 the Bible tells us exactly what transpired during the blessing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2468"><sup>16</sup> Jacob sat on the edge of the bed with his feet on the ground and Manasseh and Ephraim were between his knees (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2469"><sup>17</sup> Its root is <italic>peh, lamed, lamed</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2470"><sup>18</sup> In other words <italic>va-yikkach</italic> (took) is a pluperfect that means had taken. In verse 9 we are told that Jacob told Joseph, <italic>Bring them (your sons), I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them</italic>. Verse 10, while stating that Jacob kissed them, does not state that Joseph brought them to his father. This is stated in verse 13. Filwarg in keeping with his interpretation of I.E., viz., that verses 9-12 summarize what happened and verses 13-20 tell in detail what occurred, interprets as follows: Scripture is about to relate the details of the blessing. It begins by telling that Joseph had brought his children to his father in the following manner, Ephraim in his right hand and Manasseh in his left hand.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2471"><sup>19</sup> Of the pluperfect in Scripture. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 1:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2472"><sup>20</sup> The verse reads: <italic>sikkel et yadov</italic>, which literally means, he imparted wisdom to his hands. Hence his hands &#x201C;understood&#x201D; his intentions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2473"><sup>21</sup> In other words, <italic>ki</italic> (for) is to be rendered even though, i.e., Jacob placed his left hand upon Manasseh&#x2019;s head even though Manasseh was the first born.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2474"><sup>22</sup> Where the word <italic>ki</italic> has the meaning of even though.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2475"><sup>23</sup> The Bible refers to Israel as Ephraim in Hos. 7:1; 10:6; 11:3; 12:1; and Jer. 31-20. According to I.E. <italic>and let my name be named in them</italic> means that all of Israel will be called Ephraim. Nachmanides objects. He argues that if this were the interpretation they would also be called by the name of Manasseh since the text reads, <italic>in them</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2476"><sup>24</sup> The Bible refers to Israel as Joseph in Ps. 80:2; 81:6; and Zech. 10:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2477"><sup>25</sup> The children of the other matriarchs also went into exile. However, the Bible mentions only Rachel weeping for her children. We thus see that all of Israel is called after Rachel&#x2019;s children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2478"><sup>26</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>ikkar machasahvto</italic>, the main one of his thoughts. Rachel was the one Jacob originally wanted to marry and the one whom he loved. It was only due to circumstances that he married Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2479"><sup>27</sup> <italic>Jacob&#x2019;s wife</italic> is an appellation not used with reference to any of Jacob&#x2019;s other wives.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2480"><sup>28</sup> Dan was Bilhah&#x2019;s first born (Gen. 30:6). Gad was Zilpah&#x2019;s first born (Gen. 30:11). Jacob thus gave the birthright to Joseph even though Dan and Gad were older than Joseph and were first born. He did this because Joseph was the first born of Rachel and they of handmaidens.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2481"><sup>29</sup> According to Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2482"><sup>30</sup> The verse reads, <italic>melo ha-goyim</italic>. Its literal translation is, a fullness of the nations. I.E. points out that <italic>melo</italic> (fullness) is to be rendered as many, a multitude. Filwarg asks, &#x201C;Who were the many nations descended from Ephraim?&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2483"><sup>31</sup> Israel here doesn&#x2019;t refer to Jacob but to all of Jacob&#x2019;s descendants (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2484"><sup>32</sup> Viz., &#x201C;God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2485"><sup>33</sup> That is, with the help of God, who is my sword and bow.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2486"><sup>34</sup> A portion is called a <italic>shekhem</italic> (shoulder) because the shoulder is a part of the body (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2487"><sup>35</sup> The reference is to Joseph&#x2019;s receiving a double portion in the land of Canaan (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2488"><sup>36</sup> Jacob will conquer the land via his children. I.E. holds that <italic>lakachti</italic> (took), a perfect, is to be understood as an imperfect, viz., will take. I.E. later explains why Jacob used a perfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2489"><sup>37</sup> Sihon and Og. Cf. Num. 21:21ff.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2490"><sup>38</sup> After defeating Sihon and Og.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2491"><sup>39</sup> We thus see that Joshua referred to all of Canaan as the land of the Amorite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2492"><sup>40</sup> If Jacob was speaking of the future, why did he use the perfect <italic>lakachti</italic> (took)?</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 49</title>
<p>1. THAT WHICH SHALL BEFALL YOU. Prophecies foretelling that which shall befall you in the future. Those who base themselves on Scripture&#x2019;s closing remark, <italic>and this is that their father spoke unto them and blessed them</italic> (v. 28), and conclude that they (Jacob&#x2019;s words) are blessings, err.<sup><xref rid="fn2494">1</xref></sup> For if it were so, where are the blessings of Reuben, Simeon and Levi?<sup><xref rid="fn2495">2</xref></sup> The way to understand <italic>and this is that their father spoke unto them and blessed them</italic> is as follows: and this (v. 3-27) is what their father spoke unto them by way of prophecy after which he blessed them. Scripture omits the blessings.</p>
<p>3. REUBEN, THOU ART MY FIRST-BORN, MY MIGHT, AND THE FIRST-FRUITS OF MY STRENGTH. My might was first seen in thee. The first-born is called the first of one&#x2019;s strength. We find an identical expression in <italic>And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham</italic> (Ps. 78:51).</p>
<p>THE EXCELLENCY OF DIGNITY. You were suited by virtue of being first-born for the advantage of being exalted above all your brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn2496">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE EXCELLENCY OF POWER. This means the same as <italic>The excellency of dignity</italic>. It is prophetic style to repeat the same idea in different words.<sup><xref rid="fn2497">4</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>oz</italic> is power.</p>
<p>4. UNSTABLE. Because you acted unstably as water does.</p>
<p>HAVE NOT THOU THE EXCELLENCY. (Some say) that <italic>al totar</italic> (have not thou the excellency) means, you will not have the advantage.<sup><xref rid="fn2498">5</xref></sup> However, if this were the case then our text should have read <italic>al tutar</italic> rather than <italic>al totar</italic>; i.e., the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>totar</italic> should have been vocalized with a <italic>shuruk</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2499">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that our clause should be interpreted thus: you acted unstably as water that is poured out of a vessel and you gained nothing thereby (<italic>al totar</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2500">7</xref></sup> However, I disagree with this interpretation. The term <italic>al</italic> is always used in Scripture as an imperative.<sup><xref rid="fn2501">8</xref></sup> The latter fact is not negated by the fact that we find <italic>al</italic> used once in a non-imperative sense in <italic>In the way of righteousness is life, And in the pathway thereof there is no</italic> (al) <italic>death</italic> (Prov. 12:28).<sup><xref rid="fn2502">9</xref></sup> The correct translation of our clause is: do not seek any advantage (<italic>al totar</italic>) even one as insignificant as water.<sup><xref rid="fn2503">10</xref></sup> Accordingly the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>totar</italic> is properly vocalized with a <italic>cholam</italic>, and it follows the paradigm of <italic>tosaf</italic> (more) in <italic>Think upon the battle, thou wilt do so no more</italic> (al tosaf) (Job 40:32).<sup><xref rid="fn2504">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon explains our line as follows: you will not have any advantage over your brothers even one as insignificant as water. According to Saadiah <italic>pachaz</italic> (unstable) comes from the same root as <italic>pochazim</italic> (light, insignificant) in <italic>vain and light</italic> (pochazim) <italic>fellows</italic> (Judges 9:4), and the root of the word <italic>pachaz</italic> does not have to be inverted. <sup><xref rid="fn2505">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEN DEFILEDST THOU IT. From the day that thou defiled my couch, my conjugal couch was removed.<sup><xref rid="fn2506">13</xref></sup> <italic>Yetzu&#x2019;i alah</italic> (he went up to my couch) is to be interpreted as if written <italic>yetzu&#x2019;i alah me&#x2019;alai</italic> (my conjugal couch went up from me). Furthermore, the word <italic>alah</italic> (went up) at times has the meaning of cut off,<sup><xref rid="fn2507">14</xref></sup> as in <italic>O my God, take me not away</italic> (al ta&#x2019;aleni) <italic>in the midst of my days</italic> (Ps. 102:25).</p>
<p>Our chapter is clearly explained in Chronicles where we read, <italic>Reuben (was) the first-born of Israel&#x2026;but, forasmuch as he defiled his father&#x2019;s couch, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, and he was not to be reckoned in the genealogy as first-born</italic> (I Chron. 5:1). Chronicles then tells us that Joseph received the birthright and Judah the kingship (<italic>Ibid</italic>. v. 2). Some explain that <italic>and he was not to be reckoned in the genealogy as first-born</italic> means that the listing of the order of the twelve sons would start with Reuben.<sup><xref rid="fn2508">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. SIMEON AND LEVI ARE BRETHREN. He referred to them as brethren because of what they did to the city of Shechem.<sup><xref rid="fn2509">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEIR KINSHIP. Some say that the word <italic>mekherotehem</italic> (their kinship) is similar in meaning to <italic>ha-karat</italic> (the show of) in <italic>The show of</italic> (ha-karat) <italic>their countenance doth witness against them</italic> (Is. 3:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2510">17</xref></sup> However, this interpretation is grammatically impossible.<sup><xref rid="fn2511">18</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>mekherotehem</italic> is to be rendered their possessions<sup><xref rid="fn2512">19</xref></sup> and is to be compared to the word <italic>tikhru</italic> (ye shall buy) in <italic>and ye shall also buy</italic> (tikhru) <italic>water of them for money</italic> (Deut. 2:6). However, this, too, is incorrect for the word <italic>tikhru</italic> means to dig.<sup><xref rid="fn2513">20</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>mekherotehem</italic> is related to the word <italic>mekhirah</italic> (sale) and the meaning of <italic>mekherotehem</italic> is they sold themselves,<sup><xref rid="fn2514">21</xref></sup> as in <italic>a people that jeoparded</italic> (cheref) <italic>their lives unto the death</italic> (Jud. 5:18).<sup><xref rid="fn2515">22</xref></sup> I believe that <italic>mekherotehem</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>mekhorotayich</italic> (thine origin) (Ezek. 16:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2516">23</xref></sup> While the prepositional <italic>bet</italic> is missing from <italic>mekherotehem</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2517">24</xref></sup> we find the same with the word <italic>bet</italic> (house) in <italic>that was found in the house of</italic> (bet)<sup><xref rid="fn2518">25</xref></sup> <italic>the Lord</italic> (II Kings 16:8) and with the word <italic>ma&#x2019;on</italic> (habitation) in <italic>which I have commanded in My habitation</italic> (ma&#x2019;on) (I Sam. 2:29).<sup><xref rid="fn2519">26</xref></sup> Our text refers to the violence which Simeon and Levi committed in the land of their origin by deceitfully slaying the entire city of Shechem after making a covenant with them.<sup><xref rid="fn2520">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. LET MY SOUL NOT COME INTO THEIR COUNCIL. Rabbi Aaron<sup><xref rid="fn2521">28</xref></sup> explained the word <italic>tavo</italic> (come) in <italic>Let my soul not come</italic> (tavo) as having the meaning of set like the meaning of <italic>ba</italic> (goeth down, to set) in <italic>and the sun goeth down</italic> (ba) (Eccles. 1:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2522">29</xref></sup> He interpreted <italic>let my soul not come into their council</italic> as meaning, I do not want to be outside of their council. However, Rabbi Aaron&#x2019;s interpretation inverts the meaning of the verse.<sup><xref rid="fn2523">30</xref></sup> If Jacob praised Simeon and Levi, why did he mention weapons of violence? Furthermore, Jacob told his sons, <italic>Ye have troubled me, to make me odious unto the inhabitants of the land</italic> (Gen. 34:30).<sup><xref rid="fn2524">31</xref></sup> The truth of the matter is that Simeon and Levi placed Jacob and his household in great jeopardy by their actions in Shechem. Indeed, were it not for the <italic>terror of God</italic> that <italic>was upon the cities that were round about them</italic> (Gen. 35:5), they would have surrounded Jacob and his family and exterminated them all. He (Rabbi Aaron) similarly explained<sup><xref rid="fn2525">32</xref></sup> <italic>Cursed be their anger</italic> (v. 7) as meaning <italic>and in their self will they uprooted a cursed wall</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2526">33</xref></sup> <italic>for their anger was fierce</italic>. The above explanations are unpalatable.<sup><xref rid="fn2527">34</xref></sup> Let my soul not come into their council.<sup><xref rid="fn2528">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen<sup><xref rid="fn2529">36</xref></sup> says that <italic>kevodi</italic> (my glory) is synonymous with <italic>nafshi</italic> (my soul). He notes that we find the two often used synonymously in the book of Psalms. Rabbi Moses&#x2019; interpretation is correct since our text repeats itself in different words,<sup><xref rid="fn2530">37</xref></sup> as is the style of prophetic statements. We thus find, <italic>Ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee, Thine elders, and they will tell thee</italic> (Deut. 32:7), and (in Num. 23:8) <italic>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I execrate, whom the Lord hath not execrated</italic>? Thus <italic>into their council</italic> means the same as <italic>unto their assembly</italic>, come (<italic>tavoh</italic>) the same as be united (<italic>techad</italic>), and <italic>nafshi</italic> the same as <italic>kevodi</italic>. However, Rabbi Judah ben Balam the Spaniard<sup><xref rid="fn2531">38</xref></sup> says that Rabbi Moses erred. He maintains that <italic>kavod</italic> (glory) refers to the body because the body is the glory (<italic>kavod</italic>) of the soul in the same way that a necklace is the ornament to the neck,<sup><xref rid="fn2532">39</xref></sup> as we find in the verse <italic>Who satisfieth thy body</italic> (edyekh) <italic>with good things</italic> (Ps. 103:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2533">40</xref></sup> Rabbi Judah offers as a proof text,<sup><xref rid="fn2534">41</xref></sup> <italic>Yea, let him lay my glory</italic> (kevodi) <italic>in the dust. Selah</italic>. (Ps. 7:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2535">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, I say that Rabbi Judah errs, for we find Scripture saying, <italic>So that my glory</italic> (kevodi) <italic>may sing praise to Thee</italic> (Ps. 30:13),<sup><xref rid="fn2536">43</xref></sup> and <italic>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory</italic> (kevodi) <italic>rejoiceth; My flesh</italic> (i.e., my body) <italic>also dwelleth in safety</italic> (Ps. 16:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2537">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>As to the proof which Rabbi Judah offered from <italic>Yea, let him lay my glory in the dust</italic>, it is figurative. What the verse means is that my soul will be lowered as low as possible, i.e., to the dust. Positive proof that my interpretation is correct comes from <italic>My soul</italic> (nafshi) <italic>cleaveth unto the dust</italic> (Ps. 119:25).<sup><xref rid="fn2538">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>BE UNITED. <italic>Techad</italic> (be united) is related to the word <italic>yachad</italic> (united).<sup><xref rid="fn2539">46</xref></sup> However, according to Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen, the grammarian of blessed memory, the <italic>tzere</italic> beneath the <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>techad</italic> takes the place of the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>echad</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2540">47</xref></sup> He similarly explains the word <italic>tesham</italic> (be desolate) in <italic>and that the land be not desolate</italic> (tesham) (Gen. 47:19).<sup><xref rid="fn2541">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>[INTO THEIR COUNCIL.] <italic>Be-sodam</italic> (into their council) is analogous to <italic>be-hivvasedam</italic> (while they took council) in <italic>while they took council</italic> (be-hivvasedam) <italic>together against me</italic> (Ps. 31:14).<sup><xref rid="fn2542">49</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: since Simeon and Levi&#x2019;s weapons are ones of violence (v. 5), <italic>Let my soul not come into their council</italic>.</p>
<p>THEY SLEW MEN. Scripture employs the term <italic>ish</italic> (man) generically as it does <italic>shor</italic> (ox) and <italic>chamor</italic> (ass) for oxen and asses (Gen. 32:6). <italic>They slew men</italic> alludes to the inhabitants of the city of Shechem.</p>
<p>OXEN. <italic>Shor</italic> (oxen) is to be rendered as wall. We similarly read, <italic>Its branches run over the wall</italic> (shur) (v. 22). I have already explained in my work <italic>Moznayim</italic> that the <italic>cholam</italic> and <italic>shuruk</italic> interchange.<sup><xref rid="fn2543">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>[HOUGHED.] <italic>Ikkeru</italic> (houghed) is similar to the word <italic>te&#x2019;akker</italic> (hough) in <italic>thou shalt hough</italic> (te&#x2019;akker) <italic>their horses</italic> (Josh. 11:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2544">51</xref></sup> This verse shows that Shechem was a large city since it had a wall.</p>
<p>7. CURSED BE THEIR ANGER, FOR IT WAS FIERCE. Jacob either prophesied or offered a prayer that Simeon and Levi&#x2019;s anger would (or should) diminish and that this would be for their very own good. For curse is the opposite of bless, and as a blessing means an increase, so a curse means a diminution.<sup><xref rid="fn2545">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEIR WRATH. A repetition in different words of <italic>their anger</italic>. The same is true with <italic>I will divide them</italic> and <italic>And scatter them</italic>. The meaning of <italic>I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel</italic> is, Simeon and Levi deserve to be separated and disunited. And so it was. For we find that the lot of the tribe of Simeon fell within the inheritance of the tribe of Judah.<sup><xref rid="fn2546">53</xref></sup> Simeon was thus under Judah&#x2019;s dominion. Furthermore, its cities were discontiguous and scattered throughout the boundary of Judah.<sup><xref rid="fn2547">54</xref></sup> Similarly the forty-eight cities of the tribe of Levi were scattered among the other tribes.</p>
<p>8. JUDAH. Thou art as thy name,<sup><xref rid="fn2548">55</xref></sup> and thy brethren shall so praise thee.<sup><xref rid="fn2549">56</xref></sup> When thy brothers shall see that <italic>Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy father&#x2019;s sons shall bow down before thee</italic> as to a king. This prophecy came to pass.</p>
<p>[9.] JUDAH IS A LION&#x2019;S WHELP. Jacob compared Judah to a small lion&#x2019;s whelp, to a type of whelp that grows into a lion.<sup><xref rid="fn2550">57</xref></sup> The comparative <italic>caf</italic> (meaning like) has been omitted,<sup><xref rid="fn2551">58</xref></sup> as it is in <italic>When a wild ass&#x2019;s colt</italic> (ayir pere) <italic>is born a man</italic> (Job. 11:12).<sup><xref rid="fn2552">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROM THE PREY, MY SON, THOU ART GONE UP. My son, you appear to me as a lion&#x2019;s whelp when thou art gone up from the prey. <italic>From the prey</italic> means after tearing a prey apart.<sup><xref rid="fn2553">60</xref></sup> This is its plain meaning. For us to interpret it as referring to the saving of Joseph,<sup><xref rid="fn2554">61</xref></sup> Scripture should have written <italic>he&#x2019;elita</italic> (thou brought up)<sup><xref rid="fn2555">62</xref></sup> rather than <italic>alita</italic> (thou art come up) which is an intransitive verb. The rest of the verse<sup><xref rid="fn2556">63</xref></sup> is proof that the first part of the verse deals with Judah&#x2019;s tearing of a prey and not with Judah&#x2019;s saving of Joseph from being a prey. Observe the verse <italic>And she brought up</italic> (va-ta&#x2019;al) <italic>one of her whelps</italic> (Ezek. 19:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2557">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>[HE STOOPED DOWN, HE COUCHED AS A LION.] After a lion tears its prey it sits on its knees and couches in security and no other passing animal<sup><xref rid="fn2558">65</xref></sup> will cause it to get up and flee.</p>
<p>10. THE SCEPTRE SHALL NOT DEPART FROM JUDAH. The sceptre of greatness shall not depart from Judah until David, who inaugurated the Kingdom of Judah, comes.<sup><xref rid="fn2559">66</xref></sup> And so it was. Observe that in Israel&#x2019;s march toward the promised land, the standard of the tribe of Judah set forth in the first (Num. 10:14).<sup><xref rid="fn2560">67</xref></sup> God also said, <italic>Judah shall go up first</italic> (Jud. 1:1, 2).<sup><xref rid="fn2561">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>[NOR THE RULER&#x2019;S STAFF.] A scribe (<italic>mechokek</italic>) who will write (<italic>she-yachok</italic>) in a book.<sup><xref rid="fn2562">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FROM BETWEEN HIS FEET.] Scribes sit at the feet of the ruler.<sup><xref rid="fn2563">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHILOH. Some interpret <italic>Shiloh</italic> as Onkelos does. They say that it means &#x201C;his.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2564">71</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>Shiloh</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>u-ve-shilyatah</italic> (and against her afterbirth) (Deut. 28:57).<sup><xref rid="fn2565">72</xref></sup> Others connect it to the Rabbinic term <italic>shalil</italic> (embryo).<sup><xref rid="fn2566">73</xref></sup> There is also a commentator who says that <italic>shiloh</italic> refers to the city Shilo. He would explain <italic>yavo</italic> to mean goeth down, as in <italic>and the sun goeth down</italic> (ba) (Eccles. 1:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2567">74</xref></sup> Or he would maintain that our verse is abridged and should read as if written <italic>ad ki yavo ketz shilo</italic> (until the end of Shiloh comes).<sup><xref rid="fn2568">75</xref></sup> For it is written, <italic>And he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh</italic> (Ps. 78:60), and then, <italic>He chose David also His servant</italic> (Ps. 78:70). The latter interpretation is also not implausible.</p>
<p>It is also possible that <italic>Shiloh</italic> means his son, with the <italic>heh</italic> taking the place of the <italic>vav</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2569">76</xref></sup> as in the word <italic>oholoh</italic> (his tent) (Gen. 9:21), and that the word <italic>shiloh</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>tashleh</italic> (give birth) in <italic>lo tashleh oti</italic> (don&#x2019;t cause me to give birth) (II Kings 4:28).<sup><xref rid="fn2570">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>[OBEDIENCE.] The word <italic>yikkehat</italic> (obedience of) is similar to the word <italic>li-kehat</italic> in <italic>to obey</italic> (li-kehat) <italic>his mother</italic> (Prov. 30:17).<sup><xref rid="fn2571">78</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>yikkehat</italic> is a third person imperfect prefix.<sup><xref rid="fn2572">79</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>ve-lo yikkehat ammim</italic> is that nations shall obey him. Jacob&#x2019;s prophecy came true, for we find that many nations were subservient to David and his son Solomon.</p>
<p>Our phrase (v. 10) does not mean that the sceptre shall depart from Judah when David comes.<sup><xref rid="fn2573">80</xref></sup> Our verse may be compared to someone saying, so and so will not lack bread until the time that he will have many vineyards and fields. <italic>For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of</italic>, viz., returning you to the land of Canaan (Gen. 28:15), is identical.<sup><xref rid="fn2574">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. BINDING. The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>oseri</italic> (binding) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn2575">82</xref></sup> It is similar to the superflous <italic>yods</italic> of <italic>ha-yoshevi</italic> (that are enthroned) (Ps. 123:1)<sup><xref rid="fn2576">83</xref></sup> and <italic>le-susati</italic> (to a steed) (Cant. 1:9)<sup><xref rid="fn2577">84</xref></sup> both of which are superfluous.</p>
<p>HIS FOAL. <italic>Iroh</italic> (his foal) is similar to <italic>ayarim</italic> (ass colts) in <italic>on thirty ass colts</italic> (ayarim) (Jud. 10:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2578">85</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>beni</italic> (colt) in <italic>beni atono</italic> (his ass&#x2019;s colt) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn2579">86</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse then is: Binding his foal unto the vine and binding his ass&#x2019;s colt unto the choice vine, for the word binding is to be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn2580">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNTO THE CHOICE VINE. Scripture repeats the same idea in different words, for <italic>sorekah</italic> (vine) means the same as <italic>gefen</italic>, and <italic>ayir</italic> (foal) the same as <italic>aton</italic>. Similarly, <italic>And his vesture in the blood of grapes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2581">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that <italic>suto</italic> (his vesture) is the word <italic>kesuto</italic> (his vesture) with the <italic>kaf</italic> missing.<sup><xref rid="fn2582">89</xref></sup> However, I believe that <italic>sutoh</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>masveh</italic> (veil) (Ex. 34:33).<sup><xref rid="fn2583">90</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is that his vineyards will produce so many grapes that Judah will bind<sup><xref rid="fn2584">91</xref></sup> his foal to the vine and he will not care if the animal eats of the grapes; and he will have so much wine that he will wash his garments in wine rather than in water. Scripture terms wine <italic>the blood of grapes</italic> because wine is red.<sup><xref rid="fn2585">92</xref></sup> The Bible speaks figuratively here, as it does in <italic>And it shall come to pass in that day, That the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, And the hills shall flow with milk</italic> (Joel 4:18).</p>
<p>The land will produce so much wine that Judah will be called &#x201C;red eyes&#x201D; because of the great amount of wine that he will drink. <sup><xref rid="fn2586">93</xref></sup> He will be so called because the eyes of one who drinks much wine look red.<sup><xref rid="fn2587">94</xref></sup> Similarly Judah&#x2019;s teeth will be white from the large amount of milk that he will drink.<sup><xref rid="fn2588">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND HIS TEETH WHITE. <italic>U-leven</italic> (white) is an adjective modifying <italic>shinnayim</italic> (teeth).<sup><xref rid="fn2589">96</xref></sup> <italic>Shinnayim</italic> is in the dual form because the teeth are arranged in two sets.<sup><xref rid="fn2590">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon, of blessed memory, explains <italic>His eyes shall based with wine</italic> to mean that his eyes shall be redder than wine. He similarly explains <italic>And his teeth white with milk</italic> to mean that his teeth shall be whiter than milk.<sup><xref rid="fn2591">98</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>And his teeth white with milk</italic> means that he will not eat an unclean thing and will not follow what his eyes see.<sup><xref rid="fn2592">99</xref></sup> The latter is a ridiculous homily.<sup><xref rid="fn2593">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jacob at first enumerated the tribes<sup><xref rid="fn2594">101</xref></sup> in the order of their birth. However, he listed Zebulun before Issachar because Issachar&#x2019;s inheritance fell between Zebulun and Dan.<sup><xref rid="fn2595">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AT THE SHORE OF THE SEA. This, too, is proof that Jacob prophesied.<sup><xref rid="fn2596">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>le-chof</italic> (at the shore) is, at the border of. It comes from the same root as <italic>chofef</italic> (covereth) in <italic>He covereth</italic> (chofef) <italic>him all the day</italic> (Deut. 33:12). The border of the sea is called <italic>chof</italic> because it &#x201C;covers&#x201D; the boats as boats cannot be anchored in places that are open to the wind.<sup><xref rid="fn2597">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HIS FLANK SHALL BE UPON ZIDON. His flank shall extend to Zidon.<sup><xref rid="fn2598">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. ISSACHAR IS A LARGE-BONED ASS. Jacob compared Issachar to an ass whose bones are heavy.<sup><xref rid="fn2599">106</xref></sup> <italic>Chamor</italic> (ass) is in the construct with <italic>garem</italic> (bones).<sup><xref rid="fn2600">107</xref></sup> Due to the heaviness of his bones, he is wont to couch.<sup><xref rid="fn2601">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>BETWEEN THE SHEEPFOLDS. <italic>Ben ha-mishpatayim</italic> (between the sheepfolds) means between the arranged rows.<sup><xref rid="fn2602">109</xref></sup> It is possible that <italic>mishpatayim</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>tishpot</italic> (arrange) in <italic>Lord, Thou wilt arrange</italic> (tishpot) <italic>peace for us</italic> (Is. 26:12).</p>
<p>15. FOR HE SAW A RESTING-PLACE THAT IT WAS GOOD. When Issachar saw that his land and resting-place were pleasant, he, as an ass, bowed his shoulder to bear any and all burdens and became as a servant that pays levies. Scripture says this concerning Issachar because this tribe did not consist of warriors and its men did not want to leave their homes to go to war. Moses similarly said concerning Issachar, <italic>Rejoice&#x2026;Issachar, in thy tents</italic> (Deut. 33:18). The levy mentioned in our verse may refer to Issachar&#x2019;s payment of a money levy to the king in Israel in lieu of furnishing soldiers for his army, or it may refer to a payment of money to foreign nations that they should not attack them.<sup><xref rid="fn2603">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. DAN SHALL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE. Jacob hinted that Dan, although born of a handmaid, would have a standard just as the tribes born of the wives did.<sup><xref rid="fn2604">111</xref></sup> Dan was thus a ruler over all the other tribes that were descended from the handmaids.<sup><xref rid="fn2605">112</xref></sup></p>
<p>[17. A SERPENT.] Jacob compared Dan in his strength to a serpent.<sup><xref rid="fn2606">113</xref></sup> It is also possible that <italic>shefifon</italic> (a horned snake) comes from the same root as <italic>yeshufekha</italic> (they shall bruise thy) in <italic>they shall bruise thy</italic> (yeshufekha) <italic>head</italic> (Gen. 3:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2607">114</xref></sup> According to this interpretation <italic>shefifon ale orach</italic> (a horned snake in the path) means the same as <italic>nachash ale derech</italic> (a serpent in the way).</p>
<p>18. [I WAIT FOR THY SALVATION, O LORD.] When the serpent bites the horse&#x2019;s heel, it is afraid that the rider will smash its head with his sword. Hence the prophet prayed, <italic>I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2608">115</xref></sup> The &#x201C;thy&#x201D; of <italic>Thy salvation</italic> refers to Dan.<sup><xref rid="fn2609">116</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: I trust to God for thy salvation. It is also possible that Scripture employs a noun (salvation) in place of an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn2610">117</xref></sup> Our verse should thus be rendered: I trust that God will save thee. <italic>Thy salvation</italic> in <italic>We will shout for joy in thy salvation</italic> (Ps. 20:6) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2611">118</xref></sup> The aforementioned is the case whether the &#x201C;thy&#x201D; of <italic>thy salvation</italic> (Ps. 20:6) refers to King David or to the anointed, his son.<sup><xref rid="fn2612">119</xref></sup> Rabbi Samuel Ha-Nagid says that the word <italic>va-yomer</italic> has been omitted from our clause and it should be read as if written: and he will say (<italic>va-yomer</italic>), I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn2613">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Isaac<sup><xref rid="fn2614">121</xref></sup> explains our verse as follows: when the prophet Jacob prophetically saw his son Dan in the form of a serpent, he was overtaken by fright and exclaimed, &#x201C;Save me, O Lord.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2615">122</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. GAD. Jacob prophesied that a troop (an army) would attack Gad but that he would ultimately be victorious.<sup><xref rid="fn2616">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHALL TROOP UPON HIM. <italic>Yegudennu</italic> (shall troop upon him) is similar to <italic>yegudennu</italic> (he invadeth) in <italic>the people that he invadeth</italic> (yegudennu) (Hab. 3:16).<sup><xref rid="fn2617">124</xref></sup> <italic>Yagud</italic> (he shall troop), like <italic>gedud</italic> (a troop), comes from the root <italic>gimel, dalet, dalet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2618">125</xref></sup> It is vocalized with a <italic>shuruk</italic> in place of a <italic>cholam</italic> like the word <italic>yarun</italic> (doth sing) in <italic>But the righteous doth sing</italic> (yarun) <italic>and rejoice</italic> (Prov. 29:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2619">126</xref></sup> We do not know exactly to what incident Jacob was referring because we don&#x2019;t know all the tribulations that our ancestors endured.<sup><xref rid="fn2620">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AS FOR ASHER. Some say that the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>me-asher</italic> (as for Asher) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn2621">128</xref></sup> However, I believe that what our clause means is: from the land of Asher &#x201C;fat bread&#x201D; will come.<sup><xref rid="fn2622">129</xref></sup> Bread in our verse is in the feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn2623">130</xref></sup> We find the same to be the case with the words house,<sup><xref rid="fn2624">131</xref></sup> place,<sup><xref rid="fn2625">132</xref></sup> hand,<sup><xref rid="fn2626">133</xref></sup> fire,<sup><xref rid="fn2627">134</xref></sup> eye,<sup><xref rid="fn2628">135</xref></sup> wind,<sup><xref rid="fn2629">136</xref></sup> land,<sup><xref rid="fn2630">137</xref></sup> chest<sup><xref rid="fn2631">138</xref></sup> and people.<sup><xref rid="fn2632">139</xref></sup></p>
<p>[ROYAL DAINTIES.] The meaning of <italic>ma&#x2019;adanne melekh</italic> (royal dainties) is known.<sup><xref rid="fn2633">140</xref></sup> Moses similarly said concerning Asher, <italic>And let him dip his foot in oil</italic> (Deut. 33:24).<sup><xref rid="fn2634">141</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. NAPHTALI IS A HIND LET LOOSE. The word <italic>sheluchah</italic> (let loose) means a gift,<sup><xref rid="fn2635">142</xref></sup> and the one who receives such a gift responds with goodly words.<sup><xref rid="fn2636">143</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that <italic>hind</italic> refers to Deborah and that <italic>He giveth goodly words</italic> alludes to Barak who joined her in a song to God.<sup><xref rid="fn2637">144</xref></sup> Scripture mentions Naphtali<sup><xref rid="fn2638">145</xref></sup> because Barak came from the tribe of Naphtali.<sup><xref rid="fn2639">146</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. JOSEPH IS A FRUITFUL VINE. <italic>Ben</italic> means a branch<sup><xref rid="fn2640">147</xref></sup> and it is a feminine noun.<sup><xref rid="fn2641">148</xref></sup> <italic>Ben</italic> in <italic>And the branch</italic> (ben) <italic>that Thou madest strong for Thyself</italic> (Ps. 80:16) has a similar meaning. Grammatically speaking <italic>porat</italic> (fruitful) is a <italic>po&#x2019;elet</italic>. A feminine singular participle can come in two paradigms,<sup><xref rid="fn2642">149</xref></sup> viz., <italic>oyevah</italic> and <italic>oyevet</italic>, and similarly <italic>porah</italic> and <italic>porat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2643">150</xref></sup> The word <italic>porat</italic> is related to the word <italic>poriyyah</italic> (fruitful) (Ps. 128:3). There is a commentator who connects <italic>porat</italic> to the word <italic>porot</italic> (branches) in <italic>And brought forth branches</italic> (porot) (Ezek. 17:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2644">151</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Bible repeats the phrase <italic>ben porot</italic> twice in succession, for that is Hebrew style. Compare, <italic>For, lo, Thine enemies, O Lord, For, lo, Thine enemies shall perish</italic> (Ps. 92:10). The repetition of a phrase indicates permanence. According to the second quoted interpretation<sup><xref rid="fn2645">152</xref></sup> a <italic>tav</italic> has been substituted for a <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2646">153</xref></sup> as in the case of the <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>ve-shavat</italic> (then it shall return) in <italic>then it shall return</italic> (ve-shavat) <italic>to the prince</italic> (Ezek. 46:17).<sup><xref rid="fn2647">154</xref></sup></p>
<p>[ITS BRANCHES RUN OVER THE WALL.] Joseph was as a fruitful vine. He gave birth to branches, each one of which ran over the wall; i.e., the branches were so tall that they ran over fortified walls.<sup><xref rid="fn2648">155</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture here combines <italic>banot</italic> (branches) with <italic>tza&#x2019;adah</italic> (run)<sup><xref rid="fn2649">156</xref></sup> in a manner similar to <italic>Dead flies</italic> (zevuve) <italic>make the ointment of the perfumer fetid</italic> (yavish) (Eccles. 10:1). <sup><xref rid="fn2650">157</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. HAVE DEALT BITTERLY WITH HIM. Rabbi Samuel Ha-Nagid explains this verse as meaning: they set his gall for a target (<italic>va-yemareruhu</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2651">158</xref></sup> and then the archers shot at him (<italic>va-robbu</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2652">159</xref></sup> The word <italic>rabbim</italic> (archers) in <italic>Call together the archers</italic> (rabbim) <italic>against Babylon, All them that bend the bow</italic> (Jer. 50:29) is similar to <italic>va-robbu</italic> in our verse. <sup><xref rid="fn2653">160</xref></sup> <italic>His archers compass me round about&#x2026;He poureth out my gall upon the ground</italic> (Job 16:13) is similar to our verse.<sup><xref rid="fn2654">161</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HATED HIM. First they hated him and then they set up his gall as a target. We must thus explain <italic>va-yistemuhu</italic> to mean, and they had hated him.<sup><xref rid="fn2655">162</xref></sup> This<sup><xref rid="fn2656">163</xref></sup> alludes to Joseph&#x2019;s brothers who sold him into slavery.</p>
<p>24. BUT HIS BOW ABODE FIRM. His bow abode in a firm place.<sup><xref rid="fn2657">164</xref></sup></p>
<p>WERE MADE SUPPLE. <italic>Va-yafozzu</italic> means, and they strengthened themselves. I believe that <italic>va-yafozzu</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>mefazzez</italic> (leaping) (II Sam. 6:16).<sup><xref rid="fn2658">165</xref></sup> There are those who connect <italic>va-yafozzu</italic> to the word <italic>paz</italic> (pure gold).<sup><xref rid="fn2659">166</xref></sup> However, their interpretation makes no sense.</p>
<p>The meaning of our text (v. 23 and 24) is that the archers hated Joseph and gathered together to spill his gall. However, his adversaries were afraid of him because his bow and hands were strong. They therefore could not overcome him.</p>
<p>BY THE HANDS OF THE MIGHTY ONE OF JACOB. FROM THENCE. <italic>The Mighty One of Jacob</italic> alludes to the Lord. From the power that Joseph received from <italic>the Mighty One of Jacob</italic> he was able to become, and indeed became, &#x201C;the shepherd of the stone of Israel.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2660">167</xref></sup> And so it was, for we read, <italic>And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father&#x2019;s household, with bread</italic> (Gen. 47:12). Jacob employed the term <italic>Mighty One of Jacob</italic> for God<sup><xref rid="fn2661">168</xref></sup> because God knew of his deep love for Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn2662">169</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>stone</italic> is the very thing.<sup><xref rid="fn2663">170</xref></sup> Some say<sup><xref rid="fn2664">171</xref></sup> that <italic>mi-sham</italic> (from thence) should be interpreted from that time. However, we never find the word <italic>sham</italic> (there) to have this meaning anywhere in Scripture. This commentator also interprets <italic>the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel</italic> as meaning: the one whose heart died and was as stone,<sup><xref rid="fn2665">172</xref></sup> but who revived to feed (<italic>ro&#x2019;eh</italic>), i.e., to live by eating. However, this interpretation is farfetched.</p>
<p>25. EVEN BY THE GOD OF THY FATHER. I believe that this verse is connected to the preceding one.<sup><xref rid="fn2666">173</xref></sup> Its meaning is: the power which you possess came to you <italic>from the God of thy father, who shall help thee</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>me-el</italic> (even by God) is also to be prefixed to <italic>ve-et</italic> (and by).<sup><xref rid="fn2667">174</xref></sup> The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>me-el</italic> is like the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>be-el</italic> (as God) (Ex. 6:3) which is also to be prefixed to <italic>u-ve-shemi</italic> (but by my name).<sup><xref rid="fn2668">175</xref></sup> Thus <italic>And from the Almighty, who shall bless thee</italic> repeats the idea contained in <italic>From the God of thy father, who shall help thee</italic>.</p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon explains the phrase <italic>me-el avikha</italic> to mean, I will ask of the God of thy fathers.<sup><xref rid="fn2669">176</xref></sup> It is possible that <italic>With blessings of heaven above</italic> is connected to, <italic>From the God of thy father</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2670">177</xref></sup> The meaning of our text is explained by <italic>They (the blessings) shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the prince among his brethren</italic> (v. 26).<sup><xref rid="fn2671">178</xref></sup></p>
<p>BLESSSINGS OF THE DEEP. Moses similarly said, <italic>And for the precious things of the earth and the fullness thereof</italic> (Deut. 33:13).<sup><xref rid="fn2672">179</xref></sup> The word <italic>tehom</italic> (the deep) is feminine both in our verse and in Deut. (33:16). It is similarly feminine in <italic>The deep</italic> (tehom) <italic>made it to grow</italic> (Ezek. 31:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2673">180</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath</italic> is that rain will descend from the heavens above upon the land of Joseph and that the deep which coucheth beneath the earth will fill its rivers and springs with an abundance of water.</p>
<p>BLESSINGS OF THE BREASTS, AND OF THE WOMB. Jacob likened the breasts to heaven and the womb to the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn2674">181</xref></sup> its meaning being that Joseph will be blessed with many children.<sup><xref rid="fn2675">182</xref></sup> The opposite of this blessing is the curse, <italic>Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts</italic> (Hos. 9:14).</p>
<p>26. THE BLESSINGS OF THY FATHER. These blessings which I have blessed you with are mighty and are added to the blessing with which my progenitors blessed me.<sup><xref rid="fn2676">183</xref></sup></p>
<p>[PROGENITORS.] <italic>Horai</italic> is to be rendered my begetters.<sup><xref rid="fn2677">184</xref></sup> <italic>Va-tahar</italic> (and she gave birth to) in <italic>and she gave birth to</italic> (va-tahar) <italic>Miriam</italic> (I Chron. 4:17)<sup><xref rid="fn2678">185</xref></sup> and <italic>horah</italic> (brought forth) in, <italic>A man-child is brought forth</italic> (horah) (Job 3:3)<sup><xref rid="fn2679">186</xref></sup> are similar.</p>
<p>UNTO THE UTMOST BOUND. <italic>Ta&#x2019;avat</italic> (utmost bound of) comes from the same root as <italic>ve-hitavvitem</italic> (and ye shall mark out your line) (Num. 34:10). The meaning of our verse is: these blessings will be as high as the line marked out by the everlasting hills.</p>
<p>THE PRINCE AMONG HIS BRETHREN. <italic>Nezir</italic> (prince of) comes from the same root as <italic>nezer</italic> (crown).<sup><xref rid="fn2680">187</xref></sup> It is in the construct with <italic>echav</italic> (his brethren) and is therefore vocalized <italic>nezir</italic>. Compare, <italic>nediv lev</italic> (willing-hearted) (Ex. 35:22).</p>
<p>27. BENJAMIN. Jacob compared Benjamin to a wolf because Benjamin was mighty. The men of Gibeah are proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn2681">188</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE PREY. <italic>Ad</italic> (the prey) has the same meaning as the Aramaic word for spoil (<italic>ada</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2682">189</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>ad</italic> in <italic>Then is the prey</italic> (ad) <italic>of a great spoil divided</italic> (Is. 33:23) and in <italic>Until the day that I rise up to the prey</italic> (ad) (Zeph. 3:8); and <italic>iddim</italic> (a polluted garment) (Is. 64:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2683">190</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>[AND AT EVEN HE DIVIDETH.] At even he divideth among his children the prey that he has taken as spoil. Joshua says<sup><xref rid="fn2684">191</xref></sup> that our verse alludes to King Saul who defeated the Amalekites.<sup><xref rid="fn2685">192</xref></sup> He explains <italic>In the morning</italic> as alluding to the beginning of Israel&#x2019;s kingdom<sup><xref rid="fn2686">193</xref></sup> and <italic>at even</italic> as referring to the period of Israel&#x2019;s exile with regard to Mordecai. However, this interpretation is the way of the Midrash.<sup><xref rid="fn2687">194</xref></sup> Onkelos&#x2019; interpretation of our verse is well known.<sup><xref rid="fn2688">195</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS BLESSING. The blessing which Jacob gave each one of his sons came to pass upon each one. The meaning of <italic>every one according to his blessing</italic> is similar in meaning to <italic>each man according to the interpretation of his dream</italic> (Gen. 41:11).<sup><xref rid="fn2689">196</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND HE CHARGED THEM. He (Jacob) charged that all should go along with Joseph to bury him.<sup><xref rid="fn2690">197</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. HE GATHERED UP HIS FEET INTO THE BED. Until then he had been sitting on the bed with his feet dangling over its edge as is contemporarily the custom in Christian communities. The beds in Moslem countries are constructed differently from the beds in Christian countries.<sup><xref rid="fn2691">198</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2494"><sup>1</sup> Since Scripture concludes with <italic>and this is that their father spoke unto them and blessed them</italic> (v. 28), it implies that what precedes are blessings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2495"><sup>2</sup> These three sons were castigated, not blessed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2496"><sup>3</sup> I.E. translates <italic>yeter se&#x2019;et</italic> (the excellency of dignity) as the advantage (<italic>yeter</italic>) of rank (<italic>se&#x2019;et</italic>) and interprets accordingly. It should be noted that <italic>se&#x2019;et</italic> comes from the root <italic>nun, sin, alef</italic>, meaning raised up or exalted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2497"><sup>4</sup> I.E. translates our line: The advantage of rank / the advantage of power. The first in rank has dominion over those below him, hence power is parallel to rank and the advantage of power means the same as the advantage of rank. Modem scholars refer to this as synonymous parallelism. The latter is a feature of Biblical poetry.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2498"><sup>5</sup> According to this interpretation our line reads: Unstable as water / you will not have the advantage; i.e., because you acted unstably as water does, you will not have the advantage of rank and power.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2499"><sup>6</sup> <italic>Totar</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>cholam</italic>. If <italic>al totar</italic> means you will not have the advantage then <italic>totar</italic> is a passive, i.e., a <italic>hofal</italic>, and should be written <italic>tutar</italic> and not <italic>totar</italic> which is a <italic>hifil</italic> and a causative. Cf. Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2500"><sup>7</sup> The advantage of this interpretation is that <italic>totar</italic> is not irregularly vocalized. <italic>Al totar</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic> imperfect with the meaning of a perfect It literally means you will not gain. Here it means you did not gain anything; that is, you gained nothing by acting rashly. For an alternate interpretation see Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2501"><sup>8</sup> The point is <italic>al totar</italic> cannot be translated as you gained nothing because <italic>al</italic> is an imperative meaning don&#x2019;t This comment also negates the first interpretation quoted by I.E. since there, too, <italic>al</italic> is not used as an imperative (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2502"><sup>9</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that one irregular usage of <italic>al</italic> does not disprove his contention that <italic>al</italic> is always used as an imperative.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2503"><sup>10</sup> In other words <italic>al totar</italic> means do not seek any advantage. This comment presents a problem. I.E. reads, &#x201C;even one as insignificant as water (<italic>afilu pachaz ka-mayim</italic>).&#x201D; This reading is extremely difficult since up to now I.E. explains <italic>pachaz ka-mayim</italic> as referring to Reuben&#x2019;s action, not to Reuben&#x2019;s punishment. Filwarg suggests deleting these words. Krinsky and Cherez emend <italic>afilu</italic> to <italic>attah</italic> (you). Weiser suggests that this comment has been misplaced and that its proper place is after Saadiah&#x2019;s comment. In this case I.E. amplifies Saadiah&#x2019;s explanation that <italic>pachaz</italic> means something insignificant. However, it appears that I.E. anticipated Saadiah&#x2019;s interpretation of <italic>pachaz ka-mayim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2504"><sup>11</sup> <italic>Totar</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic> and follows the paradigm of <italic>tosaf</italic> which is also a <italic>hifil</italic>. Since <italic>tosaf</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic> the text should have read <italic>tosef</italic>. But as the word comes at the end of a verse the <italic>tzere</italic> changes to a <italic>pattach</italic>. Similarly <italic>totar</italic> should have been written <italic>toter</italic> but as it concludes a segment of a poetical line the <italic>tzere</italic> changes to a <italic>pattach</italic>. Cf. Rashi on Job 40:32 (Cherez). Thus <italic>totar</italic> is similar to <italic>tosaf</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2505"><sup>12</sup> As it must be if we interpret the word to mean unstable. <italic>Pachaz</italic> (unstable) comes from the root <italic>chet, peh, zayin (chafaz</italic>) which means to hurry. However, the root of <italic>pachaz</italic> is obviously <italic>peh, chet, zayin</italic>. By interpreting <italic>pachaz</italic> to mean unstable we are saying that we must invert the root <italic>chet, peh, zayin</italic> into <italic>peh, chet, zayin</italic>. However, according to Saadiah <italic>pachaz</italic> has its own root, <italic>peh, chet, zayin</italic>, and means light, insignificant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2506"><sup>13</sup> The part of the verse under discussion reads: Then defiledst thou / my couch went up. I.E. reads &#x201C;my couch went up&#x201D; as if written, my couch went up from me. He interprets it to mean, my couch was taken away from me. According to I.E., in Chapter 7 of his <italic>Yesod Mora</italic>, Jacob ceased cohabiting with his wives after Reuben defiled his couch. His reason was: Rachel was dead, Bilhah defiled, and he was angry at Leah because of what her son did and therefore slept neither with her nor her handmaiden Zilpah. &#x201C;My couch went up&#x201D; thus means, my conjugal bed ceased to function. Filwarg suggests that the reference may be only to Bilhah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2507"><sup>14</sup> In this case <italic>yetzu&#x2019;i alah</italic> means my couch was cut off or destroyed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2508"><sup>15</sup> In other words, <italic>and he was not to be reckoned in the genealogy as first born</italic> refers to Joseph, not to Reuben.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2509"><sup>16</sup> The point is all twelve sons were brethren, Why, then, does Jacob single out Simeon and Levi as brethren? Scripture tells us that at Shechem <italic>two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi&#x2026;took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males</italic> (Gen. 34:25). Simeon and Levi were thus brothers in council with regard to the destruction of Shechem (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2510"><sup>17</sup> That is, one can tell by looking at them that they employ weapons of violence (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2511"><sup>18</sup> <italic>Mekherotehem</italic> and <italic>ha-karat</italic> come from different roots (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2512"><sup>19</sup> Our text is thus to be rendered: weapons of violence are their possessions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2513"><sup>20</sup> Deut. 2:6 is thus to be rendered: ye shall dig water of them for money; that is, pay them so that they will give you permission to dig for water (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2514"><sup>21</sup> That is, they sold themselves to weapons of destruction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2515"><sup>22</sup> Cf. Kimchi in Jud. 5:18. Although different verbs are employed in our verse and in Jud. 5:18, the idea is the same. For an alternate interpretation see Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2516"><sup>23</sup> It means in the land of their origin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2517"><sup>24</sup> If <italic>mekherotehem</italic> means in their land wherein they dwelt, Scripture should have read <italic>bi-mekherotehem</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2518"><sup>25</sup> Scripture should have read <italic>be-vet</italic> rather than <italic>bet</italic>. We thus see that Scripture occasionally omits the prepositional <italic>bet</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2519"><sup>26</sup> Scripture should have read <italic>be-ma&#x2019;on</italic> rather than <italic>ma&#x2019;on</italic>. See above note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2520"><sup>27</sup> Cf. Gen. 34. <italic>Weapons of violence their kinship</italic> should thus be rendered: they employed weapons of violence in the land of their origin.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2522"><sup>29</sup> The word <italic>ba</italic> means to come. In Eccles. 1:5 the word <italic>ba</italic> means sets, i.e., when the sun goes down (sets) it is no longer in the sky. Similarly the word <italic>tavo</italic>, which comes from the same root, here means will set. Let my soul not set from their council means let my soul always be in their council.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2523"><sup>30</sup> Rabbi Aaron interpreted <italic>Let my soul not come in to their council</italic> to mean let my soul not set from their council. The verse means I do not want my soul to be in their council. Thus Rabbi Aaron&#x2019;s interpretation is precisely the opposite of what the verse actually says.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2524"><sup>31</sup> We thus see that Jacob was angry at what his sons did to the inhabitants of Shechem and on his deathbed would not praise them for this act.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2525"><sup>32</sup> That is, in a positive manner, not that Jacob castigated his sons but praised them for slaying the inhabitants of Shechem and destroying its wall. Rabbi Aaron interprets verses 6-7 as follows: Let my soul not set from their council, from their assembly let my glory not be excluded; For in their anger they slew men, and in their self-will they uprooted a cursed wall; For their anger was fierce, and their wrath it was cruel. Rabbi Aaron interprets verse 8 as follows: I will give them a good portion in Jacob (<italic>achallekem be-ya&#x2019;akov</italic>) and may they multiply in Israel (<italic>va-afitzem bi&#x2019;yisra&#x2019;el</italic>) (Filwarg).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2534"><sup>41</sup> That <italic>kavod</italic> refers to the body.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2536"><sup>43</sup> I.E. interprets this verse in his commentaries on Psalms as follows: So that all that have a soul (<italic>kavod</italic>) may sing praise to thee.

<ftnote id="fn2537"><sup>44</sup> <italic>Kavod</italic> must refer to the soul for otherwise body is mentioned twice in our verse.

<ftnote id="fn2565"><sup>72</sup> That is, it means a child. <italic>Shilyah</italic> means the afterbirth, or placenta and, by extension, the child which was in the placenta.

Both Filwarg and Cherez note that I.E.&#x2019;s comment as written in the printed text is incomprehensible. They suggest their own emendation. However, the reading in <italic>Vat.

The reading in the printed texts probably arose because a scribe omitted <italic>Binding his foal</italic>, etc., and a latter scribe changed <italic>ve-yehiyeh</italic> to <italic>o yehiyeh</italic> in an attempt to make sense out of the remaining fragment.

<ftnote id="fn2589"><sup>96</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>u-leven shinnayim</italic> means white teeth not whiteness of teeth; hence he points out that <italic>u-leven</italic> is an adjective (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2590"><sup>97</sup> The dual form is usually limited to nouns that come in pairs, i.e., <italic>oznayim</italic> (ears), <italic>yadayim</italic> (hands). However, there is more than one tooth in the mouth. Hence the plural of <italic>shen</italic> (tooth) should not be in the dual form.

<ftnote id="fn2592"><sup>99</sup> According to Krinsky the reference is to an oath that Judah took to be especially scrupulous in what he would eat and what he would look upon (women). Judah considered certain permitted foods as &#x201C;unclean&#x201D; and abstained from them. Judah took his oath of superpiety after the incident of Tamar (Gen. 39) as a form of penance and to ensure that henceforth he would act more saintly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2593"><sup>100</sup> It implies that the other brothers were not as saintly as Judah in that they did not take the same oath that Judah did (Krinsky). Or this interpretation is extremely far fetched because there is no allusion to it in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2594"><sup>101</sup> Jacob in prophesying about his children first prophesied about the sons of Leah, then about the sons of the handmaids, and finally concerning the sons of Rachel.

<ftnote id="fn2595"><sup>102</sup> Hence Issachar is listed between Zebulun and Dan. Cf. Josh. 19.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2597"><sup>104</sup> Thus the border or shore (<italic>chof</italic>) protects or covers (<italic>chofef</italic>) the ships. Weiser suggests that what I.E. means by border is an inlet where the ships are anchored for protection.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2601"><sup>108</sup> According to Filwarg. The point is that this type of beast carries heavy loads and therefore often couches down to rest when burdened. It should be noted that I.E. is vague and that Weiser, Cherez and Krinsky offer other interpretations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2602"><sup>109</sup> I.E. does not tell us what he means by &#x201C;arranged rows.&#x201D; The reference may be to the burdens borne by the ass which are arranged in two rows, one on the right side of the animal and one on the left (Krinsky), or to the rows of the sheep-folds (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2603"><sup>110</sup> <italic>Vat.

<ftnote id="fn2604"><sup>111</sup> For the standards see Num. 2. The four tribes with standards were: Reuben, Judah, Ephraim and Dan. The first three were descended from Jacob&#x2019;s wives, Dan was the son of Bilhah, Rachael&#x2019;s handmaid.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2605"><sup>112</sup> This explains <italic>Dan shall judge his people</italic>, i.e., he shall be a ruler over the tribes descended from the handmaids.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2606"><sup>113</sup> Scripture says that Dan shall be a serpent in the way. I.E. points out that Jacob compared Dan to a serpent only with regard to his ability to harm his enemies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2607"><sup>114</sup> Hence <italic>shefifon</italic> means a snake. It is so called because it bruises (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2608"><sup>115</sup> When the serpent strikes (<italic>that biteth the horse&#x2019;s heels, so that his rider falleth backward</italic>), he is not out of danger.

<ftnote id="fn2609"><sup>116</sup> The <italic>caf</italic> of <italic>li-shu&#x2019;atekha</italic> (for thy salvation) does not refer to God but to Dan. I.E. interprets thus because he believes our verse to be a prayer to God on behalf of Dan.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2611"><sup>118</sup> Here, too, the &#x201C;thy&#x201D; in <italic>thy salvation</italic> does not refer to God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2612"><sup>119</sup> The Messiah (Cherez). Any of the Judean kings descended from David (Weiser).

Ebr</italic>. 38 reads, &#x201C;Thy salvation (thy victory) is similar in that &#x201C;thy&#x201D; refers either to David or to the anointed his son.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2613"><sup>120</sup> The subject of <italic>va-yomer</italic> is Dan, i.e., Dan after biting the horse&#x2019;s heel will say, <italic>I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord</italic> (Filwarg).

<ftnote id="fn2614"><sup>121</sup> According to Weiser, the reference is to Rabbi Isaac, one of the early Gaonim of Sura.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2615"><sup>122</sup> &#x201C;Save me, O Lord&#x201D; is a paraphrase of, <italic>I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn2660"><sup>167</sup> <italic>The Stone of Israel</italic> refers to the children of Israel (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2661"><sup>168</sup> Jacob could have employed the term, the Mighty One of Abraham or the Mighty One of Isaac (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2662"><sup>169</sup> Joseph became &#x201C;the shepherd of Israel&#x201D; because of Jacob&#x2019;s merit. God chose Joseph for this great honor and thereby elevated him above all his brothers because the Lord knew Jacob&#x2019;s love for Joseph. Hence <italic>By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob etc</italic>. means: you became the shepherd of the stone (children) of Israel from the power that came to you from the God who knew of my deep love for you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2663"><sup>170</sup> <italic>Stone</italic> represents essence, the very thing. The reference is to Jacob and his family. Cf. Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2664"><sup>171</sup> The reference is to Rabbi Isaac ibn Giat (Weiser, Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2665"><sup>172</sup> The reference is to Jacob whose heart died within him when he was told that Joseph was alive (Gen. 45:26,27). In I Sam. 25:37 such an experience is described as the heart turning to stone (Weiser, Cherez). According to Krinsky the reference is to Jacob and his family who would have died (their hearts would have turned to stone) had Joseph not fed them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2666"><sup>173</sup> <italic>Even by God</italic> literally reads, from the God (<italic>me&#x2019;el</italic>). This term presents a problem. What came from God? I.E.&#x2019;s answer is that from God refers to Joseph&#x2019;s power which is referred to in the previous verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2667"><sup>174</sup> That is, <italic>ve-et</italic> is to be read as if written <italic>u-me-et</italic> (and from by).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2668"><sup>175</sup> Our text is thus to be read as if written: From the God of thy father who shall help thee, and from the Almighty who shall bless thee. Ex. 6:3 literally reads: <italic>and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty</italic> (be-el shaddai) <italic>but my name</italic> (u-shemi) <italic>YHVH I made Me not known to them</italic>. According to I.E. we should read the aforementioned as if written: and I appeared&#x2026;as God Almighty (<italic>be-el shaddai</italic>) but with My name (<italic>u-ve-shemi</italic>) YHVH I made Me not known to them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2669"><sup>176</sup> Saadiah, too, was bothered by the term <italic>from the God</italic>. He explained <italic>from the God</italic> not as connected to the previous verse, but as a new thought; viz., I will ask of the God of thy fathers that he help thee and of the Almighty that he bless thee (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2670"><sup>177</sup> This interpretation, like the previous one, deals with the problem of verse 25 opening with the words <italic>From the God</italic>. It similarly rejects the notion that verse 25 is connected to verse 24. It, too, sees in verse 25 a new thought. It explains <italic>From the God</italic> as relating to the blessings mentioned in the second half of the verse, which shall come to you <italic>from the God of thy father</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2671"><sup>178</sup> Verse 26 seems to conclude the blessing started in verse 25. The sequence thus appears to be: From God shall come to you blessings of the heavens above, of the deep that coucheth beneath, blessings of the breasts and womb. The aforementioned blessings shall be added to my mighty blessings and to the blessings of my progenitors and shall be on the head of Joseph and on the crown of the head of the prince among his brethren (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2672"><sup>179</sup> So Cherez. The point is that the blessing of the deep means that the land will be well watered and fertile, as Moses blessed the tribe of Joseph with a fertile land. Krinsky suggests that our text is corrupt and that the proof text should read: <italic>For the precious things of heaven, for the dew, And for the deep that coucheth beneath</italic> (Deut. 33:13). In this case I.E. is pointing out that Jacob and Moses&#x2019; blessings are identical.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2673"><sup>180</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>tehom rovetzet</italic> (the deep that coucheth). Deut. 33:13 reads, <italic>u-mi-tehom rovetzet</italic> (and for the deep that coucheth). <italic>Rovetzet</italic> (coucheth) is feminine, hence <italic>tehom</italic> (the deep) must be feminine. Ezek. 31:4 reads, <italic>tehom romematehu</italic> (the deep made it to grow). Since <italic>romematehu</italic> is feminine, <italic>tehom</italic>, too, must be feminine. I.E. makes this point because <italic>tehom</italic> is masculine in Ps. 42:8. Thus we see that <italic>tehom</italic> is both masculine and feminine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2674"><sup>181</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>With blessings of heaven&#x2026;Blessings of the deep&#x2026;Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb</italic>. According to I.E. breast and womb are similar to heaven and earth in that they produce life-giving substance and bring forth fruit. Hence they are included in the same verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2675"><sup>182</sup> For an alternate interpretation see Krinsky and Cherez.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2676"><sup>183</sup> The point being, may you be blessed with the mighty blessings with which I bless you (<italic>birkat avikhah gaveru</italic>) plus the blessings with which my begetters blessed me (<italic>al birkat horai</italic>). Cherez explains that I.E. interprets <italic>al</italic> (beyond) as meaning <italic>im</italic> (with, plus).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2677"><sup>184</sup> The root of <italic>horai</italic> is <italic>heh, resh, heh</italic> which means to be pregnant or to conceive. However, inasmuch as <italic>horai</italic> is in the plural it must refer to both Jacob&#x2019;s mother and father. We obviously cannot explain <italic>horai</italic> as meaning the ones who bore me. Rather it must be interpreted to mean the ones who begot me (Cherez).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2678"><sup>185</sup> Here, too, the root <italic>heh, resh, heh</italic> does not means to conceive or be pregnant with, for Chronicles deals with births and not with pregnancies. Thus <italic>va-tahar</italic> in I Chron. 4:17 means she gave birth to.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2679"><sup>186</sup> Here, too, the root <italic>heh, resh, heh</italic> does not mean to conceive but to bring forth, for its parallel reads <italic>ivvaled</italic> (I was born).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2680"><sup>187</sup> It means crowned, the one who was crowned over his brethren (Krinsky, Weiser and Cherez). Filwarg suggests reading, &#x201C;From the same root as <italic>nazir</italic> (Nazirite).&#x201D; This reading fits in very well with I.E.&#x2019;s comparison of <italic>nezir</italic> to <italic>nediv</italic>, for <italic>nazir</italic> has the same vocalization as <italic>nadiv</italic>, both in the absolute and in the construct. Thus in the absolute we have <italic>nazir</italic> and <italic>nadiv</italic> and in the construct <italic>nezir</italic> and <italic>nediv</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2681"><sup>188</sup> At Gibeah 26,700 Benjamites defeated an army of 400,000 Israelites. Cf. Jud. 20.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2683"><sup>190</sup> I.E. on Is. 64:5 notes that a garment taken in spoil is polluted by blood. He points out that <italic>iddim</italic> and <italic>ed</italic> are similar. I.E. interprets <italic>ed</italic> (prey) to mean spoil.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2686"><sup>193</sup> At the beginning of Israel&#x2019;s kingdom Saul, who came from the tribe of Benjamin, despoiled Amalek. In exile, Mordecai the Benjamite despoiled Haman who was an Amalekite. Cf. Es. 8:1,2, <italic>On that day did king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman&#x2026;unto Esther the queen&#x2026;And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2687"><sup>194</sup> Cf. <italic>Bereshit Rabbah</italic> 99:3 and <italic>Tanchuma</italic> 1:14; 2:15. It is hard to understand why I.E. quotes this interpretation in the name of a Karaite when it is found in the Midrash.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2688"><sup>195</sup> Onkelos explains the &#x201C;spoil&#x201D; as referring to the portions which the priests received from sacrifices offered in the temple which was erected in the territory of Benjamin.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2690"><sup>197</sup> <italic>And he charged them</italic> refers to <italic>bury me with my fathers</italic>. In the text they are not directly connected, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. Krinsky points out that Jacob had made Joseph take an oath to bury him in the cave of Machpelah (Gen. 47:30). He now commanded all of his sons to join Joseph in his burial. Therefore, according to Krinsky, I.E. notes that the charge in our verse was to all of Jacob&#x2019;s sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2691"><sup>198</sup> I.E. explains that Egyptian beds were the same as the beds used in Christian countries; hence it was possible for Jacob&#x2019;s feet to dangle from his bed. However, had his bed been like those used in Moslem countries, that is, a bed that lies flat on the ground, this would have been impossible. I.E. makes this point so that readers in Moslem countries could understand how Jacob could be in bed with his feet over its side.</ftnote>

<p>AND HE WAS PUT IN A COFFIN. Someone put him in a coffin.<sup><xref rid="fn2705">14</xref></sup> The root of <italic>va-yisem</italic> is <italic>yod, sin, mem</italic> and follows the paradigm of <italic>va-yitzer</italic> (formed) (Gen. 2:7).<sup><xref rid="fn2706">15</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Jonah, the grammarian, says that <italic>va-yisem</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic> in place of a <italic>shuruk</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2707">16</xref></sup> However, I consider this interpretation to be far-fetched.<sup><xref rid="fn2708">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IN A COFFIN.] The reason why <italic>ba-aron</italic> (in a coffin) is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> is that it signifies the coffin which he had prepared for himself. <sup><xref rid="fn2709">18</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2692"><sup>1</sup> This according to I.E. is the way a body is embalmed (Weiser). Krinsky holds that I.E. believes that only Jacob was embalmed in this manner so that his body would be spared the desecration that the usual embalming procedure entails.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2693"><sup>2</sup> Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Cant. 2:13, &#x201C;<italic>Chanetah</italic> means sweetened. Others say it means powdered, from the word <italic>va-yechantu</italic>.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2694"><sup>3</sup> According to Krinsky, I.E. believes that Jacob prepared his own grave in the cave of Machpelah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2695"><sup>4</sup> The verse speaks of <italic>the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house</italic>. If the aforementioned are elders, why does the Bible refer to them as servants? Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. According to Cherez and Krinsky, I.E. was troubled by the clause <italic>all the servants of Pharaoh</italic>. If all the servants went along with Joseph to bury Jacob then no servants remained in Egypt to serve Pharaoh. This appears highly unlikely. Hence I.E. points out that <italic>all the servants</italic> refers to the Egyptians who accompanied Jacob&#x2019;s body, for all the Egyptians are called Pharaoh&#x2019;s servants.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2696"><sup>5</sup> Cf. Gen. 41:43, <italic>mirkevet ha-mishneh</italic> (the second chariot). This comment is omitted in some editions of the <italic>Mikraot Gedolot</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2697"><sup>6</sup> What I.E. means is, even though the actual burial of Jacob is reported in verse 13, it occurred before <italic>he made a mourning for his father seven days</italic>. This is so because the sages of the talmud say that mourning commences after the burial of the deceased. Cf. <italic>Sanhedrin</italic>. 47b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2698"><sup>7</sup> Since the mourning described in verse 10 took place after the burial of Jacob we cannot interpret <italic>And his sons did unto him</italic>, etc., as a report of what happened after the mourning for Jacob. It is rather a report of what Jacob&#x2019;s sons did for their father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2699"><sup>8</sup> There, too, I.E. interprets: and Esau harbored hatred toward Jacob.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2700"><sup>9</sup> Cf. Rashi, &#x201C;<italic>Lu</italic> is sometimes used to denote a request, or to denote, would that&#x2026;<italic>lu</italic> is also used to denote if and perhaps&#x2026;and <italic>lu</italic> is also sometimes used to denote it may be.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2701"><sup>10</sup> The usual form of this infinitive is <italic>asot</italic>, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2702"><sup>11</sup> The children of the third generation are the fourth generation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2703"><sup>12</sup> They weren&#x2019;t actually born on his knees. Joseph raised them; that is, he hugged them and placed them on his knees as a father does when raising his children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2704"><sup>13</sup> The text doesn&#x2019;t say who embalmed him. However, in view of verse 2, the reference must be to the physicians. Our text is thus abridged. It should have read: And the physicians embalmed Israel (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2705"><sup>14</sup> According to I.E. <italic>va-yisem</italic> is a <italic>kal</italic> which means, and he put However, the subject has been omitted. Hence we must interpret it as, and someone put. Similarly the word <italic>oto</italic> (him) is to be added to the text Hence <italic>va-yisem ba-aron</italic> should be rendered, and someone put him in a coffin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2706"><sup>15</sup> <italic>Va-yitzer</italic> is a <italic>peh yod, kal</italic>. So is <italic>va-yisem</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2707"><sup>16</sup> According to Rabbi Jonah ibn Janach <italic>va-yisem</italic> is a <italic>hofal</italic> from the root <italic>yod, sin, mem</italic> meaning, and he was put. However, if <italic>va-yisem</italic> was a <italic>hofal</italic> it would have been vocalized <italic>va-yusem</italic>. Hence Rabbi Jonah says that <italic>va-yisem</italic> has been vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic> in place of a <italic>shuruk</italic>. According to Rabbi Jonah <italic>va-yisem ba-aron</italic> is to be rendered: and he was put in a coffin. The advantage of this interpretation is that one does not have to add the pronoun <italic>oto</italic> (him) to the text and the subject is not omitted from the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2708"><sup>17</sup> If Scripture intended to use a <italic>hofal</italic>, it would have vocalized <italic>va-yisem</italic> like a <italic>hofal</italic>. In his <italic>Sefer Ha-Tzachot</italic> I.E. sharply criticizes Ibn Janach for suggesting that Biblical words be read other than as written. I.E. writes, &#x201C;Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul not to believe the words of the grammarian (Ibn Janach) who noted in his book (<italic>Sefer Ha-Rikmah</italic>) more than a hundred (Biblical) words that require change&#x2026;Heaven forbid such a notion&#x2026;his book is fit to be burned.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2709"><sup>18</sup> <italic>Be-aron</italic> means in a coffin. <italic>Ba-aron</italic> on the other hand means in the coffin. Hence our verse must be referring to a specific coffin, i.e., to the coffin that Joseph prepared for himself.</ftnote>
