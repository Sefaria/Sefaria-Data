SA HUC Roman_Norman.1,"This thesis provides an annotated translation of three examples of rabbinic literature dealing with various aspects of “ḥupah v<sup>e</sup>kiddushin”, the Jewish marriage ceremony: Josef Caro’s <span class=""underline"">Shulchan Arukh</span> (Even HaEzer, Chapter 55), Jeḥiel Michael Epstein’s <span class=""underline"">Arukh HaShulḥan</span> (Even HaEzer, Chapter 55), and Chief Rabbi Yitsḥak Isaac HaLevi Herzog’s <span class=""underline"">Ḥehkhal Yitsḥak</span> Even HaEzer, Volume II, Chapter 27). Representing three distinct eras in the history of the Halakha, and three equally distinct Jewish communities, these scholars bring to light decisions and local customs regarding all of the idiosyncracies inherent in the traditional Jewish marriage."
SA HUC Roman_Norman.2,"Josef Caro, and the comments of Moses Isserles, detail the laws and customs pertaining to the man and woman considered “betrothed”, the rights and responsibilities of all those involved in the familial structure of a betrothed couple, definitions of the terms “yiḥud” and “ḥupah” and the various ramifications of those definitions, and the validity of a Ketubah written before the marriage ceremony."
SA HUC Roman_Norman.3,"Jeḥiel Michael Epstein’s corresponding chapter is more extensive, although his topics are approximately the same: the prohibition of pre-marital sexual relations, definitions of the terms “yiḥud” and “ḥupah” and some of the possible conditions therein, the necessity of reciting the seven (groom’s) benedictions, whether or not witnesses are required for “yiḥud”, the rights and responsibilities of those involved in a betrothal situation, holding the “ḥupah” in the courtyard of the synagogue, the validity of a Ketubah written before marriage, and the ruling that betrothal does not imply a blood relationship."
SA HUC Roman_Norman.4,"Chief Rabbi Herzog’s responsum is against those who would hold the “ḥupah” inside the synagogue, as customary in Western Europe (and in America). He refuses to permit any reforms in the physical or religious structure of the marriage ceremony."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Introduction.1","The major issues presented in these pages concern themselves with several various facets of “ḥupah v<sup>e</sup>kiddushin”, the Jewish marriage ceremony. And, it should be noted, this ceremony is, in essence, more of a procedure, involving different stages of time and circumstance. For example, one must remember that “betrothal” and “marriage” do not only differ in terminology, but also in legal significance. A man may acquire a wife in a number of ways - constituting a “designation” or “setting her apart” - hence, betrothal; but this by no means constitutes the sanctification of that man as groom and that woman as bride, in marriage."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Introduction.2","Assuming the major significance in the minds of these authors was definition of terms: “ḥupah”, which we mistakenly assume to be just the bridal canopy, is, in reality, a much broader concept. According to some decisions, the “ḥupah” of a virgin bride differs from that of a non-virgin, a widow or a divorcee. For others, the “ḥupah” is a physical symbol of the couple’s first home. Still others insist that “ḥupah” is an act of intercourse (or the physical surroundings for such an act) for the sake of marriage. And, finally, one definition of “ḥupah” revolves around the concept of whose responsibility it is, her father or the groom-to-be, to provide for her well-being."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Introduction.3","Similarly, the question must be answered: from which exact moment in time should they be considered married? Is it upon their standing together under the canopy, when the wedding benedictions are recited, when they eat their first meal together in private, or when they first have sexual relations? Perhaps this is not such a vital question today, but in generations of unexpected circumstance, it was absolutely necessary to have exact definitions for all Jews to heed, and for all non-Jews to know."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Introduction.4","And so, Caro, in the 16th century, Epstein, in the 19th, and Herzog, in the 20th century, address themselves to these issues and others."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Introduction.5","First and foremost among their writings (as mentioned above) is the concept of “ḥupah”. For Caro, the “ḥupah” is “yiḥud”, the couple being together in private, which constitutes a formal designation of betrothal that is more valid than intercourse. Isserles, commenting on Caro’s definition, tells us that the Ashkenazi “ḥupah” is the entire ceremony of marriage, under a canopy, which is then followed by a meal eaten only in the presence of invited guests to make a “minyan” (10 men). For Epstein, several generations later, “ḥupah” is the legal marriage ceremony, with all its attendant customs and practices. And with Herzog, whose concern in this responsum is not necessarily the definition of “ḥupah”, we assume that his use of the term refers to the ceremony itself."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Introduction.6","As a resultant topic to that of “ḥupah”, the writers continue by discussing the specific status, rights, and prohibitions for those only betrothed and for those whose “ḥupah” and marriage, for some reason, is invalid. The questions of who must provide for a bethrothed woman, both in ordinary circumstances and in extraordinary instances, her claims to support in the event of a departure from her plans to be married (e.g. the death of her fiance or a divorce from the betrothal), and a ruling on whether or not marriage constitutes a blood relationship, are considered."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Introduction.7","Finally, Herzog, in this specific responsum, responds to those who would hold the “ḥupah” (i.e. the marriage ceremony) in the synagogue."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Introduction.8","<span dir=""rtl"">נם זה ז גם וה</span> All this is included, and much more. For no student can approach the rabbinic material only as academic endeavor."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Introduction.9","The world of the Halakhist is far removed from that of the contemporary American Jew, and not for mere philosophical reasons. To consider the Codes literature, the Jew must be willing to, not only devote time, but respond to the difficult task of accepting the rabbinic “gestalt” or “mind set”. Arguments and decisions such as those mentioned in these pages are not only law, they are life. The significance of “ḥupah” is not only legal, it is, in itself, a “Kiddushin”, a sanctified bond between two partners in an eternal search for meaning and fulfillment."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Introduction.10","The essence of this translation, then, is not to present the dogmatism of legal stricture and semantic; rather, it is, hopefully, to express a deep reverence for those who saw such meaning and holiness in, what is to many of us, pedestrian human activity."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Introduction.11","With warm appreciation to the two men whose teaching and guidance and love for <span dir=""rtl"">חכמת ישראל</span> led me to this literature, Rabbi Philip Horowitz and Professor Alexander Guttmann."

(In the case of) one who has intercourse with his betrothed for the sake of marriage after he has betrothed her - she is considered married from the moment of initial sexual (genital) contact; she is then his wife in all matters."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.13","From the moment when the betrothed enters into the “ḥupah”, it is permissable (for him) to have intercourse with her whenever he wishes: for behold, she is his wife completely, in every respect.

But, if she was menstruating (at the time), even though she entered into the “ḥupah” and he may have been alone with her (“yiḥud”), the marriage is not completed, and, hence, she is still (to be considered) as betrothed."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.14","IV. From his (the Rambam’s) words, it is clear that the essence of the “ḥupah” is really “yiḥud” for the sake of marriage. This “yiḥud” must be with the (proper forms of) preparation (lit. preparation and invitation) to live with her as man and wife; hence, he must bring her into his house, have “yiḥud” with her (there) and formally set her apart for himself. The bringing (her) into his house constitutes the “preparation”, and the setting her apart (designation) constitutes the “invitation” to live with him forever (from that moment on)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.15","The “yiḥud” can take the place of intercourse even if he does not have intercourse with her, (it is) only (necessary) that she be fit (permissable) for intercourse (with him), as I wrote."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.16","But, if the “yiḥud” is not to be a permanent one, even if there has been the proper (forms of) preparation, e.g. he took her to his house for several days, after which she was to return to her father’s house, (in such a case) even if he has had “yiḥud” with her, it is nothing (i.e. this “yiḥud” has no legal character). And it is an obvious thing, for even if the “yiḥud” was not in his house, e.g. if he arranged for a rendezvous place to (there) have “yiḥud” with her and set her apart for himself, after which he will take her to his house, from that moment (the time of the “yiḥud”, whatever it may be), she is legally a married woman, as it is written in Chapter 57."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.17","When he has “yiḥud” with her, he must recite the seven benedictions at the place of marriage (wherever it may be): that is, any rendezvous place for “yiḥud”, or he takes her to his house. The benedictions must precede marriage, although (the omission of) the benedictions do not hinder the validity of marriage, <span class=""underline"">ex post facto</span>, as it is written in Chapter 33. For this is what we have learned, that “a bride without the benediction is prohibited (for intercourse)”, (“without the benediction”) means to say “without marriage”, for marriage, in general, means only with (after) the benediction; on the other hand, the groom’s benedictions (in and of themselves) are insignificant (i.e. if there is no “ḥupah” the seven benedictions have no validity), as the Rambam wrote:"
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.18","(In the case of) one who betrothes a woman and recites the groom’s benediction, but does not have “yiḥud” with her in his house - she is still considered only betrothed, for the groom’s benediction does not constitute marriage, only entrance into the “ḥupah” (does)."

"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.20","V. This is what he (the Rambam) wrote: “If he has intercourse with her for the sake of marriage, she is considered married”, and it is clear from his words that, with (an act of) intercourse for the sake of marriage, she is considered married, even if he has not set her apart for himself, to take her to his house. And, in considering his words, one must make a distinction; for what the sages have said: (in the case of) one who has intercourse with his betrothed is to be flogged applies only if his intentions were not clearly for the sake of marriage; however, if the intention was (for the sake of) marriage, she is considered married because of (with) this intercourse."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.21","[illegible] (see above) is merely to take her to his house, for if such were the case, there would be no need for intercourse - “yiḥud” alone would suffice. Rather, he certainly holds, that since the sages decided that with “yiḥud” subsequent to the preparations (see above) she is considered married, and the “yiḥud” is only a preparation for (an act of) intercourse, how much the less is any preparation required for the intercourse proper."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.22","It is possible that there is no need for witnesses to the “yiḥud” (leading) to this intercourse, for this intercourse is not similar to intercourse for the sake of betrothal which requires witnesses; for it (intercourse) is the first stage in his acquisition (of her)."

"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.26","The Rambam holds that it is true: (her) entering under his domain constitutes marriage, but only in conjunction with “yiḥud”, because generally when he brings her into his house, he has “yiḥud” with her.

"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.44","In our time, since we do not have the custom of the groom and the bride eating together in one room where no one can enter (there); on the contrary, (since) all the attendants and members of the bridal party are there, (we) must know (exactly) what now constitutes the “ḥupah” which makes her (the bride) married (officially)."

"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.46","It appears to me that the things are as follows (thus): the father delivers his daughter first to his son-in-law amidst a group of his friends to be his wife; this is what is called marriage. After she has stood (stayed) one or two days, preparing the necessities for meals and dress, a house would be especially designated for (them) to rejoice there with the wedding guests and friends, and to make a meal, so that (in that house) they can have intercourse that night - there they bring in the bride; that house which has been prepared for his purpose is called a “ḥupah”. This is what is said in the Jerusalem Talmud: “The “ḥupah” is not an end in and of itself, rather (it is) a house wherein is a “ḥupah”, that is to say, that even though they have not yet placed (her) in the (marriage) litter, rather in a house wherein there is a litter, she immediately eats of the ‘T<sup>e</sup>rumah’”. (If she is the wife of a Cohen, she now has the privilege of eating the “T<sup>e</sup>rumah” - offering)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.47","Therefore (based on this) I say that our (idea of) “ḥupah” is the bringing of the bride when we lead her into a house where there are embroidered sheets; behold, the (exact) time of marriage in this case is the time of the father’s delivering (her) to the husband. He (the groom) may (now) inherit her, but he may not be defiled because of her, nor does he have the right to annul her vows, until she enters the “ḥupah”. And once she enters the “ḥupah.”, she is (considered) as his wife in all matters, except that he is forbidden from having intercourse with her until he recites the seven benedictions. And if he does have intercourse with her after the marriage but without the “ḥupah” (i.e. without the benedictions), he has not properly acquired her with respect to these matters.

"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.48","XIII. From these things it is clear that the term “nisuin” and the term “ḥupah” are two different things, and thus one can infer from the wording of the Mishna, where it is taught: “Always, she is under the authority of the father until she enters the authority of the husband through marriage.” (Ketubot 4:5) And it is also taught (in the Mishnah): The woman may not eat of the heave-offering until she has entered the ‘ḥupah’”. (ibid. 5:3) (Therefore) since there is a difference in wording, (we) learn from this that they (“nisuin” and “ḥupah”) are two different things."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.49","But, we have not heard this (opinion) from any of the Halakhic authorities, and in the words of the Rambam which we (have already) brought, it is written: “This ‘yiḥud’ is called entrance into the ‘ḥupah’, and is (also) called (it constitutes) marriage universally.” Behold, this proves that it (“nisuin” and “ḥupah”) in (only) one thing. Thus it is in the Mishnah: “until she enters the authority of the husband for ‘nisuin’ ”. This definition means “ḥupah” because this has reference to the heave-offering; thus Rashi’s comment: “That is to say she enters the ‘ḥupah’ for the sake of marriage.”"
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.50","There are those who read that this is the true meaning of “until she enters the ‘ḥupah’ ”, but we have found in the Gemera[illegible] in a Baraita where it is taught: “One who has intercourse with a married woman - (with her being defined as a married woman) as soon as she had entered under the authority of her husband in marriage” (ibid. 49a). Behold, this is (a crime punishable) by strangulation. The inference is made here (that they are two different things), (for) even though (it is not stated) “she entered under the ‘ḥupah’ yet”, behold these are two (separate) things, so it is necessary to say (add) that the term “nisuin” is an inclusive term, and lasts from before the “ḥupah” until after the “ḥupah”; the beginning of the “nisuin” is not yet the “ḥupah”, rather, “ḥupah” is the end of the “nisuin”."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.51","XIV. In my humble opinion, the Halakhic authorities do not differ at all, for behold, it is true that the word “ḥupah” is not written in the Torah, only the word (for) marriage, as it is written: “(In the case of) one who betrothes a woman but has not (yet) taken her…”"
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.52","[illegible] marriage, since, according to Torah law proper, when he has intercourse with her for the sake of marriage, she is (considered) his wife completely and she is (considered) married. So wrote the Rambam."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.53","However, it is not the way for Israelites to have this intercourse in public, and therefore, we would require witnesses to the “yiḥud” for intercourse. And even if it was possible that there was no need for witnesses to this (“yiḥud”), as it is written in paragraph 5, in every instance the matter would be in public (in reality) - for behold, (we) must bless them with the seven benedictions immediately before the marriage (ceremony). Therefore, our rabbis, may their memories be for a blessing, established that the “ḥupah” will be (can be) in place of the “nisuin” (i.e. the two terms can be used synonymously). It has always been this way; even in the time of the prophets, as it is written: “like a groom going out from his ‘ḥupah’ ” (Psalm 19:6), and, it says: “and a bride from her ‘ḥupah’ ” (Joel 2:16). (Cf. VIII) Obviously (then), thus did Moses our Rabbi instruct (lead) Israel."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.54","XV. The interpretation of “ḥupah” is from the expression: “He covers (protects) him all day” (Deuteronomy 33:12); this is an expression of covering and separating (them) from other people. And in the Aggadic literature, our sages, may their memories be for a blessing, wrote: “The Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to make for each righteous man seven ‘ḥupot’ ” (Baba Batra 75a), meaning (special) coverings of honor, to distinguish them from other people, as it is written: “For on all glory shall be a ‘ḥupah’ ” (Isaiah 4:5). It was established to make a “ḥupah” of honor, and to recite the seven benedictions over them, and with this she is (considered) married completely. The (omission of) intercourse will not hinder (the validity of marriage) “everyone knows why the bride enters the ‘ḥupah’ ”. (Ketubot 8b). So there is no need for witnesses to the “yiḥud”, or ten men (to witness) the wedding benedictions, (because) immediately afterwards they will have intercourse, and this would be indecent (for others to be present)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.55","Every kind of “ḥupah” that has been customary constitutes acquiring (a woman) through marriage, since their intent is (always) marriage, and now they are separated from other people. The two of them stand in one place for the sake of marriage, for example, when he leads her into his house and has “yiḥud” with her, as the Rambam wrote (Cf. III). And it would appear to me that the Rambam’s intention is also not that it is a complete “yiḥud” if the two of them are alone in one room, rather (when) they have “yiḥud” to live together as a man and his wife; they stand next to each other, and the seven benedictions are recited for them. Therefore, the opinion that we wrote in paragraph 6, viz. that “ḥupah” is not (only) “yiḥud” but the bringing her into his house for the sake of marriage, is essentially the opinion of the Rambam; for it is obvious that this opinion also acknowledges that, if he brings her to his house but is not with her, this is nothing. It is also obvious that he must be together with her, and recite the seven benedictions for then."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.56","However, regarding this opinion, what the Halakhic authorities worte with respect to the opinion of the Rambam, that he holds that complete “yiḥud” in one room is necessary, and that no one else should be with them - this is the opinion concerning which there is disagreement. But, (in) our interpretation of the opinion of the Rambam: this and this are one (the same)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.57","XVI. Thus, (no matter) if some are accustomed to different types of “ḥupot”, as (described) in paragraph 7 where they make a place especially decorated for the groom and the bride, or like our (custom) of placing poles with a spread curtain under which the wedding attendants lead the groom and the bride - first they seat the bride and the groom covers her (with a veil), and upon their return from the “ḥupah”, they go together and sit at the table (to eat) next to each other, and this is the sign of marriage. Everyone knows that this is (in) preparation for intercourse in an accepted manner; there is no need to fear that, at the proper hour, he will not be able to have intercourse with her, for behold, the intention has already been demonstrated (made) without (there being) so much excitement."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.58","And the Rosh, may his memory be for a blessing, who was apprehensive, because the place for the “ḥupah” is a temporary one, also acknowledges that a place should be especially chosen for them to be together before the (actual) “ḥupah” and after the “ḥupah”, this being so, it is obvious: that all this matter (all these aspects) constitutes the “ḥupah”, and immediately (after) the seven benedictions have been recited for them, she is (considered) married completely."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.59","This is where one of the Rishonim disagreed, (differentiating) between marriage and “ḥupah”, as we wrote in paragraph 12. But it is also his intention (to show) that the beginning of the marriage (ceremony) is a place where they (the bride and groom) sit before (entering) the “ḥupah”, where he covers her head; this is where he takes her under his authority. But this is not the complete “ḥupah”, and not more effective than (her father) delivering her to her husband, for this (seating and covering) relates only to inheritance, as it is written in Chapter 57."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.60","The completion is (when they are) under the “ḥupah”, (only) then is the marriage (ceremony) completed. The sign of the completed marriage (ceremony) is (when) they recite the seven benedictions for them."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.61","XVII. The general rule is according to the basis of the law of the Torah proper: marriage is intercourse for the sake of marriage or the preparation for it, where the “ḥupah” (in the broad sense of the term) is the preparation (for this). Which (type of) preparation depends upon local custom. Since this thing (albeit in many forms) is called “ḥupah”, and (since) the benedictions are recited, the marriage is completed and the end of the preparations for all “ḥupot” is from that moment on (when) she enters under his authority and he (accepts that he) is ready to live with her as man with his wife."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.62","Therefore, the Rambam insisted that she (the bride) be ritually clean; since the essence of the “ḥupah” is intercourse, it is required that she be (ritually) proper for that intercourse. But the majority of the Halakhic authorities disagree with him, with the opinion that we should not be concerned for her to be (ritually) proper for intercourse at the exact hour of the “ḥupah”, for certainly there will be (at least) ten men there for (to witness) the benedictions. It is impossible for him to have intercourse (with her) then. Rather, we should say (only) that she be (ritually) proper for intercourse after a time, and if such is the case, there is no difference (in saying) after an hour, or after one day or two days."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.63","XVIII. In regards to those among us who designate the “ḥupah” in the courtyard of the synagogue, there is great reasoning for this: for the essence of the “ḥupah” is the (bride’s) going out from the authority of the (her) father to the authority of the (her) husband; this (is the case) if the husband takes her to his house."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.64","But, in many instances, it is customary for us to make everything in the house of the bride’s father, for often the bride’s father takes him (the groom) into his house for a time, also, and, therefore, how is it evident that she (the bride) has gone out from the authority of the father to the authority of the husband? Therefore, we place the “ḥupah” in the courtyard of the synagogue, for this is a congregational (communal) place, and at the time of the “ḥupah” it is in the mind of the congregation to make this groom acquire this land, as (with) the congregation’s “etrog” at the time of the blessing on the first day of Sukkot, (which) is considered to belong to everyone. Since (in the mind of the congregation) this land is (considered) his (for the time of the “ḥupah”), it is considered like his bringing her into his authority (the G<sup>e</sup>rah<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">Elijah Gaon of Vilna (1720 - 1797).</i>)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.65","The poles and the spread curtain which we call the “ḥupah” is (so called) in reality - for it covers the groom and the bride, separating them from the rest of the people and (still) showing them cleaving to each other. And in regards to the attendants standing under the “ḥupah”, also, this is all because of the friendship with the groom and bride, and therefore they stand bound together, close together."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.66","XIX. And also, it appears to me, that even according to the Rambam and those that agree with his position, the (omission of the) benedictions do not hinder (the validity of marriage <span class=""underline"">ex post facto</span>), like all benedictions do not hinder (the validity); in this “ḥupah”, as he (the Rambam) wrote, only (the omission of) intercourse for the sake of marriage or (of) a real “yiḥud” in a closed room fitting for intercourse at that moment (do)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.67","But, all “ḥupot” except for those which are only “preparations” to point to this couple’s completed marriage, for as long as the seven benedictions have not been recited for them, the marriage has not been completed. Perhaps this is the reason for the Halakhic authorities who hold that (omission of the) benedictions does hinder the validity of the “ḥupah”, and therefore it is a necessity that the groom’s benedictions be recited, before the marriage is completed. (On the essence of the matters that we are discussing, the G<sup>e</sup>rah wrote in Chapter 109: “There is no need for ‘yiḥud’ at all, only that she be under his authority.” See there. And we explained that the Rambam also holds this opinion.

"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.69","XX. There is one who says that it is correct that, at the time when he betrothes (sanctifies) her (i.e. during the ceremony itself), in our custom this betrothal comes at the time of the “ḥupah”, the groom and the bride should not stand under the spread curtain on poles that is the “ḥupah”, rather, they should stand in front of it. Only afterwards, when they begin to recite the seven benedictions, do they stand under the “ḥupah” (<span class=""underline"">Bayit Ḥadash</span>); the principle being that the “ḥupah” should not precede the betrothal."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.70","We have not seen anyone cocerned about this (matter); for behold, according to what the major authorities wrote, that the essence of the “ḥupah” is when they (the couple) eat together after (the ceremony) in a private place, certainly there can be no concern about this (<span class=""underline"">Bayit</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥadash</span>)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.71","And even according to our custom, there is no concern for this, for we have already explained that our “ḥupah” is (derived from) their accepting the fact that, for them, this is the “ḥupah” and the completion of the marriage (ceremony), making her his wife completely. This is after they have completed (reciting) the seven benedictions, as it is written: “for then is the completion of the ‘ḥupah’ ”, not before. The result is that, when the betrothal precedes the “ḥupah”, which precedes the benediction, there is no “ḥupah” for betrothal (lit. on this). And (with regards to) the fact that the “preparations” for marriage precede the betrothal; there is no concern at all on this (matter)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.72","XXI. Since one who betrothes and his betrothed are prohibited to have “yiḥud”, therefore, wrote our rabbi, the R<sup>e</sup>mah: “one who betrothes, when he is with his betrothed in one house (i.e. in private), he must recite the seven benedictions, lost they have ‘yiḥud’ ”. And even though the benedictions without “ḥupah” do not constitute anything (officially) anyhow according to what the Rambam wrote. “(if) his intention is for the sake of marriage there is no need for a ‘ḥupah’ ” - therefore, they should recite the seven benedicitons, for then it is obvious that if he has intercourse with her, his intention is for marriage; “One will not let stand what is permitted and eat what is forbidden” (Avodah Zarah 39b)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.73","In addition, (we cite) the Halakhic authorities, that (the omission of) the benedictions hinders (the validity of the marriage); it is necessary to recite the benedictions for them (<span class=""underline"">Bet Shmuel</span>, Note #1)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.74","In addition, since they have stayed together in the house for a long period of tine, it becomes like a courtyard (i.e. an extension of their house) for the two of then, and their (this) “yiḥud” is a (valid) marriage; she is permissable to hin (for intercourse) after the benediction (<span class=""underline"">Ḥelkat M<sup>e</sup>ḥokek</span>, Note #1)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.75","All this (the above) is according to their custom, that she is already betrothed (from before). But, according to our custom, where the betrothal is at the time of the “ḥupah”, the benedictions (in this case) do not count, for behold, he has not yet betrothed her. Therefore, he must keep himself far away from his fiancee, until the time of the wedding."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.76",XXII. We have already written in the name of the Rambam:
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.77","(In the case of) one who betrothes a woman and recites the groom’s benedictions, but does not have “yiḥud” with her in his house - she is still considered only betrothed, for the groom’s benediction does not constitute marriage, only entrance into the “ḥupah” (does)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.78","However, if he has intercourse with her for the sake of marriage, it is all right (i.e. she is then considered married) as it is written: “the Rambam’s intention is (to show) that if he doess not have intercourse with her, or (if) they do not have ‘yiḥud’ immediately, the benedictions are voided” (see <span class=""underline"">Ḥelkat M<sup>e</sup>ḥokek</span>, Note #11)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.79","XXIII. And also the opposite (case can arise): if he betrothed and entered into the “ḥupah” but did not recite the groom’s benedictions - behold, this is a complete marriage; he should return and recite the benedictions, even after several days. And even though all blessings must precede tha act (cf. Pesaḥim 7b), anyhow, among those blessings, those for marriage are not mentioned at all; one may recite the (marriage) benedictions even afterwards. But, the betrothal blessing must be recited before the betrothal (i.e. that part of the marriage ceremony which is still called betrothal), as all the (other) blessings which must precede the act."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.80","XXIV. Pome of the Halakhic authorities wrote that there is no “ḥupah” for a widow, and their basis is from the Jerusalem Talmud. But it will be explained, with the help of heaven, in Chapter 64, that the Jerusalem Talmud does not prove the point."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.81","It is obvious - according to the opinion of the Rambam, that the “ḥupah” is the “yiḥud”, and likewise (for) those who have the opinion that the “ḥupah” is (her) going out into his authority - why should there be a difference between (the “ḥupah” of) a virgin and a widow? However, for those who have the opinion that the essence of the “ḥupah” is the house that is especially prepared for the dwelling of the groom and the bride, with embroidered sheets; and for those who have the opinion that the essence of the “ḥupah” is the spreading of the canopy or the marriage litter - certainly, for a widow, this is not done, for (this type of) “ḥupah” does not apply. And the essence of (his) acquiring her is in a “yiḥud” that is proper for intercourse."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.82","And therefore, according to our (customary) “ḥupot”, where we do not make a public demonstration for a widow when she marries a widower, and she does not cover her head, and they do not have attendants or musical instruments, nor do we lead them to the courtyard of the synagogue, rather, in a quiet way we place the poles with a spread canopy in the house, and he betrothes her (there), and they recite the seven benedictions. This “ḥupah” does not constitute an acquisition; he must acquire her with a “yiḥud” proper for intercourse. This will be explained further, with the help of heaven, in Chapter 64."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.83","XXV. Before entrance into the “ḥupah”, he (the groom) must write for her (the bride) a “Ketubah”, after which he is permitted to (have intercourse with) his wife, for thus did our sages, may their memories be for a blessing, say: “It is prohibited for him to be with his wife even for one hour without (his having written) a ‘Ketubah’ ”. Thus did the Rambam rule, and our rabbi, the <span class=""underline"">Bet Josef</span>, quotes it (the Rambam’s ruling) in paragraph 3: “There is no reason to question why his obligation is to write (the ‘Ketubah’) before the ‘ḥupah’; let him write it after the ‘ḥupah’ (so long as it is) before he has intercourse with her.” For there is (validity) to the Rambam’s position when he holds the opinion that a “ḥupah” proper for intercourse is necessary, and (a “ḥupah”) without a “Ketubah” is not proper for intercourse (<span class=""underline"">Har HaMor</span><sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">Mordecai Benett (1753 - 1829).</i>, Chapter 10, Halakha #7)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.84","And, according to this, we, who are not following this (the Rambam’s position) on this, as it is written in Chapter 61: “he was permitted to write (the ‘Ketubah’) also afterward (i.e. after the ‘ḥupah’)”, the fact that our rabbi, the R<sup>e</sup>mah, did not make a Hagah on this, because according to our custom - we pause (in the ceremony) by reading the “Ketubah” under the “ḥupah”, between the benedictions of betrothal and marriage. This being so, even without the reasoning of the Rambam, it is necessary (for him) to write it (the “Ketubah”) before the “ḥupah”. And such is the custom."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.85","XXVI. However, the “Ketubah” alone does not make (for a valid) marriage. Therefore, (in the case of) the one who betrothes a woman, writes for her a “Ketubah”, but she does not enter the “ḥupah” - she is still (considered) betrothed and not married, for the “Ketubah” (alone) does not make (for a valid) marriage."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.86","If he dies or divorces her, the Rambam wrote that she collects “the basic ‘Ketubah’ ” only from the free property but not from the mortgaged property<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote""> Property bought from a person who owes a debt collectible from his estate.</i>. She does not collect “the additional ‘Ketubah’ ” at all, even if he has written (the “Ketubah”) for her, his reasoning being that the “Ketubah” itself is nothing (i.e. does not make her married), for he only wrote (it) for her in order to marry her. And (therefore) “the basic ‘Ketubah’ ” is only like an oral loan; hence, she collects only from the free property."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.87","But if he betrothed a woman and did not write for her a “Ketubah”, and (then) dies or divorces her, she is (still only) betrothed and she receives nothing, even “the basic ‘Ketubah’ ”; for they did not institute “the basic ‘Ketubah’ ” for her until she is married, or until he writes (the “Ketubah” for her). This is the opinion of the Rambam."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.88","XXVII. There are some among our rabbis who hold that a betrothed woman has a “Ketubah”, for this appears to be so in several places in the Talmud. If he did not write (a “Ketubah”) for her, she collects from the free property, and if he did write (it) for her, she collects also from the mortgaged property, as (is the principle) with all documents (pertaining to monetary matters). But if he did not write (it) for her, it appears that, with this opinion also, she does not collect from the mortgaged property."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.89","However, the Rosh, may his memory be for a blessing, wrote: “even if he did not write (it) for her, she collects from the mortgaged property because of the ‘K<sup>e</sup>t<sup>e</sup>nai Bet Din’ ” (a stipulation of the rabbinical court that a woman without a “Ketubah” is still entitled to the benefits of a “Ketubah”) (Ketubot, Chapter 4, paragraph 64). And it appears, in the words of the Rosh in another place, that he is in doubt with respect to this law (ibid. Chapter 5, paragraph 5). And not only this, (but) “even if he wrote (it) for her from the betrothal, and later wrote (it again) for her from the marriage, she foregoes her claim to the mortgaged property from the first (of the two ‘Ketubot’)” (ibid.), and she can only collect from the purchasers that which has been sold since the time of marriage."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.90","All this is in the matter of “the basic ‘Ketubah’ ”, but in the matter of “the additional ‘Ketubah’ ” everyone agrees that, even if he did write (it) for her, she does not collect from the time of the betrothal, for it is (based on the) general assumption that he only wrote (it) for her in order to marry her."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.91","The Halakhic authorities wrote that the custom is according to the Rambam, not to let a betrothed woman collect the “Ketubah”, for in all the places where in the G<sup>e</sup>mara it is clear that a betrothed woman has a “Ketubah”, the Rambam shows that (in those cases indeed) he did actually write (it) for her."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.92","And, the same is the position of the G<sup>e</sup>onim<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">Singular “Gaon”, Lit. “pride”; the title given to the heads of the two rabbinic academies in Babylonia (Sura and Pumbedita). During the G<sup>e</sup>onic Period” (late sixth to early eleventh centuries), these men were considered the highest religious authorities, and were a strong unifying force for the Jewish community of the Diaspora.</i> that, since in the G<sup>e</sup>mara it is questioned whether or not a betrothed woman has a “Ketubah”, and it is not solved there (Baba M<sup>e</sup>tsia 17a), she does not receive the “Ketubah”."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.93","XXVIII. (In the case of) one whose betrothed daughter is widowed or divorced after the betrothal (but before the marriage), even several times before she reaches adulthood - her “Ketubah” (money) belongs to her father, for she only goes out from the authority of the father by becoming an adult or by marriage. Therefore, if she is married and (then) widowed or divorced from the marriage, even before (she reaches) maturity, i.e. even if she is still a minor, her father receives nothing with respect to the first “Ketubah” written at the betrothal: “we do not consider the date of the writing of the ‘Ketubah’, saying that, since it was written (while she was still) under the authority of the father, it belongs to the father; rather, we consider the date of the collection, and the collection is only after the marriage” (Rashi commentary, Ketubot 43b)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.94","XXIX. (In the case of) one whose betrothed (woman) died - if the betrothed man is a Cohen, he may not defile himself because of her, as it is written: “except for his relatives” (Leviticus 21:2), and this means near kin. And a betrothed is not his near kin, even if he has betrothed her by (an act of) intercourse, since she is (supposedly) prohibited to him (for further intercourse) until the marriage."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.95","If he (the one who betrothes) dies, she is not obligated to defile herself because of him, even though it is a commandment to defile oneself for all near kin. Nevertheless, (defiling herself) for her betrothed man is no “mitsvah” (good deed) but doing it constitutes no prohibition, even if she is a female Cohen, for the daughters of Aaron were not commanded regarding the defiling, as it is written” “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron” (Leviticus 21:1); (it says) “the sons of Aaron” and not “the daughters of Aaron” (i.e. the prohibition against defiling oneself applies to men only)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.96","XXX. And it is a similar matter with her inheritance when she (a betrothed woman) dies: he (the one who betrothes) is not eligible for her inheritance, for also in the matter of inheritance is it written: “his near kin”. And since he does not inherit her, he is not obligated to bury her (i.e. provide for her burial). Rather, her father will inherit her and he will bury her. And even if the father does not bury her, he (the father) will (still) inherit her. Even, if there remains no inheritance from her at all, it is not incumbent upon the one who betrothed to bury her or to make any payments (whatsoever)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.97","And even if she was married to him in a place where he does not inherit her because of the ordinance in Chapter 53<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">Chapter 53 of <span class=""underline"">Arukh HaShulḥan</span> Even HaEzer details all of the rabbinic ordiances and injunctions concerning inheritance upon the death of either member of the betrothed couple.</i>, he is not obligated to bury her. And in a place where he inherits half of her dowry, there are those who say that the burial is incumbent upon both of them (the one who betrothed and the father) (<span class=""underline"">Ḥelkat M<sup>e</sup>ḥokek</span>). And there are those who say (that the burial is incumbent) upon the husband alone (<span class=""underline"">Bet Shmuel</span>)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.98","XXXI. Similarly, the one who betrothes is not obligated (to provide) for the sustenance of his betrothed, because as long as she is not married, and he is not obligated to (provide) her conjugal rights, he is not obligated to (provide) her sustenance and garments, unless she was a minor (and an) orphan being provided sustenance by her brothers - for in this case, the one who betrothes is obligated to her sustenance, since she only receives sustenance from her brothers until she is betrothed or reaches maturity. This one (the orphan who is a minor) has not reached maturity to provide for her own sustenance, rather she is only a minor or a young maiden. And no man wants his betrothed to degrade herself by going out and begging at doors (to seek sustenance). Therefore, even if he (the one who betrothes) says that he is not concerned about this (i.e. her having to beg), we force hin to provide her sustenance; he is obligated (to do so) according to rabbinic injunction. This is the opinion of the Rambam."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.99","There are those who say that the one who betrothes is not obligated for her sustenance, even in a case like this (i.e. where she is a minor and an orphan) - and she must be provided for by her brothers (it depends on the version, cf. Ketubot 53b)."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Arukh Hashulḥan(even Haezer.100","It is an obvious thing that a negotiated-for (“engaged”) woman does not have any of the legal rights (status) of a married woman, not like (those of a) betrothed woman, for even if he wrote for her a “Ketubah”, it is nothing (i.e. it has no validity) if they retracted (broke the engagement) before betrothal: because he: wrote (it) for her only in order to betrothe her and enter (with) her (into the “ḥupah”) (<span class=""underline"">Ḥelkat M<sup>e</sup>ḥokek</span>).

"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Hekhal Yitsḥak(even Haezer.12","And when my father, my master, may the memory of the righteous be for a blessing, came to the state of England, and he brought me with him, there we found that they made the “ḥupah” in the synagogue.

And similarly, I after him, may I be set apart from him (and have) good and long life, when I was appointed to my first rabbinical position in the city of Belfast, found the same custom in Ireland, and it was not in my power to change it by any means, but I did not permit there the practice of playing, at the time of the “ḥupah”, neither the pump-organ nor the piano."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Hekhal Yitsḥak(even Haezer.13","However, here in our holy land, behold, thank God, we do not have this evil custom, and anyone who attempts at changing matters, has the “lower hand” (in contrast to “upper hand” [and is to be rejected]). Needless to say that the Ashkenazim must not change their custom of making the “ḥupah” under the open skies, but even with the S<sup>e</sup>fardim, who are not strict about this and make the “ḥupah” in the house, certainly it is incumbent upon us to oppose any new attempts to make the “ḥupah” in the synagogue."

"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Hekhal Yitsḥak(even Haezer.15","And, I may add, it is forbidden to kiss even small children in the synagogue (Oraḥ Ḥayyim, Chapter 98), and at the wedding (lit. in the “ḥupah”) it is impossible to prevent the ugly kissing, for not only do the groom and bride kiss each other, but also the relatives and friends, men and women. And “in contempt and wrath” (Esther 1:18) the transgression includes actual forbidden practices like sexual licentiousness and contact with menstruants in the house sanctified to the service of the Lord.

Certainly it is necessary to stand with all of our strength against these changes. “From Zion shall go forth the Law” - it is incumbent upon the Diaspora (i.e. the Jewish communitites outside of Israel) to learn from the land of Israel, and not for us to learn from the changes that have been made in the countries of Western Europe, for our heart was pained because of them, and it was not in our power to prevent thom."
"SA HUC Roman_Norman, Hekhal Yitsḥak(even Haezer.18","And if their intention is to add to the cermony of marriage a spark of the holiness of the surroundings, it would be proper to institute to have (the “ḥupah”) in the courtyard of the synagogue.
