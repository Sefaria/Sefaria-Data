SA HUC Brahms.1,"This thesis is an annotated original translation of the material in the Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span><span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span> on the laws concerning the Holy Day of Yom Kippur, <span class=""underline"">Hilkhot</span><span class=""underline"">Yom</span><span class=""underline"">ha</span>-<span class=""underline"">Kippurim</span>, found in chapters 604-24. The body of the thesis consists of three major parts. The first section is an extensive introduction which gives a synopsis of Jewish legal code literature produced from the Mishna of Judah ha-Nasi in about 200 C.E. until the Shulḥan Arukh of Joseph Caro along with the notes of Moses Isserles, a product of the sixteenth century. Major works of codification are cited along with their authors, and the contributions these works made to the development of Jewish law are discussed. The second part of this thesis consists of a translation of the material found in the above mentioned chapters of the Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span><span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span>, together with the notes of Moses Isserles called the <span class=""underline"">Mappah</span>. The material added by Isserles is designated by the introduction word <span class=""underline"">Hagah</span>, note. The translation is as literal as possible. Words and/or expressions are set off in parenthesis when a purely literal translation is unclear. The final section of this thesis consists of extensive notes of explanation on the translation of the text. Any term or concept given in the text is noted and explained. When a source is cited, it is discussed along with a short biography of the author of that source. Throughout the text, at points of interest additional commentaries from recent literature and also from the traditional rabbinic sources are added as a means of further explanation; these sources include the <span class=""underline"">Tur</span>, <span class=""underline"">Magen</span><span class=""underline"">Avraham</span>, <span class=""underline"">Turei</span><span class=""underline"">Zahav</span>, <span class=""underline"">Notes</span><span class=""underline"">of</span><span class=""underline"">the</span><span class=""underline"">Wilna</span><span class=""underline"">Gaon</span>, and short discussions from the Talmud. A conclusion is found at the end of this thesis which briefly summarizes the general findings and trends of the material discussed in the Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span><span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span>, on the Laws of Yom Kippur."

SA HUC Brahms.14,INTRODUCTION
SA HUC Brahms.15,"“A Code is a unified and coordinated body of law superseding all previous laws within its scope, or the reenactment of existing law in a systematic and improved form.

SA HUC Brahms.16,"The Shulḥan Arukh, <span dir=""rtl"">שדלחן עדור</span>, “the Prepared Table,” written by Joseph Caro in the middle of the sixteenth century is today considered the culmination of the codification of Jewish law, <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. The Shulḥan Arukh is the text to which one turns to obtain the final authoritative decision on an halakhic matter in a short, concise form. There are no discussions nor proof texts to authenticate the conclusions, rather the law is stated in an organized and systematic manner. The Shulḥan Arukh does not stand alone in Jewish legal codification literature. Vast quantities preceded this work of Caro’s and contributed to its structure. Halakhic codification has also followed the Shulḥan Arukh, but none has superseded its authority and acceptance as the approved source of traditional Jewish <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. The body of this rabbinic thesis examines only one small part of one section of the Shulḥan Arukh, the Laws of Yom Kippur found in the section <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span><span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span> which concerns itself with daily commandments, Sabbaths, and the festivals. In order to better understand the position and importance this material occupies, it is necessary to briefly look at the Shulḥan Arukh in respect to the codification literature which preceded and influenced it and then to examine the structure and the acceptance of the Shulḥan Arukh as it appears today."
SA HUC Brahms.17,"(Note that the purpose of this introduction is only to give a brief digest of halakhic codification literature so as to better appreciate the position the material covered in the body of this thesis occupies in the totality of Jewish halakhic codes.

I will attempt to merely mention and place in perspective major codification works representative of the various stages through which this type of literature developed.

SA HUC Brahms.18,"When one speaks of <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> and its codification, one is basically concerned with the Oral as opposed to the Written Law. Judaism separates Oral and Written Law in terms of its origin and transmission. Written Law is the Torah (and biblical material) given to Moses during the Revelation on Mount Sinai earlier and later during the forty years of wandering in the desert of Sinai and from its very beginning committed to writing. These scrolls of Jewish literature were then passed down from generation to generation in this written form. Traditional Judaism believes that at the same time as God gave Moses His Written Law, God also transmitted an Oral Law to Moses which was not originally committed to writing, but rather it was preserved in an oral fashion and passed down through a direct, unbroken line of descendants who could be traced back directly to Moses. This oral material remained fluid over the centuries and grew as each generation encountered new situations not specifically dealt with by the previous generations. According to tradition, God was revealing more and more of His Oral Law to each generation. After numerous successive centuries when the law was expanded upon itself, it became almost impossible for any single person to retain the Oral Law and pass it on in its entirety and accurately to his successor. There was a fear that the material being oral and without organization would at least be altered if not lost over the years. There was a need, therefore, that this Oral Law be compiled and finally be preserved in a written form."
SA HUC Brahms.19,"The first halakhic code extent that was compiled after the Written Law was the Mishna. It was compiled by Judah ha-Nasi in around the year 200 C.E. It contained the entire scope of Jewish law that was in existence at the time of its formulation in its six tractates. The <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span> of the time of Judah ha-Nasi were assembled according to their subject matter. Prior to the Mishna the Oral Law had been preserved in various different ways. Before the tannaitic period there might have been more uniformity to halakhic material. Laws were decided upon by the Sanhedrin, which served as the supreme legislative and judicial body for the people. The Sanhedrin’s majority decision became the law without mention of authorship. As the Sanhedrin weakened differing opinions were formulated, and the names of those scholars who expressed them were associated with the dispute. There were internal problems of authority between the Pharisees and the Saducees and between the scholars of Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai. When the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 C.E. and scholars were forced to migrate, there was an increased occurrence of halakhic disputes that were never resolved. Therefore there was a need at the time of Judah ha-Nasi to once again unify the vast amount of halakhic material into an authoritative code, limiting the divergent views as much as he could. There was also the fear that the material would be lost or incorrectly transmitted. Thus there was a need for a codification of the law that the Mishna became."
SA HUC Brahms.20,"The Mishna does not always merely state the law, but offers the law as part of a factual case including those conditions which lead up to the final situation. This is referred to as the casuistic method which enabled the law to continue its development and meet new situations which surfaced that had not been encountered before."
SA HUC Brahms.21,"Following the compilation of the Mishna we find the most vast and singly authoritative work of all of Jewish legal literature, the Talmud. The large and predominately accepted Babylonian Talmud as well as the less extensive Palestinian Talmud are works which combine the Mishna, the Law, with its accompanied <span class=""underline"">Gemara</span> or “commentary.” The <span class=""underline"">Gemara</span> includes deliberations of the sages, halakhic commentary by the legal authorities known as the <span class=""underline"">amoraim</span>, responsa material, and decisions which made the law alive by considering every conceivable situation connected with a possible law and what the final halakhic decision would be. The Talmud as a whole is accepted as the authentic and binding halakhic work from which all decisions must be based. Yet from a literary point of view it is not considered a code."
SA HUC Brahms.22,"The literary forms found in the codes are basically three: (1) “books of <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>,” books which simply collect the conclusions pertaining to a certain aspect of the Jewish law with a brief discussion and reference to its talmudical sources; (2) “books of <span class=""underline"">pesakim</span> or decisions,” which state the conclusions of the halakhic rules in a certain area of the law arranged according to halakhic subject matter without any mention of the underlying sources; and (3) a combination of the two in varying forms."
SA HUC Brahms.23,"Halakhic codification literature belonging basically to the category of “books of <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>” appeared during the Geonic Period from the eighth century onward. The first of these books was <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span><span class=""underline"">ha</span>-<span class=""underline"">She’iltot</span> by Aḥa of Shabḥa, Babylonia. It is a collection of homiletic discussions. Scholars quoted from this work for the purpose of deciding halakhic questions in accordance with it; therefore, it is classified as a code. It is arranged according to the weekly Pentateuchal portions with the laws related to that particular part of the Torah included in the discussion of that section."
SA HUC Brahms.24,"Yehudai b. Naḥman Gaon wrote <span class=""underline"">Halakhot</span><span class=""underline"">Pesukot</span> during the first half of the eighth century. It was the first of the “books of <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>.” It was arranged according to both subject matter and the talmudic tractates. Yehudai Gaon only included laws that were relevant and in practice at his time, thus establishing a principle followed by almost all of the authors of code material who followed him. Laws that no longer existed were omitted."
SA HUC Brahms.25,"In the ninth century the greatest halakhic work of the Geonic Period appeared. It was called <span class=""underline"">Halakhot</span><span class=""underline"">Gedolot</span>. Most scholars agree that the author was Simeon Kayyara of Basra, Babylonia. It was arranged according to talmudic tractates and a brief review of the sources appeared before the conclusions of the law."
SA HUC Brahms.26,"Scholars during this period of time were concerned with codifying Jewish law for basically two reasons. One was to ease the study of the voluminous and difficult talmudic material. The second reason was attributed to the rise of the Karaites in Babylonia during the eighth century. The Karaites rejected rabbinic law and the <span class=""underline"">geonim</span>, as a response produced vast amounts of halakhic and philosophical works so as to formulate a normative, traditional Jewish attitude based on Oral Law. This caused a need for codified material that would summarize easily the accepted laws. But as a result other problems arose. People began studying the codes material and neglecting the source, the Talmud, rather than using the codes as they were designed, as a tool to simplify the study of the Talmud. Because of this criticism virtually very few other books of codes appeared during the Geonic Period. Responsa literature began to arise which answered new specific halakhic questions through an examination of the halakhic sources."
SA HUC Brahms.27,"At the close of the Geonic Period there arose again the need for a codification of the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. This resulted from the fact that Babylonia was no longer the center of the Jewish Diaspora. New centers of Jewish life emerged in North Africa and Europe resulting in different customs and rules regarding the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. In the eleventh century a very important work in Jewish law under the category of “books of <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>” was written, the <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Halakhot</span> by Isaac b. Jacob ha-Kohen Alfasi, who was known as the “Rif.” It was arranged according to the tatlmudic tractates and included only the laws in practice at the time. Alfasi gave a more extensive talmudic discussion of each conclusion than did the geonic authors, and he also included aggadic statements which had halakhic importance. Therefore this work is also referred to as the small Talmud, <span class=""underline"">Talmud</span><span class=""underline"">Katan</span>. Alfasi made use of the Jerusalem as well as the Babylonian Talmud but decided according to the latter in areas of dispute between the two because of its later redaction. Alfasi’s work became accepted as decisive and binding, praised and used by both Maimonides and later Caro as pillars of their works upon which halakhic decisions were based."
SA HUC Brahms.28,"The twelfth century was dominated by Maimonides who created a new literary form of the “book of <span class=""underline"">pesakim</span>, decisions” for the codes which is exemplified by his book the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span><span class=""underline"">Torah</span>. “Books of <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>” were originally to be used only as a method of reference to the Talmud itself. As the centuries passed, though, scholars became less and less able to accurately examine the Talmud and derive from it alone the proper, reliable decision. Halakhic material became more and more voluminous. There arose a need around the time of Maimonides for a book which would derive its authority from other great scholars as well as the Talmud, yet would stand by itself as a single work, serving as the basis of deciding the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> usable by scholars as well as laymen. Maimonides, who had magnificent respect for his own ability (which has been proven vastly deserved), established his objective of designing an authoritative compilation by which the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> should be decided. There was no question in his mind that there would be no contradiction between his book and previous halakhic literature, and therefore he named his book the second Torah, <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span><span class=""underline"">Torah</span> which he wrote over the ten year period from 1177 until 1187. Its authority was only superseded by the Written and Oral Law themselves."
SA HUC Brahms.29,"Maimonides used four basic criteria for his codification: (1) He wanted to locate and compile <span class=""underline"">all</span> the material of Jewish law from the Written Law until his time by a systematic and scientific process. Therefore only the actual Written Law and Maimonides’ book were needed for every detail of the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. His work was exhaustive and his preparation complete."
SA HUC Brahms.30,"(2)	Maimonides subdivided and classified all the material according to its subject matter. (He divided his work into fourteen books. Fourteen rendered in the numerical letter equivalents in Hebrew is <span dir=""rtl"">י״ד</span>, <span class=""underline"">yad</span>, which is the word for hand. The <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span><span class=""underline"">Torah</span> is therefore also referred to as <span class=""underline"">Ha-Yad</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Ḥazakah</span> (Deut. 34:12), “the Strong Hand.”) The fourteen books were each subdivided into eighty-three parts called <span class=""underline"">hilkhot</span>, these were again divided into <span class=""underline"">perakim</span> of one-thousand chapters, consisting of some fifteen thousand paragraphs, each called an “<span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>.”"
SA HUC Brahms.31,"(3)	Maimonides decided upon a single halkhic rule, and he made no reference to disputing opinions nor did he designate the post-pentateuchal sources. This was a true break in the tradition of preserving the name of the author of a particular law or its talmudic source. His reasoning was not to break the chain of authority and tradition, but rather so as not to confuse the law and limit the use of his code. Therefore this work was considered a new form of code literature, a “book of <span class=""underline"">pesakim</span>, decisions” where only a single statement of a law was given without qualifying it or citing the non-biblical sources. The only qualified halakhic rulings among the fifteen thousand were one hundred and twenty new ones added by Maimonides himself and fifty rulings where he decided between the <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> and the <span class=""underline"">rishonim</span>."
SA HUC Brahms.32,"(4) The final criteria employed by Maimonides was his use of language. He chose the clear, legalistic Hebrew of the Mishna. The language of the Pentateuch was not adequate to express all the laws, and the talmudic Aramaic was not sufficiently understood in his time. Maimonides in reality created a new, clear, lucid legal Hebrew language. Maimonides maintained the casuistic method of previous halakhic material by not making simple normative statements so that all the legal facts could be included in the talmudical style familiar to most at the time."
SA HUC Brahms.33,"Maimonides’ work received most of its criticism from the fact that he omitted the names and talmudic sources, so much a part of halakhic material prior to his work. Maimonides defended himself by stating a halakhic rule that “the law was transmitted by way of the many to the many and not from a single individual to another individual.” He did admit, though, that in a separate work he should have given the sources of a particular law."
SA HUC Brahms.34,"Maimonides was also criticized for his omission of different opinions which deprived a person from chosing between other sources to arrive at his decision. Asher b. Jehiel, the Rosh, stated that one would get the wrong understanding of the law based on Maimonides if he were not also familiar with the <span class=""underline"">gemara</span> from which Maimonides took the law. Every <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span>, judge and decision maker, had the right to refer to differing opinions in order to come to a valid individual decision. It was reiterated that a code could only serve as an aid in finding a law in the talmudic literature itself. With all its criticism, Maimonides’ method had great influence on codes and the decisions on Jewish law. Joseph Caro in the Shulḥan Arukh used Maimonides as his “second pillar” of halakhic decisions (Alfasi was the first), and he employed Maimonides’ basic premise as his methodology."
SA HUC Brahms.35,"The <span class=""underline"">Mishneh Torah</span> influenced many supporters who wrote additional works to defend the goal of Maimonides. The most famous is called <span class=""underline"">Hagahot</span><span class=""underline"">Maimuniyyot</span>, written in the thirteenth century by a pupil of Meir b. Baruch of Rothenburg supplementing the laws of Maimonides with those found in France and Germany. It is ironic that the result of Maimonides’ halakhic works was the direct opposite of what he sought out to achieve. Rather than producing the final, single halakhic source, he influenced the writing of hundreds of books which complicated halakhic problems, making the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> even less uniform than it had been before."
SA HUC Brahms.36,"After Maimonides and the criticism he received, it was necessary to produce “books of <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>” which preserved the link with talmudic sources. A representative fourteenth century work of this type was the <span class=""underline"">Piskei</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Rosh</span> or <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span><span class=""underline"">Ashrei</span> by Asher b. Jehiel. In his codification of Jewish law he wanted to preserve the <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span>’s freedom to decide between differing opinions. He followed (based on Alfasi’s <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Halakhot</span>) the talmudic tractates and gave a synoptic statement of the talmudic discussion which resulted in the halakhic law. He was a scholar in both Germany and Spain. In his work he included opinions from both cultures and decided between the two, being very widely excepted. Caro used Asher as his, “third pillar” two hundred years later."
SA HUC Brahms.37,"Other works of codification appeared during this period of time which later influenced the work of Caro. “Books of <span class=""underline"">mitzvot</span>” were written to decide law. In the thirteenth century a Frenchman, Moses of Coucy wrote the <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span><span class=""underline"">Mitzvot</span><span class=""underline"">Gadol</span> which was divided into two parts, negative and positive precepts, each one being accompanied by talmudic sources and opinions of other scholars, followed by the halakhic conclusion. Another similar book appeared later, entitled <span class=""underline"">Ammudei</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Golah</span> or <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span><span class=""underline"">Mitzvot</span><span class=""underline"">Katan</span> by Isaac b. Joseph of Corbeil. This book also had laws accompanied by a short statement on their talmudical sources, but this book was divided into seven parts corresponding to the seven days of the week, with laws traditionally being associated with those days (or homiletically connected) discussed in that particular section."
SA HUC Brahms.38,"Other books of code’s material were arranged according to the desire of the author. For example, according to the appearance of letters in a certain passage (<span class=""underline"">Ittur</span><span class=""underline"">Soferim</span> a twelfth century work by Isaac b. Abba Mari)."
SA HUC Brahms.39,"Solomon b. Abraham Adret who lived in Spain in the mid-thirteenth century, in his work <span class=""underline"">Torat</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Bayit</span> combined both the forms of a “book of <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>” and a “book of <span class=""underline"">pesakim</span>.” The first part is a “book of <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>” entitled <span class=""underline"">Torat</span><span class=""underline"">ha-bayit</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Arokh</span> where Adret gave talmudic sources and differing opinions arriving at an halakhic decision after a full discussion. The second part of his work was called <span class=""underline"">Torat</span><span class=""underline"">ha-bayit</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Kaẓer</span> and was a “book of <span class=""underline"">pesakim</span>” where he merely stated the halakhic conclusion he determined in the first part of his book. Adret wanted to avoid criticism yet employ the best aspects of both methodologies."
SA HUC Brahms.40,"The problem with the attempts at codification in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was that even though there was the development of a rich and vast body of halkhic literature, none of it was easy to use as a code nor was it decisive. Also there was a tremendous amount of material produced by tosafists in Germany, France, and western Europe in the form of responsa, novellae, and commentaries that were used as the basis of halakhic decision making by the <span class=""underline"">dayyanim</span> but had never been codified. Some of these tosafists were Rabbenu Tam and Meir of Rothenburg. In the Spanish school there was Meir ha-Levi Abulafia, Naḥmanides, and Solomon b. Abraham Adret. In addition to the above there were differing opinions and customs in the various Jewish communities of the world without any useful code."
SA HUC Brahms.41,"In view of this situation a <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span> in Toledo, Jacob b. Asher, the third son of Asher b. Jehiel, in the first half of the fourteenth century compiled a code in the form of four columns which he called <span class=""underline"">Turim</span>. He generally decided according to Alfasi, but when this was disputed by Maimonides or others, he accepted the opinions and decided according to his father’s responsa or opinions. Jacob b. Asher combined both the qualities of a “book of <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>” and a “book of <span class=""underline"">pesakim</span>” in that he gave the essence of each rule yet he did not give the exact talmudic sources or the names of the scholars along with it, he did so only at the beginning of a <span class=""underline"">tur</span> or a group of rules. He followed each rule with a brief statement of differing opinions given by post-talmudic scholars, and from all these he made his decision. This methodology produced a convenient and clear format while still maintaining a connection with halakhic sources."
SA HUC Brahms.42,"Jacob b. Asher divided his code into four parts and in it he included only the laws in practice at the time. Each of the four <span class=""underline"">turim</span> is divided into <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span> and <span class=""underline"">simanim</span>. <span class=""underline"">Tur</span><span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span><span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span> dealt with laws pertaining to man’s day to day conduct, the laws of prayer, blessings, Sabbaths, and festivals. <span class=""underline"">Tur</span><span class=""underline"">Yoreh</span><span class=""underline"">De’ah</span> was concerned with dietary laws, ritual purity, circumcision, visiting the sick, mourning, and some other ritual laws. <span class=""underline"">Tur</span><span class=""underline"">Even</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Ezer</span> covered family laws, marriage, and divorce laws, and monetary relations between man and wife. Finally, <span class=""underline"">Tur</span><span class=""underline"">Ḥoshen</span><span class=""underline"">Mishpat</span> dealt with civil law as well as criminal law, courts, judicial authority, evidence and the like. The arrangement of a code of Jewish law in this manner was totally original and had a great influence on all that came after it, especially its small, clearly defined units."
SA HUC Brahms.43,"In addition to the halakhic statements, Jacob b. Asher also included his own opinions on ethical and moral issues and aggadic sayings along with talmudical sources at the beginning of each <span class=""underline"">tur</span>. Jacob b. Asher assembled all the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> at his time in a clear and concise manner. Communities of the Orient continued to follow the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span><span class=""underline"">Torah</span> of Maimonides, but those of the west quickly adopted the <span class=""underline"">Turim</span>. Other works developed at this time which dealt with parts of what Jacob b. Asher covered, but none reached his scope. The <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> stood for over two hundred years as the basic code of Jewish law and inspired works based on it by scholars of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries."
SA HUC Brahms.44,"As the result of the Black Death (1348-50), the persecution of German Jews and the expulsion of Spanish Jews in 1492 there was a great movement of Jews due to uprooting. Old centers of Jewish life and authority were replaced by the new communities founded by the migrants of Germany in Poland, and in the oriental countries of Turkey, Ereẓ Israel, Egypt, and North Africa from those Jews forced out of Spain. This vast movement of people brought on many new halakhic problems. Laws were decided with virtually no authority behind them. Responsa literature became very popular and relatively creative. There arose a need for this <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> to be assembled, summarized, and reduced so as to be of use."
SA HUC Brahms.45,"Joseph Caro was born into this world of upheaval. He was born in Spain in 1488, and finally settled in the city of Safed in the Galilee of Ereẓ Israel where he was a member of the Great Rabbinic Court which decided <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. In view of the need of a new codification, Caro thought to compile one work made up of two parts which differed from each other in form and content but which supplemented each other."
SA HUC Brahms.46,"The two parts are the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> and the Shulḥan Arukh. The <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> was written first and its scope was much more extensive than its companion work, The <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> included all halakhic material in use at the time. It included the talmudic sources and the differing opinions of post-talmudic literature to its day. Caro used the <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> of Jacob b. Asher so that he did not need to repeat halakhic material already stated there, but he added extensively to it from the works of thirty-two halakhic scholars whom he mentioned by name as well as sayings from the Zohar. Caro in addition wanted to decide the law and make it uniform therefore he used the writings of his three pillars, Alfasi, Maimonides and Asher b. Jehiel. When all three dealt with a certain law he decided according to the majority except when that differed from a majority of halakhic scholars and there was a custom contrary (to the majority of the three pillars) in existence. If a matter had only been considered by two of the three and those two disagreed then he consulted five other authorities and decided according to their majority. The five were Naḥmanides, Solomon b. Abraham Adret, Nissim Gerondi, Mordecai b. Hillel, and Moses b. Jacob of Coucy. If none of his three pillars dealt with a subject, Caro decided the matter according to the majority of famous scholars. Caro did not go back and examine the correctness of each rule in terms of talmudic sources, arguing that this was too laborious in view of the large number of rules requiring decisions."
SA HUC Brahms.47,"Having done the ground work upon which to substantiate a briefer work that would definately meet the requirements of a simple and easy to use code, he set about writing a book of <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> in a simple, undefined, and summarized form. He thus compiled a book he called the Shulḥan Arukh, “The Prepared Table” in which the conclusions he reached in the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> were stated briefly and in a clear language. The book was designed for all, both scholars and laymen, as a quick reference guide to the accepted <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. He divided the Shulḥan Arukh into thirty parts so that one part could be read each day thus enabling it to be completed in one month. Caro realized that one book could not do all, therefore he wrote a short synoptic “book of <span class=""underline"">pesakim</span>” to supplement a “book of <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>” which gave the source to the varying opinions. Caro considered the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> his primary work and he spent twenty years writing it and twelve years annotating it."
SA HUC Brahms.48,"Caro divided his Shulḥan Arukh into four parts based on the <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> by Jacob b. Asher employing the same titles and basic content as the four <span class=""underline"">Turim</span>. He then further divided the <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> into one hundred twenty <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>. one thousand seven hundred <span class=""underline"">simanim</span>, and thirteen thousand, three hundred fifty <span class=""underline"">se’ifim</span>. Caro did not divide the larger units into smaller ones, as Jacob b. Asher had done. Caro gave each siman a title and shortened the names of the <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span> when they were too long, or he added to them when they did not sufficiently describe the contents. He also added topics that did not appear in the <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> or left them out if they were no longer <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span> in practice."
SA HUC Brahms.49,"The Shulḥan Arukh omitted the halakhic sources, names of scholars, ethical and moral statements, scriptural authority, and everything except the basic rule itself. In terms of a code, it was a very brief work being quite decisive. For this reason it eventually became the standard “book of <span class=""underline"">pesakim</span>”, decisions, of the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. Caro completed the Shulḥan Arukh in 1563, and it was first printed in Venice in 1565, one thousand three hundred and fifty years after the first code of Jewish law, the Mishna was compiled in the second century."
SA HUC Brahms.50,"One can not mention the Shulḥan Arukh or consider its impact without taking into account the role of Moses Isserles in the wide spread acceptance of Caro’s work. Isserles was a leading Polish Jewish scholar when Caro’s code reached Poland. Isserles was born in Cracow in 1525, or 1530 and died in 1572. His name was Isserel-Lazarus which was shortened to Isserles, but he was usually referred to as “the Rema” (<span class=""underline"">R</span>abbi <span class=""underline"">M</span>oses <span class=""underline"">I</span>sserles). His father was very wealthy and he was sent to Lublin to study in the yeshiva of Sholom Shachna until 1549, Isserles studied Talmud, codes, philosophy, astronomy and history. He was a well respected scholar and a world renowned <span class=""underline"">posek</span>, decider of halakhic issues. He was considered to be the “Maimonides of Polish Jewry.”"
SA HUC Brahms.51,"Isserles’ teacher, Sholom Shachna, was opposed to codifying the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. He felt that every <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span> was obligated to consider each question individually from the sources. The existance of a code did not encourage this. A <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span> would take the latest authority, namely the code, as binding and be deprived of the individuality of deciding an issue."
SA HUC Brahms.52,"Isserles was at first going to compile his book, <span class=""underline"">Darkei</span><span class=""underline"">Moshe</span>, following the <span class=""underline"">Turim</span>, to make it easier for the <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span> to find the material by assembling it in a brief form which was to include differing opinions without deciding between them. While he was writing his book he received Caro’s <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> and he realized that Caro had already assembled the material. Instead of stopping his work, he completed it because Caro had left out a good deal of material that had been contributed by Ashkenazi scholars, and also because he did not agree with Caro’s methodology of deciding the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> according to the majority opinion of “the three pillars,” Alfasi, Maimonides, and Asher b. Jehiel. Isserles felt later scholars had to be consulted equally. Isserles completed his <span class=""underline"">Darkei</span><span class=""underline"">Moshe</span> basing his decisions on later scholars but not making his decisions binding on any <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span> who wanted to decide an issue as a result of his own investigation."
SA HUC Brahms.53,"Isserles produced a second work of codification, namely <span class=""underline"">Torat</span><span class=""underline"">Ḥattat</span> which dealt mainly with dietary laws. When Isserles finally received the Shulḥan Arukh he decided to add his own glosses to it, the “<span class=""underline"">Mappah</span>” or “the Table Cloth” over the Shulḥan Arukh, the Prepared Table. (The notes of Isserles are also called <span class=""underline"">Hagahot</span>). In his glosses Isserles cited different Ashkenazi opinions and customs not present in Caro’s work and decided among them according to the accepted principle of giving authority to the most recent scholars, and enabling each <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span> to interpret and decide for himself. Isserles maintained the brief and concise style employed by Caro in the Shulḥan Arukh. Isserles wanted each <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span>, even in a brief statement, to realize that there were differing opinions and it was incumbent upon him to reach a decision through his own struggling with the material. Isserles often changed Caro’s (the <span class=""underline"">meḥabber</span>’s) wording, explained unclear passages, pointed out contradictions between different decisions, or added a rule, thus refining the major work. With the additions of Isserles the Shulḥan Arukh became a code which embraced the many differences existing in the various Jewish centers throughout the world. Isserles saw the need for a work such as the Shulḥan Arukh to accompany a more extensive “book or books of <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>” and through his editing and additions made the Shulḥan Arukh eventually an authoritative and binding code of Jewish law for Israel. The Shulḥan Arukh became acceptable to both Sephardim and Ashkenazim."
SA HUC Brahms.54,"In his discussions of the law, Isserles strove to give the <span class=""underline"">minhag</span>, or custom, the same force as the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> itself even when the <span class=""underline"">minhag</span> had no halakhic source. There are times when Isserles even accepted a custom as binding when it conflicted with the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. He also stated at times throughout his glosses to the Shulḥan Arukh that “the custom is a wrong one” or “if I had the power I would abrogate the custom, for it is based on an error and there is no reason to rely on it.” The majority of the customs which Isserles followed were of course those which developed among Ashkenazi Jews. It must be noted that Isserles was frequently lenient when an issue involved stress or when there was a considerable financial loss involved. He was among the very few <span class=""underline"">posekim</span> who decided many issues leniently."
SA HUC Brahms.55,"The importance Isserles placed on the <span class=""underline"">minhag</span>. his leniency in cases of loss, and his codification through the glosses of the Shulḥan Arukh caused him to be severely criticized by his contemporary scholars, especially one who studied with him in Lublin under Sholom Shachnan, Ḥayyim b. Bezalel. Despite the numerous reasons offered by Ḥayyim and other contemporary scholars to oppose Isserles, his rulings and customs became accepted as binding on Ashkenazi Jewry."
SA HUC Brahms.56,"The Shulḥan Arukh along with the glosses of Isserles received much criticism from oriental as well as Ashkenazi communities. Some critics noted discrepancies between the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> and the Shulḥan Arukh. Many scholars thought the work to be too simplistic, aimed at minors and ignoramuses. Even though many oriental scholars disagreed with Caro’s method of deciding according to the majority opinions of Alfasi, Maimonides, and Asher b. Jehiel, the fact that two hundred rabbis of Caro’s generation accepted this method as well as the majority of later scholars countered that criticism. Despite all the criticism, Caro’s decisions were accepted by the majority of oriental scholars even in his own lifetime."
SA HUC Brahms.57,"Ashkenazi criticism, even with the glosses of Isserles, was much more severe of Caro’s work. The main criticism stemmed from the fear that with the code, students could know the law without any effort and that the proper method of study by mastering scripture, Mishna, and Talmud would be neglected. One had to study and understand the law to make decisions based on talmudic and post-talmudic discussions. Polish Jewry especially thought it preferable to occasionally make a mistake in a legal decision through honest study than to base a decision on one single work without knowing what went into the basic reasoning. In addition Ashkenazi scholars found value in the non-uniformity of <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. This increased the possibility for deciding a law according to the <span class=""underline"">dayyan’</span>s own opinion, thus enabling the law to bend to existing circumstances. Others criticized the “compromise” decisions when no definite solution was clear. <span class=""underline"">Halakhah</span>, it was often felt, should only have been decided by the Talmud, and there were cases where Caro made a decision of a law that was not finally decided in the Talmud. Mordecai b. Abraham Jaffe, stated that his objection to Caro was that the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> was too extensive to study from, and the Shulḥan Arukh was too brief, therefore he wanted a balance between the two extremes. (He wrote <span class=""underline"">Levush</span><span class=""underline"">Malkhut</span> which attempted to achieve this goal.)"
SA HUC Brahms.58,"The criticism of Caro’s and Isserles’ code continued even into the seventeenth century basically because it deprived the <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span> of the mental exercise of wrestling with the halakhic material and coming to a decision employing the knowledge and underlying reasoning. It seemed that no code would become acceptable to all Jews, but two factors changed this. Joshua b. Alexander ha-Kohen Falk, who was a pupil of Isserles and Solomon Luria (who leveled criticism against the Shulḥan Arukh) found no fault in the form employed by the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Yosef</span>. Falk regarded the Shulḥan Arukh as a work which intended the law to be decided according to it <span class=""underline"">only</span> after the study of the talmudic sources through the <span class=""underline"">Tur</span> and the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Yosef</span>. Falk said that people were making a mistake by deciding simply according to the Shulḥan Arukh without totally understanding the substance of the decisions. Therefore Falk wrote a commentary on the Shulḥan Arukh itself. He wanted it to explain the Shulḥan Arukh and actually become a part of it, the Shulḥan Arukh not to be studied without his commentary. He felt this would eliminate any misunderstanding of the law if it were studied along with it. He called his commentary <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span><span class=""underline"">Me’irat</span><span class=""underline"">Einayim</span> or the “Sma” (the book of enlightening the eyes). He quoted the sources of each law and different opinions expressed, in addition to new rules. It is only found with the section <span class=""underline"">Hoshen</span><span class=""underline"">Mishpat</span>."
SA HUC Brahms.59,"Joel Sirkes, who wrote a commentary on the <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> entitled <span class=""underline"">Bayit</span><span class=""underline"">Ḥadash</span>, had the same idea as Falk. He composed a commentary that would provide a link between the commentary and its sources. After Falk and Sirkes a number of other commentaries arose, each one making the Shulḥan Arukh more binding and authoritative. They included the <span class=""underline"">Turei</span><span class=""underline"">Zahav</span> or “<span class=""underline"">Taz</span>” by David b. Samuel ha-Levi, on all the four parts of the Shulḥan Arukh; the <span class=""underline"">Siftei</span><span class=""underline"">Kohen</span> or “<span class=""underline"">Shakh</span>” on <span class=""underline"">Yoreh</span><span class=""underline"">De’ah</span> and <span class=""underline"">Ḥoshen</span><span class=""underline"">Mishpat</span> by Shabbetai b. Meir ha-Kohen; the <span class=""underline"">Ḥelkat</span><span class=""underline"">Meḥokek</span> by Moses Lima on the <span class=""underline"">Even</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Ezer</span>; the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Shemu’el</span> by Samuel b. Uri Shraga Phoebus also on <span class=""underline"">Even</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Ezer</span>; and <span class=""underline"">Magen</span><span class=""underline"">Avraham</span> on <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span><span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span> by Abraham Abele Gombiner."
SA HUC Brahms.60,"In addition to the commentaries of eminent scholars attached to the Shulḥan Arukh, external factors also attributed to the speedy acceptance of the Shulḥan Arukh as The Code of Jewish Law. Jewish life in the middle of the seventeenth century was disrupted in central Europe. The Chmielnicki massacres of 1648 destroyed many Jewish communities and halakhic centers. When there was such a disruption in Jewish life, a desire for codification and preservation of Jewish law resulted. This time a code was available and only required the approval of the leading scholars of the generation. One of the most respected seventeenth century German scholars, Menaḥem Mendel Krochmal, gave his support to the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span><span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> and the Shulḥan Arukh which by this time had become the authoritative and binding halakhic code."
SA HUC Brahms.61,"Even though there was a revival of codification literature every one to two centuries in the Jewish world since the geonic period of the eighth century, there has been no recognized authoritative code since the Shulḥan Arukh, but then the entire structure of the Jewish community has changed since the emancipation the Jews experienced in Europe beginning in the eighteenth century. Jewish society took on non-traditional elements to which an authoritative halakhic code was not only not binding but also of no significance. Halakhic interest lessened as did the number of works associated with it. After the eighteenth century only laws of regular daily life were of concern to the traditional Jew who was afraid to revitalize the authority of the individual <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span> to offer new decisions based on his own struggling with the talmudic sources for fear of a too radical change in the law. The Shulḥan Arukh thus remained binding. The laws of sections such as <span class=""underline"">Ḥoshen</span><span class=""underline"">Mishpat</span> (civil and criminal law) were mostly academic with Jews bound by the secular laws of the states in which they lived. (The <span class=""underline"">Arukh</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Shulḥan</span> by Jeḥiel Mikhal Epstein (died 1908) was an exception for it dealt with all four parts of the Shulḥan Arukh.) But nothing since the Shulḥan Arukh has replaced it as the authoritative code on Jewish law. All that has come after it is merely part of the commentaries surrounding the Shulḥan Arukh."
SA HUC Brahms.62,"There has been a development in halakhic literature since the Shulḥan Arukh, and it made up a significant contribution to this field which must be taken into account by modern day halakhic decision makers. This development has consisted of responsa, commentaries, and novellae in addition to changes, <span class=""underline"">takkanot</span>, decreed in the laws and differences in customs as the daily life of a Jew has altered. But for the most part these new contributions look back on the Shulḥan Arukh as the authoritative work in <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">ibid</span>., all of the above including the commentary offered by the author of this thesis.</i>.</sup>"
SA HUC Brahms.63,"The body of this rabbinic thesis is an annotated, original translation of the material found in the Shulḥan Arukh along with the glosses by Rabbi Moses Isserles concerning the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur. The original Hebrew is found in the section <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span><span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span>, chapters 604-624. <span class=""underline"">Hilkhot</span><span class=""underline"">Yom</span><span class=""underline"">ha-Kippurim</span>, the Laws of Yom Kippur, are presented by Joseph Caro in an orderly and systematic method. The Holy Day is covered chronologically in the Shulḥan Arukh from prior to its arrival, through the evening, night, morning, afternoon, evening, and following the conclusion of the holiday. Almost all conceivable circumstances or conditions that one would encounter are covered in the code as to what is the correct action to take or not to take. Situations involving pregnancy, sickness, fire, prayer, children, food, clothing, mental attitude, marital relations and the like are included in these chapters. The Shulḥan Arukh on the Laws of Yom Kippur fulfilled its original goals of having a short, clear, concise, and authoritative guide of Jewish halakhic decisions assembled in a usable form (if one could read the original Hebrew, for prior to this thesis, the total original material had not been translated into English). The Shulḥan Arukh on this subject does not stand alone as a source for the original talmudic logic and scholarly debate that went on to form the halakhic decisions, nor would it be sufficient if it were the only text consulted in formulating a reaction to a new situation that required a <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span> to make a new halakhic decision, but it is a useful code which serves as a digest of the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> concerning Yom Kippur."
SA HUC Brahms.64,"Yom Kippur is to the Jew the most holy day of the entire year. It is rich with special customs, prayers, thoughts and emotions for every Jew regardless of his philosophical or theological leanings. I offer this work in the hope that through it some might be able to find more understanding and meaning in the tradition which surrounds this Day of Atonement, so that it might become a way for each person to find peace with oneself and with God’s world."

"SA HUC Brahms, “the Laws of Yom Kippur”shulḥan Arukhoraḥḥayyim.3","<span class=""underline"">Hagah</span>:<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">Hagah, <span dir=""rtl"">הגה</span>, introduces the notes added to the text of Joseph Caro by Rabbi Moses b. Israel Isserles. Isserles is also known as “the Rema”, an acronym for <span class=""underline"">R</span>abbi <span class=""underline"">M</span>oses <span class=""underline"">I</span>sserles. He was a Polish rabbi, codifier and halakhic authority, who lived from 1525 or 1530 until 1572. He was born in Cracow under the name of Isserel-Lazarus which was later shortened to Isserles. He studied in Lublin at the yeshivah of Sholom Shachna. Isserles obtained such a fine reputation that he became known as the “Maimonides of Polish Jewry”. Isserles was in the middle of writing a code himself following the pattern of the four <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> by Jacob b. Asher which he called <span class=""underline"">Darkhei</span> <span class=""underline"">Moshe</span> which was to assemble the halakhic material of his time in a short, synoptic form so that a <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span>, a decision maker, could more easily find the material he needed to formulate a ruling on a particular issue. In the middle of his writing of the <span class=""underline"">Darkhei</span> <span class=""underline"">Moshe</span> he received a copy of the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span> <span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> of Joseph Caro which in essence had already accomplished this goal. But Isserles decided to complete his work operating a bit differently than did Caro. Isserles did not always agree with Caro’s selection of the “three pillars of halakhic decisions”, Alfasi, Maimonides, and Asher b. Jehiel to decide issues. He followed the principle which stated that laws should be decided according to later scholars. He also often agreed with Asher b. Jehiel and his son Jacob b. Asher even when they were in the minority, unlike Caro. Also Isserles realized that Caro ignored in his work Ashkenazi practices that were very much a part of his Polish and European community but were not included in Caro’s work in the world of Sephardi Jewry.<br>Isserles wrote other halakhic works, such as <span class=""underline"">Torat</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥattat</span> which focused on mainly Jewish dietary laws. Finally Isserles received the Shulḥan Arukh by Joseph Caro. Like the earlier and more extensive <span class=""underline"">Beit</span> <span class=""underline"">Yosef</span>, it lacked many halakhic contributions and customs, <span class=""underline"">minhagim</span>, of Ashkenazi Jewry and was therefore not an adequate code for this segment of the Jewish world. Isserles decided to add notes (<span class=""underline"">hagah</span> or <span class=""underline"">hagahot</span>) to the body of the Shulḥan Arukh which has also been referred to as the “<span class=""underline"">mappah</span>” or “tablecloth” over the “Shulḥan Arukh” or “prepared table”. In his glosses, Isserles added his conclusions which he drew in his work <span class=""underline"">Darkhei</span> <span class=""underline"">Moshe</span> to the Shulḥan Arukh. In many cases he disagreed with Caro and he stated his disagreement, or he would cite an Ashkenazi custom not found in Caro’s work. He maintained the brief style employed by Caro, and he provided the existence of differing points of view by later scholars and Ashkenazi Jews which he felt were needed for a <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span> to be able to arrive at a correct decision. He often modified the views of the <span class=""underline"">meḥabber</span>, the author, as he referred to Caro, he explained, contradicted, added to and refined the structure.<br>Isserles put much emphasis on the custom, the <span class=""underline"">minhag</span>. He often gave it the same force as the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. If there was no halakhah in existence, or in some cases where a <span class=""underline"">minhag</span> and a <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> conflicted with each other, he decided according to the <span class=""underline"">minhag</span>, the custom which the people actually followed in their daily lives. If Isserles disagreed with a particular custom he would state so and he would urge against following such a custom.<br>Isserles was very lenient in cases of stress or in cases which would involve considerable financial loss. His leniency, which was seldom found in the works of others, was the subject of criticism by many of his contemporaries particularly Ḥayyim b. Bezalel who studied with him under Sholom Shachnan in Lublin. Even in view of the extensive criticism Isserles received, his notes to the Shulḥan Arukh became accepted and his rulings and customs were binding on Ashkenazi Jewry. The <span class=""underline"">mappah</span> of Isserles made the Shulḥan Arukh of Caro acceptable to Ashkenazi Jews and the authoritative code that it remains to this day.<br>The Shulḥan Arukh which was first published in Venice in 1565, was first published with the <span class=""underline"">mappah</span> of Isserles in Cracow in 1569-71 and it has been a part of the accepted text ever since.<br>Louis Ginzberg in Menachem Elon, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., “Codification of Law” v. 5. pp. 628-56;<br>Simḥa Katz, “Isserles, Moses ben Israel”, v. 9, pp.1081-85.</i>.</sup> It is forbidden to fast on it (the Eve of Yom Kippur), even a dream fast<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">A fast was recommended to be observed as the result of an ominous dream (or a nightmare), <span class=""underline"">ta’anit</span> <span class=""underline"">ḥalom</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">תענית הלום</span>, to avert the evil consequences dreamt. In talmudic times and later it was believed that bad dreams could have pernicious effects. The fast was regarded of such urgency that the rabbis permitted it even on the Sabbath, but one was to fast on a weekday as well, as a repentance for having dishonored the Sabbath Joy through fasting.

He was born in Mainz and became the foremost talmudist of his generation and the head of the Jewish communities of Germany, Austria, and Bohemia. He studied under his father and later went to Austria where he was ordained after studying under Meir ha-Levi and Sholom b. Isaac. After the death of his father, Maharil established a yeshivah from which came the greatest rabbis of Germany and Austria.<br>Moellin was famous and halakhic questions were asked of him throughout Europe. Many of his rulings became the foundation of the Jewish way of life for German Jewry. His decisions were characterized by the fact that he took into account the conditions of the time including the economic situation of a particular community. He would often decide to be strict in a case where a community had no rabbinic leadership. Moellin was concerned about leaders who did not possess the proper authority and the neglect of proper Torah and talmudic study that resulted from decisions arrived at using codified halakhic works instead of thorough original investigation. He placed a great deal of importance on charity and the honor of the poor.<br>Moellin was an accomplished <span class=""underline"">ḥazzan</span> and fought for the preservation of traditional melodies for the liturgy.

It was these customs of Germany that Moses Isserles used so often in his glosses to the Shulḥan Arukh. The second work was a collection of responsa arranged by Eleazar b.

If he expressed it using the word “vow”, the law is as if one has taken them upon himself, with the expression, a vow (it has the legal character of a vow).

That is if one “vows” to fast on the Eve of Yom Kippur then he must if he uses the words “vow” and “fast”.

It is normally part of the daily Morning, <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> (see footnote 17), and Afternoon, <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> (see footnote 40), Services. It is recited after the reader’s repetition of the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> (see footnote 43). The <span class=""underline"">taḥanun</span> begins silently with a selection from II Samuel 24:14 which was uttered by King David after he was rebuked by the prophet Gad for sinning by numbering the people: “let us fall, I pray thee, into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are many, but let me not fall into the hands of man.” The prayer is referred to literally as the “prostration prayer” because the Bible mentions the fact that one prostrates oneself during petitions (Deuteronomy 9:18; Joshua 7:6), and the prayer <span class=""underline"">taḥanun</span> was therefore customarily recited in the prostrate position. Today the prayer is recited while one is seated with one’s head bowed into the bend of one’s arm when a Torah Scroll is present to indicate the sanctity of the location. The Sephardi ritual begins the <span class=""underline"">taḥanun</span> with a silent confession of sins, <span class=""underline"">viddui</span> (see footnote 39) followed by the verse from II Samuel 24:14. The central part of the prayer for the Ashkenazim is Psalm 6 and for the Sephardim the penitential psalm, Psalm 25.

There was no one book from which Isserles drew his <span class=""underline"">minhagim</span>, his customs, but rather he drew them from various <span class=""underline"">minhagim</span> books available to him and from customs he was familiar with in daily life. Many of the <span class=""underline"">minhagim</span> from which Isserles drew were contained in a book entitled <span class=""underline"">Minahage</span> <span class=""underline"">Maharil</span> or <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">Maharil</span> published in 1556 in Sabionetta which was compiled by Zalman of Saint Goar.

When the term is used in the plural, <span class=""underline"">seliḥot</span>, it refers to a special order of service which consists of non-statuatory additional prayers which are recited on all fast days, on occasions of special intercession, and during the Penitential season which begins with a special <span class=""underline"">Seliḥot</span> Service usually held at midnight on the Saturday night immediately preceding Rosh HaShanah and concludes with Yom Kippur. The Mishna (Ta’an 2:1-4) gives the order of the service for public fasts which were often proclaimed during periods of drought and it provided for six additional blessings inserted into the daily <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> after the sixth blessing which is a prayer for forgiveness of sins (see footnote 43).<br>The first mention of any kind of definite order of <span class=""underline"">Seliḥot</span> is found in <span class=""underline"">Tanna</span> <span class=""underline"">de-Vei</span>, Eliyahu Zuta (23 end). The order of <span class=""underline"">Sheliḥot</span> was not found until the ninth century in the <span class=""underline"">Seder</span> of R. Amram which included “May He Who answered” and the biblical verse “Thee Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundent in goodness and truth” (Exodus 34:6) along with others.<br>Over the centuries many more <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> with the theme of forgiveness have been added to the <span class=""underline"">Seliḥot</span> prayers. Because of the many liturgical poems added at various times, many Jewish communities have had their own distinct rites evolve. It became a Palestinian custom not to say the <span class=""underline"">Seliḥot</span> prayers during the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> but after it, and this became the custom generally accepted (Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span>, 566:4).<br><span class=""underline"">Seliḥot</span> prayers were originally confined to fast days. God was just, and it was felt that if one confessed one’s sins and prayed for forgiveness, calamities which were the result of Israel’s sins, would be averted. In modern times the <span class=""underline"">Seliḥot</span> prayers were first recited in conjunction with the six fast days prior to Rosh HaShanah and then they were extended to include the ten days of Penitence including Yom Kippur but not Rosh HaShanah in the Ashkenazi ritual. Among Sephardi Jews it was a custom to recite <span class=""underline"">Seliḥot</span> for forty days from Rosh Ḥodesh Elul (the New Moon of the month of Elul, the last month of the Hebrew year preceding the New Year beginning with Rosh HaShanah on the New Moon of Tishrei) until Yom Kippur. The Ashkenazi custom was evolved in our day to recite <span class=""underline"">Seliḥot</span> from midnight on the Saturday night prior to Rosh HaShanah or the week before that should Rosh HaShanah fall on a Monday or a Tuesday. (Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span>, 581 with the Isserles). Only on the first night is <span class=""underline"">Seliḥot</span> recited at midnight. On all other days it is recited in the Morning Service.<br>Present day customs also allow individuals to recite <span class=""underline"">Seliḥot</span> on semi-official voluntary fasts.<br>Louis Isaac Rabinowitz, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 14, pp. 1133-34.</i>.</sup>” (prayers of forgiveness), but there are places where it is customary to increase <span class=""underline"">seliḥot</span>.

The prayer is not said during Friday <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Afternoon, on the Sabbath, or on the day before Yom Kippur. If the day before Yom Kippur is a Friday then the prayer is recited during the Morning, <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> Service (see footnote 17). Each of the forty-four invocations of the prayer begins “<span class=""underline"">Avinu</span> <span class=""underline"">Malkhenu</span>”, “Our Father our King”. This litancy has the elements of a confessional and petitionary prayer. The prayer is quite old and the Talmud attributes some of the lines to Rabbi Akiba when they were spoken on a fast day due to a drought. The prayer was expanded over the centuries to include prayers for life, pardon, and the needs and trials of human existence.

After the destruction of the Temple the rabbis made the recitation of the <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> prayer obligatory to replace the daily morning sacrafice called the <span class=""underline"">Tamid</span> which had been performed in the Temple (Ber. 26b).<br>There are basically eight parts to the <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> Service and they are the following: (1) The Morning Benedictions or <span class=""underline"">Birkhot</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Shaḥar</span>, <span dir=""ltr"">ברכות השחר</span>, these are preliminaries to the Morning Service and they consist of hymns, blessings, and meditations, the themes of which are generally concerned with the change of night to day and of sleep to wakefulness. There are also readings from the Torah and rabbinical writings to get the soul ready for worship. Originally this part of the service was to be read at home before coming to the synagogue for communal prayer.<br>Hertz, <span class=""underline"">op</span>. <span class=""underline"">cit</span>., p. 4.<br>(2) The Psalms and Passages of Song or <span class=""underline"">Pesukai</span> <span class=""underline"">de-Zimra</span>, <span dir=""ltr"">פסוקי דזמרא</span>. This section of psalms and anthems is intended to serve as the transference from private worship in the first section to public prayer. The tradition says that pious men during the days of the Second Temple would completely read the entire Book of Psalms everyday. This was an ideal that men with necessary work could never emulate, thus it became the custom to read at least six psalms in the morning, Psalms 145-150. There have been additions to this nucleus. Prior to the above mentioned psalms, are recited other psalm-like selections, I Chronicles 16:8-36, a collection of Biblical verses, Psalm 100, and more Biblical verses. Psalms 145-150 are followed by responses of adoration (“doxologies”), the benediction of David, I Chronicles 29:10-13; the prayer of Nehemiah 9:6-11; and the Song of Moses, Exodus 14:30 - 15:18. Therefore this section contains no formal prayers but only psalm-like material. It was brought into the Morning Service by Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg (1230-1293).<br><span class=""underline"">ibid</span>., pp. 50-1.<br>(3) Reading of the <span class=""underline"">Shema</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">קריאת שמע</span>, and its benedictions. This is truely the central part of the Morning (and the Evening) Service. It is Israel’s confession of faith in the One God. The worshipper, by reciting it, proclaims his allegiance to the Kingdom of Heaven and his submission to God’s commandments. The <span class=""underline"">Shema</span> is preceded by two blessings; (1) The <span class=""underline"">Yotzer</span>, <span dir=""ltr"">יוצד</span>, Prayer which is a prayer of thanksgiving for the creation of physical life, for the actual light of day and for God’s renewal of creation which is demonstrated by the fact that the sun, the light, returns; and (2) The <span class=""underline"">Ahavah</span> <span class=""underline"">Rabbah</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">אהבה רבה</span>, a gracious prayer of thanksgiving, gives thanks to God for the light of Torah which he gave to Israel and its moral teachings.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Shema</span> in the <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> Service is followed by two prayers; (1) the <span class=""underline"">Emet</span> <span class=""underline"">Veyaẓiv</span>, <span dir=""ltr"">אמת ויציב</span>, which means (True and Firm). The prayer confirms the faith in the declarations that were made in the <span class=""underline"">Shema</span>. (2) and the prayer <span class=""underline"">Go’el</span> <span class=""underline"">Israel</span>, <span dir=""ltr"">גואל ישראל</span>, the Redeemer of Israel which praises God.<br><span class=""underline"">ibid</span>., p. 108.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Shema</span> itself consists of three Torah sections, Deuteronomy 6:4-8; 11:13-22; and Numbers 15:37-42. It is a proclamation of God’s Unity and Oneness, Israel’s total loyalty to God and his commandments, the belief in Divine Justice, the rememberance of the liberation from Egypt, and the choosing of Israel. Together these form the foundation of Jewish faith.<br><span class=""underline"">ibid</span>., p. 116.<br>(4) The Amidah, <span dir=""ltr"">עמידה</span>, is the most central and important part of the service next to the <span class=""underline"">Shema</span>. It is also referred to as the <span class=""underline"">Tefillah</span>, <span dir=""ltr"">התפילה</span>, “The Prayer” and the <span class=""underline"">Shemoneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Esreh</span>. <span dir=""ltr"">שמונה עשרה</span>, or eighteen benedictions because it originally contained eighteen separate benedictions but which has come down to us as a prayer consisting of nineteen benedictions during the regular daily worship service. The Prayer is recited three times a day silently while standing, therefore the name <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> which means “standing” became associated with it. The benedictions contain expressions of praise, thanksgiving, confession, and petition to God.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> contains three basic parts. The first part consists of three opening benedictions which are praises. They glorify God, His everlasting love and His infinite holiness. The second part of the weekday <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> contains thirteen blessings (which were originally only twelve) which are petitions for the individual as well as for the nation. This middle section of the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> is different on the Sabbath and festivals. On the Sabbath there is only one benediction in the middle of the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> (therefore only a total of seven benedictions) and it concerns the special nature of the day. A <span class=""underline"">Kedusha</span> or a sanctification of the name of God, is included in this section of the Sabbath morning <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span>. On the festivals this is also the case with a special middle benediction which concerns the unique nature of the holiday. This is true of all festivals except Rosh HaShanah which contains three central blessings in its <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> (see footnote 166), thus making a total of nine benedictions.<br>The third part of the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> consists of three closing benedictions whose theme is one of thanksgiving. The first three and last three benedictions never change regardless of which service the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> is found in or on what day it is recited. The prayer is first recited privately in silence and it is then repeated out loud by the reader (except for the Evening Service, see footnote 144) for the benefit of those who are unable to say it themselves (see also footnote 42).<br><span class=""underline"">ibid</span>., pp. 130-31.<br>(5) The <span class=""underline"">Taḥanun</span>, <span dir=""ltr"">תחנון</span>, prayers of confession; see footnote 10.<br>(6) The Torah reading on the mornings that it is required, namely on the Sabbath, festivals, Mondays, Thursdays, New Moons, the intermediate days of Passover and Succot, Purim and public fast days. Normally, that is on most Sabbaths, Mondays and Thursdays the Torah is read according to its regular weekly division of fifty-four (on a leap year and fifty on a non-leap year) portions. On special Sabbaths, festivals, and other occasions specially designated portions are read which have a relationship with that particular occasion.<br>(7) <span class=""underline"">Ashrei</span>. <span dir=""ltr"">אשרי</span>, “Happy are they” is basically Psalm 20 and a collection of Biblical quotations. It is in essence a prophetic lesson and a second sanctification.<br>(8) <span class=""underline"">Aleinu</span> <span class=""underline"">le-Shabbe’aḥ</span>, <span dir=""ltr"">עלינו לשבח</span>, “It is our duty to praise the Lord” is recited at the conclusion of the Morning Service. It is usually preceded by a full <span class=""underline"">Kaddish</span> (see footnote 177) read by the reader and it is followed by a Mourner’s Kaddish. The <span class=""underline"">Aleinu</span> or adoration prayer since the fourteenth century has been a proclaimation of God as the Supreme King of the Universe and the God of a United Humanity. In the first part Israel aknowledges that it has been selected for service to God and the second half proclaims Israel’s faith and hope that all idolatry will disappear and that all activity will be turned to God. All will be united under the Kingship of God.<br>Hertz, <span class=""underline"">op</span>. <span class=""underline"">cit.</span>, p. 208.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> Service remains fairly constant in the prayers recited every morning except for the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> which changes according to the occasion as described above. There are also additions to the <span class=""underline"">pesukei</span> <span class=""underline"">de-zimra</span> (2) on Sabbaths and festivals, and on festivals and New Moons the <span class=""underline"">Hallel</span> (special psalms of praise and thanksgiving which consist of Psalms 113-118 with various Psalms omitted on certain festivals) is added. Special <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> (see footnote 149) are also inserted on certain Sabbaths and festivals during the <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> Service.<br>The Mishna and Talmud discuss when the <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> Service should be recited. The <span class=""underline"">Shema</span> must be recited from the period of time which begins with daybreak and ends after a quarter of the day has passed (Ber. 1:2; Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span>, 58:1). One must recite the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> during the hours encompassed by sunrise and a third of the day (Ber. 4:1; Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span>, 89:1). If by chance the recitation of the daily prayers was delayed they could be recited until midday (Ber. 4:1; Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span> 89:1). If the <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> is not recited, an extra Amidah is added during the <span class=""underline"">Minḥaḥ</span>, Afternoon Service.<br>During the daily weekday <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> Service the <span class=""underline"">tallit</span>, prayer shawl, and the <span class=""underline"">tefillin</span>, phylacteries, are worn. On the Sabbath and festivals only the <span class=""underline"">tallit</span> is worn. One wears neither <span class=""underline"">tallit</span> nor <span class=""underline"">tefillin</span> on the Ninth day of Av for the <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> Serivce but wears them instead for the <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Service. One must not interupt one’s prayer by speaking from the prayer “<span class=""underline"">Barukh</span> <span class=""underline"">she-Amar</span>” which precedes the <span class=""underline"">pesukei</span> <span class=""underline"">de-zimra</span> until after the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span>.<br>Editorial Staff, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 14, pp. 1257-58.</i>.</sup> (Morning Prayers) on the Eve of Yom Kippur."
"SA HUC Brahms, “the Laws of Yom Kippur”shulḥan Arukhoraḥḥayyim.6","<span class=""underline"">CHAPTER</span><span class=""underline"">605</span> - “The custom of “<span class=""underline"">kapprot</span><sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Kapparot,</span> <span dir=""ltr"">כפרות</span>, which is plural for <span class=""underline"">Kapparah</span>, meaning expiation. This is a custom where the sins of a person are symbolically transferred to a fowl. This practice is mostly done on the day before Yom Kippur and in some congregations it is also performed on the day before Rosh HaShanah or on Hoshana Rabba. During the ceremony Psalms 107;10,14,17-21 and Job 33:23-24 are recited. Following this a cock is taken for a male and a hen for a female, the fowl is swung around one’s head three times while the person says: “This is my substitute, my vicarious offering, my atonement; this cock (or hen) shall meet death, but I shall find a long and pleasent life of peace”. It is thought by some (erroneously) that the fowl assumes the punishment for sins that the person would normally receive. Often the fowl is donated to the poor minus the intestines which are given to the birds. Some people substitute the monetary value of the fowl and donate that to the poor.<br>The custom is not a talmudic one. It first appears in the writings of the <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> (see footnote 19) in the ninth century. The connection between a man and a cock is that both can be referred to as a <span class=""underline"">gever</span>, so a <span class=""underline"">gever</span> (man) can transfer his sins on to another <span class=""underline"">gever</span> (cock). Another reason for the use of a cock or a hen was due to the fact that after the destruction of the Temple, no animal used in the sacrificial rite could be used for a similar purpose outside the Temple. The cock and the hen had no Temple cultic connection. Caro, along with R. Solomon b. Abraham Adret and Naḥmanides opposed this custom but Isserles included it because of its practice in the Ashkenazi community where it had taken on mystic interpretations from the Kabbalists.<br>Editorial Staff, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 10, pp. 756-57.<br>The basic Hebrew sources and comments on <span class=""underline"">Kapparot</span> are the following:<br><span class=""underline"">Tur</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">טור</span>, (see footnote 23) 605 - There are places where it is customary to slaughter a rooster as atonement (for <span class=""underline"">Kapparah</span>). And thus it is (related) in geonic (see footnote 19) responsa: “You asked; we customarily slaughter a rooster on the Eve of Yom Kippur, and we do not know the reason for this custom. If it is an “exchange” (substitute) for a sacrifice (if it symbolizes a sacrifice), then what is the difference between a rooster and cattle or a beast, but certainly there is a problem. However, there are two reasons: (1) a rooster is found more commonly in a household than any cattle, beast, or fowl; (2) There are places of wealthy people who substitute rams; and the main horned animal (for the Yom Kippur ceremony) is analogous to the ram of our father Isaac (which was substituted for him (Isaac) as a sacrifice), therefore the matter (of using a rooster) is not established (determined).”<br>In addition we have heard from the early scholars that even though the price of a cattle is higher than that of a rooster, nevertheless a rooster is chosen because its designation is <span class=""underline"">gever</span> (man, rooster) as is said in (<span class=""underline"">Yoma</span> 20a): What is the meaning of <span class=""underline"">Kara</span> <span class=""underline"">Gavra</span>, R. Sila says the meaning is that the rooster crows and since its designation is <span class=""underline"">gever</span> and the exchange is of one <span class=""underline"">gever</span> (rooster) for another <span class=""underline"">gever</span> (man), therefore it (using a rooster) is effective and superior (to any other animal). And this is the custom here, the congregational reader holds the rooster and lays his hand on its head (in the manner in which a sacrifice was performed in the Temple) and then he takes it (the rooster) and lays it upon the head of the one seeking atonement and says (the verses in the Prayer Book used in this service (<span class=""underline"">Oẓar</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Tefillot</span>, volume 2, pp. 1090-91)). “This (<span class=""underline"">gever</span>, rooster) for this (<span class=""underline"">gever</span>, man), this substitutes this, this is in exchange for this,” and he (the reader) returns it upon him once (swings it around his (the one seeking atonement’s) head one time) and says (psalms 107:10,14,17,19-21) “Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron…He brought them out of darkness and and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder…Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities are afflicted… Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and He saves them out of their distress. He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. Oh, that men would praise the Lord for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men.” “Thou shalt give life for life”, (Exodus 21:23). And he (the reader) does this according to this order three times, and after this he lays his hand on the head of the rooster in the way of the <span class=""underline"">Semikhah</span>, putting the hands on it (the animal’s head before slaughtering) and slaughter it immediately after the <span class=""underline"">Semikhah</span>, and they customarily give it (the slaughtered rooster) to the poor so there would be atonement for his own soul (for the one who gives it).<br>That it was customary to throw the insides of it (the rooster) on the roof in order to give them to the birds, there is some proof (indication, justification) for this from the Talmud tractate <span class=""underline"">Ḥulin</span> (95a) 110a: “Rami b. Tamri… once happened to be in Sura on the Eve of Yom Kippur. When the townspeople took all the udders (<span class=""underline"">Tur</span>: Liver and Kidneys) (of the animals) and threw them away, he immediately went and collected them and ate them”.<br>In the Prayer Book <span class=""underline"">Oẓar</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Tefillot</span>, <span dir=""ltr"">אוצר התפילות</span> Published by Sefer, New York, 1946, page 1089, there is an extensive, detailed note with Rashi’s (description of) the custom of the <span class=""underline"">Kapparot</span> ceremony on the Eve of Yom Kippur. Rashi already described this custom meaning it was a common practice during his time.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Kapparot</span> ceremony is not mentioned in the Talmud, only in Rashi. It is mentioned in <span class=""underline"">Maḥzor</span> <span class=""underline"">Vitry</span> by R.

The <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> were the highest Jewish authorities. In the tenth and eleventh centuries heads of academies in Ereẓ Israel were also called <span class=""underline"">geonim</span>. The geonic period proper ended in 1040. The heads of the academies in Baghdad, Damascus, and Egypt were also called geonim and later it became a term applied as an honor to any rabbi who had great toraitic knowledge.<br>It cannot exactly be determined when the term <span class=""underline"">gaon</span> came into use. Prior to its use generally the term <span class=""underline"">rosh</span> <span class=""underline"">yeshivah</span> <span class=""underline"">shel</span> <span class=""underline"">golah</span>, the head of the academy of the Diaspora, was used. The heads of these academies were appointed by the exilarchs, the political leaders of the Jewish people in exile. People rose to the office of <span class=""underline"">gaon</span> often through an hierarchy of offices, thus not always did the most learned reach the position. Often the office was used for political purposes by the exilarch. An assistant to the <span class=""underline"">gaon</span> was referred to as the <span class=""underline"">av</span> <span class=""underline"">bet</span> <span class=""underline"">din</span>. The position of <span class=""underline"">gaon</span> usually fell upon an elderly man who could only serve for a rather short period of time, and therefore did not always make a great impression.<br>Babylonia was the center of world Jewry and the Jews looked to the <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> as a source of instruction for Jews and also as the deciders of Jewish law. The <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> formed many new halakhic decisions which evolved in the Diaspora. They formulated <span class=""underline"">takkanot</span> or ordinances which altered Jewish law according to the new situations. The <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> and their academies were supported by taxes levied against the people for this purpose.<br>The halakhic decision of a <span class=""underline"">gaon</span> generally had the effect of law and it was binding. Due to the new situation which the Diaspora provided many halakhic decisions of the <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> were based on <span class=""underline"">minhagim</span>, or customs, that took on the force of a law (the principle under which Isserles operated). Their responsa to halakhic questions were followed as law. The goal of the <span class=""underline"">gaon</span> in the Diaspora was mainly to interpret the Babylonian Talmud for the Babylonian Jews and to lessen their emotional attachment to Ereẓ Israel. This created much political animosity between the Jews of Babylonia and those left in Ereẓ Israel. Since the major scholars of the time where exiled to Babylonia, the center of Jewish leadership was in the hands of the <span class=""underline"">gaon</span> for a long period of time, more than four centuries.<br>The goanate, though, did lose its power even though some of the greatest geonim were among the later ones. From the late ninth century onward, most of the <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> did not live in the cities of the academies, Sura and Pumbedita, they lived in Baghdad along with the exilarch. Competition between the two academies and political disagreements over the appointment of <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> lessened their effectiveness as did the rise of new academies and their leaders. Scholars stopped sending them halakhic questions preferring their own ability to arrive at a decision. Jewish communities outside of Babylonia began taking on independence from the original center of the Diaspora. As the caliphate in Baghdad weakened, financial support from other Jewish communities ceased for the Babylonian academies. The gaonate ended as an institution around 1040.<br>The religious leaders of Baghdad and later Ereẓ Israel took on the title of <span class=""underline"">gaon</span> after the fall of the gaonate in Babylonia. The position of the <span class=""underline"">gaon</span> in Ereẓ Israel was one passed on by heredity. The geonim in Ereẓ Israel had to manage all Jewish affairs in addition to heading the academy. They ordained rabbis, appointed judges, and managed the economic affairs of the Jews. The title of <span class=""underline"">gaon</span> finally spread to Damascus and Egypt where it eventually died out in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br>Simha Assaf and Editorial Staff, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 7, pp. 315-24.</i>.</sup> who listed this custom (as a proper custom) and likewise many of the <span class=""underline"">aḥronim</span> listed it thusly.

Caro began writing the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span> <span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> in 1522 and completed it in 1542 in Safed. It was first published in 1555. The <span class=""underline"">Beit</span> <span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> followed the format of the four <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> established by Jacob b.

Caro included in the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span> <span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> all the halakhic material in use during his time which included the talmudic sources and also the post-talmudic scholars which he used to reach an halakhic decision. Caro linked himself to the <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> and did not repeat halakhic material already cited in the <span class=""underline"">Turim</span>. Caro employed the method of determining <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> by following the majority decision of his “three pillars of halakhic decisions”, Alfasi, Maimonides, and Asher b. Jehiel. If there was no majority decision by these three he consulted and decided according to the majority of another five scholars, Naḥmanides, Solomon b. Abraham Adret, Nissim Gerondi, Mordecai b. Hillel, and Moses b. Jacob of Coucy. If none of these men dealt with a particular law he decided according to the opinions of the majority of “famous” scholars. Caro consulted thirty-two works in his research. In this extensive work Caro created a book of Jewish law. He wanted to create then a companion book that would truly be a code. Therefore he wrote the Shulḥan Arukh which basically listed only the decisions that Caro reached in the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span> <span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> and not all the arguments and sources. The Shulḥan Arukh merely stated what the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> was and how it was practiced.

The Shulḥan Arukh appeared which was basically a digest of the larger <span class=""underline"">Beit</span> <span class=""underline"">Yosef</span>, but the <span class=""underline"">Levush</span> was completed so as to include the laws observed by the Ashkenazi Jews of Behemia. Mordecai ben Abraham Jaffe (1535-1612) wrote the <span class=""underline"">Levush</span>. He was born in Prague and studied under Solomon Luria and Moses Isserles. While he was writing the <span class=""underline"">Levush</span> he learned that Isserles was attempting the same goal he was to include the Ashkenazi laws in the Shulḥan Arukh so he put aside his work. When Jaffe received the glosses of his teacher Isserles he thought it was too brief and therefore he set about completing his <span class=""underline"">Levush</span>. There are ten <span class=""underline"">levushim</span> in all, five are devoted to the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span> <span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> and the other five to other works; Ephraim Kupfer, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 9, pp. 1263-64). And this is the custom even with two persons, and this is the implied meaning at the end of chapter 12 in (the Talmud Tractate) <span class=""underline"">Menaḥot</span>. And Ashkenazi R. Isaac (who was called Adoneinu R. Yitzḥak by the <span class=""underline"">Ḥasidim</span>, referring to Isaac Luria the Kabbalist) prescribed that she take three (chickens), (<span class=""underline"">Shenei</span> <span class=""underline"">Luḥot</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Berit</span>, <span dir=""ltr"">של״ב</span>, “Two Tablets of the Covenant”; which is an extensive halakhic work including homily and <span class=""underline"">Kabbalah</span> giving directions as to how to live an ethical life. The vast work contains two parts, the <span class=""underline"">Derekh</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span> contains laws according to the order of the festivals in the calendar, and the <span class=""underline"">Luḥot</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Berit</span> summarizes the 613 commandments in the order in which they appear in the Bible. The work was written by Isaiah ben Abraham ha-Levi Horowitz who lived from around 1565 until 1630. He was born in Prague but lived and studied mostly in Poland. He later moved to Ereẓ Israel and lead the Ashkenazi community in Jerusalem. He was greatly influenced by Kabbalistic works and philosophy which is evident in his writings; Haim Hillel Ben-Sasson <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 8, 990-994).</i>.</sup> for the possibility she might give birth to a male (infant). The (custom is to) chose white roosters<sup>20b</sup><i class=""footnote"">A commentary by <span class=""underline"">Magen</span> <span class=""underline"">Avraham</span> (see footnote 33): 605:3 - “White roosters”: Anyhow, one should not try to get only white (chickens), which is similar to the practice of the Amorites (meaning, idol worshippers).

Asher (see footnote 23), where each law is traced to its talmudic source, and the development of the law through successive generations of interpretation is followed. The work was prompted by the over-reliance on codes, especially the Shulḥan Arukh for halakhic decisions, without using the basic sources. The work was written by Joel Sirkes who lived from 1561 until 1640. He was born in Lublin but came to be the head of the <span class=""underline"">bet</span> <span class=""underline"">din</span>, the rabbinical court, in Cracow where he also headed a yeshivah in 1619.

And if there is no chicken, he should buy another kind of animal, and there are those who say even fish (can be used), (<span class=""underline"">Levush</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">לבוש</span>, see footnote 20a.).

And even though the rooster is not proper as a sacrifice, since we found that it is a forbidden practice in chapter 469 (of the Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span>) concerning the matter of such meat for the Passover for which the <span class=""underline"">Maharil</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">מהרי״ל</span>, (see footnote 8) forbid even a rooster, and how much the more so here, where one does it explicitly as a sacrificial matter, that this fear is present (this consideration that it might be prohibited is present). This being so it is better to prevent this matter, (following the dictum to sit and not do it is better.

In a case of doubt do not do such a thing.) And so it seems to me in my humble opinion.</i>.</sup> on it like (it was done with) the Sacrifice<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">The “laying of the hands” of the priest onto the animal that was sacrificed was part of the rite which transformed the animal from a mere profane animal into a holy sacrifice to God. Sacrifice from the biblical through the temple Period in Jerusalem was the way in which man communicated with God. Extensive rituals and practices developed around the sacrifice which was performed by the special priestly class, the <span class=""underline"">cohanim</span>. The main thrust behind a sacrifice was the fact that man was surrendering to God a living thing of some value to man. This brought out vividly the fact that all things man has on earth are given by God and ultimately God has complete control over man and all He has given to man. Special concern was placed on the blood of an animal sacrifice for <span class=""underline"">dam</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">דם</span>, blood, was the symbol of life. “For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement, by reason of the life (that is in it)”, (Leviticus 17:11). The people were therefore forbidden to eat the blood of an animal since it belonged to God. The offering to God of a sacrifice had to be an animal which was owned by the person offering it and the animal had to be domesticated and proper for food. In other words, it had to have some worth. Work animals were excluded from this. An animal had to be at least eight days old and totally without blemishes, (Leviticus 22:17-25).<br>A very large portion of the Bible, especially the Pentateuch, is concerned with the extensive ritual, ceremony, and material that went into a sacrifice. Also different types of sacrifices were outlined for different purposes. The following are separate types of sacrifices present in the Bible: Propitiatory, both Sin and Guilt Offerings, Dedicatory, Burnt, Meal, Libation, Fellowship, Peace and Thanksgiving, Wave, Votive, Freewill, and Ordination Offerings.<br>During the period of the First and Second Temple, elaborate sacrificial services took place twice daily, <span class=""underline"">Shaḥrit</span>, Morning and <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span>, Afternoon, along with special sacrifices for Sabbaths, festivals, and special circumstances.<br>Yom Kippur, being the holiest day of the year had associated with it a special and unique sacrificial atonement ritual. The <span class=""underline"">Avodah</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">עבודה</span>, which means literally “service” was the name applied to the ritual, during the Temple period, which was the central part of the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">מוסף</span>, additional, sacrifice on the Day of Atonement. With the <span class=""underline"">Avodah</span>, which is a poetical recounting of the Temple ritual, became the central part of the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> liturgy (see footnote 166) for the Day of Atonement. The ritual itself was based on the sixteenth chapter of Leviticus where the special sacrifical ritual for atonement is described. After the detailing of the ritual is completed, the Bible established that the tenth day of the seventh month (the tenth of Tishrei which today is considered the first month) would be set aside as a special Sabbath for the purpose of atonement, (Leviticus 16:29-31). The extensive details associated with the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement are described in the Talmud in tractate <span class=""underline"">Yoma</span>.<br>It was on Yom Kippur, and only on Yom Kippur, that the high priest would enter the very center of the Temple, the Holy of Holies. He had to make special preparations for this ritual. One week prior to the Day of Atonement, the high priest would begin living in a special apartment in the Temple court where he studied with the scholarly elders all the special laws of Yom Kippur. Another priest would also stand-by and study in case something happened to the high priest. The day prior to Yom Kippur the high priest would enter the Temple and perform all the minute details involved in a sacrifice along with the other priests who were used to sacrificing. The high priest rarely performed the regular daily sacrifices, he only functioned on special occasions. On the Day of Atonement, the high priest himself would perform all the sacred and sacrificial duties.<br>After proper cleansing for the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span>, or <span class=""underline"">Avodah</span> Service the high priest would first sacrifice a bull as his own personal sin offering after which he would confess and purify the sins of his own family, those of the priests (the tribe of Aaron), and finally those of the whole congregation of Israel, (Leviticus 16:6). The high priest, in the Holy of Holies, would carefully sprinkle and dispose of the animal’s blood as was prescribed. It was at this time, and only at this time, that he would utter the holy name of God, the Tetragrammaton, <span dir=""rtl"">יהוה</span>, and when he uttered this the people outside would prostrate themselves and respond, “Blessed be His Name whose glorious kingdom is forever ever and ever.” This was repeated ten times according to the Babylonian Talmud, (Yoma 2:2) and thirteen times according to the Jerusalem Talmud (Yoma 3:7).<br>The high priest then drew lots, one marked for “Azazel” and the other marked as a “sin offering for the Lord”. Depending upon the drawing of the lots, two he-goats had different parts to play in the remaining ritual. The goat marked “for Azazel” would be lead out of the Temple into the wilderness called Azazel. This he-goat symbolically carried the sins of Israel away and was lost over a cliff in the wilderness along with Israel’s sins. A red ribbon which had been tied to the goat was brought back to the people to display to them that the goat had been lost in Azazel. The he-goat marked as a “sin offering for the Lord” was offered as such. This was followed by a special incense-offering and a prayer for good weather, prosperity, and the sovereignty of Judah, whereupon the high priest would come out from the Holy of Holies marking the end to the <span class=""underline"">Avodah</span> ritual.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Avodah</span> liturgy expanded in its development from simply a description of the Temple service and the reading of Mishna <span class=""underline"">Yoma</span>, chapters 1-7 to an elaborate service rich with special liturgical poems, <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> (see footnote 149), most of them acrostics, their beginning word following the alphabet. Different Jewish communities developed separate rites. Most rites contain a brief synopsis of the history of Israel and the purity of its early generations culminating in a description of the Temple ritual on the Day of Atonement and the Holy of Holies. Some communities and rites even still call for a prostration on the floor of the synagogue during the <span class=""underline"">Avodah</span> Service as was done at the Temple upon the prononciation of the Tetragrammaton.<br><span class=""underline"">Piyyutim</span> also close the <span class=""underline"">Avodah</span> Service expressing the misfortune of Israel who, because of her sins, is deprived of the Temple and its sacrificial cult and must suffer persecution and exile. The <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> call for the reestablishment of the Temple, which is followed by the <span class=""underline"">seliḥot</span> (see footnote 14) prayers (penitential prayers of forgiveness) of the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> Service.<br>Anson Rainey, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 14, pp. 599-602; Hanoch Avenary, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 3, pp. 976-80.</i>.</sup>; and they (it is customary) throw their intestines on the roofs or in a courtyard, a place from where fowls are able to take (the intestines of the slaughtered chickens), (<span dir=""ltr"">טדר</span>).<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Tur</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">טור</span>, is the singular for the word <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> or the <span class=""underline"">Arba’ah</span> <span class=""underline"">Turim</span>, the four columns, the major halakhic work of Jacob ben Asher who lived from around 1270 until 1340. He was the son of a famous halakhic authority, Asher b. Jehiel, known as the “<span class=""underline"">Rosh</span>”. Jacob ben Asher studied under his father and moved with him from Germany to Toledo in 1303. His work on the <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> was the result of the fact that in his time there was no one halakhic work free from controversy. Different opinions were present and there were no clear and authoritative halakhic decisions. Jacob ben Asher wanted to compose a work which would include all the laws and customs which applied in his day. He divided his work into four sections or <span class=""underline"">turim</span>, “rows”. Part one was called <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span>. It contains 697 chapters on the laws of blessings, prayers, Sabbaths, festivals, and fasts. The second part was called <span class=""underline"">Yoreh</span> <span class=""underline"">De’ah</span>. It contains 403 chapters on the laws of ritual, <span class=""underline"">Issur</span> <span class=""underline"">ve-Hetter</span> (that which was forbidden and that which was permitted), and laws of mourning, idolatry, and usury. Part three, <span class=""underline"">Even</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Ezer</span>, has 178 chapters on the laws affecting women; marriage, divorce, wedding contracts (<span class=""underline"">Ketubbah</span>), and childless widowhood (<span class=""underline"">ḥaliẓah</span>). The fourth part, <span class=""underline"">Ḥoshen</span> <span class=""underline"">Mishpat</span>, contains 427 chapters on civil law and personal relations.<br>Jacob ben Asher used the Talmud and its commentaries as well as the opinions of other authorities before him.

Even if he angered him only in words, he is required to appease him (his fellow-man). And if at first he is not pacified, he (must) return and go to him a second and third time. Each time he should take three men with him, and if on the third time he does not become reconciled he (no longer) is obligated to him, (nevertheless afterwards he should say before ten (people) that he did request forgiveness from him), (<span dir=""ltr"">מרדכי דיומא ומהרי״ל</span>).<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span> in <span class=""underline"">Yoma</span> and <span class=""underline"">Maharil</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">מרדכי דיומא ומהרי״ל</span>.<br>Mordecai ben Hillel ha-Kohen, the author of <span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">מרדכי</span>, lived from approximately 1240 until 1298. Not much is known personally about this German author and rabbinic authority. He was a descendant of Eliezer b. Joel ha-Levi, a relative of Asher b. Jehiel, a brother-in-law to Meir ha-Kohen who wrote <span class=""underline"">Hagahot</span> <span class=""underline"">Maimuniyyot</span> (see footnote 27) and he was a pupil of Meir b. Baurch of Rothenburg, Isaac b. Moses of Vienna (author of <span class=""underline"">Or</span> <span class=""underline"">Zaru’a</span>, see footnote 118), and Perez b. Elijah of Corbeil. He died as a martyr along with his wife and five children in the Rindfleisch massacres. He is mostly known for his great work, <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span>, which is referred to as the “<span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span>”. It is a huge collection which expanded upon talmudic problems in the style of the <span class=""underline"">tosafot</span> but which followed the arrangement of the laws established by Isaac Alfasi. Even though Mordecai does not include all of Alfasi’s laws, he included over three hundred books and authors and employed much material from the <span class=""underline"">Or</span> <span class=""underline"">Zaru’a</span> and responsa of Meir of Rothenburg. The <span class=""underline"">Mordekahi</span> was probably completed before 1286 when Meir was imprisoned because his writings are included in the book. The book was compiled by students of Mordecai who refer to him as “my master, Rabbi Mordecai”.<br>The book was widely distributed in two versions. The first version, the “Rhenish” contained customs of French, English, and eastern German communities. The “Austrian” version reflected the customs of south-eastern Europe, including Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, Saxony, and Moravia. Commentaries grew up around the <span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span> including the <span class=""underline"">Hagahot</span> <span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span> by Samuel Schlettstadt in 1376 (see footnote 198).<br>The <span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span> became widely accepted even in the Sephardi Jewish communities. In fact, <span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span> was one of the few Ashkenazi works that Joseph Caro cited in the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span> <span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> and the Shulḥan Arukh. The Mordekhai was the final halakhic ruling for most Jews until Moses Isserles came along.<br>The section of <span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span> that is cited in this section of the Shulḥan Arukh is part of the commentary found in the <span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span> on the Talmud tractate <span class=""underline"">Yoma</span>.<br>Israel Moses Ta-Shma, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 12, pp. 311-14.<br><span class=""underline"">Yoma</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">יומא</span>, is the fifth tractate in the order of <span class=""underline"">Mo’ed</span> found in our Mishna and Tosefta.

Early rabbinic authorities decreed, coupled with “<span dir=""ltr"">חרם</span><sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Ḥerem</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">חרם</span>, is the status of that which is separated from common use or contact, either because it is proscribed as an abomination to God or because it is consecrated to Him.<br>There are different categories of <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span>. The Torah considers the following to be <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span>: Israelites who worship other gods and idols. People who commit this idolatry were to be put to the sword and the objects burned. These people and objects contaminated those they came in contact with; The seven nations inhabiting the land promised to Israel - the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (Deuteronomy 7:1-2; cf. 20:17). These people were to be totally destroyed; Whatever one privately devoted to the Lord as <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> is the most sacred, <span class=""underline"">Kodesh</span> <span class=""underline"">Kodashim</span>, and these objects were never to be sold nor was their status revokable (Leviticus 27:28). Cases of <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> in the rest of the Bible follow from these Torah laws. The term later came to mean total destruction.<br>The term <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> began to take on different meanings from the Biblical ones as time passed. Even the term <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> in the Bible changed its meaning. In Deuteronomy declaring an enemy as <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> was done to gain God’s favor by totally devoting to Him, one’s own nation and the total nation of the enemy.<br>After Saul the rise of the enemy <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> seems to have disappeared. <span class=""underline"">Ḥerem</span> came to mean, when referred to a nation that the other nation’s religion practiced evil ways that would badly influence the Israelites and therefore these people were to be separated from Israel to preserve their true belief in God (Exodus 34:11ff; Numbers 33:51ff; Deuteronomy 7:1-5; 20:16ff).<br>In later Jewish law the concept of <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> changed radically. The <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> of Ezra is the first indication that meant banishment and persecution. The term <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> was used in tannaitic literature to mean the punishment of an offender by his isolation from and his being held in contempt by the community at large. The term <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> was used in the Bible (Numbers 12:14) as an isolation punishment. The Pharisees employed <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> if a person did not follow their prescribed standards. A scholar was isolated for his non-compliance with the majority and no one was permitted to contact him lest they too became defiled. <span class=""underline"">Niddui</span> was a Punishment employed by the courts on the heads of the academies.<br>Later in the talmudic laws the term <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> was used again as an aggravated form of <span class=""underline"">niddui</span>. A <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> could last for two 30 day periods. After 60 days passed and the person did not satisfy the courts or the academies by changing his ways, a <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> was declared which was a total banishment and isolation. Another type of punishment was also established. That was a <span class=""underline"">nezifah</span>, a “reprimand”, which lasted for seven days. It was intended for shame and remorse and automatically expired while a <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> and a <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> had to be lifted by the courts.<br>A <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> differed from a <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> in that one who was declared <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> could have social intercourse for purposes of study or business, but one placed in <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> had to study alone and earn money from the small shop he was permitted to maintain. One punished by <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> or <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> was considered in a state of mourning and was therefore not permitted to cut his hair, do laundry, or wear shoes, except for out-of-town walks. He was forbidden to wash himself except for his face, hands, and feet but he did not have to rend his clothes. He had to live in confinement with his family only, no outsider was permitted to come near him, eat or drink with him, greet him, or give him any enjoyment (Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Yoreh</span> <span class=""underline"">De’ah</span> 334:2). He could not be counted as part of the three for grace after the meals nor as one of the ten for a prayer <span class=""underline"">minyan</span>. After his death, his coffin would be stoned, (one stone could be symbolically placed on the coffin). The <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> was actually considered a rather light penalty for minor offenses since it could be so easily lifted. <span class=""underline"">Niddui</span> was during talmudic times put on people by laymen and individual scholars for various reasons, not only by the courts, for reasons such as debt. Only a court designated <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> would necessitate the whole community from disassociating with the isolated person. A non-judicial <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> did not require this. A person had to be warned about a possible <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> for a non-religious offense, but for a religious one no warning was necessary. The <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> had to be publically announced but no evidence was required. The court was considered fair. A <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> by a court could be lifted by any court. A personal <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> had to be lifted by the person who imposed it and, if he was unavailable, by the <span class=""underline"">nasi</span> or leader of the community. The courts tended not to pronounce a <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> against a judge or a scholar. Flogging (see footnote 31) was considered a more appropriate punishment.<br>In post-talmudic times the threat of a <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> or a <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> was considered a way of future law enforcement. As time went on the conditions put on one who was excommunicated in the Talmud became the minimum. They became more and more severe. One who was banned could not have his sons circumcised or their children married, their children and wives were expelled from the synagogue, and they were not to be buried with any honor. He was considered as a non-Jew; his <span class=""underline"">ẓiẓit</span> fringes, were cut off, his <span class=""underline"">mezuzah</span> removed from his door, his food proclaimed unfit for Jews, and his books considered trash. The <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> became actually, a civil death. The man was dead to the community.<br><span class=""underline"">Ḥerem</span> became more and more frequent as the punishment of excommunication by the Church increased. Jewish courts were influenced by civil courts of the land to impose <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> on Jews for monetary reasons, but the Jewish courts remained independent in religious matters. Rabbis became more and more reluctant to impose a <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> on an individual especially without the consent of the entire congregation due to the extreme hardship it imposed on the family of the isolated man. This caused the development of partial <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> which was less severe and only isolated the person in synagogue worship but not in daily life, for example. <span class=""underline"">Niddui</span> was then imposed for major offenses such as a man refusing to divorce his wife when it was felt that he should, a bridegroom refusing to marry his bride, or offenses such as theft or fraud.<br>Minor forms of <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span>, <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> or <span class=""underline"">nezifah</span> were pronounced by the head of the rabbinical court, but a severe <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> was pronounced in the synagogue either before the open ark or while holding the Torah scroll. The proclaimation was made with the sounding of the <span class=""underline"">shofar</span>, the ram’s horn (see footnote 221). The people held candles and put them out symbolically when the excommunication was declared. Several Biblical verses were recited against the one excommunicated and people were warned against associating with the person put in <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span>. The ceremony concluded with a prayer for the faithful of the congregation.<br>In later times the <span class=""underline"">niddui</span> and <span class=""underline"">ḥerem</span> became so frequent and common that it lost almost all of its significance and force. It became the standard rabbinic reaction to all forms of deviation from the norm of Orthodoxy. Although still pronounced they are no longer binding on the person involved or the community, nor do they carry the terror they once did.<br>Haim Hermann Cohn, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 8, pp. 344-55.</i>.</sup>”, ban, that the living should not slander the dead."

One may immerse (inaritual bath<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Mikveh</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">מקוה</span>, is a pool or a bath of clear water. When a person immerses in it, it renders ritual cleanliness to one who has become ritually unclean through contact with the dead (Numbers 19) or any other defiling object, or through an unclean flux from the body (Leviticus 15), especially for a menstruant. The <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span> is also used to purify vessels (Numbers 31:22-23). Today the <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span> is used for the menstruant since the laws of ritual purity no longer apply due to the destruction of the Temple. A woman must immerse in the <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span> and purify herself following her menstruation in order to again participate in marital relations. It is also obligatory for proselytes to immerse as part of the ceremony for conversion. Many people still use the <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span> for spiritual purification and thus immerse in it on the eve of the Sabbath, festivals, and especially on the eve of the Day of Atonement. The mikveh serves to purify the spirit, not the body, as described by Maimonides. One has to have a mental intention to purify oneself by immersing in the <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span>.<br>According to Biblical law any collection of water whether drawn or collected naturally is suitable for a <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span> as long as one person can immerse himself, but the rabbis later stated that only water which has not been drawn, that is not collected in a vessel or recepticle, could be used. The rabbis also established a minimum for the amount of water to be used, that is the amount of water needed to fill a square cubit to the height of three cubits. This is between 250-1,000 liters depending on various calculations. If it contains at least this much undrawn water, any amount of drawn water can be added to it. A whole talmudic tractate <span class=""underline"">Mikva’ot</span>. is devoted to <span class=""underline"">mikvehs</span> and how they are to be constructed.<br>A <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span> cannot be prefabricated and just installed on a site since this makes it a vessel and constitutes water that has been drawn or collected. It may be built anywhere and out of any material that is water-tight. No water may leak from it, and it must contain the minimun of forty <span class=""underline"">se’ah</span> (250-1,000 liters) of valid, undrawn, water. Originally its height had to be one-hundred and twenty centimeters so one could stand and be totally immersed (even if bending was required). Later it was established that any height was valid if a person could be immersed laying down provided the minimum quantity of water was there.<br>All natural spring water provided it was not discolored by any admixtures is valid. Rain water or melted snow or ice is ideal for the <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span> provided that it flows unstopped into the <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span>. Pipes may be used to carry this water provided they touch the ground and are thus not considered vessels. A <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span> must be emptied by any means, even a pump, from above. No drain in the bottom is permitted as it makes the <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span> a vessel and subject to leakage. As long as the <span class=""underline"">mikveh</span> has contained at least forty <span class=""underline"">se’ah</span> of valid water, all water added to it, even drawn water is valid.<br>David Kotlar and Editorial Staff, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 11, pp. 1534-44.<br>A prayer is normally recited after the immersion called al <span class=""underline"">ha-tevilah</span>, “Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who hast sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us concerning the immersion”.</i>.</sup>) and accept lashes<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">Lashes and <span class=""underline"">Malkkut</span> <span class=""underline"">Ar’ba’im</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">מלקות ארבעים</span>, forty lashes is also known as flogging which is a Biblical form of punishment. When no other form of punishment was specifically prescribed, flogging became the standard form of punishment (Deuteronomy 25:2). Flogging was the only punishment in the Bible used as a general rule and not in relation to any particular offence except for the slandering of a virgin where the lashes as well as a fine were prescribed (Deuteronomy 22:18).<br>The maximum number of stripes to be administered in any one case are forty (Deuteronomy 25:3) for any further flogging the Bible stated, would degrade your brother in your eyes (Deuteronomy 25:3). The intent of the Bible seems to be that forty is the maximum number of stripes allowed, but that each offense and its seriousness could determine the number of stripes from one to forty provided the maximum number was not exceeded.<br>Talmudical law detailed how the Biblical punishment of flogging was to be administered. All the laws are found in the Talmudic tractate <span class=""underline"">Makkot</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">מכות</span>. The rabbis altered the Biblical law of flogging reducing the number of the maximum number of stripes to ever be received from forty to thirty-nine (Mak. 22a) so as to avoid the danger that the flogger accidentally might exceed the number of forty lashes. If he were permitted to administer forty lashes, the flogger might have given an extra one before he could have been stopped thus administering forty-one lashes which exceeds the maximum number of lashes allowed by the Bible and disgracing the man in the eyes of his brothers and thus also would the flogger be made subject to flogging for his transgression. Therefore the rabbis ruled that the maximum number of stripes they would allow was thirty-nine, for even if the flogger made a mistake he could be stopped before he exceeded the maximum number of forty stripes even if he gave an extra one as he was being stopped. (This is the reason for the comment by Isserles to this law given by Caro, see footnote 55).<br>The rabbis carefully defined all the offenses for which flogging would serve as a punishment. The number thirty-nine became the maximum number of stripes for offenses for which flogging was administered. The rabbis though, were careful not to cause death by flogging which would have exceeded the Biblical law. Therefore all people to be flogged were first examined to see if they could physically withstand the punishment. The examiner would then determine the safe number of stripes to be inflicted (Mak. 3:11). Flogging would be stopped if it appeared during the stripes that the man could not take anymore (Mak. 17:5). Flogging could also be postponed a day until a person would be fit to under-go the punishment (Mak. 17:3).<br>Floggings were administered with a whip made of calfskin to the bare upper body of the offender. One-third of the lashes were given on the breast and the other two-thirds on the back. The one being flogged would stand in a bowed position and the flogger would stand on a stone above him. As the stripes were being given admonitory and consolatory verses from the Bible would be recited (Mak. 3:12-14). If death did result and the flogging had been conducted according to the law, the flogger was not liable. If though, he had not faithfully followed the law, he had to flee to a city of refuge which was the case in any accidental homocide.<br>Flogging for disciplinary reasons as well as for punishment for other than transgressing actively a prohibition of the Torah was also prescribed by the rabbis and this was usually done in a public place so as to be a deterrent to others to violate laws. Usually disciplinary stripes were given in lesser numbers (that is less than thirty-nine) and were not administered to the bare upper body nor were they given with a leather whip. As time passed, people were more often allowed to pay fines rather than be whipped and whipping all but replaced capital punishment in Israel.<br>On Yom Kippur a custom arose that after the <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Afternoon Service, forty stripes (according to Caro, but only thirty-nine in Ashkenazi communities as pointed out by Isserles) were administered while the victim repeated the confession, <span class=""underline"">viddui</span> (see footnote 39). The one who administered the flogging was to say “And He (God) pities and will atone sins”, (Psalms 78:38). The purpose of this custom was to increase one’s awareness of his need for confession to atone for his sins. This was a visual and physical admission of sins and it was believed to help one receive complete atonement.<br>Haim Hermann Cohn, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 6, pp. 1348-51; Moshe David Herr, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 5, p. 1381.</i>.</sup> (to effect atonement) whenever desired provided that it is before nightfall, but one does not bless over the immersion."

"SA HUC Brahms, “the Laws of Yom Kippur”shulḥan Arukhoraḥḥayyim.16","<span class=""underline"">CHAPTER</span><span class=""underline"">607</span> - “The order of confession (of sins)<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Viddui</span>, <span dir=""rtl"">ודוי</span>, confession of sins, is a prerequisite for expiation and atonement in the Bible for sins committed individually or collectively. In the Bible there is usually a pardoning by God following the confession. Examples of this are found in the stories of Cain, (Genesis 4:13) David, (Psalms 32,41,51, and 69), Judah with Tamar (Genesis 36:26), Achan and the spoils of Jerico (Joshua 7:19-21), Saul and the Amalekite booty (I Samuel 15:24-25). There are also examples of Biblical confessions made for the nation; Moses and the golden calf worshipping (Exodus 32:31), the high priest’s confession on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16:6, 11, 21) and the confession of Ezra (9:6, 7, 15) and Nehemiah (1:6,7;9:2,33-35).<br>Prior to the destruction of the Temple confessions had to precede special sin and guilt sacrificial offerings. The person confessing had to place his hands upon the head of the animal sacrifice to transfer his sins to the animal (Leviticus 1:4). The Bible gives no wording for these confessions but there is in the Mishna the wording for the confession of the high priest on Yom Kippur: “O God, I have committed iniquity, transgressed, and sinned before Thee, I and my house. O God forgive the iniquities and transgressions and sins which I have committed and transgressed and sinned before Thee I and my house as it is written in the Law of Thy servant Moses, ‘For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before the Lord’” (Leviticus 16:30; Yoma 3:8).<br>In rabbinic times it became an accepted custom to confess one's sins before seeking atonement and the confession of sins became an integral part of the synagogue ritual. On the Day of Atonement it became a focal point of the service. According to the Talmud (Yoma 87b) the simple statement ""Truly, we have sinned"" is sufficient for confession, but elaborate formulas of confession have evolved. The <span class=""underline"">Ashamnu</span> ""We have incurred guilt"" is the prayer on Yom Kippur that is inserted into the fourth benediction of the reader's repetition of the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> (see footnote 43). The prayer consists of two parts, each of which contains an alphabetical listing of sins probably committed by people during the year for which they are seeking atonement on Yom Kippur. The first alphabetical confession is known as the <span class=""underline"">Viddui Katan</span>, the ""Small Confession"". The second part of the <span class=""underline"">Ashamnu</span> is known as the <span class=""underline"">Viddui Gadol</span>, the ""Great Confession"". It is also known as the <span class=""underline"">Al</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥet</span> ""For the sin which I committed before Thee"" which is the statement that precedes each specified sin. These confessionals are first mentioned in geonic liturgy (see footnote 19). Additions to the enumerated sins have evolved to include all possible transgressions since a person might have unintentionally forgotten about a sin during the year which must be confessed in order to receive atonement. The sins are all confessed in the first person plural, ""we"", communally, thus a person may even confess a sin he is sure he did not commit.<br>In addition to Yom Kippur, the <span class=""underline"">Ashamnu</span> is also recited during the <span class=""underline"">Seliḥot</span> Services prior to Yom Kippur (see footnote 14). It is also recited in the <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Afternoon Service on the Eve of Yom Kippur and ten times during the Day itself.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Ashamnu</span> is also included in the daily service of the Ḥasidic rite, and on Monday and Thursday it is recited by the Sephardi, Italian, and Yemenite communities.<br>The <span class=""underline"">viddui</span>, confession of sins, can also be said by individuals silently at appropriate occasions especially when one is about to die. The <span class=""underline"">viddui</span> said on the Day of Atonement in the singular has become acceptable as a death confessional. A bridegroom also recites this <span class=""underline"">viddui</span> in the singular during the <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Service before his wedding, the wedding day being considered a day of judgment for the bride and groom.<br>Editorial Staff, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 5, pp. 878-80.</i>.</sup> during <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span><sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span>, <span class=""rtl"">מבחה</span>, is the Afternoon Service which is one of the three daily services, the Morning Service being called the <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> (see footnote 17) and the Evening Service being called the <span class=""underline"">Arvit</span> or <span class=""underline"">Ma'ariv</span> Service (see footnote 144). The <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Service possibly derives its name from the <span class=""underline"">minḥah</span> sacrificial offering performed at the Temple in Jerusalem in the afternoon. A lamb was sacrificed at the Temple at dusk. The <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Service consists of the following parts: the <span class=""underline"">Ashrei</span> (Psalm 145 preceded by Psalms 84:5 and 144:15 and closed by Psalm 115:18); the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> (see footnote 17); the <span class=""underline"">Taḥanun</span> (see footnote 10); and it is concluded with the <span class=""underline"">Aleinu</span> (see footnote 17).<br>On the Sabbath and on fast days a portion of the Torah is read before the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> and in some rites portions dealing with daily sacrifices are read before the <span class=""underline"">Ashrei</span>. On Sabbaths part of the portion from the Torah of the coming week is read.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Prayer can begin any time after the sixth and one-half hour of the day, which mean any time after 12:30 P. M. If <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> is prayed at this time of the day it is called <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> <span class=""underline"">Gedolah</span> or the ""major"" <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span>. If <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> is prayed after the nine and one-half hour, which means after 3:30 P. M., it is called <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> <span class=""underline"">Ketannah</span> or the ""minor"" <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span>. The <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Service must though be completed before the twelfth hour, that is, before sunset, (Ber. 4:1; Ber 26b-27a).<br>The Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span>, 324 states that one may pray both <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> <span class=""underline"">Gedolah</span> and <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> <span class=""underline"">Ketannah</span> provided that one is obligatory (<span class=""underline"">ḥovah</span>) and the other is a voluntary act (<span class=""underline"">reshut</span>). But this is only allowed for the extremely pious.<br>The third meal on the Sabbath, <span class=""underline"">Se'udah</span> <span class=""underline"">Shelishit</span> is usually eaten between the <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span>, Afternoon Service, and the <span class=""underline"">Ma'ariv</span>, or Evening Service. It has become the custom during the daily service to wait and begin the <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Service shortly before sunset, so that the congregation can wait a few moments and then not have to reassemble (for a third time, having also assembled in the morning for <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span>) for the Evening, <span class=""underline"">Ma'ariv</span> Service which on Sabbaths and holidays can be recited immediately following the sunset.

The main function of the <span class=""underline"">sheli'aḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">ẓibbur</span> is to lead the congregation in communal worship by chanting (or reading) aloud certain prayers or parts of them. He also recites the doxology of calling the congregation to worship (<span class=""underline"">Barekhu</span>) and he repeats the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> (see footnote 17 and 43).

It is also recited for the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span>, the Additional Service (see footnote 166) on the Sabbath and festivals, and on Yom Kippur for a fifth time during the <span class=""underline"">Ne'ilah</span>, the concluding prayer (see footnote 191). During a congregational prayer that is when there is a <span class=""underline"">minyan</span>, a quorum of at least ten adult males, the reader (see footnote 41) repeats the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> outloud and on festivals a number of additions are made. Originally the repetition was for the uneducated people who did not know the prayers. Upon hearing each blessing they could respond, ""Amen"" and thus fulfill their religious obligation of reciting the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span>. The <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> of <span class=""underline"">Arvit</span>, the Evening Service, was originally optional but it long ago became obligatory to recite it silently but it is not repeated outloud except on the Sabbath eve when an abbreviated version of it in one single benediction is recited.<br>The word Ha-Tefillah for this prayer originated in the Talmud where it was referred to as ""The Prayer"" <span class=""underline"">par</span> <span class=""underline"">excellence</span>. It is also known as the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> for it is said ""standing"" and as the <span class=""underline"">Shemoneh-Esreh</span> (18) for it originally had eighteen benedictions in the daily worship while today it contains ninteen.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> takes on various forms for different occasions. On weekdays there are ninteen benedictions, on fast days an additional benediction is added when the reader repeats the prayer, (in ancient times on some public fasts six prayers were added to the regular ones, Ta'an. 2:2-4). On Sabbaths and festivals there are only seven benedictions in the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> except for the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> Service (see footnote 166) on Rosh HaShanah where there are nine. All the various forms of the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> have six blessings in common, the first and last three, with the middle changing according to the occasion. The first three benedictions praise God and the last three basically express thanksgiving. On the weekdays the intermediate benedictions are petitions and the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> is therefore predominantly a prayer of supplication where praise, petition, and thanksgiving are included. In most of the benedictions the one praying addresses God as ""Thou"" for it is through the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> that one communicates with God. The pronoun, ""we"" is also used throughout the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> which indicates that it is to be a communal prayer. Even though at times it is said individually, the worshipper is considered a member of the congregation. On Sabbaths and on festivals the central prayer concerns the specialness of the day or one aspect of that part of the day (that is, morning, afternoon, or evening on the Sabbath), and there is no petition, only praise, the special blessing of the day, and thanksgiving.<br>On the Day of Atonement the central blessing called <span class=""underline"">Kedushat</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Yom</span>, the sanctification of the day, is concluded specially as follows: ""<span class=""underline"">Barukh</span>…<span class=""underline"">Melekh</span> <span class=""underline"">moḥel</span> <span class=""underline"">ve-sole'aḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">le-avonoteinu</span>…<span class=""underline"">mekaddesh</span> <span class=""underline"">Yisrael</span> <span class=""underline"">ve-Yom</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Kippurim</span>,"" ""Blessed…King who pardons and forgives our iniquities…who sanctifies Israel and the Day of Atonement"". On Yom Kippur also the third blessing (of the first three standard blessings of praise) is elaborated to contain the prayer ""<span class=""underline"">u-Vekhen</span> <span class=""underline"">Ten</span> <span class=""underline"">Paḥekha</span>"", ""Now therefore impose Thy awe"", which is an ancient petition for the eschatological Kingdom of God. On the Day of Atonement the silent recital of the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> is followed by the <span class=""underline"">viddui</span>, a confession of sins (see footnote 39) which is not written as a benediction. When the reader repeats the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> the <span class=""underline"">viddui</span> is inserted into the fourth, the central, benediction. Two confessions are recited, one short and one long which are both arranged in alphabetical order. The sins which every person might have committed during the year are included and enumerated upon. Since this prayer is part of community worship, the pronoun ""we"" is used, ""we have transgressed, etc."" (see also footnote 17).<br>Joseph Heinemann, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 2, pp. 838-45.</i>.</sup> (<span dir=""ltr"">טור</span>).<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Tur</span>, <span class=""rtl"">סור</span>, see footnote 23.</i>.</sup>"

He lived from around 1310 until approximately 1375. He was one of the most important Spanish talmudists. Nissim was born in Gerona but settled in Barcelona. He never held any official rabbinical office but he functioned as a rabbi and a judge, a <span class=""underline"">dayyan</span>, in his community. Many of the <span class=""underline"">takkanot</span>, the ordinances supplementing the law, which were enacted in Spain originated with Rabbenu Nissim. He was considered an authoritative <span class=""underline"">posek</span>, halakhic decision maker, and he received questions on Jewish law from Ereẓ Israel and Syria as well as from his own community. His main teacher was Perez ha-Kohen. Rabbenu Nissim served mainly as the head of the yeshivah in Barcelona.<br>Nissim wrote many halakhic works. The method and system he followed was established basically by Naḥmanides, Solomon b. Abraham Adret, Aaron ha-Levi of Barcelona, and their contemporaries although in his decisions, Nissim did not name the scholars whose sayings he quoted. He also added much of his own thought to the material he received from others. One of Nissim's main works was his commentary on the <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span> of Isaac Alfasi, a code based on the Talmud. His work is included in the margins of Alfasi's commentary in all printed versions of this work. This commentary is found with the following tractates (the section quoted by Isserles in this footnote is included): <span class=""underline"">Shabbat</span>, <span class=""underline"">Pesaḥim</span>, <span class=""underline"">Beẓah</span>, <span class=""underline"">Rosh</span> <span class=""underline"">HaShanah</span>, <span class=""underline"">Yoma</span>, <span class=""underline"">Ta'anit</span>, <span class=""underline"">Megillah</span>, <span class=""underline"">Sukkah</span>, <span class=""underline"">Ketubbot</span>, <span class=""underline"">Gittin</span>, <span class=""underline"">Kiddushin</span>, <span class=""underline"">Shevu'ot</span>, <span class=""underline"">Avodah</span> <span class=""underline"">Zarah</span>, <span class=""underline"">Ḥullin</span>, and <span class=""underline"">Niddah</span>. Nissim also wrote novellae to parts of the Talmud. The commentary that Rabbenu Nissim wrote to the Talmud tractate <span class=""underline"">Nedarim</span> is his best known work and his commentary has become the standard one instead of that by Rashi. Some of the commentaries attributed to Nissim might not be his, as the acronym, RaN, was used by many. Only a few of Nissim's responsa are still in existence along with a collection of twelve sermons and a commentary to the Pentateuch where he wanted to prove the superiority of prophecy and the Bible over philosophy. This was to give people strength and faith during difficult periods of persecution. Nissim also wrote <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span>, liturgical poems, (see footnote 149).<br>Leon A.

He is also known as Maimonides. This twelfth century intellectual is one of the most famous Jewish philosophers, halakhists, and writers of all times in addition to being a famous physician. His most famous work is called the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span> which means ""The Repetition of the Law"" or a second Torah. It is a code of Jewish law. Maimonides wanted to collect and organize Jewish law so it could be easily found and understood by people not as well versed as he was in the law. Maimonides' goal was to concentrate all of Jewish law from the Written Law until his time in a scientific and systematic way. His knowledge of and commentaries on halakhic material was phenomenally extensive. He wanted to subdivide and classify all of Jewish law according to subject matter which had not been done since the Mishna of Judah ha-Nasi. He divided his work into fourteen books (the letters, <span class=""rtl"">י״ד</span>, equal fourteen and therefore the alternate name for his work is <span class=""underline"">ha-Yad</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Hazakah</span>, ""The Strong Hand""). Each book has eighty-three further divisions called <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span>, the construct form being <span class=""underline"">hilkhot</span> (the reference made by Isserles in this footnote is to one of these divisions called <span class=""underline"">Hilkhot</span> <span class=""underline"">Shegagot</span>), these parts were further divided into one thousand chapters, <span class=""underline"">perakim</span>, made up of some fifteen thousand paragraphs, each called a <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. Maimonides gave a single halakhic rule in his work in clear, legal Hebrew without stating different opinions or the sources for his decisions except when they originated in the Torah. For this he is criticized. (For a further explanation of Maimonides and the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span> as part of the whole of codification literature, see the introduction to this thesis.)<br>Maimonides' work as a halakhist was not limited to the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span>, although that is his most famous legal work. He wrote commentaries to some tractates of the Talmud, and mention is also made to his commentaries on the Palestinian Talmud as well as the Mishna. His <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span> contains the whole of Jewish law, both practical and theoretical. Maimonides also wrote responsa where we learn of the life of the Jewish community in Egypt and its neighboring countries during his lifetime. There are 464 responsa of Maimonides in Hebrew and Arabic. Many of his decisions became the accepted <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. Another famous work of Maimonides is his <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Mitzvot</span>, the ""Book of the Commandments"". In this halakhic work Maimonides decided to arrange the traditional 613 commandments in a new way. He gave his own enumeration of the 248 positive and the 365 negative commandments. The book, originally written in Arabic and translated into Hebrew by Moses ibn Tibbon, received much criticism for the methodology employed, but it later became an accepted work. The <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Mitzvot</span> served as an introduction to the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span> which he worked on for ten years. Although the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span> is an halakhic work, and even though Maimonides' philosophic work, <span class=""underline"">The</span> <span class=""underline"">Guide</span> <span class=""underline"">of</span> <span class=""underline"">the</span> <span class=""underline"">Perplexed</span>, was written after the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span>, the Rambam still managed to include philosophic ideas in his code. Maimonides felt that philosophy and science are handmaidens to theology. Mainmonides in the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span> included a system of metaphysics (Book One), the astronomical calculations for the calendar (Book Three), and the doctrine of the Messiah and a refutation of Christianity, Islam and their founders (Book Fourteen).<br>Even though the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span> received much criticism by the contemporary scholars of Maimonides because it was such a novel way or arranging <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>, since it did not give all the sources, and because it was feared that students would use it and no longer study the original talmudical sources, the book became one of the most creative sources of <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> in all Jewish literature.<br>Jacob I.

He is also known as Asheri. His real name is Asher ben Jehiel and he lived from around 1250 until 1327. This famous talmudist studied under his father, Jehiel, one of the Ḥasidei Ashkenaz and his older brother. He lived for a short while in Troyes, France and then lived in Cologne and Coblenz. From there he moved to Worms and studied under Meir b. Baruch of Rothenburg who appointed Asher as a member of the local rabbinic court, <span class=""underline"">bet</span> <span class=""underline"">din</span>. When Meir was imprisoned, Asher became the leader of German Jewry. During the Rindfleisch massacres of 1298 Asher distinguished himself by giving respected halakhic decisions which were raised due to the disruption of family and communal life.<br>Asher left Germany in 1303 and went to Barcelona. He was a colleague of Solomon b. Abraham Adret and in 1305 became the rabbi of Toledo. Asher fought for a long time the study of philosophy which had become popular. His dislike of philosophy was the result of what he saw on his move through different countries to Toledo. He saw that people were abandoning the study of Torah for the study of philosophy. He enacted a ban against the study of philosophy and against those practices which resulted from Christian influences.<br>The responsa of the Rosh reflect both the modesty and humility of Spanish scholars. Asher had a great deal to do with meshing German <span class=""underline"">minhag</span>, custom, with Spanish <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>, law. Asher, an outstanding halakhic authority, thereby gave authority to the French and German codifiers. Rabbenu Asher was not afraid to disagree with the <span class=""underline"">rishonim</span> (early authorities, see footnote 16) or the <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> (see footnote 19) when the talmudic source disagreed with them. Asher was known to be lenient in matters not specifically forbidden in the Torah if it was for the sake of peace, but he was strict against developments that harmed communal life.<br>Asher wrote the following halakhic works: <span class=""underline"">Piskei</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Rosh</span> (known also as <span class=""underline"">Hilkhot</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Rosh</span> and <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Ashrei</span>), a work modeled after Alfasi. He summed up decisions of earlier codifiers and it covered most of the Talmud tractates; a collection of responsa, which was published in Constantinople in 1517, contains over one thousand responsa in one hundred, eight chapters. These responsa give a picture of what German and Spanish life was like during his time; commentaries on the <span class=""underline"">Mishnayot</span> to the orders of <span class=""underline"">Zera'im</span> and <span class=""underline"">Tohorot</span>; <span class=""underline"">Tosafot</span> which is basically what he taught at the yeshivah and covered virtually all the tractes of the Babylonian Talmud.

This arrangement is unique to halakhic literature. Isaac b. Abba Mari used a vast knowledge of <span class=""underline"">geonic</span> (see footnote 19) literature in his work as well as decisions of scholars from Spain, Germany, and northern France.

"SA HUC Brahms, “the Laws of Yom Kippur”shulḥan Arukhoraḥḥayyim.48","1. On Yom Kippur, its night is the same as its day in all matters; and what are its forbidden things on it: working, eating, drinking, washing, annointing, wearing sandles (leather), intercourse. But one is not guilty of the <span class=""underline"">karet</span> penalty<sup>78</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Karet</span>, <span class=""rtl"">כרת</span>, means ""extripation"" which is a punishment at the hands of heaven mentioned in the Bible. It served as a penalty for numerous sins which were committed deliberately such as idolatry, desecration of the Sabbath, eating leaven on Passover, incest, adultery, and eating some forbidden foods. For such offences, the person need not be given a previous warning as the sin is so basic and severe. The <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> defines <span class=""underline"">karet</span> as premature death (Sifra, <span class=""underline"">Emor</span> 14:14) and <span class=""underline"">baraita</span> (Mk. 28a; TJ, Bik. 2:1, 64b) state it as ""death at the age of fifty"". Some <span class=""underline"">amoriam</span> refer to it as death between the ages of fifty and sixty. The Mishna (Ker. 1:1) lists thirty-six transgressions mentioned in the Torah for which <span class=""underline"">karet</span> is punishment. The word <span class=""underline"">karet</span> has also become the standard for many severe violations of the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. <span class=""underline"">Karet</span> has to be for a deliberate act. If the transgression was done inadvertently, only a sin-offering is required. The punishment of <span class=""underline"">karet</span> is divine, therefore God knows if it was deliberate or not and there need not be any witnesses.<br>There is discussion among the <span class=""underline"">tannaim</span> whether or not the penalty of <span class=""underline"">karet</span> exempts a person from flogging (see footnote 31) which is the penalty for most toraitic law violations where the person is warned. The decision is that one should be flogged and repentence can annul a <span class=""underline"">karet</span> (Mak. 23a-b). Even though a transgressor may be punished by <span class=""underline"">karet</span>, he is still liable for any civil claims that may have arisen from his actions (Ket. 30a).<br>It was believed that natural death took place after sixty and if one died before that or one's life span was in any way curtailed this was considered ""death by the hand of heaven"" even though it had no fixed time. There was also discussion regarding the speed of death. Death in one, two, or three days before the age of sixty, or for those committing a transgression after the age of sixty was considered a sign of <span class=""underline"">karet</span>.<br>The medieval scholars who were very concerned with reward and punishment decided that a death from <span class=""underline"">karet</span> meant the absolute end, the maximal punishment, while ordinary sinners after being punished in Gehinnom, lived again in the world to come, a world not shared by those punished with <span class=""underline"">karet</span>. This was the view of Maimonides while Naḥmanides felt that those who died by <span class=""underline"">karet</span> continued to suffer in the world to come since the soul can never be annihilated and perish. <span class=""underline"">Karet</span> was degradation of the soul and the negation of spiritual pleasures awaiting the souls of the righteous.<br>Israel Moses Ta-Shma, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 10, pp. 788-89.</i>.</sup> except for working, eating, and drinking."
"SA HUC Brahms, “the Laws of Yom Kippur”shulḥan Arukhoraḥḥayyim.49","2. All (types of) work (for whose transgression) a person is guilty on the Sabbath is also guilty on Yom Kippur. And all types of work for whose transgression on the Sabbath a person is free from punishment but are still prohibited, are also prohibited on Yom Kippur in a like manner except that on the Sabbath a conscious sin is punishable by stoning,<sup>79</sup><i class=""footnote"">Stoning, <span class=""underline"">sekilah</span>, <span class=""rtl"">סקילה</span>, is a Biblical form of capital punishment which was the standard penalty for crime in all ancient civilizations. In the Torah there are two explicit methods of executing a criminal or a sinner; stoning and burning. According to the Talmud, the Torah has four methods of execution: stoning, burning, beheading, and strangling, (See B. Sanhedrin 49b., ff).<br>Stoning was an instinctive violent expression of popular wrath, (Exodus 17:4, 8:22; Numbers 14:10; I Samuel 30:6; I Kings 12:18; II Chronicles 10:18) and often in the Bible it is the prescribed mode of execution (Leviticus 20:2, 27, 24:16; Numbers 15:35; Deuteronomy 13:11, 17:5, 21:21, 22:21, et al). Originally, the whole community participated in the stoning and were required to throw stones at the guilty person. Stonings were probably the standard form of judicial execution in Biblical times, (Leviticus 24:23; Numbers 15:36; I Kings 21:13; II Chronicles 24:21).<br>The Mishna (Sanh.6:4) states that a ""stoning place"" was established where instead of a person being pelted by stones, the convicted person would be pushed down from a high place to his death provided it was not too high so as to mutilate the body which was a concern of the rabbis. It also was not to be too low so the death would be instantaneous. The reason for the stoning place was that the scriptural rule states ""The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death,"" (Deuteronomy 17:7) and then afterwards the ""hand of all the people (should be on him)"", (Deuteronomy 17:7). To insure that the witnesses put him to death they were the ones to push him and thereby be first to put him to death. Thus this method of ""stoning"" became acceptable as opposed to the actual throwing of stones. This also seemed the more ""humane"" way of carrying out capital punishment as the convicted person died more quickly and the danger of mutilation was reduced. In Maimonides' comment to Sanhedrin 6:4 he stated that it really made no difference if stones were thrown at one or if one were thrown at stones.<br>cf., Haim Hermann Cohn, v. 5, pp. 142-43.</i>.</sup> but on Yom Kippur it is punishable by <span class=""underline"">karet</span>.<sup>80</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Karet</span>, <span class=""rtl"">כרת</span>; see footnote 78.</i>.</sup> Everything that is forbidden to be moved (or handled) on the Sabbath is also forbidden to be moved (or handled) on Yom Kippur, (but it is permitted to clean vegetables and to open (shell) nuts from the <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> time<sup>81</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span>, <span class=""rtl"">מבחה</span>, a time designating afternoon, meaning after the six and one half hour or after 12:30 P.M. according to our present day time system.

He was one of the foremost Jewish scholars of his day and he was a member of a well-to-do family in Barcelona where he lived all his life. He studied principlely under Jonah b. Abraham Gerondi and also under Naḥmanides. After a short career in business he became a rabbi in Barcelona for over forty years. He quickly became a well respected authority among Spanish Jewry and beyond. Adret gave responsa to questions addressed to him from all over the Jewish world. His responsa were gathered into collections and served as sources of guidance. He had the ability to simplify and clarify difficult material, and he wrote over one thousand responsa. His responsa serve as a picture of the type of life around his time both for Jews and non-Jews because of his knowledge of Roman law and local Spanish legal practice. Adret knew philosophy and science but was fearful to let the masses study it and not the Torah. He therefore placed a ban on secular studies for Jews. He criticized the influence of mysticism in Judaism and the allegorical method of interpreting the Bible which was popular in southern France and Spain. Adret also defended Judaism against non-Jewish challengers.<br>In addition to his numerous responsa Adret headed a yeshivah to which students flocked from as far away as Germany. Adret wrote novellae to seventeen tractates of the Talmud that made up his academy lectures. Adret commented on <span class=""underline"">aggadot</span> (non-legal material) in the Talmud and he wrote a special work on the subject called <span class=""underline"">Ḥiddushei</span> <span class=""underline"">Aggadot</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Shas</span>, published in Tel Aviv in 1966. Adret also wrote two legal manuals. <span class=""underline"">Torat</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Bayit</span> deals with most ritual observances such as ritual slaughter of animals for food, forbidden foods, gentile wines, and laws of <span class=""underline"">niddah</span>.

These two sections which comprise one book are divided into seven parts which contain detailed halakhic discussions. Adret decided between opposing views and added his own opinion. As a practical guide Asher wrote a shorter version which he called <span class=""underline"">Torat</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Bayit</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Kaẓer</span>, published in 1556 in Cremona.

It was part of the daily service in the Temple every morning and evening before the thanks-offering the priests would raise their hands up and pronounce the three-fold priestly blessing from a special platform called a <span class=""underline"">dukhan</span>, <span class=""rtl"">דרכן</span>. Therefore the ceremony has also been referred to as the <span class=""underline"">dukhenen</span>. The ceremony was transferred into the daily service in the synagogue. In Ashkenazi communities it is restricted to the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span>, Additional Service (see footnote 166) of festivals but is omitted on Simḥat Torah because the <span class=""underline"">Kohanim</span> might be drunk and when the festival falls on the Sabbath. It is said during the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> (see footnote 43) of the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> Service during the fifth (of seven) benediction which calls for the restoration of the Temple Sacrifice Service where the priests served in performing the sacrifices for the people to God.<br>The Hebrew text of the blessing Numbers 6:24, consists of three short verses of three, five, and seven words respectively. It mounts in gradual stages from the petition for material blessing and protection, to that of a divine favor as a spiritual blessing, and it climaxes in a petition for God's most consummate gift of peace, which encompasses the welfare of all material and spiritual wellbeing. These fifteen words have a rhythmic beauty to them. They are introduced by a reminder of the Temple Sacrifice Service and a prayer for its reestablishment. The blessing was only spoken by Aaron but it was a blessing of God.<br>The words that the descendents of the priests chanted in front of the congregation from the ark covered by their prayer shawls with their fingers separated in the middle are as follows:<br><img src=""images/Art_P2.jpg"" alt=""art""/><br>The Lord bless thee and keep thee:<br>The Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:<br>The Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace.<br>And the congregation responds ""Amen"" to each blessing.<br>Hertz, <span class=""underline"">op</span>. <span class=""underline"">cit</span>., pp. 834-37.</i>.</sup> he washes his hands even though they are clean because the majority of (the instances of) washing which are not intended for pleasure are permitted, (<span dir=""ltr"">הגהות מיימדני פ״ב מהלי י״כ ומהרי״ל</span>).<sup>101</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Hagahot</span> <span class=""underline"">Maimuniyyot</span>, chapter two from the <span class=""underline"">Laws</span> <span class=""underline"">of</span> <span class=""underline"">Yom</span> <span class=""underline"">Kippur</span> and <span class=""underline"">Maharil</span>, <span class=""rtl"">הגהות מיימוני פ״ב מהלי י״כ ומהרי״ל</span>.<br>For <span class=""underline"">Hagahot</span> <span class=""underline"">Maimuniyyot</span>, <span class=""rtl"">הגהות מיימדבי</span>; see footnote 27.<br>For <span class=""underline"">Maharil</span>, <span class=""rtl"">מהרי״ל</span>; see footnote 8.</i>.</sup> Therefore even if one comes from the street and his feet are dirty, it is permissible to wash them, (<span dir=""ltr"">ב״י בשם הגהות מיימוני וסמ״ג וטור הלכות ט״ב</span>).<sup>102</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Beit</span> <span class=""underline"">Yosef</span> in the name of <span class=""underline"">Hagahot</span> <span class=""underline"">Maimuniyyot</span> and <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">Mitzvot</span> <span class=""underline"">Gadol</span> and <span class=""underline"">Tur</span> on the <span class=""underline"">Laws</span> <span class=""underline"">of</span> <span class=""underline"">Tishah</span> <span class=""underline"">be-Av</span>, <span class=""rtl"">ב""י בטם הגהות מיימובי דסס""ג וסור הלכות ט""ב</span>.<br>For the <span class=""underline"">Beit</span> <span class=""underline"">Yosef</span>, <span class=""rtl"">ב״י</span>; see footnote 20.<br>For <span class=""underline"">Hagahot</span> <span class=""underline"">Maimuniyyot</span>, <span class=""rtl"">הגהות מיימובי</span>; see footnote 27.<br><span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">Mitzvot</span> <span class=""underline"">Gadol</span>, <span class=""rtl"">סמ״ג</span>, is also known by its acronym SeMaG for <span class=""underline"">Se</span>fer <span class=""underline"">M</span>itzvot <span class=""underline"">G</span>adol. It was written by Moses ben Jacob of Coucy, a thirteenth century French scholar and tosafist. Moses of Coucy was the first French Jew to serve as an itinerant preacher, who wandered from town to town and from country to country trying to inspire Jews to renew their faith in God. He began his work in Spain in 1236 apparently after he received some mystical revelation. He excited people to renew their following of the commandments of <span class=""underline"">tefillin</span> (prayer phylacteries), <span class=""underline"">mezuzah</span> (<span class=""underline"">Shema</span> prayers placed on the doorpost), and <span class=""underline"">ẓiẓit</span> (garment fringes) which they had been lax in observing. He also spoke against a practice that had become common among Jews of Spain, having sexual relations with Gentile women. He stressed the value of the study of Torah and all positive commandments which had declined in Spain along with the allegorization of the Bible as a result of the philisophic writings of Maimonides which had become popular in the thirteenth century. Because of his vast sermonizing he received the name of Moses ha-Darshan, Moses the Sermonizer.<br>The SeMaG, <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">Mitzvot</span> <span class=""underline"">Gadol</span>, is Moses of Coucy's most extensive and important work, and it was first published before 1480 probably in Rome and again in Italy in 1547. The work is unique among the rabbinic writings of the period because of its style and arrangement. It contains the essence of the Oral Law, and it is arranged in order of the precepts divided into two parts, the positive and the negative precepts. Coucy based his work on the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span> of Maimonides (see footnote 59) and he quoted from it directly on almost every page. He basically added to the words of Maimonides using as his source the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds as well as many <span class=""underline"">midrashim</span>, halakhic and aggadic commentaries on the Bible. He also employed the works of French and German <span class=""underline"">rishonim</span>, early scholars (see footnote 16). Coucy changed the language of the <span class=""underline"">midrashim</span> to fit in with the style of Maimonides. The order to the SeMaG is different than that of the <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span> and even different than Maimonides' <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Mitzvot</span> (see footnote 59) which also lists the 613 commandments in positive and negative precepts because Coucy was not familiar with this work by Maimonides. At the end of his book Coucy included rabbinic precepts so as to instruct the people in the way of the Lord, which had been his original aim. To reach this aim, Coucy also separated those precepts which had practical value from those which were no longer applicable. The work of Moses of Coucy, because of his travels in Spain and his discovery of the works of Maimonides, helped bring Maimonides to the awareness of the French Jewish community. It is ironic that the allegorization of the Bible that Moses of Coucy fought so hard against was the result of the philosophy of Maimonides whom, as a halakhist, Moses of Coucy respected so much.<br>Moses of Coucy employed the following style in <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">Mitzvot</span> <span class=""underline"">Gadol</span>: he began with a scriptural verse touching on the subject, he then sighted interpretations of the verse found in the Talmuds and the halakhic <span class=""underline"">midrashim</span>. He then gave explanations based on commentators and halakhic scholars, and finally he summarized the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>. He weaved into the discussions aggadic and homiletic aspects, many of which were his own creation that displayed a love of God and his fellow man. The SeMaG became quite a popular and well known work among Jewish scholars for many generations. Isaac of Corbeil who had the title of ""Head of the Yeshivot of France"" compiled a book that was completely dependent on the SeMaG and he called it <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">Mitzvot</span> <span class=""underline"">Katan</span>, SeMaK, (see footnote 27), and he made it compulsory daily learning for every Jew. The SeMaG was the most accepted halakhic code among Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewry until its position was taken over by the Shulḥan Arukh. (For an explanation of the SeMaG and how it fits into the entire picture of codification literature, see the introduction to this thesis).<br>Israel Moses Ta-Shma, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 12, pp. 418-20.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Tur</span>, on the laws concerning the Ninth Day of the month of Av, <span class=""rtl"">טור הלכרת ט״ב</span>.<br><span class=""underline"">Tishah</span> <span class=""underline"">Be-Av</span> is a fast day which commemorates the destruction of both the first Temple (586 B. C. E.) by the Babylonians and the second Temple (70 C. E.) by the Romans in Jerusalem which traditionally occurred on this date, (M. Ta'anit 4:6). (Actually records show that the major destruction of both Temples was on the tenth of <span class=""underline"">Av</span> but the Talmud proclaimed the Ninth Day of <span class=""underline"">Av</span> as the official day of mourning). It is a national day of mourning for the Jewish people. The rules regarding washing one's feet only if they are dirty (for cleansing purposes) are the same on <span class=""underline"">Tisha</span> <span class=""underline"">Be-Av</span> as they are on Yom Kippur.<br>The Mishna, <span class=""underline"">loc</span>. <span class=""underline"">cit</span>., also points out other calamities that befell the Jewish people on the Ninth Day of <span class=""underline"">Av</span>. It was on that day that the children of Israel were told they could not enter the Promised Land following their exodus from Egypt. On the Ninth of <span class=""underline"">Av</span> Bethar, the last stronghold of the leaders of the Bar Kokhba revolt was captured in 135 C.E. and exactly one year later the Roman Emperor, Hadrian, established a heathen temple on the site of the Temple in Jerusalem and made the city a pagan city which the Jews were not permitted to enter. The Jews later were expelled from Spain in 1492 on <span class=""underline"">Tishah</span> <span class=""underline"">be-Av</span>. This day then became a symbol for the persecutions and misfortunes of the Jews throughout history.<br>Fasting on the Ninth Day of <span class=""underline"">Av</span> as a day of mourning might have even been in practice during the second Temple period, and it was certainly part of the Jewish life in mishnaic times. It is a fast like Yom Kippur, from sunset to sunset.<br>In some places it is customary to eat a boiled egg during the last meal before <span class=""underline"">Tishah</span> <span class=""underline"">be-Av</span> sprinkled with ashes to symbolize mourning. No meat or wine is to be included prior to the fast. It is a day of national fasting and mourning. The laws of fasting are very similar to those of Yom Kippur and the laws of mourning parallel those that apply to one who has just lost a close relative after the burial. Lamentations are read as part of the Evening Service. While studying is prohibited, the Book of Job, curses in Leviticus (26:14-42) Jeremiah 39, and stories in the Talmud on the destruction of Jerusalem (Git. 55b-58a) may be read.<br>Supposedly <span class=""underline"">Tishah</span> <span class=""underline"">be-Av</span> will eventually again become a day of joy as the Messiah is to be born on this day.<br>Meir Ydit, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 3, pp. 936-40.<br>For thr <span class=""underline"">Tur</span>, <span class=""rtl"">טור</span>; see footnote 23.</i>.</sup>"

He lived from around 1180 until approximately 1250. He was born in Bohemia and in his wanderings he came into contact with many German and French scholars. He studied under some of the greatest men of his age and was highly influenced by such men as Simḥah b. Samuel of Speryer, Eliezar b. Joel ha-Levi, and Judah b. Isaac Sir Leon of Paris.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Or</span> <span class=""underline"">Zaru'a</span> is a most extensive work and because of its size it was not extensively copied nor circulated. The first two parts of the work were not published until 1862 before which it remained in manuscript form. The first part of the <span class=""underline"">Or</span> <span class=""underline"">Zaru'a</span> deals with blessings, the laws connected with the land of Israel, <span class=""underline"">niddah</span> (the laws of menstruation), <span class=""underline"">mikva'ot</span> (see footnote 30), laws of marriage, and finally a collection of responsa. The second part of the <span class=""underline"">Or</span> <span class=""underline"">Zaru'a</span> basically covers the material covered in the <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span> section of the Shulḥan Arukh.

The work gives a systematic and comprehensive summary of all the laws in the Talmud. It basically follows the order of the tractates except it will group several <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span> having to do with the same subject even though they are scattered throughout the books. <span class=""underline"">Halakhot</span> <span class=""underline"">Gedolot</span> works the opposite way of the Talmud. It first states the general principle and then it gives the details. <span class=""underline"">Halakhot</span> <span class=""underline"">Gedolot</span> gave new names to laws no longer in existence because of the destruction of the Temple. It based its decisions on those found in the Talmud and on principles laid down by the sages. Most of the book is based on the Babylonian Talmud but reference is made to the ""Talmud of the West"", that is the Jerusalem Talmud. There are many responsa of Babylonian <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> and the book was widely known.<br>The book has an introduction which was a totally new feature at that time. It stated that the work was against the Karaites and others who rejected the Oral Law. It is in two parts. The first part has aggadic statements which praise the Torah and its students, and the second part enumerates the 613 commandments mentioned in the Talmud (Mak 23b) for the first time. They are listed according to the degree of punishment one receives for violating them which is their common character.<br>There is no agreement on who wrote <span class=""underline"">Halakhot</span> <span class=""underline"">Gedolot</span>. It has been attributed to Sherira Gaon, Simeon Kayyara (Spain and Provence), and Yehudai Gaon (northern France and Germany). Some scholars say that it was originally two parts which later were combined. The original <span class=""underline"">Halakhot</span> <span class=""underline"">Gedolot</span> they say was written by Simeon Kayyara and the extra was written by Yehudai Gaon in his <span class=""underline"">Halakhot</span> <span class=""underline"">Pesukot</span>. Yehudai Gaon used Aramaic and used the word for a legal decision, <span class=""underline"">pesak</span>, in his sections.<br>Other scholars say the whole work was written by Simeon Kayyara who lived at the beginning of the tenth century, one hundred and fifty years after Yehudai Gaon and that the <span class=""underline"">Halakhot</span> <span class=""underline"">Pesukot</span> was used as a source as was Aḥa of Shabḥa'a <span class=""underline"">She'eltot</span> for the <span class=""underline"">Halakhot</span> <span class=""underline"">Gedolot</span>.

He was a scholar in the fields of <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span>, theology and biblical exegesis in medieval Germany. He was the last great scholar of the movement known as Ḥasidei Ashkenaz. He was born in Mainz but traveled and studied all over Germany and northern France until he settled and spent most of his life in Worms. Eleazar studied <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> with R. Moses ha-Kohen, R. Eliezar of Metz, and his father Judah b. Kalonymus. He studied esoteric theology with his father and with Judah b. Samuel, he-Ḥasid. Eleazar witnessed much persecution of Jews at the hands of the Crusades at the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century. His wife, daughter and son were killed in one of these persecutions and he was badly injured. He wrote a book, <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Ḥokhmah</span>, the ""Book of Wisdom"" in 1217 where he felt compelled to put his knowledge into writing since he felt that oral tradition was dieing out in Germany as the situation of Jews there got worse and worse.<br>Eleazar wrote five types of works: halakhic, <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> (liturgical poems), theology, ethics, and exegesis. <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Roke'aḥ</span>, published in Fano in 1505, is his halakhic work that follows the pattern of the tosofists of Germany and northern France. The book was to educate the common reader in the details of Jewish law. He explained the law and its talmudic basis. Unlike the tosofists, Eleazar included recommended <span class=""underline"">minhagim</span>, customs, in his work. They were not strictly halakhic but were practices followed. He relied a good deal on German scholars who preceded him, and he quoted more than forty of them.<br>He wrote many <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span>. They expressed devotion to God but also protested to God about Israel's suffering. His theological work is called <span class=""underline"">Sodei</span> <span class=""underline"">Razayya</span>, ""Secrets of Secrets"". It is about creation based on the alphabet, angels, revelation, and prophesy. Eleazar wrote on psychology, <span class=""underline"">Ḥokhmat</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Nefesh</span> analyzing the connection of the soul and the divine world, dreams, and life after death. Eleazar's work on ethics is found in the first two chapters of the <span class=""underline"">Roke'aḥ</span>. He discussed the central values of Ḥasidism, love and fear of God, prayer, humility, and he detailed the way of repentance. Eleazar wrote many exegetical works. He commented on the Torah, on the Passover <span class=""underline"">Haggadah</span> as well as prayers from the liturgy. He explained the content, interpreted the theology and tried to find the hidden harmony in the <span class=""underline"">gematriot</span>, the numerical equivalents of the letters.

He was of Turkish origin and was born in Constantinople. He studied under Elijah ha-Levi in rabbinic studies and Mordecai Comitiano in general studies. Mizraḥi taught publically until 1475 when he became the most famous religious authority in the entire Ottoman Empire and questions on <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> were addressed to him from all over. He was well respected as an halakhic decision maker, <span class=""underline"">posek</span>, in Turkey by his contemporaries and those who came after him.<br>In addition to teaching and heading the yeshivah he also wrote commentaries to religious as well as scientific works. He collected money to help absorb the exiles of Spain and Portugal. He respected the knowledge of the exiles, but he refused to allow them to bring in their customs foreign to Turkey. He helped teach the Karaites secular subjects as well as Oral Law, but he refused to allow Karaites to marry Rabbanites.<br>Mizraḥi had a very clear halakhic style. He presented the fundamental principles and then he raised possible objections to them and then he examined and clarified each one. His responsa were thus considered authoritative even by those who opposed his views.<br>He is known to have had a very sad, poor life, with much family misfortune, but that did not hamper his work. His most famous halakhic accomplishment was his super-commentary to Rashi published in Venice in 1527. He discussed every word of Rashi and often disagreed with him, yet he defended Rashi against Naḥmanides.

He usually tended toward leniency but here Isserles had decided that a twelve year and one day old girl and a thirteen year and one day old boy must fast regardless of whether or not they have started to grow pubic hairs. Puberty along with age in Judaism indicated adulthood and the religious responsibilities that it brought. Isserles changed this ruling and made it more strict deciding that age alone would mark adulthood and its religious obligations even for one who reaches puberty later than most normally do. The reason Isserles gave is that the person might actually have grown some pubic hairs but, because of their fragility, they might have fallen off before they could be noticed.

The animals must be killed in a specially prescribed way and be prepared so that all the blood is removed.

On the Sabbath as on Yom Kippur it is forbidden to slaughter an animal for food under normal circumstances, nor is it permitted to cook food.

A sick person who ate on Yom Kippur and recovers to such a degree so that he is able to bless (the food he ate, to say the Grace after the meal<sup>137</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Grace after meals, <span class=""underline"">Birkhat</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Mazon</span>, <span class=""rtl"">ברכת המד רן</span>, is a central part of the home liturgical service. Its obligation is considered biblical from the verse: ""Thou shalt eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord thy God for the good land which He has given thee"", (Deuteronomy 8:10). It has four parts to it and it should be said only after bread has been eaten. When bread has not been eaten, a shorter version of the Grace is recited.<br>The first blessing, <span class=""underline"">Birkhat</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Zan</span> praises God for providing food for all His creatures. The second blessing, <span class=""underline"">Birkhat</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Areẓ</span>, expresses Israel's special thanks for the good land God has given it. It speaks of the redemption from Egypt, the covenant of circumcision and the revelation of the Torah. The third benediction, <span class=""underline"">Boneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Yerushalayim</span> and also <span class=""underline"">Neḥamah</span>, consolation, asks God to have mercy on Israel and to restore the Temple and the Kingdom of David. These blessings also include a plea for God to always sustain and support Israel. This was the core of the Grace after Meals, but after the destruction of Bethar during the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 C.E. a fourth blessing was added, <span class=""underline"">Ha-tov</span> <span class=""underline"">ve-ha-metiv</span>. It thanks God for His goodness praying that He may fulfill specific desires. This is followed by special petitions which begin with the word <span class=""underline"">Ha-Raḥaman</span>, ""May the All-Merciful…"" This part of the prayer was once for personal desires but it then became standardized. The number of petitions vary. The Sephardi rite has fifteen while the Ashkenazi only has nine.<br>The Talmud (Ber. 48b) ascribes the origin of each of the benedictions to different Jewish heros and events. The first was originated by Moses when he saw manna fall, the second by Joshua when he conquered Ereẓ Israel, the third by David and Solomon and the fourth by the rabbis at Jabneh although it might actually date back to as early as the reign of Hadrian.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Birkhat</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Mazon</span>, on Sabbaths and festivals is usually preceded by Psalm 126, which reminds us of Zion and its restoration among our earthly delights. Whenever three or more men have eaten together one of the men begins the Grace by summoning the others, (Ber. 7:1-5), ""Gentlemen, let us say Grace"", (in the Sephardi rite it is ""with your permission""), and the others reply ""Blessed be the name of the Lord henceforth and forever."" The leader repeats that statement and says, ""With your consent (the Sephardim say, ""With the permission of heaven""), let us now bless Him of whose food we have eaten."" The others respond, Blessed be He whose food we have eaten and through whose goodness we live."" This whole introduction is called <span class=""underline"">zimmun</span> (Ber. 45b). The Talmud states that this must be said also by three women who eat together. The <span class=""underline"">zimmun</span> becomes somewhat longer when the number of people together goes to ten, a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand. Now we insert the word <span class=""underline"">Elohenu</span>, ""Our God"" in the third line when ten or more eat together. Grace used to be followed by a cup of wine and there was a discussion if this was only when the grace was said with <span class=""underline"">zimmun</span> or also individually, (Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span>, 182:1). The custom now is to have the wine only on Sabbaths, festivals, and special occasions.<br>On Sabbaths and festivals special sections are added to the third blessing, <span class=""underline"">Boneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Yerushalayim</span>, these are <span class=""underline"">Reẓeḥ</span> and/or <span class=""underline"">Ya'aleh</span> <span class=""underline"">ve-Yavo</span> and an additional petition is added in series of <span class=""underline"">Ha-Raḥaman</span>. Special <span class=""underline"">Ha-Raḥaman</span> petitions are inserted for New Moons, Rosh HaShanah, Sukkot, Passover, and Shavuot. On Ḥanukkah and Purim the special <span class=""underline"">Al</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Nissim</span>, ""about the Miracles"", section is said during the second blessing which is devoted to the thanksgiving.<br>The Grace at a wedding feast is slightly different. The third line of the <span class=""underline"">zimmun</span> is supplemented by ""Blessed he our God in whose abode is joy, of whose food we have eaten, and through whose goodness we live"" and then the seven wedding benedictions are recited at the end of the Grace. The Grace at the house of a mourner is also changed. The end of the third benediction has a special prayer substituted, the text of the fourth blessing is changed as is the <span class=""underline"">zimmun</span>. At a circumcision ceremony, the wording of the <span class=""underline"">zimmun</span> changes to fit the occasion. The <span class=""underline"">Ha-Raḥaman</span> petitions also allow for passages to be inserted by children, guests or masters of the house.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Birhat</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Mazon</span> is the only prayer commanded by the Torah but the words were developed by man. Therefore under certain circumstances and for children different, shorter versions have been developed which at least mention the land and Jerusalem. When bread is not eaten another form of Grace is said. It is called <span class=""underline"">Berakhah</span> <span class=""underline"">Aḥronah</span>, a ""final benediction"" and what is said depends on what is eaten. When one eats of food from the five species of grain; wheat barley, rye, oats, and spelt, wine, or fruits of Ereẓ Israel, a short Grace is said, which consists of one benediction with an insertion for the type of food eaten and for the special nature of the day if it is the Sabbath or a festival. It is called <span class=""underline"">Berakhah</span> <span class=""underline"">Me'ein</span> <span class=""underline"">Shalosh</span>, ""a benediction summarizing the three"" regular benedictions. For any other food a short benediction called <span class=""underline"">Ve-Lo-Khelum</span>, ""nothing"" is said.

On the Night of Yom Kippur the custom is that the reader says, “In the court of high, in the court of low (earthly); with the consent of God and with the consent of the congregation, we are permitted to pray together with the transgressors<sup>140</sup><i class=""footnote"">This is the prayer that the reader recites as the services begin on the night of Yom Kippur after the sun goes down marking the beginning of the Day of Atonement. The prayer is said immediately after placing on the <span class=""underline"">talit</span>, the prayer shawl, which is only worn during the day, but exceptionally, also on the night of Yom Kippur.<br>The word ""transgressors"" at the end of the prayer referred originally to the Marranos, those Jews who chose to convert to Christianity rather than suffer as Jews.</i>.</sup>”, and it is customary that he say “<span class=""underline"">Kol</span><span class=""underline"">Nidrei</span>”, (“All the Vows”)<sup>141</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Evening Service (see footnote 144) on the night of Yom Kippur has taken on the name of <span class=""underline"">Kol</span> <span class=""underline"">Nidrei</span>, <span class=""rtl"">כל נדרי</span>, ""All Vows"" after the unique Aramaic prayer of the same name that marks the beginning of the Service. The prayer is a supplication for annulment of vows. The congregants pray that all the personal vows, oaths, and obligations that will be made during the coming year should be null and void. This applies to vows made between man and God. The recitation of the <span class=""underline"">Kol</span> <span class=""underline"">Nidrei</span> begins while there is still daylight and is prolonged until the sun sets. It has become the custom to repeat the chant three times so that late comers can be sure and hear it. The prayer relieved anxieties of a person who worried that he might have violated the sanctity of some pledge. The rabbis were concerned with the ease of annulling a vow and put certain restrictions on the procedure.<br>The origin of the <span class=""underline"">Kol</span> <span class=""underline"">Nidrei</span> is not know for sure. It is mentioned in the responsa of Babylonian <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> (see footnote 19) in the eigth century. It was condemned by the <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> of Sura. Some theorize that it originated in Palestine as a Rabhanite practice against the Karaites. Some feel that prayer has mystical origins like other Aramaic prayers which annul curses and oaths which had touched off evil forces in the community. By 1000 C.E. the prayer had been generally accepted by the Pumbedita <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> as a way to invoke pardon, forgiveness and atonement for failing to keep a vow from the previous Day of Atonement to this one. Rabbenu Tam's version changed the wording to read from this Day of Atonement to the next, the wording accepted by most Ashkenazim while most Sephardim except for the oriental and Yemenites, refer to past vows not future ones.<br>Anti-Semites have often used this prayer as evidence that the vow of a Jew was worthless, even though the prayer does not refer to man's vows with his fellow man, only with God.<br>Bathja Bayer, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 10, pp. 1166-68.</i>.</sup> (and the entire prayer that follows) and afterward he says (the prayer) “<span dir=""ltr"">שהחינו</span><sup>142</sup><i class=""footnote"">The prayer <span class=""underline"">Sheheḥayanu</span> is a prayer recited at the beginning of festivals, minor holidays, and at special times which mark a new, significant event and also when acquiring and putting on new clothing.

Originally the <span class=""underline"">Arvit</span> Service was an optional one since there was not an evening Temple sacrifice that corresponded to it as was the case with the <span class=""underline"">Shaḥarit</span> (see footnote 17), <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> (see footnote 40) and <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> (see footnote 166) Service. Traditionally this Service was attributed to Jacob who prayed and Evening Service (Genesis 28:11).<br>The <span class=""underline"">Arvit</span> Service basically consists of a <span class=""underline"">Barekhu</span> which is a call to worship followed by the <span class=""underline"">Shema</span> and its benedictions and the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> (see footnote 43). After nightfall Psalm 134 begins the Service. On weekdays the Service begins with Psalms 78:38 and 20:10.<br>The blessings around the <span class=""underline"">Shema</span> are a bit different for the <span class=""underline"">Arvit</span> Service. The theme of the first blessing before the <span class=""underline"">Shema</span> is the change from evening to night and the second blessing is one of thanksgiving for the love shown by God for Israel in revealing his Torah. The blessing which follows the <span class=""underline"">Shema</span> in the <span class=""underline"">Arvit</span> Service is a <span class=""underline"">Ge'ullah</span> prayer which praises God as the Redeemer who redeemed Israel from Egyptian slavery. This is all followed by a special night prayer called the <span class=""underline"">Hashkivenu</span>, ""Grant us to lie down in peace"", which asks for God's help and protection from various mishaps and dangers that can happen in the mysterious night.<br>There were two versions of the final prayer, a Babylonian and a Palestinian. The Babylonian version is now used on weekdays and it speaks of God ""who guards His people Israel forever."" The Palestinian version is used on Sabbaths and festivals which is a prayer for peace and Zion; God ""who spreads out the tabernacle of peace"".<br>In the Ashkenazi rite several scriptural verses beginning with Psalm 89:53, ""blessed by the Lord for evermore"", are inserted between the <span class=""underline"">Hashkivenu</span> and the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span>. The Sephardi rite does not have this.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> (see footnote 43) during the <span class=""underline"">Arvit</span> Service is only prayed silently. It is not repeated by the reader as it is in the other Services. The <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> is preceded by a half reader's <span class=""underline"">Kaddish</span> (see footnote 177) and it is followed by the full reader's <span class=""underline"">Kaddish</span>. The prayer, <span class=""underline"">Aleinu</span> <span class=""underline"">le-Shabbe'aḥ</span> (see footnote 182) concludes the Service.<br>On the evenings of Sabbaths and festivals there are a few changes in the <span class=""underline"">Arvit</span> Service. On the Sabbath it is preceded by a special set of prayers and Psalms which welcome the Sabbath, called <span class=""underline"">Kabbalat</span> <span class=""underline"">Shabbat</span>. The <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> changes to the special Sabbath <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> of only seven benedictions. Also a <span class=""underline"">Kiddush</span>, a blessing over wine, is also inserted into the Service. At the conclusion of the Sabbath a special <span class=""underline"">Havdalah</span> (see footnote 226) section is added to the fourth benediction of the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> and readings are added to the end of the Service. The <span class=""underline"">Arvit</span> Service usually follows the <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Service immediately after sunset, but it can be recited up until dawn, and under special circumstances, even as late as after twilight.<br>Alexander Carlebach, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 3, pp. 664-66.</i>.</sup> It is customary to recite “<span class=""underline"">Kol</span><span class=""underline"">Nidrei</span><sup>145</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Kol</span> <span class=""underline"">Nidrei</span>, <span class=""rtl"">כל נדרי</span>; see footnote 141.</i>.</sup>” while it was still day and to lengthen it with melodies until nightfall, and (“<span class=""underline"">Kol</span><span class=""underline"">Nidrei</span>”) is said three times, and each time (the cantor) raises his voice “higher” (says it louder) than before, (<span dir=""ltr"">מהרי״ל</span>).<sup>146</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Maharil</span>, <span class=""rtl"">מהרי״ל</span>; see footnote 8.</i>.</sup> And likewise the reader says the following prayer sentence three times; “And the entire congregation will be forgiven, (etc.)<sup>147</sup><i class=""footnote"">This is a prayer from Numbers 15:26 and 14:19-20 which follows the chanting of the <span class=""underline"">Kol</span> <span class=""underline"">Nidrei</span> (see footnote 141).<br>Ben Zion Bokser. <span class=""underline"">The</span> <span class=""underline"">High</span> <span class=""underline"">Holyday</span> <span class=""underline"">Prayer</span> <span class=""underline"">Book</span>, New York, Hebrew Publishing Company, 1959, p.259.</i>.</sup>” And the congregation says three times, “And God said I forgave you according to your word”, (<span dir=""ltr"">מנהגים</span>).<sup>148</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Minhagim</span>, <span class=""rtl"">מנהגים</span>; see footnote 13.</i>.</sup> A man must not deviate from the custom of his city even in the melodies or <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span><sup>149</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Piyyutim</span>, <span class=""rtl"">פירטים</span>, is a Hebrew word derived from Greek which means a lyrical composition which was intended to embellish an obligatory prayer in the liturgy, or any other religious service whether communal or private. The word refers to liturgical compositions in Hebrew from the first century of the Common Era until the beginning of the Enlightenment, the <span class=""underline"">Haskalah</span>. Originally <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> meant to replace the set versions of prayers, expressing the same basic ideas, mainly on the Sabbath and festivals. When prayers became fixed, <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> were inserted into or around a set prayer. Most <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> were used to adorn and make beautiful the holy days, but there are many which were written for the Sabbaths, fast days, and even weekdays. There are also <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> for weddings, curcumcisions and mourning.<br><span class=""underline"">Piyyutim</span> are characterized from regular prayers by their lofty style and rythm. We know the authors of many <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> while others remain anonymous. <span class=""underline"">Piyyutim</span> were produced at one time or another in every land where Jews lived, each area producing its own style. There are <span class=""underline"">Kerovah</span> types of <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> which usually are found in the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> prayer and <span class=""underline"">Yoẓer</span> <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> found in the benediction before and after the <span class=""underline"">Shema</span> in the Morning Service (see footnote 17 and 173). <span class=""underline"">Piyyutim</span> used in the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> of <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> and <span class=""underline"">Arvi</span>t for Sabbath and holy days are called <span class=""underline"">shivata</span> because of this <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> having seven (<span class=""underline"">Shevah</span>) blessings. The Morning Service <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> for Sabbaths and holy days contains a sanctification prayer, therefore the <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> associated there are called <span class=""underline"">Kedushata</span> (sanctification is <span class=""underline"">Kedushah</span> in Hebrew, see footnote 213). Different holy days have special <span class=""underline"">Kerovot</span> <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> associated with the characteristic of the holiday. On Yom Kippur the special section of the service describing the Temple Sacrificial Service has many <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> associated with the <span class=""underline"">Seder</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Avodah</span> (see footnote 22). There are many <span class=""underline"">seliḥot</span> <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> for the fast days (see footnote 14).<br>Styles and vocabulary of the various <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> stretch Hebrew to its fullest in creativity and made the language rich. Many <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> are difficult to understand because of the freedom of style and vocabulary that was employed. The first <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> only used rhythm but later rhyme also played an important role in the <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> especially in Spain.

He lived in Spain from 1326 until 1408. This halakhic authority was born in Barcelona and he studied under Perez ha-Kohen, Ḥasdai b. Judah Crescas and Nissim b. Reuben Gerondi. He moved to Saragossa after he was imprisoned in Barcelona, but his life in his new home was also full of controversy and family tragedy.<br>In Saragossa he tried to abolish certain local customs he did not agree with and he won the anger of many local scholars. He as a result finally moved to Valencia in 1385 where he served as the rabbi. In 1391 there were anti-Jewish riots which forced him to move to North Africa, and he settled in Algiers where he became the communal rabbi and was well respected even though at first his appointment was challenged by Simeon b. Ẓemaḥ Duran (<span class=""underline"">Tashbaẓ</span>, <span class=""rtl"">תשב״ז</span>; see footnote 20).<br>Perfet's most important work was his responsa which was published in Constantinople in 1546. His responsa influenced the <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> after him and Caro used Perfet's decisions extensively in the Shulḥan Arukh. In addition to the vast amount of halakhic material, the responsa also reveal much about the life and customs of the Jews of Spain and North Africa in the fourteenth century. Perfet was the first to discuss the status of the Marranos (Spanish Jews who converted to Christianity so as not to be expelled in 1492) from an halakhic point of view. This became a quite crucial and painful problem for the Jews of Spain and North Africa. Perfet also wrote commentaries on many talmudic tractates and the Pentateuch. He refused to be associated with Kabbalah and even though he knew philosophy, he opposed its study including the works of Maimonides.<br>Hirsch Jacob Zimmels, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 9, pp. 32-33.<br>For <span class=""underline"">Minhagim</span>, <span class=""rtl"">מנהגים</span>; see footnote 13.</i>.</sup>)."

The <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> Service now comes immediately after the Torah Service, where the Torah and <span class=""underline"">Haftarah</span> (see footnote 170) are read, which follows the Morning Prayers on Sabbaths, festivals, and New Moons. <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> can be recited anytime during the day, but one who recites it after the seventh hour (1:00 P.M. according to our time system except on Yom Kippur, see footnote 167) is considered a transgressor.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> Service begins with the reader's recitation of the half-<span class=""underline"">Kaddish</span>, or praise of God (see footnote 177), which is followed by the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> (see footnote 43). This <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> normally consists of seven benedictions, the first and last three being the same as is always said, and the middle benediction known as <span class=""underline"">Kedushat</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Yom</span>, ""Sanctity of the Day"". In the case of the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> Service the middle benediction has an introductory paragraph followed by a prayer for the restoration of the Temple Service, and it concludes with the section from the Torah which deals with the particular Additional Sacrifice made on that Sabbath or festival.<br>On Rosh HaShanah the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> takes on a unique configuration. It has three central benedictions, thus making a total of nine benedictions in the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span>. The three benedictions cover the theme of the holy day, <span class=""underline"">malkhuyyot</span> (kingships), <span class=""underline"">zikhronot</span> (remembrances), and <span class=""underline"">shofarot</span> (Ram's Horns, see footnote 221).<br>The <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> after being recited silently is repeated outloud by the reader (see footnote 42). On the Sabbath, the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> is made up of twenty-two verses following the Hebrew alphabet backwards, and a description of the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> Sacrifice found in Numbers 28:9-10. The <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> takes on a slightly different form for each festival. On the Day of Atonement, the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> opens with the usual three benedictions. This is followed by the description of the Additional Sacrifices made on Yom Kippur found in Numbers 29:7-8. After this a prayer for the forgiveness of sins is found. The Confession, the <span class=""underline"">Al</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥet</span> and <span class=""underline"">Ashamnu</span> Prayers (see footnote 45), form the most important part of the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> as they do in the other <span class=""underline"">Amidot</span> of Yam Kippur. Various <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> (see footnote 149) are added in the reader's repetition of the <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur.<br>Aaron Rothkoff, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 12, pp. 532-34.</i>.</sup> before the seventh hour (1:00 P.M.).<sup>167</sup><i class=""footnote"">In halakhic literature the daylight hours were divided up into twelve equal parts regardless of how short or long the day was at various times of the year.

The exception to this is Yom Kippur and <span class=""underline"">Tishah</span> <span class=""underline"">be-Av</span> (see footnote 102) where there is a <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> after the Torah reading in both the Morning and the Afternoon Service.<br>The Torah in its regular portions is read straight through during the year but such is not the case on festivals and some special Sabbaths. The <span class=""underline"">haftarot</span> are selected in parts from both the Former and Latter Prophets. Only two prophetic books are read in their entirety as <span class=""underline"">haftarot</span>, the Book of Obadiah which has only twenty-one verses and is read after the Torah portion <span class=""underline"">Va-Yishlaḥ</span> (Genesis 32:4-36-43) according to the Sephardi rite, and the Book of Jonah which is the <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> for the <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Service on Yom Kippur (see the Shulḥan Arukh, <span class=""underline"">Oraḥ</span> <span class=""underline"">Ḥayyim</span> 622:2).<br><span class=""underline"">Haftarot</span> were usually selected so there would be some similarity in content between the Pentateuchal and the Prophetic portions, but often this did not happen and <span class=""underline"">haftarot</span> were chosen because of historical events or because of some special date. Special <span class=""underline"">haftarot</span> are read on special Sabbaths and the <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> for each festival is based on the nature of the festival.<br>When the custom of reading the <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> got started is not known for sure, but it is thought that it began during the persecutions of the Antiochus Epiphanes which preceded the Hasmonean revolt. The Torah was not permitted to be read by the Jews during the persecution for it was felt that the reading of it kept the Jews together and gave them a special strength. As a substitute for the Torah reading, sections form the Prophets were chosen that would remind the Jews of the corresponding Torah portion. Appearantly when the ban against reading the Torah was lifted, the practice of reading the <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> continued. The first mention of the practice of the reading of the <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> is found in the New Testament. Acts 13:15 states, ""after the reading of the law and the prophets"". <span class=""underline"">Haftarot</span> are also discussed in the Talmud as to which are to be read at specific times and festivals. In Mishnaic times different communities read different <span class=""underline"">haftarot</span>, and a set order was probably not established until talmudic times. Some <span class=""underline"">haftarot</span> today differ from those recorded in the Talmud, and there are differences in the Sephardi and Ashkenazi rites.<br>The <span class=""underline"">maftir</span>, the one who reads the <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> also reads the last part of the weekly portion, (i.e., the Torah reader reads it for him). On the Sabbath, after the seventh reader from the Torah, the <span class=""underline"">maftir</span> usually rereads the last three verses of the weekly portion. On festivals and the four special Sabbaths, the <span class=""underline"">maftir</span> reads the special section from the second scroll which is usually a short description of of the festival found in the Torah. Before the <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> is read (or chanted) the <span class=""underline"">maftir</span> precedes the <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> with two blessings and after he ends the <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> he recites three blessings to which a fourth one is added on Sabbaths and festivals. This fourth blessing changes with the nature of the day. The Sabbath <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> usually has a minimum of twenty-one verses while the festival has at least fifteen verses. Lately it has become the custom for the Bar Mitzvah boy (a man upon reaching the age of thirteen) to chant the <span class=""underline"">haftarah</span> to display his ability with a Hebrew text.<br>Louis Isaac Rabinowitz, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 16, pp. 1342-44.</i>.</sup>) comes from Isaiah, “and shall say, cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way” until “for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it”, (Isaiah 57:14-58:14)."

The Talmud (Ber. 4b) states that anyone who recites the <span class=""underline"">Ashrei</span> three times a day will be assured of a life in the world to come.

The confession of sins though was later replaced by two prayers that are unique to the confession made during the <span class=""underline"">Ne'ilah</span> Service: <span class=""underline"">Attah</span> <span class=""underline"">noten</span> <span class=""underline"">yad</span> <span class=""underline"">le-foshe'im</span>, ""Thou stretchest forth Thy hand (in forgiveness) to sinners,"" and <span class=""underline"">Attah</span> <span class=""underline"">hivdalta</span> <span class=""underline"">enosh</span>, ""Thou has distinguished man (from the beast)."" These prayers remind man that God eagerly forgives one who is genuinely penitent. There is a basic rabbinic idea that divine judgment is inscribed in the ""Book of Life"" on Rosh HaShanah, but it is not sealed until the end of the Day of Atonement. Therefore at the end of the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> in the <span class=""underline"">Ne'ilah</span> Service the root for the word inscribe, <span class=""underline"">ktv</span>, <span class=""rtl"">כתב</span>, is replaced by the root for the word seal, <span class=""underline"">ḥtm</span>, <span class=""rtl"">חתם</span>, when reference is made to the ""Book of Life"". To help set off the <span class=""underline"">Ne'ilah</span> Service and its uniqueness on Yom Kippur, the <span class=""underline"">Ashrei</span> (see footnote 175) and the <span class=""underline"">U-Va</span> <span class=""underline"">Le-Ẓiyyon</span> <span class=""underline"">Go-el</span> (see footnote 187) prayer which normally come at the beginning of the <span class=""underline"">Minḥah</span> Service on Sabbaths and festivals, come at this time before the <span class=""underline"">Ne'ilah</span> Service.<br>Beautiful liturgical poetry has become associated with the <span class=""underline"">Ne'ilah</span> Service especially prayers of forgiveness, <span class=""underline"">seliḥot</span> (see footnote 14). The central theme of the Service is to give one a final chance and effort to seek forgiveness before the heavenly gates symbolically close at sunset. The Service ends with a feeling of confidence.<br>The <span class=""underline"">Ne'ilah</span> Service contains <span class=""underline"">piyyutim</span> (see footnote 149), an <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> and a reader's repetition of it, <span class=""underline"">seliḥot</span>, <span class=""underline"">Ashamnu</span> (see footnote 45), <span class=""underline"">Avinu</span> <span class=""underline"">Malkenu</span> (see footnote 15), and the <span class=""underline"">Kaddish</span> (see footnote 177). The entire ritual culminates with a responsive proclamation of the <span class=""underline"">Shema</span> once (see footnote 173, but only the one line ""Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One"") followed by its response three times, <span class=""underline"">Barukh</span> <span class=""underline"">shem</span> <span class=""underline"">kavod</span> <span class=""underline"">malkhut</span>o <span class=""underline"">le'olam</span> <span class=""underline"">va'ed</span>, ""Praised be His glorious Kingdom forever and ever"", and <span class=""underline"">Adonai</span> <span class=""underline"">Hu</span> <span class=""underline"">ha-Elohim</span>"", ""The Lord He is God"" (I Kings 18:39) seven times. Finally in the Ashkenazi rite a final single <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> blast (see footnote 221) marks the end of the Day of Atonement, the Sabbath of Sabbaths.<br>Herman Kieval, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., v. 12, pp. 943-44.</i>.</sup>, and so wrote a few of our rabbis, (<span dir=""ltr"">מרדכי והגהות מיימוני סוף ספר אהבה, וסוף הלכות יו״כ, כל בו ומנהגים</span>).<sup>192</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span> and <span class=""underline"">Hagahot</span> <span class=""underline"">Maimuniyyot</span> at the end of the book <span class=""underline"">Ahavah</span>, Love, (which is the name of the second book of Maimonides' <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span>, see footnote 59) and the end (of the section) of the Laws of Yom Kippur, and <span class=""underline"">Kol</span> <span class=""underline"">Bo</span> and <span class=""underline"">Minhagim</span>, <span class=""rtl"">רמנהגים מרדכי והגהדת מיימרני ס‘ ״ס״ אהבה דסדף הלברת יד״ב דבל נר</span>.<br>For <span class=""underline"">Mordekhai</span>, <span class=""rtl"">מרדכי</span>; see footnote 24.<br>For <span class=""underline"">Hagahot</span> Maimuniyyot, הגהרת מיימדני; see footnote 27.<br>For <span class=""underline"">Kol</span> <span class=""underline"">Bo</span>, <span class=""rtl"">כל בר</span>; see footnote 34.<br>For <span class=""underline"">Minhagim</span>, <span class=""rtl"">מגהגים</span>; see footnote 13.</i>.</sup> We do not say “<span dir=""ltr"">אין כאלהינו</span><sup>193</sup><i class=""footnote""><span class=""underline"">En</span> <span class=""underline"">Kh'Elohenu</span>, <span class=""rtl"">אין כאלהינו</span>, is one of the most popular chants connected with the Jewish liturgy.

The <span class=""underline"">Musaf</span> Sanctification dwells more sublimely on the majestic conception of the angels in heaven glorifying the Eternal King and it introduces Israel proclaiming in response to the angelic choir, the holiness, glory, unity, and sovereignity of God's name.

The word is mentioned sixty-nine times in the Bible as well as numerous times in talmudic and post-talmudic literature.<br>The <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> was used to proclaim significant events in Judaism. It proclaimed the Jubilee Year (Leviticus 25:9-11) every fiftieth year proclaiming freedom throughout the land. Its most noted use is on Rosh HaShanah which is also called <span class=""underline"">yom</span> <span class=""underline"">teru'ah</span>, ""a day of blowing"", (Numbers 29:1). It was also used to declare war (Judges 3:27) and to induce fear (Amos 3:6).<br>In Temple times the <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> was not exclusively a ram's horn. Any curved animal's horn from a sheep, goat, mountain goat, antelope, or a gazelle was possible. The use of the ram's horn became popular because of its association with the <span class=""underline"">Akedah</span>, the sacrifice of Isaac read on Rosh HaShanah when the <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> is sounded. A ram was substituted for Isaac in the biblical account (Genesis 22) which is read on the second day of Rosh HaShanah. The <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> may have carved designs on it as long as the mouthpiece is natural. It may not be painted. It may not have a hole.<br>The Bible only refers to two trumpet sounds, teki'ah and <span class=""underline"">teru'ah</span> (Numbers 10: 5-8) the Mishna (RH. 4:9) describes <span class=""underline"">teki'ah</span> as one long blast and <span class=""underline"">teru'ah</span> as three wavering crying blasts. It prescribes three sets of <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> sounds since the word <span class=""underline"">teru'ah</span> is mentioned three times in the Bible, (Leviticus 23:24, 25:9, and Numbers 29:1). In talmudic times there was a disagreement about what exactly the sounds of the <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> should be and Rabbi Ahbahu decided the issue by compromise. The <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> was to be sounded three times which included different notes of <span class=""underline"">shevarim</span>, which are broken sounds and <span class=""underline"">teru'ah</span>, nine staccato notes. The sounding is one set of <span class=""underline"">teki'ah</span>, <span class=""underline"">shevarim</span> - <span class=""underline"">teru'ah</span>, t<span class=""underline"">eki'ah</span>, and two sets of the following: <span class=""underline"">teki'ah</span>, <span class=""underline"">shevarim</span>, <span class=""underline"">teki'ah</span>, and <span class=""underline"">teki'ah</span>, <span class=""underline"">teru'ah</span>, <span class=""underline"">teki'ah</span>. The <span class=""underline"">teki'ah</span> begins as a low note swelling to a higher one. The <span class=""underline"">teru'ah</span> is a series of staccato blasts and the <span class=""underline"">shevarim</span> alternates higher and lower notes. The concluding note of each of the two series is a <span class=""underline"">teki'ah</span> <span class=""underline"">gedolah</span>, a great, long blast, which derives its origin from Exodus 19:13, ""When the ram's horn soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.""<br>The <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> used to be sounded on the second day of the month of Elul marking the beginning of the penitential season. Today it is sounded daily except for the last day of the month of Elul at the Morning Service until Rosh Ha-Shanah is over and it is sounded at the end of the <span class=""underline"">Ne'ilah</span> Service at the conclusion of Yom Kippur.<br>On Rosh HaShanah, Psalm 47 is recited seven times before the <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> is sounded. This is a reminder of the walls of Jericho being circled seven times before they fell to the sound of the <span class=""underline"">shofar</span>.<br>The <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> may only be sounded during the day. It is not sounded when Rosh HaShanah falls on the Sabbath, lest one violate the laws of the Sabbath by carrying the <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> into the synagogue. When the Temple was in existence the <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> was blown there on the Sabbath.<br>Throughout Jewish history the <span class=""underline"">shofar</span> was blown to announce a death, on fasts, at excommunications (see footnote 29), and at funerals.

It is a blessing that is recited at the termination of Sabbaths and festivals in order to help distinguish the holy of the holiday from the profane or ordinary nature of the regular weekday. According to the Talmud (Ber. 33a) the men of the Great Synagogue instituted these prayers. At times the prayer was said in the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span>, but when Israel got richer and could afford it, the prayer was said over a cup of wine and, therefore taken out of the <span class=""underline"">Amidah</span> and placed at the end of the Service. The location of the prayer varied through the tannaitic period. In different rites, different prayers begin the ceremony. Most Ashkenazim recite Isaiah 12:2-3, ""Behold, God is my salvation"". The introduction is followed by three blessings, over wine, spices, and light, the order varied before it was set down in the Mishna.<br>The blessing over light was to display that work (lighting fire) was now permitted as the Sabbath or festival was over. The blessing over wine comes from the early established duty to recite the prayer over wine. There is no agreement as to the origin of the blessing over the spices. The <span class=""underline"">rishonim</span> (see footnote 16) state that it is to compensate the Jew for the loss of his ""additional soul"" which traditionally accompanied him throughout the Sabbath and festivals, although other reasons have also been given.<br>The actual <span class=""underline"">Havdalah</span> blessing itself, the blessing over the separation of holy from profane, is the fourth blessing in the ceremony. It developed over the years into various versions. It was decided that the prayer must mention at least one distinction, that between holy and profane. When a festival is followed immediately by the Sabbath the distinction mentioned is between the holy and the holy. When a festival is followed by a weekday, <span class=""underline"">Havdalah</span> may be recited over wine alone without the candle and spices.

It was written by a Spanish rabbi known as Vidal Yom Tov of Tolosa who lived in the second half of the fourteenth century. He came from Tolosa, Catalonia where he wrote his commentary. The commentary does not cover the entire <span class=""underline"">Mishneh</span> <span class=""underline"">Torah</span>, only Books 3; 4; 5, chapters 1-9; 11; 12, chapters 1-3; and 13 are in existence. Some of his commentaries may have been lost, but it is also possible that he only commented on laws that were practical during his time. His purpose was to clarify the difficult passages of Maimonides and to indicate the sources Maimonides used. Vidal also dealt with criticisms, <span class=""underline"">hassagot</span>, of Abraham b. David of Bosquieres and tried to answer them. He often found both men right attributing the differences to different versions of the text. He also explained the order of the <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span> of Maimonides in each book. He felt that a misunderstanding of Maimonides' order was the reason for the book being so severly criticized.

He was a communal leader in Toledo, and he was inspired to write his book because of the fact that customs connected with prayer varied from country to country where the Jews lived. Most of the Jews at this time did not understand the words of the prayers, nor the correct procedures and the reasons for saying them. Abudarham based his decisions on the Talmuds, the decisions of the <span class=""underline"">geonim</span> (see footnote 19), and early and late commentators of Spain, Provence, France and other Ashkenazi origins. Abudarham made much use of the prayer book of Saadiah Gaon. He also used several customs based on the <span class=""underline"">Manhig</span> of Abraham b. Nathan ha-Yarḥi of Lunel and the <span class=""underline"">Minhagot</span> of Asher b. Saul. He derived legal material from Asher b. Jehiel and the <span class=""underline"">Turim</span> of Jacob b. Asher (see footnote 23).<br>Abudarham traced the various customs in different countries of each prayer and commented on them. He included in his commentary an examination of the Passover <span class=""underline"">Haggadah</span>. He also discussed the weekly division of the Torah readings and their corresponding <span class=""underline"">Haftarot</span> (see footnote 170). He added to his book the rules of various benedictions, dividing them into nine categories and explaining and interpreting them. <span class=""underline"">Sefer</span> <span class=""underline"">Abudarham</span> was first published in Lisbon in 1490.

When this is the case, the footnote will be concluded with the following: Author of the article, <span class=""underline"">E</span>. <span class=""underline"">J</span>., followed by the volume(s) and page(s) consulted."
"SA HUC Brahms, Conclusion.1","It is quite interesting to take a document from the sixteenth century which gives, in the form of a code, a summary of Jewish law on a specific subject and be able to use it as an authoritative source for traditional Jewish practice in the twentieth century. The Shulḥan Arukh achieved its goal of becoming an accepted and binding short code of Jewish law which one could use to easily find out what the (latest) accepted decision was on a certain topic without being bogged down with long discussions and sources which went into deciding the final law. It was not written to take the place of exhaustive study which must go into the process of deciding a law for a new situation. The code is a useful way of quickly determining the accepted <span class=""underline"">halakhan</span>. Other works provide one with the information necessary to trace the development of a law through its original sources and discussions."
"SA HUC Brahms, Conclusion.2","The beauty of the Shulḥan Arukh is in its cleanness, conciseness, and organization to which it is indebted to a considerable extent to the <span class=""underline"">Arba'ah</span><span class=""underline"">Turim</span> by Jacob b. Asher. Laws on similar subjects and common areas are grouped together, but not only that. The laws in each section dealing with a specific subject are systematically organized. As an example, the Laws of Yom Kippur are listed chronologically. Situations are dealt with as one encounters them in his observance of the Holy Day. In each time period of the day, the laws that are applicable are given. Every conceivable situation is considered in relation to the Day of Atonement including special liturgy, type of dress, personal care, mental attitude, sickness, study, children, food, atonement, confession, and marital relations to name a few."
"SA HUC Brahms, Conclusion.3","The richness of the basic Shulḥan Arukh by Joseph Caro is only enhanced by the glosses of Moses Isserles. Caro supplied mainly the customs and accepted <span class=""underline"">halakhah</span> of his Sephardi tradition while Isserles enabled the Shulḥan Arukh, through his addition of the customs and <span class=""underline"">halakhot</span> practiced in the Ashkenazi communities, to be a code for the whole of world Judaism. The Shulḥan Arukh was able to survive and be binding on Jews because it contained in it the accepted laws and practices of almost all Jews wherever they lived with the inclusion of the notes by Isserles. Isserles often disagreed or expanded upon what Caro had stated so as to supply the customs and special practices of the Ashkenazi communities. This did not weaken the work as a binding code, but rather it had the opposite effect of making the total work more complete. When there was a disagreement between Caro and Isserles on a certain point, in certain areas Isserles was more lenient than was Caro; in other areas he tended to be more strict."
"SA HUC Brahms, Conclusion.4","The Shulḥan Arukh has not been surpassed by any other code of Jewish law since it was written. The traditions preserved by Judaism have not changed that significantly since the time of the Shulḥan Arukh to warrant a whole new code. Instead the code as we have it today has been extensively commented upon by successive generations. These notes and comments serve a similar function to that of the glosses of Isserles, in that they provide customs and variations which developed in different lands over generations. These additional notes on the Shulḥan Arukh enrich this code even more by adding a wealth of explanations, interpretations, and variances unique to separate Jewish communities throughout the world, thus keeping the Shulḥan Arukh alive and authoritative for traditional Jews."
