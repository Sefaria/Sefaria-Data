Judaism Fossil..1,JUDAISM — FOSSIL OR FERMENT?
"Judaism Fossil., Preface.1",T<small>HIS WORK</small> has grown out of an attempt to ascertain the opinions of the English historian Arnold J. Toynbee on Judaism and the Jewish people as they may be found in his monumental <i>A Study of History</i>.
"Judaism Fossil., Preface.2","Toynbee’s attitude to Judaism and Jewry is determined by his general interpretation of history. It is for this reason that Jews have to come to grips with it. Toynbee dismisses Judaism and Jewry, with an awe-inspiring claim to scholarship, on the grounds that they have failed in their endeavor to solve the problems of human existence. This is a challenge aimed at the very heart of all Israel. If Toynbee is right, there is no moral and spiritual justification for being a Jew. At the same time, the dilemma is Toynbee’s too. For, if he is wrong on the subject of Judaism, he is wrong altogether. His interpretation of Jewish history is not at all incidental to his main theme. Judaism and Jewry represent the antithesis to the Toynbean thesis."
"Judaism Fossil., Preface.3","The Jewish student of Toynbee’s great work must therefore look to his own bearings and review—and, if need be, revise—his own position. With the present volume the author has tried to meet that challenge for himself. He submits it to a wider public in the hope that it may be of help to others at a time when the meager knowledge and understanding of Judaism permit the Toynbean misrepresentations and distortions to cause confusion even among the Jewish readers of the English historian."
"Judaism Fossil., Preface.4","The present volume falls into two parts. The first deals with Toynbee’s interpretation of Judaism and Jewish history up to the fall of Jerusalem in the year 69-70 <small>C.E.</small> With that event, according to Toynbee, the history of the Jewish people as well as that of Judaism came to an end. The second part is centered around Chapter IV, which presents Toynbee’s explanation of Jewish survival after Jewry’s “extinction” in the year 70 <small>C.E.</small> In each case the author has tried to show how Toynbee’s opinions proceed from his general philosophy of history and religion. First, these specific views on Judaism and Jewish survival are analyzed on the basis of the Toynbean premises themselves and tested for their consistency and logicality. Next, the author offers a Jewish interpretation of those aspects of Judaism and Jewish history which have come under the purview of Toynbee’s inquiry. Finally, the author has endeavored to show the Jewish position on the broad universal issues of man’s existence and his relationship to God, over which—in the opinion of Toynbee—Judaism and the Jewish people came to grief. In the epilogue, an attempt is made to present the net result of <i>A Study of History</i> with a view to the crisis of our own times, as well as to evaluate it from a Jewish standpoint."
"Judaism Fossil., Preface.5","<i>A Study of History</i> is usually referred to in this book as the <i>Study</i>. The places in the <i>Study</i> from which quotations are taken are indicated in the notes by volume and page number only. Thus “V/237” refers to <i>A Study of History</i>, Volume V, page 237."

"Judaism Fossil., Introduction.1","T<small>OYNBEE’S CRITICISM</small> of Judaism and Jewry is spread practically across the entire face of the ten volumes of his <i>Study</i>. This is the external mark of the intrinsic connection that exists between that author’s interpretation of world history and his understanding of Judaism. Believing that he has discerned the central theme of all history, he briskly treads his path through the maze of events and occurrences. But it is his central theme which is responsible for Toynbee’s preoccupation with Judaism, as well as for the facts that most of the basic principles of the <i>Study</i> are developed in innumerable—rather one-sided—debates against Judaism and the alleged aspirations of the Jewish people. The theme of universal history, according to Toynbee, is Man’s Salvation. But no one who is bold enough to believe in that will ever be able to get away from Israel. He must either bless or curse—and Toynbee does both—but he cannot leave alone. The salvation of man is not only a central theological concept of Judaism, but the goal toward which, in Judaic teaching, all history is moving. It was the prophets of Israel, and they alone, who interpreted history as man’s Messianic development toward his salvation. Toynbee takes over the Jewish concept but puts it to work side by side with his rejection of Judaism and of the Jewish people. No wonder that the final outcome of <i>A Study of History</i> is intellectually as well as morally insipid.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">See below the Epilogue, section 2.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., Introduction.2","Probably the most significant aspect of <i>A Study of History</i> is that it is not at all a historical work, i.e., one belonging to the discipline of the science of history. It is a philosophical and theological inquiry concerning a great deal of historical raw material. The historian Toynbee supplies the information; the philosopher and theologian. Toynbee provides the interpretation. However, since Toynbee is much more historian than theologian or philosopher, he really believes that his interpretation is derived from the facts of history; and so he lustily engages in the discovery of a considerable number of “laws” of history. But since the days of Hume and Kant no philosopher should make the mistake of thinking that “laws” can be derived from facts. That man cannot save himself and depends for his salvation on an Act of Grace by God, who in a form incarnate gives Himself to the world in order to redeem it, is Christian doctrine; and as such it will be treated with respect as the faith of their fellow men by non-Christians too. But when Toynbee adduces countless instances of human failure in history in order to distill from them the <i>proof</i> that man, on account of his intrinsic nature, will never save himself—which, by the way, is Toynbee’s central thesis—then he is talking nonsense. The examples may establish the fact that, up to date, man has not succeeded in saving himself. Whether he has failed because he has blundered—and what he needs is more time to try—or because he is incapable of saving himself: on this point history remains silent. It is for the religions and philosophies of mankind to take over where history leaves off and to interpret the facts as best they may. The principles of interpretation do not emanate from history, but from philosophy, ethics, and religion. It is so in the case of Toynbee, and as it has been so in the case of all the interpreters of history, even though he does not seem to be aware of the fact. Toynbee’s “laws” of history are all imported from without and applied to the facts, but not proved by them. From the point of view of historical objectivity all that one might say in their favor is that, according to Toynbee, they are not contradicted by the facts."
"Judaism Fossil., Introduction.3","Toynbee’s discussion of H. A. L. Fisher’s approach to history is beside the point.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">See V/414.</i> Fisher is of course right that, for the historian, history is without meaning. But this is not the same as saying that “history is bunkum.” The meaning is in the interpretation, and the interpretation is never provided by history itself. Toynbee is fooling himself when he suggests that his “laws” are those of history. They are philosophical and theological concepts with whose help he attempts to bring order to the chaos of historical events. There may be dozens of others, as there indeed are, that may be equally useful as “categories” or as “principles of selection” for the purpose of imposing some order on the “Tohu va’Bohu” of mere facts. If the “principles of selection” are to be treated as more than a mere device for the writer of history to marshal his facts coherently, if they are to be granted the solemn dignity of “laws,” expressing—as in the case of Toynbee—eternal metaphysical truth, then they have validity only in so far as they may stand their ground in the realm of philosophy, ethics, or theology. But nowhere in the <i>Study</i> is the soundness of the many philosophical, metaphysical, or theological premises of Toynbee even investigated, much less established. The author of the <i>Study</i> has read widely and makes clever eclectical and literary use of his reading; it is, however, extremely doubtful that he deserves much consideration either as a philosopher or as a theologian."
"Judaism Fossil., Introduction.4","It would be pointless to argue that the Toynbean “laws” of history might have “statistical” significance, as—indeed—Toynbee occasionally suggests. There is no need to discuss here the question whether the concept of statistical laws of modern scientific research is at all applicable—and if so to what extent—to the study of history. Whatever the verdict of the logician, scientist, or philosopher, it is certain that statistics could never yield the Toynbean pattern of world history. By their very essence statistical laws have only quantitative meaning and are, indeed, always about quantitative relationships in nature; the Toynbean “laws” are about values and metaphysical truths. Statistical laws can be put to the test of experiment: if they “work,” if they are successful, they may be assumed to be valid. The validity of value concepts, on the other hand, cannot be questioned by failure in practice, nor can metaphysical truths be ascertained by facts of history."
"Judaism Fossil., Introduction.5","Toynbee, for instance, spends a great amount of effort to prove how right Jesus was when he said that all who take the sword perish by the sword. Now, for a believer in Jesus, the real significance of the pronouncement lies not in the fact that it was made on the basis of experimental observation, but in the fact that its source is divine inspiration and knowledge. It is the revelation of the metaphysical truth that this world has been so established by God that those who take the sword must perish by it. Only on this account is it wrong, in all circumstances, to take the sword; he who does so acts against the Will of God. This may be true and it does make a lot of sense for the believer, but it cannot be “proved” by a study of history. It is sufficient that history should not contradict it. What Toynbee has shown—if he has done so much—is that, as far as our observations reach, all those who ever took the sword perished by the sword. Consequently, one is entitled to conclude that, for anyone who does not wish to perish, it would be foolish to take the sword, for the probability that he will perish by the sword is extremely high. But suppose that a person should enjoy being foolish and cared nothing whether he lived or perished.… Notwithstanding his ten volumes, Toynbee has not made the slightest contribution toward establishing more firmly among men the truth that it is ethically wrong to take the sword. All his examples show only that taking the sword is likely to lead to failure. This, however, means nothing for the question of values. If it is right to take the sword, it will be right to do so even though one is likely to perish in the action; if it is wrong to take the sword, it will remain an evil thing to do even though it may bring honor, glory, long life, and all the riches of the world. Facts know nothing of “ought” and “ought not.” Ethical values and religious truth are not confirmed by success nor invalidated by failure."
"Judaism Fossil., Introduction.6","The prophets of Israel did not gain their interpretation of history as historians. The meaning which they attributed to history as the gradual Messianic evolution of mankind toward salvation has its origin in their faith in God and in the logical application of that faith to the understanding of all life. Man’s failure in history is, to use a phrase of Jacob Burckhardt,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Jacob Burckhardt, <i>Force and Freedom</i>, ed. Meridian Books, N. Y. 1955, p. 234.</i> a scandal. The scandal caused Toynbee to panic intellectually;<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">See below chapter V, section 1 and the Epilogue, section 1.</i> because of it he became a religious historian. The believer, however, believes not because of the scandal, but in spite of it; nor does he seek his justification in history, but in his own conscience before God."

"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.1",<b>1.</b>
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.2","I<small>N THE OPINION</small> of Toynbee the outstanding event in the history of the West was the rise of Christianity.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">VII/446-47.</i> As in the case of all other Higher Religions, Christianity too emerged from the clash between two civilizations. Since, however, the two civilizations in question were the “Syriac” (standing here for Jewish) and the Hellenic and, especially, since Christianity was originally the answer of Jewish souls to the challenge inherent in the conflict, an understanding of Judaism and Jewish history becomes one of the keys to the understanding of the pattern and the “laws” that Mr. Toynbee believes he is able to discern in all history. The Christian response to the challenge was successful; the Jewish response, a warning failure for all generations. No wonder, therefore, that for exceedingly long stretches through nine of the ten volumes<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>A Study of History</i> is actually completed with Volume IX; Volume X might appropriately be considered an annex to the rest of the work.</i> of <i>A Study of History</i> the author seems to be waging a running battle against Judaism and Jewry."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.3","It seems, though, that Judaism was not always a failure. Its fall dates from the epiphany of Christianity. Originally, Judaism represented one of the noblest manifestations of the Spirit. The Syriac civilization, the larger unit to which Israel and Judah belong according to Mr. Toynbee’s method of classification, is perhaps “the most brilliant and most original representative of the species”; and of “the three great feats to its credit … the greatest creative achievement … was neither its discovery of the Atlantic nor its discovery of the Alphabet,” the achievement of the other Syriac peoples, but its Jewish discovery of God. The “particular conception of God” of the early Hebrew tribes “is common to Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam, but alien from the Egyptiac, Sumeric, Indic, and Hellenic veins of religious thought.”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">The quotations are taken from II/50 and 386-87.</i> The essence of Judaism at this early stage is summed up in the Biblical tale about the Choice of Solomon. “Ask what I shall give thee,” God said to the King in a dream; and Solomon asked not for riches or honor but for “an understanding heart.”<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">I Kings, III/5 and 9.</i> Mr. Toynbee comments: “This fable of Solomon’s Choice is a parable of the history of the Chosen People. In the power of their spiritual understanding, the Israelites surpassed the military powers of the Philistines and the maritime powers of the Phoenicians. They had not sought after those things which the Gentiles seek, but had sought first the kingdom of God; and therefore all those things were added to them.…”<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">II/55.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.4","However, soon after the death of Solomon the Hebrew tribes, “betrayed by what is false within,” in fratricidal warfare brought about the beginning of the breakdown of the Syriac civilization. Thus, true to the general pattern of history, this civilization too was launched toward its inevitable “Time of Troubles,” which began when the Assyrian colossus, practically invited by the breakdown, marched into the Syriac arena.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/68.</i> Fortunately, this crisis turned out to be a blessing in disguise, for it was the challenge that stimulated the “Syriac” people of the Jews to respond with the most magnificent flowering of their spiritual creativity. It was in this Time of Troubles that Judaism truly developed into one of the great Higher Religions of mankind. One might single out some of the phases in this development which are discussed by Mr. Toynbee. If the breakdown is due to “what is false within,” then of course it is logical to seek for salvation by what is true within or, as it may also be put, by the transference of action from the material to the spiritual level, “from the Macrocosm to the Microcosm.” That, indeed, is the secret of creativity and the “sign of growth.” It was the message conveyed to Socrates by his “daimonion … after he had grown in wisdom and had put away childish things”; it was the intuition of Lao-tse; and it was perceived in “the still small voice in which Elijah heard at last the Godhead whom he had not seen in the fire and not encountered in the earthquake and not felt in the great and strong wind which had rent the mountains and broken in pieces the rocks.”<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">III/187.</i> Later in Jewish history this experience of Elijah is crystallized by the pre-exilic prophets of Israel into the corporate response of the Jewish people to Assyrian and Babylonian militarism. It confounds the crushing military superiority of the adversary because it is not a retort “in kind,” but the answer “to a physical challenge on a spiritual plane.”<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">VIII/467.</i> In terms of the <i>Study</i> one may discern several features in this response. It contains an explanation of the disaster that overtook the people, the reason for which—and this is decisive—is not sought in obvious external causes, like the military might of the enemy, but in guilt within, in a realization of sin and personal failure. The explanation implies acceptance of the suffering that follows from the crisis and that is translated into “understanding of the heart.” It is now that Judaism develops from its stage of an “embryonic higher religion” into its maturity. In the tribulations of this Time of Troubles, Judaism “found its soul by exchanging a parochial for an ecumenical outlook.” Jewry, enlightened by suffering, resigns itself “consciously to be the instrument of God’s will,” and is ready now to go out and meet the world with the ethos of gentleness, to captivate souls rather than to subdue empires.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">This meaning of “the retort” is taken from various passages in the <i>Study</i>, in particular from V/433, VII/228 and 424, I/293, VIII/472, V/120.</i> Mr. Toynbee, developing this theme, is unstinting in his appreciation. So he says, for example:"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.5","… the classical case is the spiritual experience of the Prophets of Israel and Judah in the Syriac “Time of Troubles,” when these prophets discovering their truths and delivering their message, the society out of whose bosom they had arisen, and to whose members they were addressing themselves, was lying in helpless agony in the grip of the Assyrian tiger.… For souls whose body social was in this fearful plight, it was an heroic spiritual feat to reject the obvious and specious explanation of their misery as the work of an irresistible external force of a material kind, and to divine that, in spite of all outward appearances, it was their own sin that was the true cause of their tribulations and that it therefore lay in their own hands to win their true release."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.6","This “saving truth” was inherited by Christianity from the prophets of Israel and “propagated in Christian guise” for the salvation of “the Hellenic World.”<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">According to Mr. Toynbee’s terminology, meaning the Roman Empire, which is to be considered the Universal State of the disintegrating Hellenic Civilization.</i> “Without this intrusion from an alien source in [of?] a principle which had already been apprehended by Syriac souls with an altogether non-Hellenic outlook, the Hellenic Society might never—even in its own ‘Time of Troubles’—have succeeded in learning a lesson which was so much at variance with the dominant mood in the Hellenic Ethos.” The significance of this Jewish response of the “still small voice” was then so far-reaching that without it the conversion of the Roman Empire and its peoples to Christianity might never have occurred."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.7","Bearing this in mind one is almost tempted to the perhaps frivolous remark that, alas, the finest Time of Troubles does not last forever; and so the Syriac tribulations too came to an end with the establishment by Cyrus of an Empire that gave the Syriac world a <i>Pax Achaemenia</i>.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/302.</i> From the sixth century to the second century <small>B.C.E.</small> Judaism and Jewry pass through a phase of “relative stagnation.”<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">III/141.</i> No suffering, no creativity!—this is the rule. The stimulus for further growth is not again provided until the Achaemenian Empire, as the result of the conquest of Alexander the Great, is overwhelmed by the Hellenic world. And now we have a second bout of the Time of Troubles, but this time between the Syriac and the Hellenic civilizations. The conflict is narrowed down in the second century <small>B.C.E.</small> to one between Judaism and Hellenism—at first between Jewry and the Hellenized Syria of the Seleucids, later between Jewry and the Roman Empire, the universal state of Hellenic society. It is in this period that Judaism and the Jewish people fail miserably; it is the time of their decline and irretrievable fall."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.8",<b>2.</b>
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.9","What happened to the Jewish soul after the glorious achievements of the first period of Syriac misfortune? In the opinion of Mr. Toynbee, Judaism in this second Time of Troubles lapsed into militancy.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/68, footnote 2.</i> However, trying to analyze what that means, we come up against one of the idiosyncrasies of the profuse <i>Study</i>. The rich style is, unfortunately, not seasoned by clarity of expression; nor is the breadth of erudition controlled by consistent reasoning. The “lapse into militancy” has not remained unaffected by the author’s predilection for literary luxuriance. The phrase seems to have a host of different meanings. The rebellion of the Maccabees is first described as such a lapse into militancy for the purpose of propagating a religion by methods of violence.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/225.</i> However, the record is corrected later, so as to conform more to the truth, by the admission that the Maccabees drew the sword “in self-defense, in order to save the Jewish religion from extinction.”<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/657-58.</i> This, of course, does not seem to be such a dishonorable deed, and Mr. Toynbee, in another place,<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/246.</i> gives even the Pharisees a pat on the back for having supported the Maccabees in “the heroic Jewish revolt against Hellenism.” But the admission is made not in order to exculpate the Maccabees but in order to pin-point their guilt. The very same sword that had been so nobly drawn was soon turned “to the new sinister use of imposing Judaism upon the neighboring non-Jewish populations … whom the Maccabees now succeded in bringing under their rule.”<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/657-58.</i> The reference is of course to Johanan Hyrcanus<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Josephus, <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, XIII/9.</i>, who is reported by Josephus to have compelled the Idumeans to accept Judaism. The isolated action of a Hasmonean prince is construed as “the Maccabean policy of religious conversion by political force” that cost Judaism “the whole of its spiritual future.”<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/657-58.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.10","Whether the thesis makes sense or not, it means that the lapse into militancy was due to religious zeal; it had a religious motivation. This version of the “lapse” is lost sight of elsewhere in order to make room for a different one. According to another version, Jewry’s struggle against Hellenism was a purely secular affair, a political enterprise with the purpose of driving an alien aggressor out of the domain of the Syriac world, a task that was later brilliantly accomplished by Islam. This then was the “disastrous aberration”—the exchanging of the religious function, proper to Judaism, for a political role. In the end Jewry had to pay heavily “for having lent itself to a political enterprise.”<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">E.g., V/125-6, VIII/479, 446.</i> But even this version of the “lapse” is not maintained consistently. At times Mr. Toynbee says that Judaism was perversely distracted from its “ecumenical mission of bringing human souls into a closer communion with God” and became a combatant “in the trivial mundane military enterprise of liberating a subjugated Syriac Society’s domain from the incubus of an interloping Hellenic ascendancy.” At times, on the other hand, Mr. Toynbee implies that the struggle between the two societies was really a <i>Kulturkampf</i> and that Judaism was deflected from its original mission and “transformed” into a weapon “of cultural warfare in the Syriac Society’s retort to the Hellenic Society’s aggression.”<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">VII/73.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.11","And now the reader may take his choice between militancy as a policy of religious conversion, as an auxiliary in a cultural warfare, or as a struggle for political freedom. But, Mr. Toynbee himself does not make a choice; he asserts these propositions indiscriminately and simultaneously, with all their contradictory consequences."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.12","The use of force for the conversion of souls is indeed the most monstrous perversion of religion that one can imagine. And if that was the guilt of Jewry during the period under discussion, one might even agree with the author’s equation of the exploits of the “Jewish Sicarii—the ‘gangsters’ of the zealot persuasion”—with those of the Spanish Inquisition.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/228-29.</i> It is of course true that these “gangster” Zealots were fighting as soldiers, defending their homeland against the brutal military monster, whereas the Grand Inquisitors were living in the palaces of the mighty, robed in purple and satiated with power and riches, secure and safe and risking nothing of their own, wielding all the power of this world against the few and the weak who were no aggressors. Nevertheless from the point of view of the Kingdom of God, it makes little difference whether you take the sword in self-defense or as an aggressor; you will perish by the sword.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/260-61.</i> On the other hand, if the struggle of Jewry against Hellenism was only “a trivial mundane military enterprise” for the sake of political liberation, then it might be called foolish but not really devilish; then it does make a world of difference whether you fight in self-defense, spurning life without liberty, or as an aggressor, trampling under foot the freedom and happiness of others. Surely, not even the “etherealized”<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/225.</i> Mr. Toynbee would have the courage to consider all the “unsuccessful” fighters for freedom in history to be “gangsters.” If Jewry’s failure consisted in exchanging a religious function for a political one, then the mere mentioning of the Zealots and the Spanish Inquisition in the same breath is an unwarranted insult to the Zealots. Mr. Toynbee is perfectly right in maintaining “that the propagation of one religion at the expense of other religions through the employment of methods of barbarism, on the ground that the religion in whose name the persecution is carried on is a religion of a higher order, is a moral contradiction in terms, since oppression and injustice and cruelty are negations of the very essence of spiritual sublimity.”<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/225.</i> Now, this is extremely relevant in any discussion of the Inquisition; it was indeed “a moral contradiction in terms” to insist on building the Kingdom of God with “oppression and injustice and cruelty.” However, the stricture does not apply to the Jewish Zealots, if theirs was a secular struggle against a secular enemy. It is certainly not a “moral contradiction” to fight on the mundane plane a mundane war of self-defense with mundane means; but it is undoubtedly the most devilish form of barbarism to “save” souls, against their own will, with iron and fire."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.13","Similarly, the purported forcible conversion of the Idumeans ought to be re-evaluated. If Judaism was forced into a political role and the Maccabean kingdom was a purely mundane enterprise,<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/387.</i> then Johanan Hyrcanus was attempting to imitate the methods of Antiochus Epiphanes, who by the brutally enforced elimination of religious diversity among his subject peoples was hoping to safeguard the political unity of his empire.<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Josephus, <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, XIII/9.</i> On this showing, Johanan Hyrcanus was doing on a small scale and in a tiny corner of the world what the conquerors of this earth did almost as a matter of political routine on a far vaster scale and with much more devastating consequences for the human race. In this case one may of course speak no longer of the “Maccabean policy of religious conversion by political force,” but rather of the Machiavellian policy of all rulers—that of safeguarding the political unity of their realm at all cost, even by means of enforced religious uniformity.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">There are historians who maintain that Constantine the Great, when making Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire, was moved mainly by considerations of political expediency. While Mr. Toynbee, for reasons of his “psychological” penetration of the mentality of Constantine, rejects such a view (see V/708-10), he cannot help conceding (see IV/349-50) that the triumph of Christianity over the Empire was due to “promptings of Superstition … supported by the counsels of raison d’état.” In order to preserve “the ancient unity of religious and political life in the Hellenic universal state … the bold diplomatic counterstroke was executed of taking the Christian Church bodily to the Empire’s bosom”. After the <i>entente</i> between Constantine and the Church, the latter—according to Mr. Toynbee—“nestled down promptly and cheerfully into the <i>political</i> shell in which the Imperial authorities now invited it to take up its abode …” Since “the bold diplomatic counterstroke” included the forcible suppression of all other religions besides Christianity (Judaism being the only one that was granted a very narrowly circumscribed measure of toleration), it would be interesting to know whether the establishment of Christianity by Constantine should be called “a policy of religious conversion by political force” or, perhaps, a policy of political unification by means of enforced religious uniformity? See also what Toynbee has to say (VII/401) about Theodosius I’s new policy of repression against all non-Christian religion in 382 C.E., as a means for saving the Empire from dissolution. Be that as it may, it is interesting to note that the same deed that cost Judaism “the whole of its spiritual future,” when performed on a world-wide scale, should have established the good fortune of Christianity. At the same time one cannot help recalling that another Christian scholar contemporary of Mr. Toynbee, John MacMurray, in his <i>The Key to History</i>, subjects the <i>entente</i> between Constantine and the Church to a criticism which is very similar to the one meted out to the Hasmonean Prince by Mr. Toynbee. MacMurray recognizes in this <i>entente</i> between Church and State the main cause for Christianity’s failure in Western history.</i> The two concepts are incompatible."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.14","However, inconsistency does not perturb Mr. Toynbee. Having belabored the Maccabees and the Zealots on account of their perverse policy of propagating Judaism by methods of barbarism, he proceeds lustily to reap the full harvest of his other theory that the Maccabees deserted religion for politics. But here we have to introduce another one of Mr. Toynbee’s cherished concepts. What is at first called “lapse into militancy” imperceptibly merges into the ethos of violence, and we get the “antithesis between the gentle ethos of Christianity … and the violent ethos of Maccabean Judaism.”<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/175.</i> One cannot help being genuinely surprised. What happened to the “lapse” that it should deserve to be elevated to the dignity of an “ethos”? Furthermore, the lapse <i>into</i> militancy must have been a lapse <i>from</i> something else; speaking of the Maccabees, this could only have been a lapse from Judaism, which—in Mr. Toynbee’s own words—in “a tremendous spiritual travail” of the first Syriac Time of Troubles had chosen the ethos of gentleness.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">See above, sect. 1 of this chapter.</i> It would therefore be much more truthful, when discussing the <i>lapse</i> of the Maccabees from the religion of their fathers, to speak of the antithesis between the gentle ethos of Judaism and the violent ethos of the Maccabees."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.15","For an unbiased mind, however, the most puzzling point here is the phrase “Maccabean Judaism.” In fact, there is no such things and there never was. The Maccabees were neither teachers nor interpreters of Judaism. In matters of religion they were followers and not leaders. Yet the term is a cornerstone in the structure of Mr. Toynbee. From the point of view of a Higher Religion the lapse into militancy is a grave aberration; but a sin that affects the soul of the sinner still leaves untainted the purity of his religion. An undespoiled Judaism, however, will never satisfy Mr. Toynbee. Accordingly, the Maccabees are said to have deserted the religious plane of life for a political one, thus transforming Judaism itself; they created a Judaism of their own, a kind of mundane religion. For the political task of liberating a society under physical assault, militancy is the only possible way of action; indeed, it is a virtue, the ethos of a mundane civilization. What we have is no longer a “lapse,” but “a change of ethos”;<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/126, footnote 5.</i> and since this changes the very essence of a religion, we get “the violent ethos of Maccabean Judaism.”"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.16","It should not be difficult to guess how the other Judaism, the good one, the higher religion of the prophets of Israel, has been whisked away from the scene of history. This is how Mr. Toynbee puts it:"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.17","After the <i>transformation</i> of Judaism and Zoroastrianism into instruments of Syriac political opposition to a Hellenic dominant minority, the Syriac religious genius took refuge among those elements in the Syriac population under Hellenic ascendancy which were reacting to the challenge in the gentle and not in the violent way; and, in giving birth to Christianity and Mithraism as its contributions to the spiritual travail of a Hellenic internal proletariat, Syriac religion found new expressions for a spirit and an outlook which Judaism and Zoroastrianism had repudiated.<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/126-27.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.18","This statement neatly condenses most of the terminology of the <i>Study</i>, and no doubt has a certain dignity of its own. Attempting to translate it into plain English, by leaving out all references to Zoroastrianism and Mithraism<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">One of the charms of the <i>Study</i> is that it prevents Jews as well as Judaism from falling into the sin of vain conceit by imagining that there could be anything unique about either of them. In good and bad fortune, in their greatness as well as in their fall, they have for their yoke-fellows of destiny the Parsees and Zoroastrianism.</i> (and therefore reading for “Syriac religious” and “Syriac religion,” “Jewish religious” and “Jewish religion”), and by equating “the gentle and not violent way” with the way of the original Judaism that was “transformed,” we can perhaps maintain that what Mr. Toynbee says is this: After the transformation of Judaism into an instrument of Syriac political opposition to Hellenic domination, the Jewish religious genius took refuge among those people who reacted to the challenge in the Jewish way; and, in giving birth to Christianity, Jewish religion found a new expression (meaning Christianity) for a spirit and an outlook (meaning Judaism) which Judaism had repudiated. Now, even though he says so, Mr. Toynbee does not really mean that Judaism repudiated Judaism; that would be silly. The unfortunate impression arises from the fact that “Judaism” and “Jewish” are used in two different ways in the same sentence. Almost throughout the entire sentence the words stand for their original “pre-transformation” meaning; only once, in the final clause, is “Judaism” used in the sense which it received after its “transformation.” It was this “transformed” Judaism that repudiated the classical Judaism of Israel. Classical Judaism “found new expressions” in Christianity, when—as the result of the rather illegitimate birth of Maccabean Judaism—the Jewish spiritual genius (the classical one!) took refuge outside a faithless Jewry. The Judaism of the prophets having been taken over by Christianity, the “antithesis” is now between the gentle ethos of Christianity and the violent ethos of Maccabean Judaism. The Judaism which Jewry itself is permitted to retain for its own use is the “transformed” Judaism of the Maccabees; and, since no other remains, Mr. Toynbee proceeds to drop the adjective “Maccabean” and speak boldly of the violent ethos of Judaism."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.19","The idea is neither very original nor very exciting. We seem to have heard before that the real Jews, in the classical sense of the word, are the Gentiles, and the real Gentiles the Jews. New and original is only the way Mr. Toynbee develops this hoary theme of anti-Jewish conceit. However, let us not allow him to confuse us. When he speaks of the violent ethos of Judaism, he can only mean this new-fangled, “transformed,” political Judaism, which according to him was a Maccabean creation and which, in <i>his</i> view, is the religion of Jewry."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.20","The idea of the “lapse into militancy,” on the other hand, must not be confused with the “violent ethos”; it does not refer to the “transformed” Judaism but, on the contrary, makes sense only from the viewpoint of the classical Judaism of the prophets. If the Maccabean policy was “religious conversion by political force,” then there was “lapse into militancy” but no “transformation” of Judaism—and therefore no “change of ethos” either. Unfortunately, Mr. Toynbee does not indicate any awareness that these two concepts are mutually exclusive. As we have already seen—and as we shall observe yet more closely—he treats them as if they were interchangeable. Finally, let us keep in mind the point, so eloquently made by Mr. Toynbee, that in Christianity “untransformed” Judaism “found new expressions.” Nor let us overlook the not altogether unimportant matter that when Mr. Toynbee speaks of the gentle ethos of Christianity, the term includes the gentle ethos of Judaism, “inherited from the Prophets of Israel.”<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/434.</i> He rightly calls it Christian in contradistinction to “Jewish” only in accordance with the meaning that the word “Jewish” acquires within his <i>own</i> construction and as a result of but one of his interpretations of the Maccabean performance."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.21",<b>3.</b>
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.22","The question that still must be answered is: How could a people, or a religion, that started out so promisingly fall so low? What was the reason for “the unfortunate change of ethos” or turn to violence? According to Mr. Toynbee, Jewry’s stumbling block was its immature Messianic idea. Jewish Messianism meant the restoration of “the fallen national kingdom at some hidden future date.”<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/387.</i> Although such an expectation does mean a turning away from the external world, it is not the “transference of action from the Macrocosm to the Microcosm,” which we have recognized as the secret of the successful response to a challenge; it is not a genuine spiritual withdrawal from the world. Though the Jewish Messianic expectations were directed toward the future, they were awaiting a realm that was not essentially different from the existing one, but only more pleasant for Jewry. Such a concept of “the Kingdom” is an “external Utopia,” which “is intended to do duty, in place of the inward spiritual cosmos, as an ‘Other World’; but it is ‘Other World’ only in the shallow and unsatisfying sense of being a negation of the Macrocosm in the momentary present of the Macrocosm’s existence here and now.”<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/383.</i> Jewish Messianism may, therefore, best be called Futurism; it is the attempt to solve the problem of a society in a state of disintegration by a mere external change in the time-dimension. It is true that for several centuries after the fall of Jerusalem to Nebuchadnezzar, Jewish Messianism did work “in favour of gentleness,” and we see how the early martyrs in Judaism’s struggle with Hellenism gave their lives without offering any physical resistance. Yet, Futurism is bound to fail. The strain between “a confidently expected mundane future and an excruciatingly experienced mundane present” becomes unbearable and is resolved “in violence in the end.” And so we find that the “martyrdom of Eleazar and the Seven Brethren was followed, within two years, by the armed insurrection of Judas Maccabaeus.” This opened the era “of ever more fanatically militant Jewish Zealots … whose violence reached its appalling climax in the Satanic Jewish <i>emeutes</i> of … 66-70 and 115-17 and 132-5” of the <small>C.E.</small><sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/387.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.23","The answer to the problem of Jewry should have been Transfiguration, which differs from Futurism in that it represents “a genuine change in spiritual clime” and not “a mere transfer in the Time-dimension.”<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/394.</i> It seems to imply a transformation of human nature, a kind of “awakening of the soul to the presence,” a rejection of this mundane world and the discovery of the Kingdom of God. It was the ultimately triumphant answer of Jesus “whose servants were forbidden to fight because his Kingdom was not of this World.” Jewry could not accept such a solution since the Kingdom of God brought salvation to all mankind, whereas the Jews awaited it only for themselves as God’s Chosen People. This is what Mr. Toynbee calls the “idolization of an ephemeral self,” the fateful error for which “the most notorious historical example” are the Jews. It is the Nemesis of Creativity in Jewry; indeed, the end of all further Jewish creativity. Having risen high above their contemporaries in the first phase of the Syriac Time of Troubles by the discovery of an omnipresent and omnipotent God, “they allowed themselves to be captivated by a temporary and relative half-truth. They persuaded themselves that Israel’s discovery of the One True God had revealed Israel itself to be God’s Chosen People; and this half-truth inveigled them into the fatal error of looking upon a momentary spiritual eminence, which they had attained by labour and travail, as a privilege conferred upon them by God in a covenant which was everlasting.”<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/262-63.</i> In such sinful self-delusion the Jews “rested on their oars” when the crisis of the impact of Hellenism upon the Syriac Society challenged them to a renewed creative response. “By persisting in this posture, they ‘put themselves out of the running’ for serving once more as pioneers in the next advance of the Syriac spirit.”<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/262-63.</i> They were unable to recognize “the true fulfillment of Jewry’s long cherished Messianic Hope”<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/246.</i> when it was granted to them in the person of Jesus. Thus Jewry went down to perdition."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.24","It is somewhat amusing to find that with all the accouterments of modern historic research Mr. Toynbee could not uncover more than the homely old Christian commonplace that Jewry was punished forever for its rejection of Jesus. Of course, being an eminently enlightened <i>post-Christian Christian</i>,<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">See, e.g., IX/635.</i> he will not say that Jewry was punished by a direct Act of God, as it were, to testify through its eternal wanderings to its own perfidy. Things do not happen that way in history. There are laws and there is a pattern, like the Nemesis of Creativity and the inevitable failure of Futurism. However, since Mr. Toynbee perceives “in History a vision of God’s creation on the move”<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">X/3.</i> there is not really much difference between an Act of God and the Laws of History, which are also of God—except that a Law is always more inexorable than an Act of Will. Whereas according to the old dispensation Jews “have wandered about, regarded as an accursed race, as an object of contempt to other peoples,”<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">Quoted in <i>The Foot of Pride</i> by Malcolm Hay, Beacon Press, Boston, 1950.</i> in the opinion of Mr. Toynbee they got entangled with the Laws of History and, as might be expected, were crushed completely and forever. The “accursed race” is still alive and there may be some hope for it; but of what is crushed by the mills of God, so ingeniously built into the workings of history, only “debris” or “pulverized social ash” remains.<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">II/286.</i> Judaism and Jewry look as if they were alive; actually they are the fossilized remnants “of the extinct Syriac Society in the particular phase of disintegration in which that Society happened to find itself at the moment when it was smitten by the impact of Hellenism in the fourth century” of the <small>C.E.</small><sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/126.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.25","For the sake of clarity, however, let us establish the fact that if the ultimate fall of Jewry consisted in the rejection of the “Jewish Messiah” who was offered to Jewry by the One True God, then what Mr. Toynbee says about Jewish Messianism being identical with Futurism is rather confusing. Since, in his own view, Jesus represented “the true fulfillment of Jewry’s long cherished Messianic Hope,” it is obvious that the true meaning of those hopes could not have meant merely the re-establishment of “the fallen national kingdom at some hidden future date.” Whatever Jewish Messianism be, on Mr. Toynbee’s own admission it is not what he says it is—a leap in the time-dimension toward a mundane Jewish national paradise. What he possibly has in mind when he discusses the nature of Jewish Messianism is not the proper philosophical or theological term, but the purely empirical idea. Mr. Toynbee assumes that the Jews of the Maccabean period understood by Messianism nothing but a mundane national restoration. This would then be the counterpart to Mr. Toynbee’s discovery of Maccabean Judaism; a “transformed” Jewish Messianism, eminently becoming to a “transformed” Judaism. What we shall have to ascertain is: Who did the transforming—Maccabean Jewry or Mr. Toynbee?"

"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.28","It would appear that between writing Volume V and Volume VI of his <i>Study</i>, Mr. Toynbee did some more thinking on the subject of Jewish Messianism and, to his great dismay, must have discovered that his interpretation of it as a mundane hope for a mundane national kingdom was not at all convincing."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.29","Just imagine what a mundane Messiah would have to accomplish. After the fall of their country, the Jews were dispersed over the world. The Messiah would have to lead them out of their world-wide exile and reunite them in their national kingdom. Unfortunately between the hope and its realization there stood the might of the Great King and, at a later date, that of the Caesars. It is fairly obvious that, since—according to the premise—the restoration was to be a purely mundane undertaking, the mundane world-powers of the day would also have had some say in the matter, which of course would have complicated things somewhat. The Jewish people were shattered and scattered; the two “puny, ephemeral principalities” that had once been their homeland were effectively incorporated as minor provinces—or parts of provinces—in a vast all-powerful universal state. What madness could have moved a completely fragmentized and impotent Jewry to expect to wrest their mundane liberation by mundane means from the mailed fist of omnipotent Empire? In terms of the mundane world, within which a mundane Jewish Messianism was supposed to operate, what Mr. Toynbee said on the subject must be deemed hopeless bunkum."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.30","However, a historian like Mr. Toynbee is never at a loss to save his theories by buttressing them with new ones. Jewry realized well enough that as long as the might of the Great King or of Caesar remained unimpaired they would have no chance of liberating themselves from the foreign yoke. Well, that was just too bad for a Cyrus, or a Titus, or a Hadrian; they would have to go. At first, one would try to use diplomacy; if it did not work, <i>nolens volens</i>, one would have to use force. Now, is this not most ingenious! Those old Jews were no fools; that is what Mr. Toynbee says. He recognizes that"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.31","… if the New David was effectively to reunite all Jewry under his rule—and what but this was his mission?—in an age, in which the living generation of Jews was scattered over the face of the Earth, then he must gird himself to acquire a dominion to which his forebears had never aspired in the highest flights of their ambition. He must wrest the sceptre of <i>world-empire</i> from the hands of its present holder and must make Jerusalem become tomorrow what Susa was today and what Babylon had been yesterday. In order to reunite the Jews he must now reign as King of Kings over Jews and Gentiles alike. And why, after all, should the coming champion of Jewry not attain this pinnacle of power and glory? In a world in which a Cyrus or Seleucus could rise and a Cambyses or Antiochus the Great could fall with the speed of lightning when it flickers between the Earth and the Firmament, why should not a Zerubbabel have as good a chance of world dominion as a Darius, or a Judas Maccabaeus as an Antiochus Epiphanes, or a Bar Kokaba as a Hadrian?”<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/120; see also footnote.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.32","Mr. Toynbee’s boldness of vision is at times breath-taking. However, should anyone doubt its basic soundness, let him turn to Volume V, pp. 412-19 of the <i>Study</i>, where in a philosophical dissertation our author himself has already proved that “the belief in the omnipotence of Chance … is apt to prevail in times of social disintegration.”"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.33","Having conceived the policy of world dominion, the Jews proceeded to implement it. There was, for instance, “Deutero-Isaiah,” who hailed Cyrus as the Lord’s anointed “in the wild hope that the Persian conqueror may be moved to bestow his world-empire upon the Jews!”<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/122, footnote 3. A fuller explanation of this point one finds in VI/130, footnote 3.</i> Then there were the short-lived successes of Zerubbabel and of the Maccabees, both having in common the purpose of providing “a nucleus for the Messianic Empire that was shortly to be expected.”<sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/121, footnote 2.</i> It was not until Jewry was completely crushed in the appalling insurrections against omnipotent Rome that in the final rebellion of Bar Kokba “the hope of a new mundane Jewish commonwealth was finally extinguished.”<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/123. It is good to have this reassurance. Otherwise one might have been inclined to believe that the Jewish aspiration for world dominion, unveiled by Mr. Toynbee, was the original form of the international Jewish conspiracy, which is the theme of the spurious <i>Protocol of the Elders of Zion</i>. Toynbee does not seem to consider the <i>Protocol</i> genuine; the Jewish hopes for world dominion were “finally extinguished, in the blood of the followers of Bar Kokaba” in the second century C.E.</i> It had taken the Jews from about 522 <small>B.C.E.</small> to 135 <small>C.E.</small> “to learn by an agonizing process of trial and error that Futurism simply would not work.”"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.34",<b>2.</b>
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.35","Having reached this point in our deliberations, we are now introduced to the rather startling revelation that in “the bankruptcy of Futurism the Jews made the further tremendous discovery of the existence of the Kingdom of God.”<sup>48</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/124-26.</i> In order to be able to follow Mr. Toynbee in his development of this theme, we must perform a deed of intellectual acrobatics and erase from our memory what we heard from our author about the development of Judaism as a Higher Religion. Did he not say that the “fable of Solomon’s Choice is a parable of the history of the Chosen People,” whose first concern was the search for the Kingdom of God, that the greatest achievement of that early Syriac civilization was its discovery of the particular conception of God which is common to Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam? Did he not declare that the first Syriac Time of Troubles, beginning with the Assyrian conquests and ending by the establishment of the Achaemenian Empire, was the period of Syriac creativity, in that during this period the prophets of Israel developed an “embryonic Higher Religion” into a mature one? Did Mr. Toynbee not maintain that monotheistic Judaism was “the positive and immense spiritual achievement of the Prophets of Israel and Judah?”<sup>49</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/224 and III/141.</i> All this must now be treated as if it had never been mentioned; that is how Mr. Toynbee himself treats in this part of his <i>Study</i> what he himself has thus far said about Judaism as a Higher Religion."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.36","Now, the period of creativity begins with the establishment of the Achaemenian Empire, which ushered in a time that was previously described as a phase of stagnation.<sup>50</sup><i class=""footnote"">III/141.</i> We are now asked to believe that the per-exilic prophets of Israel—Hosea, Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the other—had no inkling of the One True God. In their eyes “the victory of the Assyrians and Chaldeans over the prophets’ countrymen is the work of the victim’s own national god …”<sup>51</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/30.</i> Thus spoke that Teutonic scholar Eduard Meyer, whose work has now become Mr. Toynbee’s Holy Bible on Judaism. The purification of this parochial concept started only with the creation of the Achaemenian Empire in 525 <small>B.C.E.</small> In the law and order of the universal state of the Syriac civilization the petty subject people from the hills of Judea beheld for the first time the image of a <i>universal</i> law and a <i>universal</i> order; and behind it all they could not help perceiving the <i>likeness</i> of a universal ruler, namely that of the Achaemenian Great King. This new experience released a process of religious fermentation, and under “the influence of the Achaemenian Monarchy upon the Jewish conception of the God of Israel” Jewry was led toward the idea of a “Unique and Omnipotent God.”<sup>52</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/34-35. There is, of course, a problem posed by such an interpretation. There were other peoples beside the Jews who “shaped their conceptions of an Almighty God in the image of the Great King of a universal state.” Why then did “the god of the Achaemenian emperors’ insignificant Jewish subjects” become “the vehicle” for the revelation of the One True God to all mankind? Mr. Toynbee is especially perturbed by the fact that the tribal Jewish deity is provincial at home, impudent in exile, and altogether intolerant and jealous. The qualifications of “a barbaric and provincial Yahweh” would seem to be “so conspicuously inferior to those of so many of his unsuccessful competitors.” See VI/39-41. Mr. Toynbee believes that two of its qualities were responsible for the victory of the uncouth deity of the Jews. The Jews imagined their tribal god to be alive. It so happens that “God’s essence” for Man is “that He is a living god with whom a living human being can enter into a spiritual relation.” It is the most difficult divine attribute to discover and to grasp; only Jews were able to see and to equip with it their national divinity. Secondly, the very easy-going tolerance of the other divinities towards their competitors was their undoing. They were not ambitious enough; whereas the vulgar “devouring jealousness” of the Jewish god kept it in the race for “a monopoly of divinity.” He who pushes hardest gets farthest. But not even Mr. Toynbee can miss the fact that mankind has failed to grasp the unity of God “in a world in which the God of Israel has not been on the scene,” which seems to indicate that there may be something more in being nasty than “Sheer survival-value in a struggle for existence between competing divinities.” “Its transcendent value lies in the disconcerting fact that a divinity who is credited by his worshippers with this spirit of uncompromising self-assertion proves to be the only medium through which the profound and therefore elusive truth of the unity of God has been firmly grasped hitherto by human souls.” (See VI/49.) This is indeed disconcerting. There must be something wrong with the human soul or with the unity of God or—perhaps—with Mr. Toynbee himself who may not know what he is talking about. His idea of devouring provincial jealousy as the receptacle for the concept of a Universal Omnipotent and True God is childish. He does put his finger on something important when he mentions the divine quality of Being-alive. However, he does not seem to be surprised that the most hidden attribute of God, the most difficult to grasp, should have been understood by primitive Israelites alone and in relationship to a rather “barbarous” concept of a local divinity. Be that as it may—and we shall yet deal more fully with the qualities of Being-alive and Jealousness (see below)—one cannot help being somewhat amused by what has developed for Mr. Toynbee in relationship to his <i>Study</i>. One of its basic principles indicates that there is nothing unique about either Judaism or Jewry, as there is nothing unique about anything else in human history. Everything happens in accordance with the general “pattern” and the “laws” which Mr. Toynbee uncovers with such ingenuity But now he himself is compelled to concede that both the priceless treasure of a living Deity, without which religion in the Christian-Islamic-Judaic sense is inconceivable, and that “disconcerting” gadget of “a jealous god,” without which—as a matter of fact—the unity of God has never been grasped by human souls, have been lifted into the light of history by some semi-barbarous Israelites; and not even Mr. Toynbee can formulate a “law” to account for it. Here, at last, is something without parallel, something outside the natural course of events, the one and only exception of all history. And what a fateful irregularity! Since in Mr. Toynbee’s own opinion “Religion is the true end of man” (see VII/448) one cannot escape the conclusion that the entire purposeful destiny of the human race was entrusted into the hands of Israel. Lucky devil of an uncouth little parochial divinity, to have drawn the First (and only) Prize in the world’s history, where otherwise—on the testimony of Mr. Toynbee—there are no lotteries and nothing is left to chance!</i> But, although the vision of a universal ruler in human shape started off this phase of religious growth, by itself it would apparently not have been potent enough to bring about the culmination of the new development. As always, trouble was needed as a stimulus. This duly set in with the collapse of the Achaemenian universal state under the impetus of the conquests of Alexander the Great. This new Time of Troubles, by bringing about the final defeat of Futurism, is mainly responsible for the emergence of the Jewish faith in an omnipotent and righteous God."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.37","It was the “mundane situation,” not at all favorable to the Jews and continually deteriorating, which compelled Jewry to revise its concept of a protecting national divinity. After all, as we may still remember, the Jews “had set their hands to a task which was, <i>humanly speaking</i>, an impossible one; for, when they had failed to preserve their independence, how could they rationally hope to reconquer it—and, what is more, to supplant their own conquerors in the lordship of the World—by the strength of their own right arm?”<sup>53</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/124-6.</i> The question has, of course, already been answered once: they started out in their plans for world dominion with the “belief in the omnipotence of Chance.” One must therefore assume that the Jewish faith in Chance just helped Jewry to conceive the idea of world empire but, as might have been expected, was unable to survive the disappointments of the first Jewish defeats. At that point, one must again assume, the Jews could have done the very reasonable thing and given up their idiotic hankering after world conquest. Fortunately for them and the rest of mankind, being the “stiff-necked” people that they have always been, rather than give up the wild dream of empire they remembered their old god “from the uplands”—he must have lived in semi-retirement during the short sway of the goddess Chance—and began “the widening of the conception of the protecting divinity.” The Jewish ambition, having waxed world-embracing, proceeded to equip the tribal deity with sufficient power to guarantee world-wide fulfillment."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.38","To succeed in this tremendous undertaking they must have behind them a god who was not only competent to see fair play but was also capable of redressing a balance that, on any human reckoning, was hopelessly inclined against this god’s terrestrial protégés. If the protégés were engaged on a forlorn hope, then the protector must be nothing less than omnipotent—and it would follow from this that he must also be actively and whole-heartedly righteous; for only an all-powerful godhead who cared for righteousness above everything else would be both able and willing to exert himself with effect on behalf of a people whose cause was just but whose worldly position was insignificant.<sup>54</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.39","With one big leap from the parochial domain of “a barbarous” tribal deity, we have landed in the Kingdom of an omnipotent and righteous God or—rather—god. Actually, “Yahweh did not cease to be thought of as the parochial god of Jewry in a certain sense.” In view of “the mundane situation” it had to be an omnipotent and righteous “divinity who stood behind the devoted human leader of a futurist forlorn hope.” As Futurism fails, the human figure fades away, “while the divinity who has originally been called in aid merely in order to give supernatural power to the human elbow of ‘the Lord’s Anointed’ now comes to dominate the scene.” Thus, by bitter experience Jewry learns that “a human Messiah is not enough. God himself must condescend to play the part, which He alone can effectively play, of serving His people as their saviour and their king.”<sup>55</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.40","This, of course, is neither history nor theology but psychology: a psychological explanation of how the idea of an omnipotent Godhead developed in the minds of Jewry, which says nothing about the objective existence of the Godhead. Jewry formed the concept of a god in the image of its needs. Mr. Toynbee cannot overlook the fact that he has described the progress of escapism with which modern psychoanalysis is so familiar: an unhappy people that set itself an unattainable goal imposes the responsibility of action upon a whole series of substitutes. First it is a human champion; when he fails, he is fortified by the backing of an imaginary divinity; “and finally, when even the Lord’s Anointed breaks down, the fools in desperation signal S.O.S. to a wholly fictitious divine being whose alleged omnipotence is expected to make up for the proven impotence of his human inventors.” Mr. Toynbee believes that this may have been true of the militant Zealots and the pacifist Quietists among the Jews. The first were convinced that their God would take upon Himself the fulfillment of their “self-appointed mundane task,” whereas the latter refrained from all action in the faith that the realization of their mundane dream was God’s own concern. That was still Futurism. There were, however, two other answers—those of Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and of the Christian Church. The psychoanalytical diagnosis does not apply to them, since the very essence of their response was the surrendering of the foolish goal of Futurism, “a withdrawal of the <i>libido</i> from the previous mundane aim.” Surrendering the purpose of Futurism, they put their treasure “in a purpose which is not Man’s but God’s and which therefore can only be pursued in a spiritual field of supra-mundane dimensions.”<sup>56</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., 128.</i>"

"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.42","The intriguing aspect of this theory is that the concept of a god, which was originally a mere figment of escapism, turned out to correspond to the One True God of the Universe. The bankruptcy of Futurism was like the rending of the veil of the Temple, which revealed the reality of an Other World that was always present but unseen or unrecognized. Most surprising of all, however, is the revelation that only now is the One True God discovered in this “spiritual reorientation”—the discoverers being Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai on the one hand and the Christian Church on the other. In this psychological interpretation of Judaism, Mr. Toynbee proceeds as if David and Solomon, Elijah and Elisha, Hosea, Amos, Micah, Isaiah and Jeremiah, Hillel and the other prophets, teachers, leaders, and saints of Israel had never lived. It is obvious that our author has become the victim of his own fabrications. Having decided that Jewish Messianism wanted nothing but a mundane national kingdom, he could not suppress that very logical question, how—according to the Jews—such a task was to be accomplished. Having then answered, rather cleverly, that the only solution to the problem of Jewish political and military helplessness was Jewish world dominion, to be initiated with the propitious assistance of Omnipotent Chance, he was inevitably led on to the discovery of “the rake’s progress in escapism.” It was rather logical to expect—was it not?—that a people as broken and scattered as the Jews were, had it believed in the One True God, would have turned to Him for help in a contrite spirit and with a longing heart—exactly as described in Mr. Toynbee’s original version of Judaism, but now denied—rather than seeking their salvation in a mad mundane ambition for world conquest. One must therefore begin with a tribal deity, whose power is weakly, and rather narrowly, circumscribed, and call in the Goddess Chance to start escapism rolling by way of Futurism into the ante chamber of “the Kingdom.” Of course, there might have been no need for such an imaginative reconstruction of Judaism and Jewish history, had Mr. Toynbee assumed that Jewish Messianism was not quite so mundane, that the Maccabees—notwithstanding their numerous shortcomings—did not “transform” Judaism into a mere instrument of political struggle with world empires. His impressions of Judaism and Jewry might have been very much different, had he allowed the Jewish hopes for a return to Zion to be in some way related to a Jewish faith in the One God, had he granted them at least some “other worldly,” religious significance. But this is exactly what he cannot do—let go of the idea of a mundane Jewish Messianism. We shall have to understand why the concept is so dear to him."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.43","In the meantime, however, let us note the significance of this theory in its relationship to the first presentation of Judaism as a Higher Religion. Originally, the sense of sin played an important part in leading Jewry to the discovery of an “Other World of supra-mundane dimensions” and to a closer communion with the One True God; now,<sup>57</sup><i class=""footnote"">See above p. 3 and V/433.</i> on the contrary, it is a sense of self-righteousness, the conviction of the people that their “cause was just,” which produces the concept of an omnipotent and righteous God. Futurism, which meant desertion from the presence of God, now—of intrinsic escapist necessity—equips itself with a faith that brings Jewry much closer to the One God than they had ever been before. On this showing, one can no longer speak of a “Nemesis of Creativity,” upon which earlier Jewry’s downfall was blamed.<sup>58</sup><i class=""footnote"">See above p. 12 and IV/262. Toynbee does say (see VI/101) that at times Futurism is “allowed to transcend itself through rising into Transfiguration.” It remains however unexplained that, whereas in Vol. V Jewry finds God through a form of Transfiguration and loses Him later through Maccabean Futurism, in Vol. VI Jewry is led to God via Futurism, which ultimately transcends itself in Transfiguration. It is impossible for both these versions to be true.</i> On the contrary, one must now assume that there was a continuous growth from the post-exilic tribal deity to Futurism and, through Futurism, to Transfiguration in its rabbinical (represented by Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai!) and Judeo-Christian variations. Mr. Toynbee has now every reason to be grateful to the sin of Jewish Futurism. Without this Jewry would have submitted to its fate and would have certainly disappeared in the universal melting pots of the Achaemenian and Romano-Hellenic empires, like all its other contemporaries. There might never have occurred “the renting of the veil in the Temple,” and one would have to write a study of history regarding “the true end of man” from the standpoint of “a Syriac Mithras, an Egyptian Isis, a Hittite Cybele.”<sup>59</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/46.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.44","In the following pages, for the sake of brevity, we shall often refer to Toynbee’s first version of the full development of Judaism in the prophetic age as the “theological” one. The second version, in which the role of the prophets of Israel and Judah is completely ignored, and the motivating force of development is the Jewish escapism of the period from 525 <small>B.C.E.</small> to 70 <small>C.E.</small>, we shall call the “psychological” one."

"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.47","Parallel to the psychological version of Judaism we are also given an interpretation of Christianity, which seems to be required by the new understanding. In the sixth volume of the <i>Study</i>, one finds a very elaborate discussion of the points of difference between Judaism and Christianity as they became manifest in the personality of Jesus."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.48","Mr. Toynbee dwells on “the direct influence of the Hellenic motif” on the Christian presentation of the story of the birth of Jesus. Quoting from E. Meyer’s <i>Ursprung und Anfaenge des Christentums</i>, Mr. Toynbee underscores “the correspondence between Matthew and the legend of the birth of Plato,” which is “as exact as it could possibly be.” There are at least six Hellenic stories of the same nature on record, and if we “compare the birth-story of Jesus with that of Herakles, we shall find a still greater number of points of correspondence than Meyer has pointed out in his comparison of the birth-story of Jesus with that of Plato.” Mr. Toynbee insists that “to a Jewish mind the Christian attribution of a divine paternity to Jesus seems like a lapse from the slowly and painfully attained monotheism of the Chosen People of the One True God into one of the grossest and most unedifying superstitions of a Hellenic paganism.”"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.49","The other even more fundamental difference between Judaism and Christianity is that according to the Jewish view the Messianic King is a purely human being, “The Anointed of the Lord,” invested by Him with authority; whereas in Christian opinion he is God Incarnate, “the King of God’s Kingdom—and a King who is God Himself and not God’s less-than-divine deputy.”<sup>60</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/268-69 and footnotes; also, ibid. 163 and footnote.</i> And again Mr. Toynbee rightly points out that concepts of a god incarnate and of a dying god are quite well known to Hellenic and other forms of paganism but have no place whatsoever in Judaism. A Jewish reader is somewhat astounded by the amount of scholarship and literary energy that the author spends on proving something that is part of the A B C of Judaism, until the reader realizes that the laborious and long-winded discussion is addressed to Toynbee’s own fellow Christians, who—regrettably—overlook what is rather “notorious,” namely, that “the view that the Messiah has to be born of a virgin is … quite unknown to the Jews.” Mr. Toynbee is most anxious to impress upon them the influence of the pagan and—in particular—Hellenic motifs. The importance of these religious influences from paganism is underlined by the fact that in the figure of “Divus Augustus the potential converts of the first Christian missionaries had already acknowledged an incarnation of the Godhead in a living human being whose mortal mother was fabled to have been got with child by an immortal sire.…” Understandably, the happy coincidence of such preparation of souls must have rendered the task of the missionaries very much easier. Truly significant, however, is the use Mr. Toynbee makes of the Hellenic influence. He maintains that “the Christian evolutionist’s inference from this would be, not that there was no truth in Christianity, but that the truth which was in Christianity had already been aglow in paganism for ages before it had burst into a Christian plane.”<sup>61</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/458, 460.</i> In other words, the truth that is the very essence of the Christian message was known to the heathens in a less intense form even before the Christian epiphany, and there is a sort of evolutionary continuity between that message in its pagan manifestation and its fuller exposition in Christianity."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.50","We shall have no quarrel with Mr. Toynbee over his interpretation of Christianity. From the standpoint of our analysis of his ideas, however, we cannot help observing that “the direct influence of the Hellenic motif” is—in other passages—complemented by what may perhaps be called the indirect influence of Jesus’ Gentile descent. The “Messiah of Jewry,” says Mr. Toynbee, “comes out of that obscure village in ‘Galilee of the Gentiles’ ”; he is the “inspired Jewish scion of forcibly converted Galilean Gentiles”; or, as he is also referred to, he is Jewry’s “Galilean step-child.”<sup>62</sup><i class=""footnote"">II/73 and V/658.</i> In short, the truth of Jesus’ divine parentage was “aglow in paganism for ages” before its fuller revelation in the Christian garb, and the potential of his human parentage lay dormant, as it were, in the womb of Galilean Gentiledom for ages before its materialization in the Jewish frame. In order to grasp better the trend of the author’s thoughts, one must remember that Mr. Toynbee also maintains that as to the vital concept of the unity of mankind the source of “the human inspiration in the mind of Jesus” was the “Alexandrian vision” of that idea. The spirit of Alexander the Great was “in the air” in Palestine. This again is what one would expect to hear from Mr. Toynbee. The unity of mankind is the corollary to the fatherhood of God. Alexander did entertain that notion, but Jewry did not. After all, a God who is jealous and intolerant, who “never ceased to be thought of as the parochial god of Jewry,” who is Power and not Love, could not be expected to promote the idea of the brotherhood of men.<sup>63</sup><i class=""footnote"">Composed of VI/7 and 9; VII/511 and IX/623; VI/125. Far be it from us to argue with the distinguished Christian scholar about the source of the “human inspiration in Jesus.” If he asks us to believe that Jesus had no knowledge of Isaiah, Micah, Jeremiah, the Psalms, and a great body of the Jewish teaching of his time, containing innumerable variations on the Mosaic theme of “God of the spirits of all flesh,” we must assume that he has valid reason for doing so. It is, however, rather confusing that in Vol. VI it is the Alexandrine discovery of the brotherhood of men (or, since Alexander himself, like Ikhnaton about ten centuries before him, perhaps “learnt the mystery from the lips of Amon’s priests” [see VI/247, footnote] the Alexandrine vision of it), presupposing the fatherhood of God, that inspired Jesus; whereas in other places (e.g., IX/623) we are told that the brotherhood of men was “an original Christian belief … and this Christian belief … was a corollary of a Christian discovery—or revelation—of the fatherhood of God.” Toynbee seems to be no less uncertain about Christianity than he is about Judaism.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.51","It is true, Mr. Toynbee does not make Jesus a Galilean Aryan, as is customary in Teutonic theological “research”; but he has certainly de-judaized him thoroughly. It would seem that the only connection that “Jewry’s Messiah” has with Judaism is his complete break with it; and one may even wonder what could be meant by “the Galilean Jewish prophet whose message to his fellow men was the consummation of all previous Jewish experience.”<sup>64</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/658.</i> What that message seems now—i.e., in Volume VI—to consummate more than anything else is a great deal of pagan, Hellenic, and Alexandrine vision and experience. Mr. Toynbee wishes to make the point that, beside Judaism, the other “tributary” of Christianity was Hellenism; and he makes the point so successfully that his acknowledgment of “the immensity of this Jewish empire in the spiritual dimension,” neatly tucked away in an annex to Volume VI, sounds hollow, a mere hypocritical lip service to the traditional Christian belief “that the coming of Christ is the fulfillment of Scripture.”<sup>65</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/537.</i> His efforts to separate Christianity from Judaism are the logical consequences of his psychological version of the development of Judaism. The relationship between the two religions was, at first, according to the theological interpretation, indicated unequivocally. After the “transformation” of Judaism by Maccabean and Zealot Jewry, the Jewish religious genius took refuge among those segments of the internal proletariat of the Hellenic world that remained loyal to the spirit of the “untransformed” Judaism and, in bringing Christianity forth, gave a new expression to that spirit.<sup>66</sup><i class=""footnote"">See above p. 11 and V/126.</i> This did make sense as long as Judaism was described as a Higher Religion which in the creative travail of the prophets of Israel and Judah found its majestic manifestation as an ecumenical faith; it does not make sense in relation to a parochial religion, to which Judaism has now been reduced. A tribal deity who through the unexpected luck of a psychological aberration “widens” into an omnipotent and universal god, but who remains chained to its tribal past, is nothing much to be proud about; the separation of Christianity from such a Judaism becomes an intrinsic necessity."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.52",<b>2.</b>
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.53","Does Mr. Toynbee, by producing his psychological version of Judaism, mean to repudiate his original theological version? We have already seen that he is not perturbed by the inconsistency of his various theories as long as he can make each of them consistent within itself. He holds on to both of his versions of Judaism, just as we saw him hold on simultaneously to his contradictory interpretations of Maccabean history.<sup>67</sup><i class=""footnote"">See above p. 6.</i> His method of using mutually exclusive theories is strikingly illustrated by the final interpretation he places on the Maccabean guilt of Jewry and the significance he attaches to it."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.54","Discussing the various forms of “Encounters Between Civilizations,” Mr. Toynbee also surveys anti-Semitism. In this connection he deals with the persecution of Jewry by the Visigoths, who placed before them the choice of either accepting Christianity or banishment from the country. In this kind of persecution of the Jews he is able to discern “a hidden vein of tragic irony,” for—believe it or not—the first people in history to indulge in such a barbarous misuse of power against a minority were the Jews themselves. Says our author:"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.55","The earliest known instance of ‘bigotry’ [Toynbee’s play on the possible etymological derivation of the term from ‘Visigoth’!] is the compulsory conversion of the conquered Gentiles of Galilee to Judaism by their Maccabean Jewish conqueror Alexander Jannaeus<sup>68</sup><i class=""footnote"">It should be Aristobolus, who—having conquered the Itureans of a frontier district in North Galilee—converted them to Judaism. See Josephus, <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, XIII/11.</i> … and the Maccabean temper was inherited by Christendom from a Jewry that came to be the principal victim of this Jewish vein in the Christian religion. Jewish “Maccabeanism” was not, of course, the sole source of Christian “Antisemitism” … but the combination of a fanatical religious intolerance with an antipathy arising from social and economic grievances was an aggravation of pre-Christian “Antisemitism” into which Christianity was betrayed by the Judaic, not the Hellenic, element in its ethos.<sup>69</sup><i class=""footnote"">VIII/279, footnote.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.56","Having recovered from the first impact of the Toynbean sledge hammer, a Jew is grateful to find that the “Judaic” responsibility for the crimes of Christian anti-Semitism is not really meant to be as grievous as he at first gathered. Mr. Toynbee does concede that the “Jewish vein in the Christian religion” is not the only possible cause of anti-Semitism. As is well known, there was anti-Semitism in the Hellenic world,—a fact dramatically exemplified by the persecutions and pogroms in Alexandria at the time of Philo. Undoubtedly, it could not have originated from a non-existent “Judaic element” in the Hellenic ethos. What Mr. Toynbee wishes to explain is the specific Christian anti-Semitism, which—as he well realizes—has been so much more sordid and inhuman than the pre-Christian anti-Semitism of the heathens. On this he maintains that the Christian form of anti-Semitism is an aggravation of the anti-Semitic infection, which was already acute when Christianity first appeared on the scene and which—one guesses—Christianity “inherited” from its Hellenic “tributary”. In other words, if, for the sake of clarity, one wished to express it in the form of an equation, one would have to say: Christian Anti-Semitism = Pre-Christian, Hellenic Anti-Semitism + An Aggravation. However, An Aggravation = A Fanatical Religious Intolerance (alias Maccabean Temper) + An Antipathy. Therefore one might also say: Christian Anti-Semitism = Hellenic Anti-Semitism + Maccabean Temper + An Antipathy. For the Hellenic component no doubt only the Hellenic element in the Christian ethos can be blamed; for the Maccabean temper the blame is placed on the Judaic element; to whom the “antipathy arising from social and economic grievances” is to be charged is not stated. The Christian element in the Christian ethos bears no responsibility whatever; one can only guess that, being outmatched by a majority of at least two to one, its effectiveness is neutralized. Bearing in mind the feats of Hellenic anti-Semitism and pondering over the potentialities for persecution that are extant in an antipathy of the kind here described, it is rather difficult to put out of one’s mind the thought that had there never been a Maccabean temper for Christendom to inherit the story of Christian Anti-semitism would still be a far more “sordid tale” than that of the pre-Christian brand."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.57","Let us now analyze Mr. Toynbee’s reasoning about the boomerang action of the “Judaic element” in the Christian ethos. He does not suggest that the Visigoths merely imitated the religious intolerance of the Maccabees. It is unlikely that they knew much about the religious policy of the one or two petty “Maccabean” (i.e. Hasmonean) princes in question, which found some vague recording in a few words of the Jewish historian Josephus. It would indeed be silly to suggest that one or two obscure incidents of Hasmonean history could have inspired with a barbarous fanaticism the Visigoths of the Iberian peninsula to enact the same kind of policy seven or eight centuries later. What Mr. Toynbee suggests is that the Maccabean temper became a constituent part of Christianity—“this Jewish vein in the Christian religion.” But by itself such a pronouncement is hardly convincing. A religion, we assume, is a set of dogmas, beliefs, and values, which is consciously embraced; a temper, on the other hand, is a not-very-pleasant propensity of human nature. How on earth can a temper be so “inherited” that it becomes the constituent part of a religion! And so, as if to smooth out the wrinkles on a reader’s forehead, in the next sentence Mr. Toynbee paraphrases “the Maccabean temper” by “Maccabeanism.” An “ism” is much more dignified than a mere temper; an “ism” has an ideology. Since, however, “Maccabeanism” is—in the same sentence—supplanted by “a fanatical religious intolerance,” which is like a reversion to the Maccabean temper, one must assume that both the temper and the intolerance are an “ism” because they represent a consciously adopted attitude which was suggested by a principle of Judaism. This then is the “Judaic element” in the Christian ethos: not a mere temper, nor just intolerance, but part of an ideology. Something of the very ethos of Judaism got into Christianity and rebounded against the Jews. And so we have rediscovered our old friend, “the violent ethos of Maccabean Judaism.”<sup>70</sup><i class=""footnote"">See above p. 8-9 and V/175.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.58","It is nevertheless unusual for an experienced author like Mr. Toynbee to use the term “temper” as if it were an ideology, and to use the subjective emotional disturbance of fanatical intolerance to indicate an ethos. Nor does he do it unintentionally. He needs both the Maccabean temper and the Maccabean “ism.” The two terms are purposefully left vague and made to mean practically the same thing. Going out to prove what he wants to prove, Mr. Toynbee is in a quandary. Did he not say that, when the Maccabees “transformed” the Judaism of the prophetic age into a political instrument to be used for a mundane purpose and thus effected “the unfortunate change of ethos” in Judaism from gentleness to militancy, the religious genius of the Judaism of gentleness found its new expression in the Christian garb? Did he not also declare that, as the result of that event, the violent ethos of Maccabean Judaism was <i>the antithesis</i> to the gentle ethos of Christianity?<sup>71</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/175 and 126-27; and 126, footnote 5.</i> All this, of course, means that there is no connection whatever between “Maccabeanism” and Christianity, and that the Judaic element in the Christian ethos is inherited from the classical Judaism of the way of gentleness, which was repudiated by “Maccabeanism.” Yet, at the same time, we remember that there was another version of the Maccabean misdeeds. According to this, the Maccabees were not engaged in a petty mundane enterprise and did not “transform” Judaism into a political weapon. On the contrary, inspired by zeal for the religion of their fathers, they conceived “a policy of religious conversion by political force.” Obviously, only this version of the Maccabean policy may be dubbed “bigotry” and compared to the religious policies of the Visigoths. This version may yield a Maccabean <i>lapse</i> from Judaism into militancy, a Maccabean sin or temper, but no new Maccabean Judaism with a changed ethos.<sup>72</sup><i class=""footnote"">See above p. 11.</i> The Judaism of the Maccabees with a temper of religious intolerance is the same Judaism of gentleness that was taken over by Christianity."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.59","This then is the dilemma: The mundane Maccabean “ism” has an ethos of violence but, far from being a Judaic element in Christianity, it is its antithesis; the Maccabean temper of the “religious” version does have some contact with Christendom, both having the same Judaism of the prophetic age for their religious background, but it provides no Judaic element of violence for the ethos of Christianity. Mr. Toynbee is not overwhelmed by logical difficulties of this kind. He lets the event of the conversion of some Gentiles by the Maccabees fulfill a double function. Its religious interpretation gave us the “Maccabean temper”; from the mundane one followed the Maccabean “ism.” Though they are exclusive of each other, they are put to work together. What one cannot do, will be accomplished by the other. All that is needed is vagueness and ambiguity—and the boomerang effect of the Maccabean policy will sound plausible. The recipe is ingenious: Take Maccabean temper, Maccabeanism, a fanatic religious intolerance, the Judaic element in the Christian ethos, and by a continuous interchange of these terms giddy the reasoning faculty of the reader—and you will get the betrayal of Christianity into Christian anti-Semitism by the “Judaic element” in the Christian ethos.<sup>73</sup><i class=""footnote"">If it were not so depressing to witness in this “mid-twentieth Christian century” so much literary ingenuity spent on such an unworthy cause, one could only be amused by the way the true nature of the Toynbean reasoning does break through the camouflage of ambiguity. Having declared that the Maccabean temper or Maccabeanism, as “a vein in the Christian religion,” recoiled upon Jewry in anti-Semitism, Mr. Toynbee—as we saw—hastened to add that “Maccabeanism” (i.e., the Maccabean temper) was not the sole reason. But a “fanatical religious intolerance” combined with a socially and economically conditioned antipathy to become an “aggravation” of an already existent anti-Semitism. But it was—and this is the “tragic irony”—by the Judaic element in its ethos that Christianity was betrayed. Since, however, a “fanatical religious intolerance” is the same as “Maccabeanism” or the Maccabean temper, which, having been inherited by Christendom, became “this Jewish vein in the Christian religion”; and since the “Judaic element” in the Christian ethos is identical with “Maccabeanism” or with “a fanatical religious intolerance” or the Maccabean temper—then what Mr. Toynbee says about the tragic irony of Christian anti-Semitism may also be paraphrased in this manner: “Maccabeanism” is not the only reason for Christian anti-Semitism, but the combination of this Maccabean “vein in the Christian religion” with “an antipathy” was an aggravation of pre-Christian anti-Semitism into which Christianity was betrayed by the Maccabean, not the Hellenic, vein in its ethos. What Mr. Toynbee actually says is that “the aggravation,” which was the result of the combination of the Maccabean vein in Christianity with “an antipathy,” was caused by the “Maccabean vein in Christianity.” It is as logical as to say that it is because of A that A + B is C. It is, of course, nonsense; but it is the acme of Mr. Toynbee’s ingenious method of holding on to contradictory interpretations of Judaism. At first, with the help of the Maccabean “ism,” he smuggles the Maccabean temper into Christianity, as a “vein” in that religion, as a Judaic element in it. Having thus safely lodged the “Judaic element” in Christianity, he reverts to the proper literary and logical difference between a “temper” in people and an “element” in a religion. To enhance ambiguity, he replaces “the Maccabean temper” (alias Maccabean “vein” alias “Judaic element”) by a “fanatical religious intolerance”; and thus the statement that the “Judaic element” (alias Maccabean “vein,” alias Maccabean temper) was responsible for the combination of “a fanatical religious intolerance” with “an antipathy” can be made to sound plausible.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.60",<b>3.</b>
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.61","Notwithstanding his sophistry, one cannot help having some sympathy with Mr. Toynbee. Having extolled the towering superiority of the essentially new Christian departure as compared with Judaism, he is badly let down by the Christian performance in history in general, and not only in the specific case of anti-Semitism. He cannot overlook the intolerance and the violence with which the religion of gentleness and love treated other religions and philosophies of life or Christian deviations from orthodoxy and the officially approved religious dogma or belief. According to Mr. Toynbee the evidence of history is so condemning that he does not hesitate to declare: “There has been no religion in which this fanaticism—this persecution of all heterodox opinions without regard for the consequences and without shrinking from any crime—has been, and remained, so dominant as it has been in Christianity in all its manifestations.”<sup>74</sup><i class=""footnote"">VII/438, footnote 2.</i> This, of course, requires an explanation, and Mr. Toynbee finds it in the unpleasantly close association between Judaism and Christianity. For reasons of exigency, it appears, Christianity, after having taken “a decisive new departure from Judaism,” readmitted “the incongruous Israelitish concept and service of ‘the Jealous God’ Yahweh.”<sup>75</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., 431.</i> It is thence that intolerance and religious fanaticism entered the body of Christendom."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.62","Once again the Toynbean method of ignoring logical inconsistencies and contradictions is apparent. One might wonder what could be meant by the <i>readmission</i> of the incongruous Israelitish service of the Jealous God. According to his theological version of Judaism, the pre-exilic prophets of Israel and Judah had overcome the earlier tribal concepts and found the way of gentleness and Transfiguration. Christianity had no contact with “the Israelitish Jealous God,” in the Toynbean sense of the term. That concept was abrogated by Judaism about eight or nine centuries before Christianity came into being, and about twelve centuries before its “readmission” into Christianity—with the beginning of Christian intolerance—is supposed to have occurred. Mr. Toynbee’s psychological version of Judaism alone brings the intolerant and jealous god right to the doorstep of Christianity. On that basis, however, although there is proximity in time there is hardly any association in spirit. As we have heard, Jewry never really got beyond the concept of the tribal deity, “widened” by psychological escapism. It was only the Christian Church, on the one hand, and Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, on the other—but also in the “Christian” manner—which by way of Transfiguration discovered the One True God. Seen in this light, Christianity was regarded as a radically new departure from the Judaism of the Jealous God, inheriting from it nothing more than the bankruptcy of Futurism. Christianity was no kindred religion of that Judaism, and Judaism was no component part of it."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.63","The dilemma does not disturb Mr. Toynbee; he mixes his frames of reference without a qualm. The theological version of Judaism proved that the Jewish religious genius took refuge in Christianity; the psychological version proved that the Israelitish tribal deity was fanatically intolerant. It is true that the Jewish religious genius, absorbed by Christianity, is the genius of the ethos of gentleness, and that the intolerant tribal deity has no connection whatever with Christianity; nevertheless, if we pretend that the words “Jewish,” “Judaism,” and “Israelitish” are always used with the same meaning and that the two versions of “Judaic” development are not what they really are—namely, a contradiction—we do get the “conclusion” that the world-wide Christian intolerance that mars Western history is due to the <i>readmission</i> of the “Israelitish concept and service of the Jealous God.”"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, Judaism As a Higher Religion and the Lapse Into Militancy.64","We may now understand why Mr. Toynbee, having built up such a powerful case for the separation of Christianity from Judaism, nevertheless retains the association between them that derives from his earlier, theological interpretation of Judaism. In truth, Christianity is a “decisive new departure” in all essential teachings and dogmas. But it is useful not to renounce the traditionally assumed contact with Judaism; that contact enables one to exculpate the religion of love for its crimes of fanaticism and intolerance by blaming them on the readmission of barbarous Judaic concepts. The ambiguities of style, the literary trickery, and the confusion of the frames of reference give us still another version of Judaism, under which it may be considered Christianity’s “original sin.” There seems to be no escape from the power of that original sin. It is responsible not only for Christian fanaticism, but even for the intolerance of the “neo-pagan” Western secular enlightenment. This is because “a post-Christian Western rationalism … inherited from Christianity a Judaic fanaticism and intolerance in its feelings and its conduct towards its adversaries.”<sup>76</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., 474, footnote 1, and VIII/406.<br>CHAPTER II</i> Thus Christian religious and post-Christian secular fanaticism and persecutions both originate from the Judaic element introduced into the West by Christianity. Thus, Mr. Toynbee provides the “scholarly” backing for what the Nazis knew instinctively, namely, that “the Jews are our misfortune.” If only Christianity had been more careful with whom it kept company in its early youth!"

"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.2","Fortunately, there is no need to deal at length with Mr. Toynbee’s psychological version of the development of Judaism from the tribal-religion stage.

Anyone who does so cannot expect to be treated seriously as a scholar.

"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.27","In order to appreciate the vileness of the Toynbean distortion of “Deutero-Isaiah,” one must read, against the background of these quotations from only one chapter of the prophet, Mr. Toynbee’s interpretation of the introductory verses in the same chapter. According to him that is what the prophet hoped for:"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.28","The mundane kingdom which is included in “Deutero-Isaiah’s” Kingdom of God is imagined as an Achaemenian Empire in which Cyrus has taken Zion instead of Susa for his capital and the Jews instead of the Persians for his ruling race, because the God of Israel has revealed to him that it is he (<i>and, by implication, not Ahuramazda</i><sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">Our italics.</i>) who has enabled Cyrus to conquer the World. In this day-dream “Deutero-Isaiah” is exposing himself with a vengeance, to the censure of our imaginary psycho-analyst.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">See above p. 21 the censure of escapism and VI/127.</i> He is conscripting Yahweh to inspire Cyrus to turn the feats of Persian arms to the benefit of the Jews in order that the latter may be compensated for their inability to preserve the independence of their own petty principality of Judah by being invested with the lordship of a universal state! Jewry’s thirst to gain a new mundane kingdom was so deep that the Jewish prophet was prepared to recognize the Gentile as “the Lord’s Anointed” if that would secure the fulfilment of these Jewish hopes.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/130, footnote 3. Toynbee identifies the “Lord’s Anointed” with the Messiah. But nowhere in the Jewish Bible does the term have the meaning of “Redeemer.” It is always priests and Kings of Judah and Israel that are meant; the anointed ones alone are consecrated for office. In the Psalms (see 105/15), the term occurs in the plural. The only exception is, perhaps the mysterious passage in Daniel 9/25, where the use of the term is not at all clear. At the same time, the “Lord’s Anointed” is not found anywhere in the Messianic passages of the Jewish Bible. The term Messiah, does derive from the Hebrew for the “Lord’s Anointed”; it does mean “the anointed one.” But it received its specific technical significance of “Redeemer” in post-Biblical times. See, e.g., <i>Hasting’s Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics</i>. The “Lord’s Anointed” in connection with Cyrus indicates that the authority of Cyrus kingship is to be considered as if he had been consecrated for office; he is king by the Grace of God. That such dignity is conceded to a Gentile is in itself a manifestation of the prophet’s universalism and in keeping with the other, more significant, aspects of his teaching.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.29","As if this were not clear enough, Mr. Toynbee paraphrases the opening words of the same chapter in the following manner:"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.30","Thus saith the Lord to his Anointed, to Cyrus (or Zerubbabel or Simon Maccabaeus or Simon bar Kokaba or whatever may be the name of the hero of the hour), whose right hand I have holden to subdue nations before him …<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., 155.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.31","The truth of course is—and it is certainly not hidden from Mr. Toynbee—that, as we have seen, in this chapter of the Book of Isaiah the basic Jewish concepts of a universal ethical monotheism find clear expression. There is the Lord God, creator and sustainer of the Universe, whose word is righteousness and who alone is savior of all mankind, in whom alone Israel seeks its justification.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">These concepts are, as anyone fairly familiar with the Bible of Israel may recall, no original discoveries of “Deutero-Isaiah.” There are innumerable parallel passages in the books of Moses and of the Prophets, as well as in the other Writings. It is true that the Universal Creator and Savior is also referred to as “the God of Israel”; the phrase has been the stumbling block of Christian theologians through the ages. The context, in which they occur, proves, as in the case of “Deutero-Isaiah,” that no tribal deity is meant. The “God of Israel” does not mean of Israel alone. See below ch. III, sect. 2 for a Jewish interpretation of the term.</i> Cyrus is an instrument in the hand of God, just as the Assyrian conqueror was so designated by Isaiah.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">Isaiah X/5.</i> It is the well-known concept of the prophets that God intervenes in the history of the nations by raising and using world-conquerors to do His bidding in the world at large. What is expected of Cyrus is not Toynbee’s idiotic idea of surrendering world dominion to the Jews, but an act of charity toward captive Judah, as it is stated unequivocally in the context: “He shall build My city, and he shall let Mine exiles go free, not for price nor reward….” It is the age-old plea of “Let my people go.” The conquest of the nations and the spoliation of their treasures are the due of the world-conqueror Cyrus, as it was that of Nebuchadnezzar. As for the Jews, they seek their “justification and glory” in the Lord, who alone is “a just God and a Saviour and besides whom there is none.”"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.32","Nothing more clearly shows Mr. Toynbee’s intellectual dishonesty than his misrepresentation of “Deutero-Isaiah,” the prophet who created the immortal figure of “the Suffering Servant of the Lord.”<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., LIII.</i> In Christian belief and theology “Deutero-Isaiah” is the cornerstone of the prophetic testimony for the mission of Jesus. It is from the eternally living words of this Jewish prophet that Mr. Toynbee himself quotes in order to describe most adequately his own idea of the savior.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/277-78.</i> In a sense, it would be even true to say that the prophet’s “Suffering Servant” is the key to the understanding of Mr. Toynbee’s <i>Study</i>. Nevertheless, when our author tries to determine the place of the same “Deutero-Isaiah” in Judaism and Jewish history, he calls him “a day-dreamer” who exposed himself “with a vengeance to the censure” of a psychoanalyst. One cannot help wondering what becomes of the christological testimony and Mr. Toynbee’s own savior, if a few sessions with a psychoanalyst might have been enough to cure “Deutero-Isaiah” of his “escapism.” Is “Deutero-Isaiah” a day-dreaming, anxiety-ridden neurotic only when he testifies against Mr. Toynbee’s pet theories? Does he become a divinely inspired witness and prophet only when he appears to fit into the Toynbean universe?"

"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.34","Since Mr. Toynbee’s psychological version of Judaic development has no basis either in theology or in history, we shall discuss his interpretations of the Maccabean and Zealot attitudes as described by him on the basis of the premises of his theological version of Judaism."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.35","As already stated, the Maccabees were no creators in the realm of Judaism. Whether their policies were right or wrong, there never existed a “Maccabean Judaism” or a Maccabean “Church Militant.” What Mr. Toynbee is unable to understand is that Judaism has been embodied not in a church but in a people. In the history of a people, constituted by a religion, the mundane and religious elements cannot be neatly separated from each other. In the Maccabean wars, political freedom was the precondition of religious freedom. In view of the oppressive legislation of Antiochus Epiphanes, which forbade the practice of Judaism under penalty of death, Jews—if they wanted to remain Jews—had to be free. The military and political struggle subserved the religious purpose. That is the only conclusion one may draw from the records available. The Maccabees fought for liberty, imbued by the conviction, as Judah Maccabee put it, that as liberty “is a thing of itself agreeable to all men, so it proves to be to us much more desirable, by its affording us the liberty of worshipping God.”<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">Josephus, <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, XII/7-3.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.36","Although with the Maccabees the religious motivation was more pronounced, probably with the Zealots under the Roman Empire the goal of national liberty was more in the foreground. But even with them it is hardly possible to separate the mundane plane of life from the religious. Describing the philosophy of the various sects among the Jews, Josephus says of the Zealots: “These men agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions; but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say, that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord.”<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., XVIII/1-6.</i> The thought that a servant of God calls no man his lord is deeply religious, and it is unlikely that either the Maccabees or the Zealots ever associated the idea of liberty with a “mundane” meaning, as Toynbee wants it."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.37","The Maccabean and Zealot wars had one important feature in common: they were provoked by insults to the basic religious convictions of Jewry and inspired by the threat to their spiritual survival. The Seleucid era in Judea began after the battle of Gaza. As early as 312 <small>B.C.E.</small> Jewry became the subject people of the Hellenized kingdom of Syria, but they never rebelled as long as there was no interference with their religious and spiritual life. About 150 years after the loss of political freedom to the Seleucids, the Maccabean revolt started when—by the order of Antiochus Epiphanes—an “abomination of desolation” was set up in the Temple of Jerusalem and the practice of Judaism was forbidden in all the land. The situation was rather similar at the time of the last Jewish rebellions against the yoke of the Roman Empire about three centuries later. The revolt of Bar Kokba broke out when Hadrian on the ruins of Jerusalem established his own city of Aelia Capitolina and on the place of the Temple of the One True God erected a temple of Jupiter.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">Dio Cassius, <i>Roman History</i>, LXIX, 12; quoted by Dubnow, <i>Weltgeschichte des Jüd. Volkes</i>, III/55.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.38","Even though the threat to Judaism was not as obvious at the moment of the actual beginning of the Zealot war with Rome, it was deeply embedded in the real causes of that insurrection too. The same generation of Jews that was driven, by the barbarity of the brigand procurators of the type of Antonius Felix and Gessius Florus,<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">Josephus gives us a vivid description of the last of the Roman procurators, Gessius Florus (64-66): “… Gessius Florus, as though he had been sent on purpose to show his crimes to everybody, made a pompous ostentation of them to our nation, as never omitting any sort of violence, nor any unjust sort of punishment; for he was not moved by pity and never was satisfied with any degree of gain that came in his way; nor had he any more regard to great than to small acquisitions, but became a partner with the robbers themselves. For a great many fell then into that practice without fear, as having him for their security, and depending on him, that he would save them harmless in their particular robberies …” <i>Antiquities</i>, XX/11-1. Of Antonius Felix, a predecessor of Florus by four years (52-60), Tacitus says in his <i>History</i> (V/8-9): “… Antonius Felix, indulging in every kind of barbarity and lust, exercised the power of a king in the spirit of a slave.” At the end of his remarks about Felix, Tacitus continues with the significant statement: “Yet the <i>endurance</i> of the Jews lasted till Gessius Florus was procurator. In his time the war broke out.” In order to appreciate the kind of objectivity that distinguishes the historian Toynbee one has to compare what he has to say about the conduct of Rome in Judea with this testimony of the Roman historian, who—as is well known—was far from partial to the Jews. Whereas Tacitus acknowledges the vileness of the Roman provocation and recognizes the high degree of Jewish endurance and restraint, in a number of passages Mr. Toynbee is quite annoyed with the noble Romans who showed so much moderation towards the Jews (e.g., VI/201) and maintains that “the Romans, in their dealings with the Jews, exercised almost <i>super-human self-restraint</i> before the Zealots forced their hand …” in 66 C.E. and finally in 132. (VII/112) Tacitus is of course not unknown to Mr. Toynbee, but his testimony must be ignored for it provides no confirmation whatever for “the satanic emeute of the Jewish Zealots.”</i> to the revolt of despair, had still fresh in its memory two significant incidents that very nearly anticipated the Zealot war by twenty-five or thirty-five years. They still recalled the calculated insult to their religious faith by Pontius Pilate, who—breaking with established custom—displayed in Jerusalem the Roman military standards bearing the effigies of Caesar, which he removed only as the result of the determined resistance of the entire people. When, several years after Pilate’s procuratorship, the emperor Caligula insisted that his statue be set up in the Temple of Jerusalem and granted divine honors, the challenge to the survival of Judaism was no less serious than at the time of Antiochus Epiphanes. Only the death of Caligula (41 <small>C.E.</small>) averted, temporarily, the catastrophe that finally culminated in 66-69 <small>C.E.</small>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.39","Mr. Toynbee makes light of these manifestations of the faith-inspired resistance of Jewry during the Maccabean and Zealot wars. He does not mention them when he builds his theory of the “transformation” of Judaism in a political instrument in a mundane struggle. He refers to them under the incongruous heading. “The Utility of a Monetary Currency as a Medium for Governmental Propaganda.” Having mentioned the indignation of the Jews at the placing of the statue of the Olympian Zeus in the Holy of Holies of the Temple of Jerusalem, which did not allow them “to rest until they had thrown off every vestige of Seleucid rule”; and having also noted the vehement reaction to Pontius Pilate’s smuggling of the Roman military standards into Jerusalem under the cover of darkness, Toynbee continues: “Yet in their holy land the Jews had schooled themselves meekly, not only to seeing, but to handling, using, earning, hoarding, and by all these compromising actions progressively countenancing, the abominable image on Caesar’s coinage, and had thereby anticipated in action the observation of their future Roman chastiser Vespasian that sordid money does not smell.” In order to catch a good glimpse of the Toynbean mentality, one should read this passage from the <i>Study</i><sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">VII/314-15. The reference is to the following passage from Suetonius. <i>The Lives of the Twelve Caesars</i> (quoted here after the Modern Library edition, p. 335): “When Titus found fault with him for contriving a tax upon public toilets, he held a piece of money from the first payment to his son’s nose, asking whether its odor was offensive to him. When Titus said ‘No,’ he replied, ‘Yet it comes from urine’.” Mr. Toynbee obviously has a delicate sense of humor, for which the late Julius Streicher, gauleiter of Bavaria and editor of the <i>Stuermer</i> might well have envied him. Strangely enough, his sense of humor deserts him when, only a few pages further on (ibid., 339), he describes the same kind of “Jewish” attitude adopted by the primitive Christians toward the worship of Caesar. They refused to serve in the Roman army, though not for long, because they objected, among other things, to “the worship of the Emperor’s genius and offer of sacrifice to it, and the veneration of military standards as idols.” One wonders what the primitive Christians used for money: or, since they did not school themselves to <i>seeing, handling, using, earning, hoarding</i> it—which, as is well known only Jews would do—did they perhaps overlook the fact that the image, as abominable to them as to the Jews, was on Caesar’s coin?</i> together with what a Prussian historian has to say on the same subject. In an essay on the “Ghetto and Jews of Rome,” Ferdinand Gregorovius makes the following observation:"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.40","Caligula had special grounds for his bitterness against the Jews. He had conceived the idea of having a colossal statue of himself in the character of a god set up in the Holy of Holies of the Temple at Jerusalem, for he had learned that the Jewish people alone among the nations of the earth had refused to grant him divine honors. He issued orders to Petronius, the governor of Phoenicia, to have the statue set up. Thereupon, as Josephus and Philo relate, all Judea, men, women, children, and the aged, betook themselves to Phoenicia. They covered the country like a cloud, and so loud was their lament that even when it ceased its echoes reverberated through the air. They threw themselves upon their knees before Petronius and adjured him to slay them all, weaponless as they were: they would never suffer the sanctuary of God to be desecrated. The scene represents one of the most magnificent tragedies a people has ever experienced, and the moral resistance they offered to Caligula is one of the most admirable episodes in the history of the Jewish people, shedding more glory upon them than the greatest achievements of David and Solomon.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">The essay is found in Gregorovius’ <i>Wanderjahre in Italien;</i> it was written in 1853. An English translation of the essay alone was published by Schocken Books, New York, in 1948. Our quotation is from that edition, page 31; italics ours.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.41","This episode, which so deeply impressed a Petronius that he implored Caligula to rescind his order and in which the Prussian historian admires the magnificent tragedy of moral resistance, moves Mr. Toynbee only to a scurrilous anti-Semitic joke. Our main concern is, however, with his falsification of history in this connection. He asserts that the reason for the toleration of Judaism as compared with the persecution of Christianity under Nero and his successors was that the Christians refused “to accept the Government’s claim that it was entitled to compel its subjects to act against their consciences.” Similarly, he maintains that the subjects and peoples of the Hellenic universal state, out of a sense of gratitude for peace and unity, “without much heart searchings” acquiesced in the deification of the Caesars; it was only with the advent of Christianity that the concept was challenged.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/648 and VI/201-02.</i> The truth is, as we have seen, that it was the Jewish people of the Seleucid and Roman empires who alone among all the nations refused to accept any dictation to their conscience and resisted any suggestion of Caesaro-worship. This was the common religious inspiration of the Maccabean and Zealot periods in Jewish history, whether the fight against the oppressor of their conscience was conducted with or without weapons. The primitive Christians were following the Jewish example.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">Even Toynbee cannot help acknowledging this, at least by implication, when (in a footnote, VI/181-2,3) he mentions Philo’s magnificent tribute to Augustus. There he says: “Yet this Jewish enthusiast for Augustus and his work would have rejected as a shocking blasphemy any suggestion that he should express his gratitude towards a human saviour by paying him those divine honours that, in Philo’s belief, were payable exclusively to the One True God.”</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.42","Since, contrary to all proof, Mr. Toynbee tenaciously clings to his “mundane” version of the Maccabean wars, he does not understand the nature of the Maccabean accomplishment. It is true that if the Maccabees had been concerned with the restoration of a “mundane” national kingdom, their success would have been short-lived and effaced by the final defeat at the hands of the Romans. As it was, the Maccabean victories brought about the defeat of Antiochus Epiphanes and, through it, the defeat of the Hellenic temptation for the Jewish soul. The Maccabees conquered Jewry for Judaism and, without them, it is doubtful whether Christianity would even have had a chance to be born. Because the Maccabean victory was essentially accomplished within the Jewish soul, the material conquest of Zealot Jewry by Rome on the battlefield could not undo the Maccabean achievement. Mr. Toynbee is perfectly right in his condemnation of the forcible conversion of some Gentiles by one or two of the Hasmonean princes. It might have helped him to understand the significance of that episode for Jewry and Judaism, had he followed the method of Jewish historians and distinguished the Maccabean period from the Hasmonean. The Maccabees were <i>the people</i> under the leadership of a family that emerged from the midst of the people; the Hasmoneans were a dynasty that became more and more estranged from the people and their recognized leaders, the Pharisees. Imitating the petty potentates around them, they degenerated at times into a tyranny. For instance, Alexander Jannai—the only Hasmonean whom Mr. Toynbee mentions by name—was probably more ruthless in his long civil wars, fought with foreign mercenaries against his own people, than in his foreign wars against neighboring Gentile nations. The religious conversions undertaken by some Hasmoneans were dictated by their personal dynastic policies; they occurred in two dangerous frontier districts for the purpose of military safety. To see in these Hasmonean princes representatives of Judaism, and in their policies the manifestation of Jewish religious intolerance, is about as justified as, for example, to see Henry VIII as a paragon of Christianity, and his marital affairs as a change in the Christian ethos.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">Henry VIII of England was of course much more representative of Christianity than the Hasmonean princes, under discussion, were of Judaism. The Tudor king did establish a specific branch of the Church in Christendom, whereas Hyrcanus, Aristobolus, and Alexander Jannai were without any influence on Judaism.</i> In footnotes and annexes Mr. Toynbee occasionally allows his readers a fleeting glance at the truth, which he distorts and falsifies in his main text; and so he grants the Pharisees the credit “that they did not let themselves drift with the tide of popular feeling, but parted company with the Maccabees just when, and just because, the Maccabees put their treasure in the establishment of an earthly kingdom.”<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/122, footnote 2.</i> This is the closest Mr. Toynbee ever gets to the acknowledgment of the truth. The Pharisees did part company with some of the Hasmonean princes, and particularly with Alexander Jannai, for the reasons indicated; they did not part company with the Maccabees. When the Pharisees broke with the Hasmonean dynasty, with them went the people. This, however, is again another aspect of history to which a man whose only sources on Judaism are the New Testament and Eduard Meyer dare not open his eyes."

"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.44","During his lengthy and repetitive discussion of the Maccabees and the Zealots, Mr. Toynbee pretends that these were the leaders and teachers in Judaism and that what they represented was the Judaic ethos. If they fought in wars, then war is consecrated by Jewish tradition<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">VII/341.</i>; if Hasmonean princes converted some Gentiles by force, then “a fanatical religious intolerance” is the very essence of Judaism. Nothing is more characteristic of this intellectual perversion than Mr. Toynbee’s cherished contrast between the gentleness of Jesus and the militancy of a Theudas or a Judas of Galilee. He elaborates on it, he comes back to it again and again; it typifies for him the two ways in history, exemplified by Christian gentleness and Judaic violence.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">See, e.g., I/288, footnote 3; V/78 and 382.</i> But who were Theudas and Judas of Galilee? What was their place in Judaism and its history? Like hundreds of others of their generation, they were patriots, who in the parlance of all oppressors and their Herodian underlings against whom patriots ever revolted in history, were referred to as brigands. Theudas and Judas owe their notoriety mainly to the fact that they are mentioned in the New Testament. But what a comparison for an historian to make—between Jesus and the Jewish Robin Hood or Davy Crockett! Here gentle Christianity—there violent Judaism!"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.45","The recognized teachers and interpreters of Judaism, who in most cases were also the leaders of Jewry, their teachings, their philosophy, their religious and ethical tenets, their manner of life and death—all are completely ignored by Mr. Toynbee. The friendliest thing one may say about him is that he is an ignoramus. If he had obtained a Jewish prayer book and turned to the section which contains a part of the Mishnah which is normally translated as “Ethics of the Fathers,” he would have found the names of the outstanding leader and teacher of each generation of Jewry, beginning with the Seleucid era and concluding with the time of the Hadrian persecutions, which followed the Bar Kokba debacle. The chain of tradition outlined in the first chapter covers the entire period which is interpreted by Mr. Toynbee. The few dicta handed down there in the names of the leading teachers of Israel might have helped our author to gain some slight inkling of the spirit of Judaism in the Maccabean and Zealot phases of Jewish history."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.46","At the opening of the Seleucid era he would have come across the adage by Simon the Just, the High Priest, that the world was based on three things: the Torah, religious worship, and the practice of loving-kindness. At the end of the entire era under survey stands the figure of Rabban Simon ben Gamliel, the head of the Sanhedrin, who died a martyr’s death during the Hadrianic persecutions. One of his maxims, a variation on the theme of Simon the Just, stated that the world was preserved by three things: by truth, by justice, and by peace. “As it is said: execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates.”<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">Zechariah, VIII/16.</i> Concerning the mundane expectations of Jewry, Mr. Toynbee might have pondered over the teaching of Antigonos of Socho, a disciple of Simon the Just, who said of the service of God: “Be not like servants who minister to their master upon the condition of receiving a reward; but like servants who minister to their master without the condition of receiving a reward.”<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">According to another version: “… but like servants who minister to their master on condition of receiving no reward.” The consistency of the Jewish ethos on this point is nobly illustrated by the Hassidic anecdote concerning the saintly Dov Baer of Mezritch. In his early years, the Maggid lived in great poverty with his young wife. When their child was born, he did not have the penny for which the midwife asked in order to buy some camomile tea for the baby. In his sorrow, out of pity for his child, the Maggid gave a sigh, whereupon he heard a voice say to him: “You have lost your share in the Coming World.” In his answer the Maggid exclaimed: “…. the reward has been done away with. Now I can begin to serve in good earnest.” See Martin Buber, <i>Tales of the Hasidim, Early Masters</i>, pp. 98-99. Schocken Books, New York, 1945.</i> Concerning the authentic Judaic attitude toward Herod and Herodianism, Mr. Toynbee might have consulted the policy statement of Shemayah, one of the leaders of the Pharisees, the teacher of Hillel, the man who with dignity and courage stood up to the Hasmonean king Hyrcanus and the young but already powerful Herod, when the latter was accused in the Sanhedrin of murder. It is the same Shemayah who advised the people of Jerusalem to admit Herod peacefully to the capital, when Herod together with Sosius besieged Jerusalem, but under whose guidance the Pharisees refused to take the oath of loyalty to Herod, the King by the grace of Rome.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Josephus, <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, XIV/9-4, XV/1-1 and 10-4.</i> The Judaic attitude toward the times and their problems was expressed by Shemayah and preserved in the first chapter of the “Ethics of the Fathers”: “Love work, hate lordship, and seek no intimacy with the mundane authority.” Concerning the Jewish ethos of militancy, Hillel, the great disciple of the great master, might have provided Mr. Toynbee with some useful information. His maxim was: “Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving thy fellow-creatures, and drawing them near to the Torah.”"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.47","While these few maxims do throw some light on the subject which Mr. Toynbee discusses with such impressive pretense of authority, they are like a drop in the ocean compared with the full extent of the Judaic teaching of the Maccabean and Zealot periods. Mr. Toynbee, however, is not a perfect ignoramus on the subject of the Judaism of those days. His claim to perfection is marred by one quotation from the sayings of Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai. After the destruction of the Temple, Rabbi Johanan comforted his disciple, Rabbi Joshua, that the practice of loving-kindness was equal to the Temple service in propitiating for the sins of Israel. But, as often, a little knowledge is more dangerous than none. Having quoted the above saying from a second-hand source, Mr. Toynbee proceeds to base on it another one of the theories of his fertile imagination: “In act and word Johanan ben Zakkai was proclaiming his <i>conversion</i> from the way of Violence to the way of Gentleness; and through this conversion he became <i>the founder of a new Jewry</i> …”<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">V/75, italics ours.</i> Nothing could be further from the truth. Mr. Toynbee’s only justification for mentioning the “conversion” of Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai is his own misrepresentation of Judaism as “a way of Violence.” Had our author taken even one glance at the original source from which his informants quote, he might have understood that the Rabbi was the head of the peace party in besieged Jerusalem.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">Aboth de Rabbi Nathan, VI/5.</i> The suggestion that Rabbi Johanan was “the founder of a new Jewry” is an utterly unjustified invention. He lived and taught in the spirit of his great master Hillel, with whom his personal relationship was one of touching mutual love and respect. On his sick bed the old, perhaps dying, Hillel called Rabbi Johanan, who was the youngest among his disciples, “Father of Wisdom and Father of his Generation.”<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">Talmud Yerushalmi Nedarim, V/6.</i> And, when the disciple was later recognized by all as the “Father of the Generation,” he extolled the greatness of his masters by declaring, with self-effacing modesty, that all his wisdom he received from his masters; yet it compared to what they possessed as the amount of water that a fly, which dips into the sea and flies away again, takes away from the ocean.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">Talmud Babli, Succah, 28.</i> The very quotation Mr. Toynbee takes from the teachings of Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai proves the continuity of the Judaic ethos throughout generations; for the Rabbi used for the “bestowal of kindness”—or the practice of loving-kindness—the same Hebrew expression that had been used, four centuries earlier, by Simon the Just, when he said that it constituted one of the foundations of the world.<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">In fact, the Talmudic source quotes Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai in fuller explanation of the phrase used by Simon the Just. The idea that “loving-kindness” was greater than sacrifice had been taught by the Pharisees—following the prophetic tradition—before Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai. Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, being a contemporary of the fall of Jerusalem, was the first to use it as a thought of comfort at a moment of despair. On this point see, e.g., Leo Baeck, <i>The Pharisees and Other Essays</i>, Schocken, New York.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.48","While there may be some excuse for ignorance, there is none for intellectual dishonesty. When Mr. Toynbee discusses the reactions of Jewry to the impact of the Roman Empire, he acknowledges only “Herodianism” and “Zealotism.”<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">VIII/580.</i> Characteristically, however, he does mention the existence of a strong peace party in Jerusalem when one would least expect it—in the chapter on “The Psychological Consequences of Atomic Warfare!” When he there discusses the possibilities of “heroism which is beyond Reason because it is above it,” he cannot suppress the example of Jewry in the years of their wars against the Roman Empire. In order to impress upon his readers the satanic addiction of Jewry to violence, Mr. Toynbee has underscored the obvious hopelessness of the Zealot reaction to Rome. But here, surely, was a fine example of “heroism which is beyond Reason because it is above it”; and a Jewish reader prepares himself to get—for a change—a few words of praise for his distant ancestors. He is mistaken again. For Mr. Toynbee hastens now to unearth the peace party and says: “It is, however, significant that in Jerusalem … a <i>majority</i> of the besieged would have countenanced overtures for forestalling extermination by surrender, if they had not been <i>terrorized by a minority of fanatics</i> into participating in these Zealots’ suicidal heroism.”<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">IX/521.</i> The Zealots in their violence are identical with Jewry; in their heroism they are only “a minority of fanatics.” As a matter of principle, Mr. Toynbee always acknowledges the truth—when to ignore it might be more flattering to Judaism and Jewry than to recognize it. He does not recognize the philosophy of the peace party as one of the Jewish attitudes at the time of the crisis. Yet, it is within the peace party that Mr. Toynbee would have found the teachers of Jewry and interpreters of Judaism, the majority of the Pharisees together with the majority of the besieged."

"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.50","Nothing could be less justified than the Toynbean contrast between the gentle Christian response and the violent “Judaic” one. Not only does he ignore the life and teachings of the recognized interpreters of Judaism, and the implementation of their ethos in the policies of a strong peace party, but he covers up the important point that the Christian response to the challenge of the times, the response of Jesus and his disciples, as well as that of the Christian apostle Paul, was in reality part of the Jewish response. This was not only because the founders and the apostles of Christianity were themselves Jews, but mainly because their ethos of gentleness was deeply embedded in the prophetic and Pharisaic tradition of the Jewry whose children they were too. It was the Jewish prophet Isaiah through whom the message of God was conveyed to Israel: “In sitting still and rest shall ye be saved, in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength….”<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">Isaiah, XXX/15.</i> To Zerubbabel, whose activity—in the Toynbean distortion—is to create the nucleus of the mundane world empire of the Messiah, the charge is: “This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying: ‘Not by might, nor by power, but by My spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.’ ”<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">Zechariah, IV/6.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.51","The fact that gentleness is not surrender, but rather the answer to a challenge on the spiritual plane, is fully realized by Mr. Toynbee. The Spirit of the Lord is itself the most powerful weapon. Thus he tells us, for example, that Paul “seizes upon all the noble and glorious connotations of War” in order to convey, “in a chain of military metaphors, the more ethereal glory and nobility of the Christian life.” Mr. Toynbee also maintains that “this use of military metaphor in the Epistles of Saint Paul is the <i>first step</i>—and a long one—towards a transfiguration of the word ‘War’ from a physical to a spiritual meaning.”<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/650 and footnote 1 ibid.</i> The truth is that, far from taking the “first step,” the Christian apostle only reflects the unsurpassed pronouncements of the Jewish prophets. Toynbee’s quotation is from the Second Epistle to the Corinthians:"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.52","Though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh (for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds): casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.53",To a Jewish ear the passage sounds like good orthodox Jewish teaching. Without the one reference to “obedience of Christ”—which may easily be replaced by “obedience of God”—it might pass for a Pharisaic comment on such verses from the prophets as these:
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.54","Behold, I have put My <i>words</i> in thy mouth;"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.55","See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms,"

"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.59","Since the words are addressed to the one solitary man, Jeremiah, who is set up over nations and kingdoms, it is obvious that his weapons are but the words of God in his mouth—a fact so tragically confirmed by the prophet’s consequent life of suffering and sorrow."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.60","But the mightiest step “towards a transfiguration of the word ‘War’ from a physical to a spiritual meaning” had been taken eight centuries before Paul, by Isaiah, who in his immortal Messianic vision said of the shoot that shall come forth “out of the stock of Jesse”:"

"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.79","As we saw, the Judaic ethos of gentleness continued to be taught—without a break in the chain of tradition—by the great Pharisaic teachers from Simon the Just to Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai.<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">The “transfiguration” of the military metaphor, far from being a Pauline discovery, is the routine Pharisaic method of the Midrash and Talmud to interpret many of the Biblical references to war.</i> Even the <i>law of Karma</i> to which the “Saviour with the Sword” is subject, and which Toynbee finds expressed in the basic teaching of Jesus that “All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword,”<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">VI/178-180.</i> is of Pharisaic origin. It was formulated in the generation before Jesus by Hillel, who—on seeing “a skull floating on the surface of the water—said to it: ‘Because thou drownedst others, they have drowned thee, and at the last they that drowned thee shall themselves be drowned.’ ”<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ethics of the Fathers</i>, II/7. There our quotation is found among some sayings by Hillel the Younger. Language, style, and contents, however, indicate that its proper place is in the first chapter of the <i>Ethics</i>, among the sayings attributed to Hillel the Older. In Talmud Babli, tractate Succah, 53/a, the statement is clearly attributed to Hillel the Older.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.80","Our purpose, however, is not to lay claim to the Jewish origins of the Christian ethos, but—as already indicated—to establish the fact that the “Christian” response to the crisis of the times during the Roman procuratorship and immediately after the fall of Jerusalem has to be understood as one aspect of the Jewish answer to the challenge. It could not have been the Christian answer, since Christianity had not been in existence prior to it. It was the response of Jews, involved in the struggle of their Jewish people and seeking an answer to the Jewish problems of their generation in the spirit of Jewish tradition, that gave birth to Christianity. The “Christian” response was as much part of the Jewish reaction as was “Zealotism,” and certainly much more so than “Herodianism.” The three forms of Jewish reaction to the intrusion of the Hellenic universal state upon Jewry were Zealotism, Pharisaism, and Christianity. The Zealots, as we saw, were not without religious zeal; with them religious and political freedom coalesced. They attempted to build “the Kingdom” with the sword. The Pharisees, men without power of office and without a sword, were the leaders of the people “by the breath of their lips.” They wanted peace on the terms of the policy of Shemaya, by withdrawing from political life. The “Christians” among the Jews, by overemphasizing the Judaic ethos of gentleness, found their answer in turning away not only from political activism but from “this World” altogether. If Judaism and Jewry of the time are to be blamed for Zealotism, then Judaism and Jewry ought to be credited with Christianity."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.81","For a Jew, this is not a matter of pride, but one of historic relevance. If a historian wishes to exemplify the Christian response of a society to a crisis, he must not point to the case of Jewry in the process of producing Christianity. He should offer as an illustration the behavior of an <i>already</i> Christian society, the reaction of a Christian people or civilization to a challenge similar to the one with which Jewry was faced at the time of Jesus. Mr. Toynbee does seem to make such an attempt when he draws a comparison between the primitive Christians and the Jewish people. Says our author: “In striking contrast to the series of Jewish insurrections … the Christians never once rose in armed revolt against their Roman persecutors during the approximately equal period of time that elapsed between the beginning of Jesus’ mission and the conclusion of peace and alliance.”<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">VII/339.</i> But must one remind an eminent historian like Mr. Toynbee that one does not compare “equal periods of time” with each other? He knows well enough that comparisons between societies and civilization are permissible only on the basis of correlative phases of their development. It is a technique that he himself employs with great fervor throughout his entire <i>Study</i>; it forms the basis of all his “law-making” in history."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.82","The Jewish insurrections were undertaken by a people, living in their own native land and assaulted by a ruthless invader. The primitive Christians were not a people but members of a religious sect; they were not living in one society concentrated on its native soil, but scattered abroad and lodged in handfuls in the midst of an overwhelming majority of non-Christians.<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">The only possible comparison between the primitive Christians and the Jews could be with Jewry in its Babylonian Exile, which according to Toynbee found its final “enlightenment” in the weeping by the waters of Babylon and almost accomplished for the Neo-Babylonian Empire what Christianity did in the arena of the Romano-Hellenic universal state. See V/120-2; VII/163 and 228; and above p. 3-4.</i> One should compare Jewry’s behavior at the time of these insurrections with that of a Christian society attacked on its own soil by an aggressor. Is there in all history a single example of a Christian people or civilization that, when attacked in its homeland, remembered the Christian ethos of gentleness and put away the sword because “All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword?” The answer is obvious. It also emerges clearly from what Mr. Toynbee himself has to say on the subject. Immediately after the “conclusion of peace and alliance” with the Roman Empire, the “Christians abandoned the policy of toleration with alacrity as soon as they became conscious that in material strength, they had acquired a decisive superiority….”<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">IV/226-27.</i> On the encounter of the modern West with the Jews, the Eastern Orthodox Christians, and the Muslims, Mr. Toynbee has the following to say: “These neighbours of the West remembered her, since the time of the Crusades, as a military aggressive society whose aggressiveness had been aggravated by a fanatical zeal to impose on all mankind her local Western version of Christianity.”<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">VIII/314.</i> It is equally clear that the records of the modern “parochial” states and nations of Western Christendom are no less devastating. It would therefore seem that in all history the only society that did give, at least through one of its factions, a “Christian response” to the challenge of a serious crisis has been the Jewish people in its struggle with the Romano-Hellenic empire.<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">In view of Gandhi’s Satyagraha and its awe-inspiring implementation against an oppressive imperial power, we are prepared to limit the validity of this statement to the arena of—to use a Toynbean phrase—the Judaic religions, i.e., Christianity, Islam, and Judaism; though in Toynbee’s philosophy the “Non-Violence of Jesus and Johanan ben Zakkai” are of a higher spiritual quality than that of Gandhi. See V/588-89.</i>"
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.83","Mr. Toynbee battles bravely to explain the failure of Western Christendom to abide by the gentle ethos of Christianity. When, for a while, he loses sight of Judaism and Jewry, he is an honest man. And so he builds up a rationalist’s accusation against the four living Higher Religions, among which—of course—Judaism does not figure. The rationalist case is that we can extol religion at the cost of secular civilization only by resorting to a trick, which “is, after all, a simple one. You have merely to ascribe to a church the virtues preached in the scriptures attributed to the church’s founder and your church inevitably takes the highest place on the ladder.” The trick, however, is easy to unmask. All one has to do is to direct one’s attention from “the alleged ideals of the church’s founder to the current practice of the church…. Look around you…. Behold Christianity, the Mahayana, Islam, and Hinduism not as they claim to be but as they are….”<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">VII/450.</i> A Jewish reader is amused by such an honest exchange of ideas between the author and an imagined rationalist, because the rationalist not only defends the claim of civilization as compared with religion but exactly describes the method used by Mr. Toynbee in order to create the “antithesis” between Christian gentleness and Jewish violence. Christianity is what Jesus teaches; Judaism, what some Jews (not even the most representative among them) do."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.84","Mr. Toynbee’s answer to the rationalist accusation is not to deny that there is a tragic gulf between ideal and performance in the Higher Religions, but to assert that the rationalist should remain true to his own premises and measure the past and the future of the churches by the “time-scale established by a Modern Western Physical Science.” On that time-scale, compared to the age of the earth and the physical universe, “a period of nineteen or twenty centuries, so far from being ‘a long time,’ was no more than the twinkling of an eye….” <sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">VII/453 and 506.</i> So, have patience; even if religion has failed thus far, what do a mere nineteen centuries amount to, when man looks forward to a future that is to be counted in millions of years! Be that as it may, one is puzzled by the fact that a historian who has nothing more to say in defense of Christianity should have the impudence to condemn Judaism, to speak of its “ethos of violence,” on the basis of the actions of a minority group in Jewry at one period in its history."
"Judaism Fossil., 1, the Tribal Deity and “deutero Isaiah.85","Our purpose in dwelling on all this is not to say to Mr. Toynbee: “And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?” The subject which he grandiloquently calls “The Challenge of Militancy on Earth”<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote"">VII/545.</i> when he labors to explain the “spiritual regression” of the Papacy and Christianity, but which he ignores completely in his discussion of the Maccabees and Zealots, provides a useful illustration for a better understanding of the Jewish position. The final conclusion of Mr. Toynbee seems to be that, on account of “Original Sin, spiritual regression, as witnessed in the history of Christendom, is inescapable; the gulf between the ideal and the performance remains unbridgeable and, “so long as Original Sin continued to be an element in terrestrial Human Nature, there would always be work in This World for Caesar to do….”<sup>48</sup><i class=""footnote"">VII/556.</i> Mr. Toynbee does not believe in progress in the usual sense of the word. Human nature has not changed much in the past, nor is there, as long as Original Sin remains, reason to expect any significant change in the future. The “Christian hope of a spiritually new species of personality, of which the first-fruits had already been manifested in Christ and in the Saints, might never receive fulfilment in a regeneration of Mankind in the mass….”<sup>49</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., 563.<br>CHAPTER III</i>"
