Version Notes,
"Major Themes., Foreword.1","As its title indicates, this volume deals with several major themes in the modern philosophies of Judaism as they emerge from some of the key writings of the authors discussed."
"Major Themes., Foreword.2","The analysis is critical. I believe that in my criticism I have given illustrative expression to the conviction that at this time we have neither a theology nor a philosophy of Judaism that does justice to the essential nature of Jewish teaching about God, man, and the universe as expressed in the classical sources of Judaism, nor one that can be maintained with contemporary philosophical validity."
"Major Themes., Foreword.3","In my opinion, we have reached a stage that requires a great deal of rethinking of the nature of the Jewish position in the history of human thought and commitment in the light of contemporary philosophical problematics and existential experience. Judaism is awaiting a reformulation of its theology and philosophy. It will, however, be accomplished by means of an intellectual strength that draws its creative inspiration as well as its contents from the classical sources of Judaism—Bible, Talmud, and Midrash."
"Major Themes., Foreword.4","The chapter on Buber was previously published by Yeshiva University, New York, in 1962, under the title, <i>A Jewish Critique of the Philosophy of Martin Buber</i>. The critique of Reconstructionism appeared in <i>Tradition</i>, in the Fall, 1959 issue, under the title, “Reconstructionist Theology.” The essay on Heschel was also published by <i>Tradition</i>, in the Spring-Summer issue of 1964. The essay, “Faith and Law” was previously published in <i>Judaism</i>, in the Fall issue, 1964. Our thanks are offered to the publishers for their kind permission to reprint these essays in their present form."

"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.1","In the closing quarter of the nineteenth century and during the opening years of the twentieth, the brilliantly shining star in the sky of philosophy in Germany was Hermann Cohen. As one of the founders of the Neo-Kantian School at the University of Marburg he enriched the philosophical treasures of his native land with the creations of his genius. After a life of estrangement from Judaism, the grand old man of German idealism who had started out in life as a rabbinical student at the Breslau Rabbinical Seminary, returned to the faith of his fathers, the faith of his youth. The fruit of this return was a rediscovery of religion that, in a philosophical interpretation of Judaism, Cohen considered to be the religion of reason. The final results of the rediscovery were in the process of formulation in numerous essays during the years of Cohen’s retirement from his chair in Marburg, and have been collected in three representative volumes as <i>Hermann Cohen’s Jüdische Schriften</i>. Our attention, however, will be concentrated on two works in which Cohen’s religion of reason found its final statement: the one entitled, <i>Der Begriff der Religion im System der Philosophie</i> (The Concept [Idea] of Religion in the System of Philosophy), published in 1915, and the other, <i>Die Religion der Vernunft aus den Quellen des Judentums</i> (The Religion of Reason from the Sources of Judaism), published posthumously in 1919. Franz Rosenzweig, Cohen’s faithful disciple during the master’s Berlin years, wrote of <i>Die Religion der Vernunft:</i> “In this work, that will still be read when the language in which Cohen wrote it will only be understood by scholars, was harvested the entire Jewish yield of this life and thus, indeed, the yield of this life in its entirety.”<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">Rosenzweig, Franz, “Einleitung” to <i>Jüdische Schriften</i>, C. A. Schwetschke und Sohn Verlag, Berlin, 1924, p. 63.</i> To us, it would seem that the essence of <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i> is contained in <i>Der Begriff der Religion</i>. On this subject, not unlike Philo in his days, Cohen wrote in one format for the philosophically schooled gentile reader, and in another for the believing Jewish intellectuals. <i>Der Begriff der Religion</i> is the version of <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i> for the gentiles, whereas <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i> is the Jewish version of <i>Der Begriff der Religion</i>."

"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.3","During the years that Cohen was creating his great system of philosophy in his works on logic, ethics, and aesthetics, he could find no place in it for religion. He regarded the particularism of all religions to be all the more dangerous since it was falsified by a pretense to universalism. Cohen’s chief ethical concern was universalism; the goal of ethics was the totality (<i>Allheit</i>) of mankind. Only if religion would be willing to surrender its particularistic principles of faith, could it make mankind, in its universality, the goal of its teaching. But then it would have to submerge itself in ethics.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">Hermann Cohen, <i>Die Ethik des reinen Willens</i>, B. Cassirer Verlag, Berlin, 1907, p. 61.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.4","Ethics cannot recognize the independence of religion. It sees in religion a <i>Naturzustand</i>, a state of nature, that in its cultural maturity must dissolve in ethics. Religion may be a handmaid to ethics, helping to transmit ethics into the stream of general culture; but its goal must be self-immolation through the fulfillment of its culture function on behalf of ethics.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 587.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.5","In one respect, however, ethics must grant recognition to the idea of God. This is necessitated by a methodological problem of ethics itself. It is characteristic of the ideal of morality that it is not realizable in time. Every phase of ethical realization is momentary; the striving and the progress must continue in eternity. This is the law of the ethics of the pure will. Ethics requires eternity. One must never waver in one’s trust in eternal progress, that alone can bring about the full triumph of the idea of the Good. But how does one get the certainty of eternal duration? The eternity of the ideal is not to be separated from the eternity of Nature. For without Nature as its foundation the ideal is not realizable. One cannot strive for the realization of the ethical ideal in a void. The monotheistic God idea is introduced into the system in order to guarantee the eternity of the ethical ideal by securing its indispensable parallel, the eternally continued existence of Nature."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.6","“God means that Nature has continued existence as certainly as morality is eternal. The ideal (of morality) can as little provide this certainty as it can be provided by nature.” The surety of this parallelism is the truth that Cohen calls God. “And now the eternity of the ideal is secured through the divine providence over nature for the sake of morality.” <sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 446, 450.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.7","What we get here is, of course, a reformulation of Kant’s idea of God as “a postulate of practical reason.” It is incorporated into the system as a solution to a methodological problem. Cohen acknowledged its importance for his ethics in later years when he wrote that without it, his <i>Ethics</i> would have remained a “torso.”<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cohen, <i>Der Begriff der Religion im System der Philosophie</i>, A. Toepelwaum Verlag, Giessen, 1915; p. 51.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.8","This was how far Cohen went in admitting religion into his ethics. But when his long road of <i>t’shuba</i>, of return to Judaism, was about to be accomplished intellectually too, he found that there were other problems of man as he lived with himself as well as with his fellow man that remained unresolved in his system and, with regard to them, ethics was helpless. In the <i>Ethik</i> man is not the individual human being as he exists in his biological reality and social and historical context. There, man is defined by what he ought to be; that means that he is understood through the ideal of <i>Allheit</i>, the ideal of the universality of man, that of mankind. Man, one might say, is mankind. “Therefore, without (the idea of) totality (<i>Allheit</i>), and that means without <i>beginning</i> with totality, the idea of man cannot only not be completed, but it can absolutely not be developed and established.”<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ethik</i>, p. 7; cf. also, <i>Religion der Vernunft Aus den Quellen des Judenturns</i>, J. Kauffmann Verlag, Frankfurt a.M., 1919, p. 15.</i> In <i>Der Begriff der Religion</i>, Cohen recognizes that this idea of man is inadequate. It does not take cognizance of the day-to-day reality of the human condition. And, now, he asks what for the author of the <i>Ethics</i> is the surprisingly bold question: “What is man and what is he lacking, if he is <i>only</i> mankind?”<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Begriff</i> etc., p. 52.</i> What is he indeed, in his own private situation? There are times of human weakness, of human failure. Above all, there is sin—“sin that overwhelms man; through it he loses his human dignity. He is diverted from the path of mankind and shrinks into <i>Individuum</i>, an individual.”<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 55; cf also <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i>, p. 207.</i> If we wish to use a more apt term for what he wishes to say, we might exchange Cohen’s <i>Individuum</i> for Kierkegaard’s “single one.” What can ethics do for a man, who is conscious of his guilt and cannot free himself from it? Here is the boundary line between ethics and religion, according to Cohen; here is the “birthplace of religion.” How strange that only at this late hour in his life did it occur to Cohen to raise the basic question of human existence in all seriousness! There is, of course, a trace of it already in the <i>Ethik</i>. He quotes the fateful words of Ezekiel of the “soul that sins,” that were to play such an important part, years later, in <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i>, that the soul is the “person,” the <i>Individuum</i>, that is discovered in the sin.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ethik</i>, p. 299.</i> However, nothing comes of it in the <i>Ethik</i>. There it leads into a <i>cul de sac</i> and it is soon forgotten. Is it possible that there was present in Cohen much more of the affirmations and commitments of his youth as an observant Jew than the Herr Professor permitted to well up into his full consciousness?"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.9","There is yet another problem of man with which ethics, as conceived by Cohen, cannot cope. It arises, not from the life of man as he struggles with his own conscience in the solitude of his heart, but from the life of man in society, together with other human beings. A fundamental concept of ethics is the idea of honor, of human dignity. The essence of man, says Cohen, is his dignity—his human dignity, he adds significantly. He means by the addition, a dignity that is his, not because of his individual or particular status, but an honor and respect that is due to him simply because he is man. Therein is grounded the idea of the equality of all men.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 492.</i> However, as Cohen puts it in <i>Der Begriff der Religion</i>, this respect refers to the moral dignity of man. It does not consider the particular situation in which each individual human being finds himself. It has no eye as to whether a man is poor or rich, miserable or happy. In the equality of their dignity because they are all human, one perceives the individual as an abstract humanity. Just as the individual cannot emerge unto himself with the help of ethics alone, neither can the other man claim my attention as an individual, as “a single one.” <sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">“<i>Der Begriff</i>, p. 79.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.10","Cohen formulates the problem somewhat differently in the introduction to <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i>. We saw earlier in our discussion, that in his ethics the “I” is really mankind. But from this follows, that so also is the “He” or “She.” And, indeed, on the basis of the <i>Ethik</i> there is no difference between the “I” and the “He.” Whatever is due to him is also due to me. What is missing in this scheme is the “Thou.” The “Thou” comes into being when I behold the man beside me in his individual circumstances that may lay claim to my pity. But while there is room in Cohen’s ethics for universal honor and dignity, there is none for individual pity or sympathy.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, pp. 18–20.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.11","Because of these insufficiencies, ethics has to call on religion for the solution of its unresolved problems. This does not mean that ethics now recognizes the sovereign independence of religion, but only its specific character, a character which is not distinguished by some other source of knowledge and truth—which is impossible—but only by its specific contents. Ethics does not here turn into religion. However, by the broadening of its problems, by the completion of its concept of man through the idea of the individual, and by an enriched self-awareness, the compass of ethics is expanded to include the contents of religion.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Begriff</i>, pp. 45, 58, 62.</i> But how is the complete harmony between the two to be achieved while preserving the unity of their methodological validity? The answer to the question is provided by Cohen’s religion of reason, as presented to us in the two volumes, <i>Der Begriff der Religion</i> and <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i>."

"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.13",<b>1. <i>Being and Becoming</i></b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.14","As Cohen puts it, “reason is the organ of the laws,” meaning that it is the instrument that provides the rules that validate the speculations of man, the laws of logical thinking. The religion of reason, accordingly, is under the authority of such speculative lawfulness. It disregards all historical factuality as purely incidental. It is based fully on this lawfulness of logical thought. This is, in essence, reason’s share in religion.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 12.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.15","In the opening pages of <i>Der Begriff der Religion</i> Cohen had already given an indication of the significance of his position when he stated that logic and religion have one basic idea in common, i.e., the idea of Being. Being is no less a problem of religion then a problem of logic.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 20–22.</i> According to Cohen, “logic is the thinking of the origin”;<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cohen, Die <i>Logik der reinen Erkenntnis</i>, B. Cassirer Verlag, Berlin, 1902.</i> thus, the understanding of all movement requires the thinking of rest as its origin, the grasping of all Becoming demands the thinking of Being as its logical precondition. Heraclitus’ “All flows” had to be corrected by Parmenides’ idea of Being. This, of course, leads us to the Kantian theory of Substance as the idea of relation, that is the logical point of rest to which all changes must be related and without which the processes in time remain inexplicable.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. Immanuel Kant, <i>Kritik der Reinen Vernunft.</i></i> The same problems and similar solutions are also the preoccupation of religion. Religion must find the origin of Becoming, and finds it in Being that is identified as God. God is the precondition of Becoming, which is the world of nature and of man. God as Being is the explanation of Becoming. However, it is important to note that there is no material relation between God and the world. Becoming is not emanation of Being. It does not issue from Being, nor is it contained in it. Just as the Kantian Substance has logical significance for change, so religion’s God as Being has logical significance for Becoming. Just as in logic thinking is the thinking of the origin, in religion thinking is the thinking of God as the thinking of origin. “Nature is the Becoming that demands that Being be given to it as its foundation.” <sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 77.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.16","God is Being, Becoming is existence (<i>Dasein</i>). One discovers existence through the senses; God, however, is nonperceptible Being grasped by reason. Thus, God is not only one, but unique, the only Being. Nothing has being apart from him. Nature has existence, but not being. Nature is nothing compared to the Being of God. Uniqueness, therefore, excludes all pantheism, which identifies Being with Becoming. It also renders impossible any idea of mediation, be it dualistic like Philo’s thought of the logos, or trinitarian, like the Christian belief in a triune God. God alone has being.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">For this presentation, cf. <i>Der Begriff</i>, 22–26; <i>Die Religion</i>, the chapter, “Die, Einzigkeit, Gottes.” However, the basic idea of the uniqueness of divine Being is already present in the <i>Ethik</i>, p. 403.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.17",<b>2. <i>Creation and Revelation</i></b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.18","Since God is thus conceived as the origin of Becoming, he is of necessity the source of all activity. This yields us the idea of creation. But we have seen that God’s significance for Becoming is logical, therefore creation must not be understood as an activity added to Being. That would establish a material relation between Being and Becoming which was excluded. Cohen says that creation is not an activity but the precondition of causality and of all activity. Thus, creation is called the essence of Being as uniqueness, or as Cohen says, “The uniqueness of divine Being is accomplished in creation.”<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 76.</i> We assume that what he means is once again the direct result of the logical significance of Being for Becoming. One can only speak of the uniqueness of Being as a distinguishing characteristic from the Non-Being of Becoming. Since Becoming demands Being for its ground of necessity, Being has to include creation, not as an act in time, but as the basis of all acts in time. Thus Cohen would say, “Creation is the ground attribute (<i>Urattribut</i>) of God … not as a consequence of uniqueness … But identical with it.”<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 77.</i> Although it is somewhat difficult to see how an attribute, however fundamental, could be identified with God, what Cohen had in mind was to make sure that creation should not be understood as a physical act in history, but as the origin of the space-time dimension as required by his logic. From this he derives the idea of the continuity of creation. If creation were a physical act on the part of the deity one such act would suffice and Becoming, too, would be such an individual event. But since creation is the ground of all activity, it must continually remain that ground. Thus Becoming itself is forever renewed. Cohen identifies this thought with the traditional formulation in the daily prayer of the Jew that maintains of God that “he renews in his goodness the works of creation daily.”<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf., <i>Die Religion</i>, the chapter, <i>“Die Schöpfung.”</i></i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.19","Man is part of nature. But man is not only nature, says Cohen; he is also reason. Creation of man was his creation as a rational being. This Cohen calls revelation. Revelation is the creation of reason. It is through reason that man discovers God, that he discovers truth. Thus, revelation should be understood as the continuation of creation. Revelation completes creation.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 84.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.20","The contents of revelation are “the statutes and laws” of Judaism. But they have their foundation in reason. They are revealed to man rationally. This changes revelation from a fact in history to a spiritual event occurring in human consciousness. What happens now to the historic revelation at Sinai? It, too, has to be spiritualized. Cohen thinks that he has found support for his theory in the Bible itself. The Bible warns against any “corporeal” visualization of the experience at Sinai. When the Bible says: “And the Eternal One spoke unto You out of the midst of the fire; ye heard the voice of the words, but ye saw no form,”<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">Deuteronomy, pp. 4, 12.</i> Cohen maintains that even to hear would still be too much of a “materialization” of the divine. He interprets, therefore, the phrase, “ye heard,” as: “you understood and obeyed,” which the Hebrew, <i>shom’im</i>, permits. The strangest support for his rationalistic interpretation of revelation Cohen finds in the biblical statement: “It is not in heaven, that thou shouldst say: Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it? But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.”<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 30, 14.</i> According to Cohen, this removes revelation from history. If tradition does associate revelation with the history of Israel, it is due to the fact that for the sake of the establishment of monotheism—which in its essence is fully universalistic—it was necessary to make it the purpose of national existence, to fill with it the national consciousness. Revelation is universal, it is addressed to man and not specifically to the Jew. Its association with Israel, one might say in view of Cohen’s interpretation, was a mere expedient, a kind of accidental monotheistic politics to introduce monotheistic universalism into history."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.21","In conclusion of the theme Cohen writes: “If this spiritual process [of revelation] in the course of political events was nevertheless given the distinction of a historic act in order that it might have the character of a national one, so—as we have seen—the critique and the correction entered at the beginning of the genuine, the literary history and have transferred Sinai into the heart of man. That which is eternal, removed from all sense experience and thus also from all history, is the ground and the guarantee for that which is innermost to the national history. It preceeds it, because it is its foundation.”<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 98.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.22",<b>3. <i>Correlation and Attributes</i></b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.23","Cohen asserts that the creation of man in reason establishes a link between God, the Creator, and man. Revelation is revelation to man; thus God enters into relation with man. This link by way of reason Cohen calls correlation. “The uniqueness of God (as the Creator) conditions His relation to the reason of man. The reason of man as creation of God, conditions his relation of reason to God.”<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 95.</i> The result is correlation. One is probably justified in saying that the idea of the correlation is the most important concept in both works, <i>Der Begriff der Religion</i> and <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i>. It is given the task of solving the problems of human existence that, as we saw, ethics cannot solve."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.24","Reason is twofold, theoretical and practical. Since reason is the basis of the correlation between God and man, the correlation, too, has to be twofold. It may reveal to man the answers to the purely theoretical question of “whence?”. In this sense, man discovers in the correlation Being as God who is unique and, as we saw, because of that, the Creator. And as he knows God, free of matter and life, as all Spirit, so does he recognize himself, because of the correlation, also as spirit similar to God, though of course not identical with or equal to him.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 104.</i> But as reason is also practical, in the correlation man will be enlightened also on the ethical question: what for?"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.25","The question, “what for?”, is answered by purpose. Theoretical reason is revelation that provides the ground to the realm of nature, i.e., causality; practical reason reveals the ground to the realm of man, it completes causality through purpose. But purpose is accomplished through action. Thus we reach the divine attributes of action, whose theory was developed by Maimonides. Cohen, however, places his own interpretation on them. How can action be an attribute of God? Being is at rest within itself. It is not subject to question of purpose. Yet Being as God is the ground, the origin, of the dimension of purpose. We have therefore to say that the question of purpose points beyond Being into a new phase of the correlation. “Action” with God is the foundation of the possibility of action in Becoming as it is represented by man. Action is always under the aspect of purpose, but purpose is for man. Therefore, attributes of action are not so much attributes of God as paradigms, norms for human action. God as Being is not only the origin of Becoming, he is also the <i>Urbild</i>, the arch-idea for human action. That the rabbis ascribed “modesty” to God, for example, proves that attributes are such norms (<i>Musterbilder</i>) for human morality. Cohen maintains that “what is called divine attribute is not at all an attribute in the logical, but only in the ethical sense. The attribute does not stand in logical relation to the Substance, but rather in ethical relation to the substance of man.<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 503.</i> The same idea was expressed by Cohen in a different context, when he said: “Only those attributes should be ascribed to him [God] which serve as the ground for man’s morality and favor his drawing near to God.”<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Begriff</i>, p. 106.</i> Through the divine attributes man should learn to act in accordance with them, and only those which serve this purpose are attached to God. In essence, it is the same idea that Cohen had already formulated rather succinctly in the <i>Ethik</i>. Having declared that it was God who taught man what morality was, he added: “Not what God is has God to teach me, but what man is.”<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ethik</i>, p. 403.</i> In keeping with his religious phase, we ought to say: “What man should be.” It is important, however, to realize that as a result of all that, “Being once again marches out of its boundaries into correlation with Becoming in man.”<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 111.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.26","We have now gained two forms of the correlation, corresponding to the two forms of reason by which God enters into relation with man. One is as Being as the origin of all causation; the other as Being as the ground of all ethical purpose. This helps us to establish the meaning of God for man. “Only in correlation with man should the essence of God be determined.”<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Begriff</i>, p. 106.</i> This is most elaborately demonstrated in the realm of purpose, the realm of ethical action for man. God is his attributes for man; God is the <i>Urbild</i>, the arch-idea. The one and unique God has no “reality.” He has the reality of the Idea, the idea of the holy God, the idea of the holy spirit, which, according to Cohen is identical with the idea of morality.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 188.</i> “Holiness is morality” says Cohen. Holiness matures into all the ramifications of correlation, it embraces justice and love. “Holiness is altogether only morality. And with God, too, it has only that meaning of morality which the correlation with man demands.”<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 128.</i> God, whose essence is determined by the correlation, is therefore the idea of holiness, the idea of love and justice."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.27","<b>4. <i>Love, Forgiveness, and Reconciliation</i></b>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.28","The idea of God as the paradigm of ethical action points to man’s purpose in his life with other human beings. The other man is at first “man beside me” (<i>Nebenmensch</i>). Ethics by itself knows only him. As we saw, it cannot consider him in his specific situation, whether he be rich or poor, happy or miserable. However, one cannot isolate oneself from society and, since poverty is the general lot of man, one dare not separate oneself from the social suffering of poverty. In the <i>Begriff der Religion</i> Cohen already stated that it is through sympathy that one overcomes the distance that prevails between one man and another if their relation is based on the sole demand of ethics, i.e., respect. “And where once sympathy has entered, there love for mankind must also blossom…. Love for mankind is the religious form of the social relation between man and man.”<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Begriff</i>, p. 79.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.29","Later on, in his work on the religion of reason, Cohen also said that, as man considers the human misery of “the man beside him,” he responds with sympathy. Thus, through sympathy he transforms “man beside him” (<i>Nebenmensch</i>) into “fellowman” (<i>Mitmensch</i>). It is something that ethics cannot do, maintains Cohen. Sympathy is the original form of man’s love for his fellow human being. “God has created man, but his fellowman he [man] must create himself.” Of it Cohen says that it is religion that has to bring about this new creation. “Thus God has to become the creator for a second time in that he forms man into fellowman through man himself, through the share of reason in religion.”<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 171.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.30","It should now be clear how it is the share of reason in religion that brings this new creation of the fellowman about. In the ethical correlation between God and man, God is revealed to man as the paradigm of God’s love for man. In the social legislation of the Bible regarding the poor, Cohen sees God’s love for man made manifest. They are limitations of property rights for the sake of the poor. Especially in the law of the <i>Shabbat</i> he finds the idea of equality expressed. Thus we have found the meaning of God’s love for man. “The sympathy with the poor which God awakens within us through His commandments, becomes for us the understandable ground for the meaning of God’s love.”<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 185.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.31","Closely related to God’s love for man is man’s love for God. At first, Cohen sees a serious problem here. It would seem that from the point of view of monotheism one should take objection to the very idea of man’s love for God. God is the Being for which only the thought of man may search and whom only the understanding can establish. However, the intellectual task is an infinite one. It is not “a quiet possession, a gift complete.” How can this restless search for God be called love?<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Begriff</i>, pp. 80–81, 84; cf also <i>Die Religion</i>, p. 188; <i>Ethik</i>, p. 403.</i> The answer is that since God, as we saw, is never “reality” for man since he is Idea—the idea of morality—in loving Him we love the idea, the norm, the paradigm. If I want my thinking of God to be love of God, I have to think of the moral universe of man’s social existence, I have to direct my concern to it and love it. Therefore, asserts Cohen, man’s love of God is not a form of anthropomorphism, for the problem is resolved by the paradox that to love God means that one should love man."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.32","As man changes “man beside him” into fellowman, he transforms the “He” or “She” into “Thou.” In fact, it is only through this act that he himself becomes a fellowman; and as he becomes a fellowman, he becomes “I.” It is only through “thou” that we become “I.” Thus, a new correlation is established, the correlation of I-Thou between man and man. Yet, man does not exist only in the social context. What of the “I” in the absolute? in separation? What of man as he exists by himself and for himself? With this question, of course, we have arrived at the second problem of man, that as we heard, ethics alone could not solve.<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">The two problems that ethics cannot solve, the response to the specific situation of human misery and the lifting of guilt from the human conscience, are treated in different sequences in the two works, <i>Der Begriff</i> and <i>Die Religion.</i> In the former, the problem of guilt is discussed first, then the social problem; in the latter the order is reversed. In our presentation we follow the sequence in <i>Die Religion.</i></i> Man exists by himself by recognizing his guilt, by realizing that he is a sinner. Thus he becomes the individuum, the individual being in separation. However, the realization of sin is not the ultimate goal; the goal is liberation from sin. Only through such liberation does the individuum become the “I,” the person in full reality. Sin is—in a sense—a transit station from individuum to the “I.”"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.33","Other stages along the journey are redemption and reconciliation. God liberates man by forgiving his sin. It is man alone who has the task of bringing about forgiveness. His is the responsibility of <i>t’shuba</i>, of return, of renewed stirring for self-sanctification after every failure. The goal of his stirring and self-uplift is God. Man alone cannot accomplish his liberation. God alone can take his sin from him, God alone is his redeemer. “The sin before God leads us to redemption through God. Redemption through God leads us to man’s reconciliation with himself. And it is this that ultimately leads the “I” to reconcilation with God. It is reconciliation with God that brings the individuum to feel maturity as “I.”<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 222.</i> Man is turning away from the old and beginning on a new road. Through his liberation from all his sins he gains new strength. Now man is able to create a new heart for himself and a new spirit. With his new “I” he steps into life and proves himself.<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 238, 227.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.34","With the help of religion we have now deepened our understanding of man and, thus, also our understanding of God."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.35","This is now the third facet of the correlation between God and man; it is forgiveness and redemption. “It is the essence of God to forgive the sins of man.

"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.37","In one more respect has ethics to broaden into religion. At the beginning of our analysis we have seen how, even at the time Cohen believed that religion would have to submerge in ethics he still needed the idea of God in order to complete the ethical system which he had erected. At that time, all he said was that the eternity of ethical striving and realization was guaranteed by the preservation of Man and Naure parallel to each other. However, that guarantee was provided by the God idea of monotheism. While not discussing it explicitly, as he did with the other two problems about which ethics was helpless, it would appear that at a later time Cohen realized how inadequate his God-idea in the <i>Ethik</i> was to fulfill the task he had allotted to it."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.38","The God-idea of the <i>Ethik</i>, as we have pointed out, was a reformulation of one of Kant’s postulates of practical reason. Now, a postulate of practical reason may be a methodological requirement in order to complete a system, as the God postulate, indeed, completed Kant’s critique of practical reason and as, in its new formulation, it was intended to complete Cohen’s ethical system of the pure will. But one thing a postulate cannot do—it cannot guarantee anything. It may methodologically smooth out some ruffled spots in thinking, but it can do nothing for the reality of existence. And thus the God-idea of the <i>Ethik</i> could not accomplish that for the sake of which it was originally introduced; it could not guarantee the continued existence in fact, in history, of man and nature."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.39","At a much later time, Cohen realized that ethics may define, for its own purposes, God as the guarantor of the ever-continuing realization of morality on earth. “Yet its means fail beyond the definition, beyond the postulate of this idea.” It is religion alone, out of its own specific nature, that can provide trust in God and confidence in Him that, indeed, man and nature will endure as needed by the task of never-ending ethical fulfillment. This trust and confidence found its expression in the messianism of monotheism. The messianic God guarantees the preservation of nature and its connection with the infinite task of morality.<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 470, 362.<br>45. Ibid., p. 48.</i>"

"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.41",<b>1.</b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.42","Having analyzed the main points in Cohen’s philosophy of religion, the question that forces itself to our attention is: Who or what is this God of the religion of reason? Readers of Cohen, and also those who studied his works, thought that in the final reckoning He was not a personal God, but only an idea. It is true that in the very beginning of <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i> Cohen states that, in religion, the Being of philosophy changes from a <i>neutrum</i> into a person, yet they felt that in the further disquisition of the subject matter, there was little to support the statement. Franz Rosenzweig, in his introduction to the <i>Jüdische Schriften</i> of the master, defended Cohen against such an interpretation. He maintained that there could be no worse misunderstanding of the thinker as well as his thought than to assume that with Cohen God was only an idea. He continues the explanation:"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.43","With the word ‘idea’ is expressed of what kind our statements are that can be made about God. One cannot—and that is what the word [idea] says—describe God, one cannot figure him out, one cannot grasp him. For an idea is neither an object, nor a logically [<i>gesetzlich</i>] complete unity, nor a concept. But one can say what, without God, could not be; or differently expressed, what it is for which God lays the ground. By indicating this “ground-laying,” the content of an idea is exhaustively stated for Cohen. However, it is not yet done merely with the indication of the contents. With it begins what Cohen calls its [the idea’s] inexhaustible fruitfulness. And this fruitfulness philosophy can only establish by individual examples, and only as a fact."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.44","We believe we have shown how the God-idea is used by Cohen as “the ground-layer.” We have seen how it lays the ground for Becoming, for creation and revelation, for love and forgiveness, for the continuity of nature parallel to the eternal ethical striving of the pure will, for messianism. We shall yet see how philosophy has been imposed upon to accept the “fruitfulness” of the idea as a fact. But does Rosenzweig’s explanation meet the criticism of those who maintain that the God of the <i>Religion of Reason</i> is a mere idea? Obviously, this religious philosophy has nothing to do with the God that cannot be described, that cannot be grasped, with the <i>deus absconditus</i>. Cohen emphasizes again and again that God can never become a reality, that—for instance—even His holiness is for man only, and what it is for God is not only unknown to us but is none of our concern. Nor is there any possibility of any kind of an emotional or affectional relation to God. In loving Him one loves the idea of morality for which he is the norm, one really loves man.<sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. Ibid., pp. 114, 128, 442.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.45","However, let us see whether Rosenzweig’s interpretation of the idea as <i>Grundlegung</i> (ground-laying) does indeed give us a God that is more than an idea. Fortunately, Cohen himself gave ample explanation for what he meant by an idea. Thinking, of course, is not sense perception. What for the eye is seeing is, for thinking as it deepens, vision. Such a vision of thought is the idea, which as a <i>hypothesis</i> precedes all scientific thought, it forms its ground, it indicates its outline and gives indication of its content. Thus, Cohen can say: The idea is the hypothesis and the hypothesis is the idea.<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Begriff</i>, p. 29.</i> In other words, the idea is a methodological principle with which all scientific and philosophical thinking must begin."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.46","In another place Cohen writes clearly, “The idea as such can only be methodological ground-laying.” A problem arises when one moves from the realm of logic into that of ethics, for instance. There one meets with the justified desire that the idea of the good should be more than just a methodological principle. This is understandable, says Cohen, since the spirit attaches a value to the idea far beyond all nature and its scientific interpretation. Nevertheless, even this problem cannot be solved in any other way but by the idea as a principle of ground-laying."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.47","Ethics and logic may differ from each other in their content, but in the unity of thinking they must not be separated from each other. Nature and ethics must remain united in the unity of methodology. This means, then, just as the idea of Being is the methodological ground for logic and science, so can the idea of the Good be no <i>more</i> than the methodological ground for ethics.<sup>48</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 37.</i> But how does it stand with the God-idea in the religion of reason? In another context, in which Cohen describes the God-idea of Being as the ground of existence (<i>Dasein</i>) identical with Becoming, he adds the significant words: “Here the spiritual association reveals itself (<i>Gemeinschaft</i>, literally “community”) with the fundamental thought (<i>Grundgedanken</i>, literally, ground, or basic, thought) of the logic of pure reason.”<sup>49</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 49.</i> What he is saying here is that just as Being in logic is a methodological principle of origin, so it is also in religion. In yet another context, comparing the God-idea of ethics with that of religion, Cohen affirms: “Here too, the identical nature of the idea for both ethics and religion has been maintained.”<sup>50</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 50.</i> There is no getting away from it, the idea in logic is identical in its nature with the idea in ethics and with that in religion. In all these disciplines it has the significance of the methodological ground, without which no thinking can even begin. This unity in the methodology of thought is, indeed, what Cohen repeatedly calls the share of reason (<i>Vernunftanteil</i>) in religion. Without it, the religion of reason would be impossible. This, however, means that the God-idea in Cohen’s religion of reason is, strictly speaking, no more than the fundamental hypothesis."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.48","The concept of God as an idea receives its strangest emphasis when Cohen discusses man’s love of God. The question that proffers itself for immediate consideration is: How can one love an idea? If Rosenzweig’s interpretation were correct, there would be little reason for the question and much less need for the surprising answer: “How can one love anything else but an idea!” Cohen believed that “even in sensuous love one loves the idealized person, only the idea of the person.”<sup>51</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 187.</i> The meaning of the statement is that in the love of God one loves only the idea of God, as indeed in the religion of reason, man knows nothing more about God than the idea of Him. In ethics the idea becomes the ideal, so that Cohen says in conclusion: “The love of man for God is the love for the moral ideal. Only the ideal can I love and the ideal I can only grasp through loving it. The ideal is the paradigm (<i>Urbild</i>) of morality…. However, only as an object of understanding can I make the paradigm an object of love.”<sup>52</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 188.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.49",<b>2.</b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.50","One might, perhaps, suggest that the concept of correlation proves that God is much more than a mere idea for Cohen. It seems to indicate that some kind of a personal relation exists between God and man. Franz Rosenzweig, in the introduction to the <i>Jüdische Schriften</i>, sees in the correlation “the new fundamental concept” (<i>der neue Grundbegriff</i>) which Cohen discovered in his religious philosophy. He describes it as “a relation of mutuality between man and God.” He relates his effort to bring Cohen and Buber together, feeling that there was an approximation in Buber’s thinking at the time toward Cohen’s position. Buber was about to make his own discovery of “relation’ as the basic word (<i>Grundwort</i>) of religion. Rosenzweig understood that there was more than a “terminological closeness” between Buber’s “relation” and Cohen’s “correlation.” In our opinion, it was not just incidental that he did not succeed in bringing the two men closer together."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.51","The truth is that nothing could be further from Cohen’s idea of correlation than Buber’s concept of relation. Cohen would have shuddered intellectually at the thought of an I-Thou relation with God. For him it would have been “materialization,” which he equated with pantheism, or “personalization,” which was the Christian aberration. That correlation was nothing of an existential nature between the individual human being in his full humanity and God, one could have guessed from the fact that in its original form it is not between God and man, but between God and Nature. According to Cohen, religion would have no use for God in his uniqueness, “if his correlation with man, and that means first with Nature, could not be secured.” The correlation with nature is necessary as a precondition to that with man.<sup>53</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Begriff</i>, p. 45, also pp. 50–51.</i> Since man is part of nature, without which man could not be, God’s correlation with nature must precede his correlation with man. On the other hand, in its ultimate form, correlation exists between God and mankind. We have seen how, according to Cohen, the God-idea preserves for ethics the possibility of eternal realization by guaranteeing the continuity of Nature. In view of this Cohen maintains: “In order that mankind may be effective according to the eternity of the ideal, ethics requires the God-idea. The correlation means here that between God and mankind.”<sup>54</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 60.</i> All this shows how thoroughly Rosenzweig must have misunderstood on this point <i>both</i> his master and his friend. Just as Buber’s I-Thou relation with God would have been intellectually anathema for Cohen, so would Buber have thought it meaningless to see his “relation” in the image of correlation between God and nature and God and mankind. Cohen also says that God is Being but has no existence (<i>Dasein</i>).<sup>55</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 47.</i> His existence is absolutely beyond the reach of man. Quite obviously the dialectical situation that relates man to God involves God in existence. Buber does indeed say that while God is the Absolute and as such not a person, there is a personal aspect to his absolute Being.<sup>56</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. for instance, Martin Buber’s essay, “Religion and Philosophy” in his <i>Eclipse of God.</i></i> By denying existence to God’s Being Cohen excludes every possibility of a “personal” aspect of the Absolute. But man can have no relation whatever with Absolute Being on the level of his own personal existence."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.52",<b>3.</b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.53","What then is Cohen’s correlation? In <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i> Cohen warns us against “materializing” or “personifying” the correlation. The correlation has to be understood conceptually, it is an abstract link between God and man. Spirit alone is the connecting link of the correlation; but he hastens to add that the function of the “holy spirit” has “only logical meaning.” We have to recognize the union (<i>Vereinigung</i>) with logical strictness, but not visualize it in the manner of some vague connection.”<sup>57</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 122.</i> Now, what is this abstract, logical link of the correlation? Nothing is given explicitly in the form of an explanation in <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i>. On the other hand, in <i>Der Begriff der Religion</i> Cohen takes pains to explain what is meant by “the logical union.” Only in the light of what is said there is it possible to understand his theory of the correlation as it appears in his later work. Far from being a new fundamental concept (<i>der neue Grundbegriff</i>) as Rosenzweig thought, Cohen states explicitly, “the correlation is a scientific ‘basic category’ [<i>Grundform</i>] of thinking in our terminology of judgment.” Indeed, it has its place in his <i>Logik</i>. The general name of the “ground category” of correlation, says Cohen, is purpose. Two entities may be related to each other by a purpose that binds them to each other. The purpose is a purely logical one, a logical requirement. Thus, for instance Cohen defines the relatedness between past and future. According to him, time is always future-directed. Out of this future-directedness emerges the past, backwards. Every moment is a relation point of anticipation. It exists “in this correlation” says Cohen.<sup>58</sup><i class=""footnote"">Hermann Cohen, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 133.</i> Correlation is a logical principle that relates two ideas in such a manner that their meaning is determined in logical mutuality. This is the ultimate meaning of correlation also in Cohen’s philosophy of religion. With this meaning in mind does he say: “We posit a relation of purpose between God and man as well as between God and Nature.”"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.54","Cohen’s philosophy demands the idea of God for the creation and preservation of Nature and man; it demands it as the idea of purpose; “… what one wants with creation or preservation is brought to its determination in the positing of this purpose, the correlation between God and Nature.”<sup>59</sup><i class=""footnote"">Der Begriff, p. 47.<br>60. Ibid.</i> We may now be in a better position to understand what Cohen meant when he said that God was holy for the sake of man. So is He also the paradigm of action for the sake of man. Becoming is related to Being by correlation, i.e., the idea of purpose. The continuity of nature is guaranteed so that the eternity of ethical endeavor may be possible. This is the meaning of the correlation between God and nature. This guarantee of infinite ethical realization is the correlation between God and mankind. Thus Cohen would say: “If, accordingly, I want to formulate the idea of God, I have to establish an intended purpose between God and man.”<sup>59</sup><i class=""footnote"">Der Begriff, p. 47.<br>60. Ibid.</i> This means, then, that the idea of man is contained in the God-idea, just as the idea of God is contained in the idea of man. God defines man and man defines God because of the bond of purpose between them. In essence this is a ramification of the fundamental idea of creation. We heard Cohen describe creation as the arch-attribute of God, contained within the very concept of God’s uniqueness. God’s uniqueness is conceived with the purpose of providing the ground for Becoming. Without uniqueness of Being, Being and Becoming would merge into each other and the result would be pantheism. In the light of such an understanding of the idea of correlation could Cohen write that God was determined by His correlation to man as man was determined by his correlation to God. The mutuality of the correlation is achieved by the bond of purpose between them. But the correlation must not be “materialized” or “personalized.” It is only abstract and logical."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.55","One might wonder how this meaning of the correlation can be maintained in its specifically religious significance in the correlation in which man, realizing his sin, awaits God’s forgiveness. Yet, even here Cohen insists on its logical character. Only man is to be thought as the active factor in the correlation. “God, on the other hand, is thought of as the goal, at which man’s own moral activity is directed…. All activity lies with man.” <sup>61</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Begriff</i>, pp. 63–64.</i> Even in this specific religious form of the correlation, mutuality consists in man’s directedness at God as the goal; in the realization of his failure and in the activity of <i>t’shuba</i>, “return,” man in the correlation is all alone. Cohen exclaims: “How could God enter into association (<i>Gemeinschaft</i>) with man!”"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.56","We have to reach the conclusion that in Cohen’s religion of reason God is nothing more than a methodological idea. Even in the correlation man remains all by himself with his ideas and thoughts, though they are God-directed as the goal of his relatedness. Man is forever alone; God is only the object of his thinking. Or if we wish to use Buber’s terminology, this God is an It."

"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.58",<b>1.</b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.59","The religion of reason has universal validity and cannot be limited to the Jews. That it was developed from the sources of Judaism was merely a coincidence. Yet, since it does claim to be an interpretation of the sources of Judaism, the question, to what extent may this interpretation be accepted, is inescapable. It would seem to us that Cohen’s religious philosophy, as distinct from his personal religion (about which see later), is not a philosophical reinterpretation of his personal religion but its philosophical rejection."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.60","The inescapable truth about Judaism is that it sees God as personal and as involved and acting in history. Whatever its philosophical validity, creation in Judaism is a volitional act and not a mere logical precondition for all activity. And so, also, does God act in history, in the life of people and of nations. Revelation is not just the truth that human beings perceive through their rational ability, but—however it may be interpreted—an actual event occurring between God and this human being or this people. Independent of the problem of whether the good is good because of its own intrinsic nature or because it is commanded by God, it is not true to say of Judaism what Cohen says of the religion of reason, namely, that it speaks of the laws of God because it considers the will of reason as the law of God.<sup>62</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 383.</i> This may be consistent if one sees, as Cohen did, revelation in man’s reasoning faculty. It is, however, not true of Judaism, whose concept of revelation is fundamentally different from his. The autonomy of the will does indeed raise a serious problem in any philosophy of a religion that recognizes a law of God, but this problem cannot be solved by simply declaring the will of reason to be the revealed law of God."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.61","As we have seen, in Cohen’s religious philosophy God has only Being but not existence. Whatever its philosophical or theological interpretation, in Judaism God is so intensely present that his existence practically conceals his Being. The genuine religious concern is much more with His existence than with His Being. His presence in history is the source of all religious problematics. It is, of course, correct to say, as Cohen does, that the revelation at Sinai has been spiritualized by the Bible itself, but it is simply not true that with this spiritualization Sinai has been placed in the heart—or, as he should have said more consistently, in the mind—of man. Notwithstanding all spiritualization, Judaism remained inseparable from Sinai as an event in space and time. Eliminate Sinai from the mountain and the desert and you have lost Judaism’s share in life and history."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.62","It is rather significant that Cohen never makes mention of the exodus. Now, any kind of rationalism may have its problem with the exodus story. It is, of course, possible to spiritualize it. But no matter what one’s personal attitude to it may be, it is not possible to eliminate the exodus from Judaism as an actual awareness of divine concern with the destiny of the Jewish people become manifest in the actuality of a historical situation. The very first of the “Ten Words” states: “I am the Eternal, your God, who has led you out from the land of Egypt.” Here lies one of the vital roots of Judaism. A religion of reason that disregards its importance in the self-understanding of Judaism and in its world view is just not drawn from the sources of Judaism. In the Introduction to which we have referred repeatedly, Rosenzweig mentions a <i>seder</i> (the Passover festive meal) that the young “Dr. phil.,” at the time completely estranged from Judaism, attended in his father’s house. The bright young man was most appreciative of his father who, in order to make his son more comfortable at the family table, went over the first part of the <i>Haggada</i> (the telling of the Passover story) in only twenty minutes “without referring to a single Jewish emotion.” It would seem to us that even at the conclusion of his intellectual return Cohen still did not know what to do with the Passover story philosophically."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.63","Cohen was convinced that in numerous ways his religion of reason was anticipated by medieval Jewish philosophy and especially by Maimonides. Cohen already made the observation in the <i>Ethik</i> that Maimonides, in true religiosity, presented us with the thought that God was an idea. His argument there was that a person is determined by life, and Maimonides dared to exclude life from the essence of God.<sup>63</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ethik</i>, p. 453.</i> It is surprising how a man of the philosophical genius of a Hermann Cohen could have misunderstood Maimonides so thoroughly. The author of the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> excluded not only life from the essence of God, but dared to go even further in a statement in which he said that God was one without oneness and existing without existence.<sup>64</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Guide for the Perplexed</i>, I. 47.</i> This, too, of course, could be misinterpreted as meaning that he was unique and not just one, that he had Being, but not existence (<i>Dasein</i>). But quite obviously, it is not what Maimonides meant to say. He was saying that none of the terms derived from human experience apply to God. He cannot be described in human language. The “one” of our experience is part of a series, God is not. “Existence” is always created, or as Maimonides would say, it is <i>efshar hamziut</i>, it is a possibility relative to a cause; God is <i>m’huyab hamziut</i>, he is absolute and exists of his own uncreated intrinsic necessity. In the same sense does he exclude life from the essence of God. Life as a matter of human experience is created, it is relative to a cause. Not such is the “life” of God. Following his own characteristic formulation, Maimonides could have said: God has “life” without life; He is “person” without being a person."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.64","It never occurred to Maimonides to suggest that God was an idea. There is no trace of it in all his work. On the contrary, Maimonides’ God, like that of the Bible, acts in history. Maimonides, in the analysis of his theory of the negative attributes, explains omnipotence as not lacking in power to produce the universe. Cohen sees in it an affirmation of his own idea of creation as the logical category of the “ground.” He believes Maimonides says that God being self-sufficient to create the All, is the logical origin of all activity.<sup>65</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 73.</i> Nothing of the kind! Anyone who is familiar, for instance, with Maimonides discussion of the idea of creation cannot miss the fact that for Maimonides creation is an act performed by divine power and not just the logical ground for all activity of Becoming. One may recall here his argument against the Aristotelian concept of an uncreated world. According to Aristotle God is not free to as much as be able to lengthen the wing of a fly.<sup>66</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Guide for the Perplexed</i>, II, 22.</i> One would have to say that he could not do that according to Cohen’s God-idea either. It is significant that there is no room for miracles, for direct divine intervention in the destinies of man, in the religion of reason. Now, however rationalistic one may be regarding this matter, still the truth is that with Maimonides the biblical record of the miracles was the ultimate reason for his espousing the idea of creation <i>ex nihilo</i>.<sup>67</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid.</i> This is true of all rationalistic Jewish philosophers of the Middle Ages. Notwithstanding their rationalism, they accepted God as reality of Being with personlike actual involvement in the world and the affairs of man."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.65","Cohen reinterpreted Maimonides’ attributes of action as a paradigm for human action. According to Cohen, as we saw, Being does not act. But undoubtedly what Maimonides means by attributes of action are actual volitional deeds of God within the space-time continuum. In innumerable passages in the <i>Guide</i> God appears as an intelligent being that acts freely and with choice and discretion. Whether one is personally able to accept the idea is irrelevant. This is Maimonides and such are the medieval Jewish philosophers."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.66","Cohen also says that the fact that in medieval Jewish philosophy the <i>muskalot rishonot</i>, the innate categories of thought, were accepted as equal in authority to the contents of revelation proves that revelation was understood as correlation by way of reason.<sup>68</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, 96.</i> It is just not so. Because the content of revelation was true, therefore all truth, even the not revealed one, was equal in its truth value. Yet, reason remained reason and revelation was revelation. Saadia and Maimonides both believed that the contents of revelation—or part of it, according to Saadia—could be discovered by reason alone. This presented them with a serious problem: if this were so, what need was there for revelation?<sup>69</sup><i class=""footnote"">See the <i>Guide</i> and <i>Emunot Ve’Deot.</i></i> Their preoccupation with the problem proves that they did not identify revelation with correlation by way of reason but saw in it an actual event of history. Maimonides was of the opinion that as to the first two of the “Ten Words” the people and Moses were on the same level, for they express purely rational truth, which was grasped by the people by the same intellectual method as by Moses himself. This might be seen as supporting Cohen’s view of revelation. Yet, Maimonides also believed that the other eight words were revealed to Moses alone, while the people were actually hearing the divine voice, which however reached them without intelligible articulation.<sup>70</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Guide.</i></i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.67","Finally, let us consider what Maimonides has to say about man’s love for God. “What is the way of loving Him? As man meditates on His wondrous and great deeds and creatures and beholds in them His wisdom, which is incomparable and infinite, he will be overwhelmed immediately by love and he will praise and exalt. He will greatly desire to know the Great Name, as David said: My Soul thirsteth for God, for the living God!”<sup>71</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Hilkhot Y’sodei Hatora</i>, II. 2.</i> This is rather different from Cohen’s love of God as the love of the ethical ideal, as different as is the God-idea of the religion of reason from Maimonides’ “living” God. Rosenzweig tells us in the Introduction that when Cohen, in the early days of 1918, showed him the first pages of <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i>, he praised it in terms similar to those in which the circle around Virgil praised the appearance of the <i>Aeneid;</i> he made special reference to Maimonides, to which Cohen answered: Yes, I have been thinking the same: “The Rambam (the traditional way of referring to Maimonides, Our teacher, Moses the Son of Maimon) will be satisfied.” How moving the blind loyalty of the disciple! How melancholy the old man’s desire to return!"

"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.69","The universalism of the religion of reason is also applied to the people of Israel. Israel, the people of monotheism, is a universalistic people, for monotheism itself is universalistic. The one God is the originator of the one mankind. Only in monotheisn is mankind one. The purpose of Israel is to strive for the unity of a monotheistic mankind. Its goal in history is to dissolve itself into the unity of all nations. Messianism is the promise that this all-embracing unity will be achieved. Messianism is the religious concept of the guarantee of nature as a lasting correlate to continuous ethical realization which must end in the triumph of the good. The Jewish state of old was too narrow a compass for monotheistic messianism. It had to go. The state soon fell apart. It had little significance for this people, says Cohen. In the <i>Ethik</i> he even declared that the state was not just lost; it was given up by the prophets. Already there Cohen stated that the meaning of the religion of the prophets, upon which the continued existence of Judaism rests, was to prepare mankind’s union of states through the messianic idea.<sup>72</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, pp. 173, 296; <i>Ethik</i>, p. 495.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.70","The people of Israel was needed for the establishment of monotheism. This is the meaning of the chosenness of Israel. It symbolizes God’s love of mankind.<sup>73</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 173.</i> The idea is also formulated somewhat differently. The election of Israel has a twofold meaning. Historically, it served the purpose of arousing the national consciousness for the historic mission. Its higher symbolic significance lies in the fact that it prepared Israel for its messianic mission, for its elevation into mankind.<sup>74</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 306.</i> Election and chosenness are, of course, traditional terminology. With Cohen they cannot mean a divine act in history. Since revelation is rational enlightenment, to be chosen means to recognize and accept the idea of monotheism as one’s truth and mission."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.71","How far removed Cohen’s ideas on the subject of Israel and messianism are from the way the Jewish people understood itself and its historic way one may judge by the fact that the word exile does not occur once in his discussion. Of course, if the state is an unnatural framework for monotheism, statelessness is not exile; on the contrary, one might say it is the ideal situation for the Jew.<sup>75</sup><i class=""footnote"">At a later time, Arnold Toynbee was to call the pale of enforced Jewish settlement in czarist Russia the natural condition for the Jew.</i> There is Jewish isolation, but it is enforced upon Israel from without because of the, as yet, unrealized ideal of worldwide monotheism. The isolation, the unrealized idea of mankind, brings suffering upon Israel. Israel suffers as the symbol of mankind, it suffers for the sake of mankind. And this is another aspect of its chosenness.<sup>76</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 511.</i> Cohen also says that suffering became Israel’s life force. With others it is an indication of decline and the end; but Israel’s world mission begins with its martyrdom. Suffering is a means of self-sanctification. It is a symbolical expression of reconciliation with God. Suffering is the precondition of redemption. It liberates man from the “sediments” of his empirical humanity. It is his ascent to the ideal moment in which he becomes himself. Redemption need not be postponed to the end of days; it is attached to every moment of suffering. Every moment of suffering is also a moment of redemption. Thus, suffering is no contradiction to Jewish survival; it is its very basis.<sup>77</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 277.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.72","In the various discussions of the subject of suffering, Cohen becomes almost poetic in its praise. He practically offers a philosophical ode to it. Yet, notwithstanding some significant words he did say about Jewish martyrology through history, one wonders whether he had a personal realization of what was involved in it for the untold masses—and not just individual saints—of the martyrs of Israel. How much understanding did he have of the vitality and staying power of the Jew and his faith, if he saw in Jewish suffering the life force that secures its survival? He does acknowledge that Israel is a priestly nation, not a nation like any other, it is a people of faith; not as Israel, but as an anticipation of mankind. Israel is unique—for the time being—because the others have not yet become what they are supposed to be, mankind. One might say, in accordance with Cohen, that Israel is a negative nation; its uniqueness is imposed upon it by the inadequacy of others. In essence, there is no such thing as a Jewish identity. His universalism is so world-estranged that he thinks it necessary to disclaim any trace of anything specifically Jewish even in Jewish martyrology. He writes: “Jewish bravery is … simply a virtue of history, of the historical man and not of the individual. And messianism breaks the backbone of nationalism so that the bravery of the Jews not be degraded to a mere national virtue. The human bravery of the Jew is as historical virtue, the virtue of bravery, human bravery, the bravery of the truth of the religious ideal of mankind.”<sup>78</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 517.</i> Poor Cohen! How afraid he was that he might find in his Jewish people something specifically Jewish."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.73","Cohen’s interpretation of Judaism and Israel is, of course, a philosopher’s attempt to lend scholarly dignity to the typical assimilationist ideology of German reform Jewry of his generation. We might forgive him his time-boundness. Nor is there any need, at this late hour in history, to discuss with any seriousness the assimilationist fervor of a former reform Jewry. All that is by now, at least intellectually as well as ethically, dead as the dodo. Yet, even at this hour he should be taken to task for his scholarly and philosophical inadequacies and inconsistencies."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.74","But for one vague reference to a complete dissolution of all national distinctions, Cohen sees as the goal of the messianic idea not the disappearance of all states but their organization in a union of states. In this respect, however, he did exempt Israel from the universal order to be. From the viewpoint of messianism history is the future. “The future becomes the reality of history. Therefore, only a spiritual world can fulfill this national existence,” meaning the national existence of the Jewish people.<sup>79</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 296.</i> Cohen understood very well that just as man does not live by bread alone, neither can he live by the spirit alone. It was for this reason that in his <i>Ethik</i> he introduced the idea of God in order to guarantee the continuity of nature, full well realizing that without nature the ethical deed was not possible. Later on, in <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i> he very wisely stated that man required the connection with nature. “He is not just spirit of holiness.” In his “spirtualization” of religion Cohen had some trouble explaining how one could pray for such mundane things as bread to eat, clothes to wear, for health and bodily well-being. He solved the problem by the ingenious idea that the religious demands the empirical foundations of the I, as the “negative conditions” of its existence. It needs the biological and historical individual. Thus man is given care for his empirical, biological, and historical ego. Thus, he may pray for the earthly blessings of life without shame.<sup>80</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 445.</i> It is rather strange that having recognized all this, he still wanted only a spiritual world for Israel alone, as if man, and especially a people, could live in the realm of the purely spiritual. How little understanding he had for the essential feature of Judaism one may judge by his comment that in prayer the concept of God becomes the Kingdom of God. The praying community is the forerunner of the messianic kingdom of the future. It accepts the yoke of the Kingdom daily, thus preparing the future.<sup>81</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 455.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.75","It is rather strange to receive such an interpretation from a knowledgeable Jew who considers himself a socialist at that. He even makes reference to the majestic <i>Alenu</i> prayer, in which the Jew expresses his hope for the establishment of the world as a Kingdom of God. The truth is that in prayer the Jew prays for it, hopes for it, but it is not in prayer that the Kingdom is established. It is not the praying community that builds the Kingdom but the doing community, the active one, the living, historical, community. Even though a people may forsake all hedonism, all power history, even though it may seek as its goal some form of ethical and spiritual realization, it needs “nature,” it demands for its “negative condition” the empirical foundation of its spirituality, as long as it desires to remain on this earth with the goal of establishing the real world as a Kingdom of God. The entire problematic of Jewish existence, its authenticity, derives from it. Cohen’s Kingdom of God, realized in prayer is Christian, not Jewish. Reserving the spiritual world for Israel, he proved that he did not understand the historical Israel. His Israel is a construct of his private predilection."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.76","Cohen senses that his radically universalistic interpretation of messianism does not fully harmonize with the sources from which he has drawn it. He cannot help confessing that “but of course messianism is forever burdened with the providence for the believing people (<i>Glaubensvolk</i>), for the servant of God. And thus this conflict continued to remain in the prayers too. The return to Zion, the rebuilding of the Sanctuary, together with the sacrifices, is most intimately associated with messianic universalism. Therefore, the latter had inevitably to spiritualize and to broaden the former.”<sup>82</sup><i class=""footnote"">See, for instance, this author’s essay, “Jewish Universalism” in <i>History and the Idea of Mankind</i>, edited by W. Warren Wagar, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1971.</i> This, of course, is quite an understatement for the rejection of the idea of return to Zion. More important than that many prayers of the synagogue are for return to Zion and for the restoration of Jerusalem is the fact that all the writings of the prophets are saturated wih the hope and the promises of Israel’s return to Zion. There is no biblical prophetism without the promise and the assurance of return to the ancient homeland. Universalism and affirmation of a particular Jewish destiny inseparable from the land of Israel are the main themes of the prophets. Most important of all, however, is to understand that the two are found in the Bible together most naturally, without the slightest notion of a conflict between them."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.77","It is not messianic monotheism that contradicts the idea of return to Zion, but the assimilationist interpretation of it. There is authentic universalism in messianism, as there is in it also, not as a burden but as an enthusiastic espousal, the vindication of the people of Israel, redeemed in Zion and Jerusalem. He who sees only the universalism does not understand its messianic version; he who sees only particularism does not understand Judaism and its people of Israel. The unique character of Jewish messianism lies in the fact that in it universalism and Jewish reality on empirical, biological and historical foundations, dwell together harmoniously. When one asks the question how that is possible, one is just trying the door handle to the antechamber of Judaism.<sup>82</sup><i class=""footnote"">See, for instance, this author’s essay, “Jewish Universalism” in <i>History and the Idea of Mankind</i>, edited by W.

"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.78",<b>V. P<small>HILOSOPHY AND</small> R<small>ELIGION</small></b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.79",<b>1.</b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.80","We believe that our discussion of the religion of reason shows that Cohen has not developed any new philosophical insights in order to establish “reason’s share” (<i>Vernunftanteil</i>) in religion. He uses some of the basic concepts of his <i>Logik</i> for the purposes of establishing his philosophy of religion. We have seen how Being is thought as God as a <i>logical</i> requirement for the origin of Becoming—a thought which conforms to the thesis of Cohen’s <i>Logik</i> that thinking is the thinking of origins. As he also says: “All pure knowledge (<i>Erkenntnis</i>) must be variations of the principle of origin.”<sup>83</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Logik</i>, p. 33.</i> Whatever he says about creation (that includes also revelation) as the “arch-attribute” of Being and “inherence” in it, and whatever else follows from the idea of the philosophy of religion, is the application of Cohen’s interpretation of Kant’s category of the substance as a precondition of all relational concepts. There is clear indication of that in <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i>.<sup>84</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 69.</i> We shall quote here the relevant passage from the <i>Logik</i>. “The substance now becomes analogous to the subject. As the subject has to await its predicates if anything is to become of it, this also happens to the substance. The nimbus of the absolute is taken from it. It leads the dance of the [concept] of relation. It has to await the relations which alone can make anything of it. It has its correlate in the [concept] of inherence. The accidents and modi are within it; and only insofar as they are in it, can anything come of it. It is only the precondition for the relations, which though in need of it as precondition, have yet to develop the precondition to its contents and significance (<i>Inhalt und Gehalt</i>).”<sup>85</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Logik</i>, p. 186.</i> In this passage is contained the gist of “the share of reason” in Cohen’s religion of reason. As the substance, so too Being as God lost its “nimbus of the absolute.” This God is nothing without its attribute of creation, which as creation of nature and creation of man in reason gives us all the other attributes. As we saw, the “arch-attribute” of creation inheres in the uniqueness of the God. Thus, this God also leads “the dance of all relation.” He is the precondition of Becoming, but it is Becoming that develops “the contents and meaning” of God as precondition, for it is through Becoming that we know what is posited by creation, the inhering fundamental attribute."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.81","Needless to say the idea of correlation which plays such an important part in the religion of reason has been lifted from here. The substance and its accidents and modi are logically related to each other. The substance is the precondition that is, in its turn, defined by the accidents and their modi that develop its contents and significance. That is the essence of the correlation that Cohen described as established by the concept of purpose. The purpose is the purely logical one of mutual dependence and definition. In the same way, Becoming is the correlate of Being; God and Nature, God and Man are in correlation. This is the ultimate meaning of the statement that correlation is neither material, nor personal, but purely logical."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.82","Even when Cohen believes that he is affirming the phrase from the daily prayers of the Jew that states of God that in his goodness he renews daily the works of creation, he is only dressing up in religious language a principle of logical thought as he understands it. In the <i>Logik</i> Cohen maintained that the law of the principle of origin has to accompany every phase of pure thinking. He gives the following example to prove his point: “If mathematics as the mathematics of science is to determine motion, which runs in restless progression, it has to fix the origin of this motion. This origin is not only valid for the beginning of the motion, but every progression of it has to emerge anew from the same origin.”<sup>86</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 104.</i> Since “the origin” is a principle of thought, it can, of course, not stand only at the beginning of the motion which is logically interpreted. The origin as a beginning would be an event in time. Origin as the logical principle of the mathematically formulated principle of motion has to accompany every progression of the motion anew, otherwise the progression could not endure mathematically. In the same way, Being as God as the logical requirement of Becoming has to accompany every moment of Becoming in order to render it logically conceivable. It is for this reason that Cohen says that creation is not a material relation; Becoming does not issue from Being, it does not emanate from it, it is not contained in it in a material sense. God has only logical significance for Becoming."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.83","Even in his interpretation of messianic history we find the religious formulation of Cohen’s definition of time only from the <i>Logik</i>. We had occasion to refer to his concept of time earlier. Let us consider it once more. Time according to the <i>Logik</i> is anticipation of the future. Says he: “The future contains and reveals the character of time. The past is strung and graded to the anticipated future. It did not come first. First came the future….” Or in another context: “The proper activity of time is future-oriented, which it anticipates.”<sup>87</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 131, 133.</i> In much the same vein does he speak of the age of the fulfillment of the messianic ideal toward which all history is moving. History is no mere repetition of the past as with the heathens, no mere “travelogue,” but movement toward a goal—thus time becomes the future.<sup>88</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 293.</i> This future is the thread on which all past is “strung” and thus receives its position."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.84","The question arises: what is the religious value of pouring principles of logical thinking into containers marked with religious labels? This God, this creation, this revelation, this correlation, this messianic future, are they anything else but methodological requirements of logical thinking? Of course, if one fully embraces the idealistic point of view and identifies thought and reality, something might be gained from it all for religion. However, if such identification is not accepted, Cohen’s religion of reason remains a cold and soulless construct without the lifeblood of reality."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.85",<b>2.</b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.86","Cohen is so deeply wedded to his pure ethical past that one wonders whether he fully gained the objectives that he planned for when he was moving from his <i>Ethik</i> to his “religion of reason.” One of his objectives was to find a place for the individuum, the I, the person, standing by himself. It would seem to us that he established the individual human being qua individual only to lose him again to the old ethical concept of the individual as mankind. This happens in the tortuous interpretation of the idea of immortality that Cohen receives from religion."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.87","In his analysis of this idea, Cohen uses some traditional language on the subject. He speaks of the spirit that God gives and that returns to God after death. But God being unique, how can soul return to God? And would not man lose his self-identity by such return? What then is return after death? Says Cohen: “… nothing but the regaining and the affirming of the origin which was given to the spirit of man.”<sup>89</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 360.</i> But what does this mean? The return to the historic existence of the spirit that has God as its origin. In other words, only by returning to Becoming does the individual soul return to God, for only within Becoming does it regain and affirm God as Being, the origin of the spirit of man. The meaning of this may be put as follows: The task of the soul is self-sanctification by way of ethical realization. The task, however, is eternal. It can therefore, not end with death. But how does it continue after death? Every step in the endeavor of self-sanctification is a moment of the upswing of the spirit. At every such moment the soul is separated from its empirical being. Thus, the union with the body is transitory. The development of the soul is an infinite process because the task is infinite. The development is, therefore, not tied to the body. It is rather related to the infinite development of matter, guaranteed by messianism, as the negative condition for the infinite task of sanctification. Messianism, guaranteeing the infinite development of the human race in history, provides the “eternal” connection of the soul with matter. Such a connection is the necessary condition for the development of the soul’s potentialities (<i>Seelenanlagen</i>) by way of heredity. Because of messianic development man is freed from the limitation to the biological or even historical individual being."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.88","Thus, Cohen can write: “In the endless development of the human race towards its ideal spirit of holiness alone may the individual soul achieve its immortality. It [the soul] is always only the upswing, always only the totality of the upswings that are gathered together in the endless development.”<sup>90</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 362.</i> What, now, is immortality? The eternal preservation of each individual “upswing” within the infinity of messianic development in history. For this reason Cohen would interpret the biblical phrase of “coming to one’s fathers and being gathered to one’s people” as immortality, which has the meaning of the continued historical existence of the human being in the continuity of its people.<sup>91</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 354.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.89","Since the individual soul is identical with the sum total of the “upswings” in the eternal process of messianic development as it is reached at any moment in history, Cohen calls the ethical individual the <i>Allheitsindividuum</i>, the “universal individual.” In this manner the individual does not disappear, but accomplishes its perfection in the historical development as indicated by messianism. Without such development of the human race the ethical concept of man would not be realizable.<sup>92</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 363.</i> In other words, immortality is the preservation of every soul, of every upswing in the process of endless self-sanctification, in the sum total of all the upswings of the human race in the course of its messianic history."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.90","All this, of course, is extremely close, and in essence identical, with the concept of man as given in the <i>Ethik</i>. Once again man has been separated from his empirical, biophysical existence and has become a sample of mankind in the process of its realization. If the function of religion is to redeem the individual soul from its failings and thus establish the I, the person, this rather forced idea of immortality has lost the person again and returned man into the womb of mankind be it even by way of the <i>Allheitsindividuum</i>, the “universal individual.” At all costs Cohen is holding on to the religious idea of immortality, but empties it of all religious contents."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.91","No less tortuous and artificial is his analysis of love, for the sake of which he invoked religion to broaden the field of ethics. As we saw, ethics could not fully approve of it. From Cohen’s ethical point of view, love was not an ideal, since it was not universal. It was always relative to a smaller group than the totality (<i>Allheit</i>) of mankind. But how was one to deal with the poor and the disadvantaged in society? Ethics could only offer honor and respect, which however could not relieve the sufferings of the poor. With the help of religion Cohen validated pity and sympathy as the proper response to human suffering, affects which were eventually sublimated into love. Is this really the love that is meant by the biblical command, “Thou shalt love Thy neighbor as thyself?” Is this really love? Does one really get to love by the roundabout way of pity and sympathy? Is love only a sociopolitical ideal, to become reality in response to the plight of the poor in society?<sup>93</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. also Cohen’s rather tortuous elevation of love from a “second-grade” virtue allowing it to merge with respect, the “first-grade” virtue of ethics in <i>Der Begriff</i>, pp. 83–84.</i> Cohen’s concept of immortality and love shows that to the end he was attempting to tie religion to the apron strings of ethics and thus determine the meaning of religious ideas."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.92",<b>3.</b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.93","The truth is that, there is quite a bit more in “the religion of reason” than what may claim admission on the grounds that it represents “reason’s share” in religion. There are a number of concepts of a purely religious character which forced their way into Cohen’s religious philosophy, which “reason’s share” in religion can hardly legitimize. We have discussed earlier how the religious idea of God differs for Cohen from the God-idea which he introduced into his <i>Ethik</i>. There God was a postulate that was required as the logical basis for the continuity of nature which is needed for ethical realization. Ethics cannot go beyond the postulate. Religion, however, through its trust in God, provides the reliance on the messianic realization of the ethical God-idea."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.94","Now, what he says about religion is quite correct. It does know of the trust in God and, therefore, it has confidence in the messianic future. But can Cohen’s idea of God, as it appears in the religion of reason justify such trust and confidence? We do not think so. What is given to us is Becoming. This Becoming demands for its explanation the logical ground of Being, which is identified as God. To expect of this God to guarantee the eternity of Becoming is a logical fallacy. Being can only be used insofar as Becoming requires an origin in rest. It can, however, add nothing to the nature and character of Becoming. It is from Becoming that Being is concluded and it is not from Being that Becoming derives. If Becoming does not on its own reveal its quality of eternal duration, the Being concluded from it cannot show it either. One is reminded of Kant’s argument against the cosmological proof for the existence of God. Since it is from the cosmos of man’s finite experience that one concludes the existence of God, there is no reason to assume that God of a finite world is infinite."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.95","On a number of occasions Cohen speaks of trust in God. This, of course, is a familiar religious concept; but it implies faith in a personal God. But Being as the logical ground of Becoming cannot serve as a personal God. Cohen himself warns often enough against such interpretation. The correlation is logical and not personal. There is no legitimate reason for trust in God and reliance on him in Cohen’s religion of reason, yet it was given an important function within it. It is vital for the idea of forgiveness. We have seen how important it was for Cohen to find a solution to the problem of man’s ethical failure. Ethics could not help the man who was alone with his sin. Man enters on the path of “return” by self-sanctification whose goal is God. As we saw, it was the God of the paradigm, the <i>Urbild</i>, of action."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.96","Cohen is right in saying that man alone could not bring about his liberation from sin. It is essential for our understanding of God to know that God alone is the redeemer. This indeed, is the meaning of God in Judaism. What we are unable to see is how one may trust in God’s forgiveness if God is the ground of Becoming, the logically required origin of nature as well as the logically required origin of the human spirit that conceives him as the ideal norm for human action? How does a paradigm forgive, how does it redeem? A God who is not in some “personal” way involved in history cannot do it. Cohen quotes the biblical “And God said, I have forgiven according to your words.” But the God of the Bible is a personal God; he stands in a personal relation to man. He “speaks,” whatever the non-anthropomorphic meaning of the phrase may be. He communicates and “says”: I have forgiven! But the God of Cohen’s religion of reason does not act, does not communicate. He is the silent ground of the All. Forgiveness is an event that happens between God and man. But where God is only the “goal” of human endeavor, nothing is happening between the two. In vain does Cohen comment that in forgiveness God as the Good One has to perform a “personlike” deed of goodness.<sup>94</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Die Religion</i>, p. 245.</i> The God of his religion of reason cannot do it. It is more like man, conceiving of goodness as an act worthy of the ideal of goodness, forgiving himself."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.97","It would seem to us that having locked the front door against a personal God, Cohen unwittingly let him enter through the back door. He even quotes the Hebrew terms of <i>ḥesed</i>, lovingkindness, and <i>raḥamim</i>, mercy, and declares that God’s love is not intellectual. It has to be an effect, since it has to correspond to sympathy.<sup>95</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 175.</i> This, of course, is in agreement with everything he has said about the love of God for man from the point of view of “reason’s share” in religion. Accordingly, we know of God’s love for man through the pity which he awakens in our heart by his laws of social justice, which are revealed to us through our reason.<sup>96</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 185.</i> Surely, this kind of a logically derived knowledge of God’s “love” from what man discovers in his own mind should not be called an affect. It has nothing in common with the biblical <i>ḥesed</i> and <i>raḥamim</i>. “Affects” are the prerogatives of a personal God, but should not be ascribed to Being, the ground and the paradigm. Cohen even admits the idea of God as the ruler and judge of the universe. He acknowledges the majesty of the thought as it found its expression in the liturgy of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, the New Year, which is the Day of God’s World Judgment.<sup>97</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 468-469.</i> The idea was precious to Cohen. Yet, on the basis of the “share of reason” in religion as he understood it, there is no place for it in his religion of reason."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.98",<b>4.</b>
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.99","Perhaps the greatest inconsistency in Cohen’s religious philosophy may be discerned in the various ways he sees the relation between God and man. In the development of the theme of revelation he finds it necessary to make the point that since God is spirit, man too must be spirit. This is supposed to be the result of the correlation. This is, of course, a <i>non sequitur</i>. If the conclusion were valid, we would have to say that nature is spirit too, on account of the correlation between God and nature. However, apart from that, it is surprising to hear him say that while, of course, there could be no identity between the spirit of God and that of man, they would have to be comparable to each other. Even in this connection Cohen emphasizes the uniqueness of God, which is inviolable, yet he allows the spirit of man to be similar to God, who is all spirit.<sup>98</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 104.</i> We recall what he said about the uniqueness of God. God alone has Being, everything else is Non-being. The world has existence (<i>Dasein</i>) but not Being. This, of course, means that Being and Becoming are not comparable. One would have to conclude that if God as Being is spirit, man as having his place within Becoming would have to be non-spirit. The very language that Cohen uses here, saying that God gave man his spirit, is personalistic. Quite clearly, Cohen was attempting to preserve the biblical idea of man’s having been created in the image of God."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.100","Actually, if we follow Cohen further, we have to assume a form of identity between the spirit of man and that of God. Religion does speak of the laws of God. This seems to contradict a fundamental principle of the ethics of pure will, hallowed by the authority of Kant himself, that of the autonomy of the will. Does not the recognition of divine laws contradict the ethical autonomy of the will? Cohen explains: “The fact that religion speaks of the laws does not contradict the principle of the autonomy of the will, since it is the will of reason that the religion of reason considers to be the law of God.” <sup>99</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 237.</i>"
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.101","The idea is repeated in a number of passages. God’s commandment is the religious expression that parallels the fundamental principle of autonomy in ethics. The moral law, which is the law of God, is also the law of moral reason. The moral law, declares Cohen in good Kantian tradition, is the autonomous law of my reason.<sup>100</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 383.</i> This would indicate that the law of my reason is identical with the law of divine reason. There is only one reason and that is divine. We have now to assume that the spirit of God and that of man are identical. It is an idealistic position that goes even beyond the traditionally religious interpretation of the idea of man’s creation in the image of God."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.102","Surprisingly moving is Cohen’s final description of the God-man relation in the closing section of <i>Die Religion der Vernunft</i>. There he discusses the meaning of prayer. He sees in prayer a “dialogical monologue,” most authentically expressed in the Psalms. What is a dialogical monologue and how is prayer such a monologue and yet a dialogue? Cohen explains: “The lyrical confession has to sing the monologue as a dialogue. The soul unites both persons of the dialogue; for the soul is really God-given, therefore it is not exclusively human soul (<i>Menschenseele</i>). Thus, it may seek God and talk with him.”<sup>101</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid, p. 457.</i> This is Cohen’s final confession and it is a turning away from the God of his “religion of reason” and yet not a complete turning to the God of his fathers, the God of his youth for whom his soul was longing."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.103","Only a few pages earlier Cohen was speaking of prayer as the longing for God who can never be reached. “Prayer is longing. The desire of the prayer for God is a search for God and remains forever only a search. One can never find the reality only the “nearness” of God. The approach to God alone is the goal.”<sup>102</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 442.<br>NOTES<br>For Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism<br>This study is based chiefly on Rosenzweig’s <i>opus magnum, Der Stern der Erlösung</i>, Schocken Verlag. Berlin, 5690 <small>A.M.</small>, which is usually quoted as <i>Der Stern.</i> The passages quoted in the text are translated by me, and my purpose was not so much literal exactitude as a correct rendering of the meaning in accordance with my own interpretation. This, I found to serve the general trend of my understanding of Rosenzweig better than the translation by William H. Hallo published under the title <i>The Star of Redemption</i> by Holt, Rinehart and Winston, (New York, 1970-71). This, however, should not be taken in any sense as implying any criticism of William Hallo’s momentous undertaking. Corresponding references to his translation, quoted as <i>The Star</i>, are made in brackets.</i> As such, prayer could only be a monologue. And yet, Cohen could not give up the idea of the dialogue completely. It is the sign of the inner struggle between the intellect of the Neo-Kantian sage and the heart of the <i>baal t’shubah</i>, the old Jew returning to the house of his fathers. Thus, he conceives of prayer as the dialogical monologue. He is still not facing God in a dialogical situation. His Neo-Kantian past does not let him. Man is alone and God is only the “goal.” Yet, he does not give up the dialogical meeting with the God of his fathers completely. God is really so near. This soul of mine is not completely mine, it is God’s too. Thus it can bring together the two <i>persons</i> of the dialogue. It can not only search God; it can also speak to him. Finally he dared say—God, a person, but said it as if by a slip of the pen."
"Major Themes., 1: Hermann Cohen’s Religion of Reason.104","Herman Cohen the <i>baal t’shuba</i> was in essence a tragic personality of the all-too-short golden age of German Jewry. After complete estrangement from the God of his people, having given the fruits of the great powers of his genius to the enhancement of Germany’s philosophical glory, rebuffed by anti-Semitism that came to new life even in the highest seats of German culture, he returned proudly to his people. And yet, he could not make the return complete. Intellectually, the system put the breaks on the heart’s desire; emotionally, the loyalty of his stiff-necked Jewishness even to a Germany that kept no faith with him, blinded him to the vision of the historic Israel. Did he ever find peace? My teacher told us once about a visit with Hermann Cohen in the last days of Cohen’s life. The old man led him to a room in which stood a bookcase full with old rabbinical works of classical Judaism. Pointing to the shelves, Cohen said with tears in his eyes: “The <i>s’forim</i> [books] of my father.”"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.1","Franz Rosenzweig was the child of a completely assimilated Jewish family, in which the only somewhat nostalgic reminder of Judaism was an old uncle. Otherwise, Judaism meant chiefly anti-Semitism. Having the means from an affluent home to support him, he was able to rove over many areas of knowledge. His was a brilliant mind that mastered the entire realm of Western thought and was comfortably at home in all the manifestations of Western civilization."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.2","Rosenzweig was a man of absolute intellectual honesty and of a most sensitive conscience. During his intellectual odyssey he reached a point at the age of twenty-seven, when he decided to convert to Christianity. However, before actually carrying out his decision, he attended services on the Day of Atonement in Berlin in a <i>shteebl</i>, a small Orthodox synagogue. He went in as a completely alienated Jew ready for Christianity; he came out a radically transformed person, his soul aflame with unquestioning commitment to Judaism. From then on his entire life belonged to God and Judaism. He wrote, he taught, he translated, and interpreted. Original ideas continually emanated from him, he toiled tirelessly for the renewal of Judaism in the midst of a more or less assimilated German Jewry. He was the great <i>baal t’shuba</i>, the man of return, if not the greatest, during the final phase in the history of German Jewry, among the purest of <i>zadikim</i> (the world is untranslatable) of his generation. His life showed the way for many and has remained an inspiration to this day. If we subject his philosophy of Judaism as expressed in his <i>magnum opus, Der Stern der Erlösung</i> (The Star of Redemption) to criticism, it is done with the full realization that in the case of Rosenzweig, as is often the case in the history of the philosophies of Judaism, the man’s intellectual validation of his position does not do justice to his existential commitment and to the truth of his life. The philosophy is a rationalization, and often a poor one. Not even with Maimonides was it any different."

"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.5","Rosenzweig’s thoughts on Judaism center around three main ideas, eternity, holiness, and redemption. Eternal life was planted in the midst of the people of Israel in the revelation at Sinai.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Stern der Erlösung</i>, [The Star, p. 419], Vol. III, p. 204.</i> The meaning of eternity in this context is not continuous duration in time, rather it is a “Now” that stands between a solidified past and an unchanging future. How is this to be understood? Change is the essence of vitality in the life of nations. Vitality consists in pushing each day into the past to make room for another day, and so on ad infinitum. Nations are alive in such change which finds its expression in custom and law. Custom arises from the past, whereas the law is formulated in the present for the sake of the future. “Nations live in revolutions, in which the law continually sloughs off its old skin….”<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 55 [ibid., p. 303].</i> Not so, with Israel. The Torah, which is teaching and law in one, is holy, it is eternal. One may leave it, give it up. One cannot change it. What with other nations is custom and law, responsible for the division of time into past and future, with the Jewish people is the eternal Torah, which solidifies past and future. Time thus becomes “an unchangeable present.” The Jew lives in an everlasting present, in an eternal Now."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.6","The historical memory of the Jew does not refer to a definite point in the past. Every year of the past is equally near to the present. It is for this reason that at the festive <i>Seder</i> meal the Jew affirms that “in every generation one has to look upon oneself as if one too had shared in the exodus from Egypt.”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 56 [ibid., p. 304].</i> What is said about the exodus applies also to every other event in Jewish history. They are all equally close to the lived moment. This establishes a form of contemporaneity between the generations. All generations of Jews are, in a sense, contemporaneous. Living together in the unchangeable Now is the bond between the generations. “Through this bond, the people become the eternal people. For as grandson and grandfather behold each other, in the same moment they also behold in each other the latest offspring and the first forebear.”<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 110 [ibid., p. 346].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.7","The eternal law eternalizes the present moment. But as the Now becomes “eternal,” it is removed from the stream of time. The Torah lifts Israel out of time and history. God withdrew the Jewish people from the dimension of history in which the nations live by giving Israel his law, which like a bridge arches over the flow of time, “that rushes underneath it powerless in all eternity.”<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 100 [ibid., p. 339].</i> This is the essence of the sanctification of the life of the Jew, to live above time, outside of time, in the eternal Now. Such timelessness is holiness. And Rosenzweig has to add the melancholy thought that “as life is being sanctified, it is no longer alive.”<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 55 [ibid., p. 303].</i> We gain then an eternal life which is not alive in historic time. In the midst of the time of the nations and history, the people of God enjoy a “lifeless” life of holy eternity.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 91 [ibid., p. 331–2].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.8","All this, however, means that the people of God is already at the end, it is at the goal.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 91–92 [ibid].</i> It is beyond time, because it is complete and fulfilled. It lives in a state of redemption. The redemption, which is awaited by the world at the end of time, is anticipated by the Jew. Especially on the Sabbath and on the <i>yamim noraim</i>, the Days of Awe, of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> and <i>Yom Kippur</i>, the Jew feels that he is already redeemed. It should, however, be noted that there are passages in the <i>Stern</i> where Rosenzweig seems to indicate that the “lifeless” life of holy eternity in which the Jew exists thanks to the Torah is the life of redemption. It is not only on the Sabbath or the Holy Days that he feels already redeemed. It is the life outside and above time which is the state of redemption. The Jew is at the goal means that he has reached redemption. Thus, Rosenzweig speaks of the community’s kneeling before God on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, not while confessing its sins, but in a supreme act of worship free of all personal desire and requests, as the celebration of redemption. To which he adds: “for only we live a life in redemption and are, therefore, able to celebrate it.”<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 142 [ibid., p. 370].</i> In an unredeemed world, the Jew lives at the end of time and history, the “lifeless” life of holiness in a state of redemption."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.9","Consistent with his basic position is Rosenzweig’s interpretation of the reconciliation between God and man which is the precious fruit of the Day of Atonement. Clothed in the <i>kittel</i>, the white gown in which the Jew is buried, he stands in prayer before God on the Days of Awe, facing him as if on the day of final judgment “… thus he stands before the eye of the Judge in complete solitude, a corpse in the midst of life, and a member of an assembled humanity who all—like himself—in the midst of life have already placed themselves beyond the grave. Everything already lies behind him.”<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 85 [ibid., p. 327].</i> In a sense this is only an intensification of the “daily life” of the Jew in the eternal Now. Since the Jew is already at the end, living in the <i>eschatom</i>, the “lifeless” life of eternity, he is daily placing himself “beyond the grave” in the midst of life. He is at the goal, therefore always—and not only on <i>Yom Kippur</i>—everything is already behind him. Eternity is bought at the price of the temporal life."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.10","Manifold consequences follow from this understanding. If the eternal people is outside of time, what then is temporality to it, to which its body is after all still attached? It cannot mean growth and development as with other nations. Growth and development would be an indication that Israel has not yet reached its completion in time, that it was not at the goal and did not exist in the state of redemption. Any change in time would be a denial of eternity.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 87 [ibid., p. 328].</i> Thus it can only wait and wander. It takes no part in the temporal processes of history. It can, therefore not share “fully and creatively” in the historical life of the nations of the world. “The eternal people must forget the growth of the world. For itself, the world, its own world, must be accepted as complete.”<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 57, 87 [ibid.,]</i> At times, Rosenzweig formulates Israel’s nonparticipation in the historical life of the nations differently. Not only can a completed people of God not participate in the historical processes which carry the nations towards the goal which Israel has already reached, it is as if the holiness of the people prevents it from spending its energies on an unredeemed world. “The consecration which is spread over it as a kingdom of priests, renders its life barren. Its holiness prevents it from giving its soul to the as yet unsanctified world of the nations, however much its body may be fastened to that world.”<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 91 [ibid., p. 332].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.11","Perhaps the most far-reaching consequence of Rosenzweig’s philosophy of Judaism is his radical rejection of the state as a structure within which to order the life of the eternal people. “For the state is the continually changing form, under which time moves, step by step, toward eternity. In the people of God, however, eternity is already there in the midst of time.”<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 91 [ibid., ib.].</i> The nations live in pure temporality. The state for them is the forever repeated attempt to secure eternity in the midst of time. In such attempts the state becomes “the imitator and rival” of the people that carries its eternity within itself. If the state could succeed in achieving its desire for eternity, Israel would have no right to its own specific form of timelessness.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 92 [ibid., ib.].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.12",<b>2. <i>Survival</i></b>
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.13","The eternity that we have thus far analyzed is of a metaphysical, spiritual nature. It was achieved in the immediacy of the encounter with God in the act of revelation and through the eternal law that has lifted Israel out of the stream of history. However, one has also to find yet another foundation for the eternity of the eternal people. While the people of God may well be spiritually complete and at the goal, living the “lifeless” life of redemption, its body lives in time and is attached to the life of the world. Existing outside of time in its soul, how does it maintain its physical eternity in time? Here Rosenzweig surprises us with his most daring idea. Israel possesses the guarantee of its eternity in “the community of the blood” that binds the generations to each other. Only the blood can vouch, already in the present, for the realization of the hope for a future. With hardly believable boldness Rosenzweig declares: “Only the blood community feels the guarantee of its eternity already today pushing through its veins … it need not trouble the spirit. It has the guarantee of its eternity in the natural procreation of its body.”<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 49 [ibid., p. 299].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.14","Because of this “self-created eternity,” that Israel carries in its own blood, it is independent of all those elements to which the nations attempt to attach their eternity, land, language, and the changing customs and laws. Since the nations tie their lives to the land, they spill their blood for it. They love the land more than their life. But when the land is lost, life is lost too; for he who owns the land also owns the people. “Thus, the land betrays the people that entrusts its survival unto it. Indeed, it endures; but the people on it perish.”<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 50 [ibid., p. 300].</i> Not so the eternal people. It alone trusted its blood and left the land. Rosenzweig presents us with the fantastic statement, “Thus we (meaning the Jews) saved the precious life juice which offered us the guarantee of our own eternity.”<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 50 [ibid., p. 299].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.15","From here Rosenzweig develops the roots of a kind of a philosophy of Jewish history. Unlike other nations, the history of Israel does not start with an autochthonous people which lives in its own land. The patriarch Abraham is a stranger in the land of Canaan, and Israel first becomes a nation in the Egyptian exile and experiences its national rebirth “in the bright light of history” in exile in Babylon. Even its own land is never fully in its possession. Even there, it is a stranger and sojourner, “for the land is mine” says God to the Jew. The exile from its own land was, therefore, neither a mere accident of history, as one might think, nor punishment “because of our sins,” as tradition would have it. It was the logic of the “self-created” eternity from “the dark wells of the blood” that this people was not allowed to age and fade away by dwelling “at home.” For the Jew, the lost homeland becomes “in the deepest sense the land of his longing as—holy land.” The longing, however, cannot be a longing for return. According to Rosenzweig’s idea of the “blood community,” exile from the land was not so much a loss as a meaningful liberation from a dangerous bond. For, as Rosenzweig also says: “the will to peoplehood must not cling to any dead means [i.e., land]. It may only be realized through the people itself. The people is a people only through the people.”"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.16","What then is the aim of this longing? It would seem to us that within the context of Rosenzweig’s thought the longing for the holy land can only have a negative function. It is not a longing for return, for repossession of the land. As he himself seems to indicate, its sole purpose is not to allow the eternal people to find a real home in any other land.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 50–51 [ibid., p. 300].</i> This is an essential requirement for the preservation of the eternal people. Israel must not be allowed to live in unison with time and world history. It would lose its eternity. The Jew finds his place in the world within himself. His own kind, that came to him in his birth, he carries around like an “internal homeland: … like a magic circle, from which he is as likely to escape as from the circle of his blood, just because he carries it around—like his own blood—wherever he may go, wherever he may stand.”<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 175 [ibid., p. 396].</i> This people has its roots within itself. One might then say, following the inherent logic of Rosenzweig’s position, that “the holy land” is the landless land, just as “the holy life” is the lifeless life. The longing for it guarantees Israel’s homelessness for the sake of the preservation of its timeless existence."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.17","The “holy language” of the Jew also has a function similar to that of the “holy land.” The holy language is the language of prayer. The Jew speaks in this tongue only to God, according to Rosenzweig. Thus, it diverts the Jew from the immediacy of his contact with daily life. The holiness of his language does not allow the life of the Jew to take root in the soil of a language of his own. As the “holy land” prevents him from finding home in any other land, so the holy language does not let him become one with the language that he happens to speak. Even where the Jew does speak the language of his host country, according to Rosenzweig, he uses it in a manner specifically Jewish, which reveals that the language is not really his own. This, too, means that nowhere can the Jew settle down for good. Nor should he. He has his home within himself."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.18","We have seen earlier how the eternal law removes the Jew from time and establishes the timeless perfection of Israel. Other nations which had the anchor of their life in land and language, customs and laws, are dead. For us, however, land, language, and law have long since left the circle of the living and have been raised out of life into holiness. We are eternal, for our life is not dependent on anything external. “We took root in ourselves; without roots in the earth and therefore eternal wanderers, yet deeply rooted within ourselves, in our own body and blood. And this rootedness in ourselves, and only in ourselves, vouchsafes us our eternity.”<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 57 [ibid., p. 305].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.19","In summation we might say that the result of Rosenzweig’s position is a concept of the Jewish people that at the goal of all history lives the “lifeless” life of holiness outside of time and history, whose eternity is safeguarded in the blood community that binds all the generations."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.20",<b>3. <i>Judaism and Christianity</i></b>
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.21","Rosenzweig’s view of Judaism and the Jew is inseparable from his understanding of Christianity and the Christian. It is not our intention to analyze his interpretation of Christianity. However, a few words need be said about the relationship between the two religions. Whereas in Judaism man knows God directly, in Christianity he can only come to him by the mediation of the Son. The Christian can approach only the Son with same intimacy and trust with which the Jew comes before God himself. This is, indeed, so natural for the Jew that he cannot grasp why the same immediacy should be impossible for anyone else. Only at the hand of the Son dare the Christian come near the Father, because the Christian cannot imagine that the Holy God would lower himself to him as he desires it, unless he became himself Man. Thus, if the Son were not Man he would be useless for the Christian. In the need for a Man-God, Rosenzweig sees “a bit of paganism” present in every Christian which cannot be eliminated. For the heathen desires to be surrounded by “human gods.” It is not enough for him that he himself is man, God too must be Man.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 115 [Ibid., p. 350].</i> This, however, means that the Christian is by nature and birth a heathen."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.22","Christianity comes to the Christian from without and gives direction to his life. As Rosenzweig puts it in Latin: <i>Christianus fit, non nascitur</i>. Judasim is direction from within. The Christian has to leave his condition at birth and has to be reborn as a Christian. The Jew, on the other hand, had his “rebirth” long before his natural birth, when his people was reborn in the divine covenant of the revelation. Therefore, he is born a Jew. But just because of that the Christian is always at the beginning, always young, whereas the Jew is always already at the goal.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 175–176 [Ibid., pp. 395–6].</i> In other words, Christianity is within time, between rebirth and the Second Coming, in history, just as Judaism and Israel are beyond it. Christianity, young and full of vitality, is on the way with the task of spreading out and filling out time and history. The Jew has the eternal life; the Christian, the eternal way which is illuminated by the rays from the self-contained fire at the heart of the eternal life. “Eternal life and eternal way—they are as different as the infinity of a point and that of a line. The infinity of a point may consist only in that it (i.e., the point) cannot be erased; thus (the point) maintains itself in the self-preservation of the procreating blood. The infinity of a line, however, ceases when it is no longer possible to elongate it.”<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 103–104 [ibid., p. 341].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.23","Christianity as the eternal way has to expand continually. Simply to preserve itself would be the renunciation of its eternity and with it, death. Christianity has to be missionary, no less than the eternal people has to preserve itself by closing “the pure wells of the blood” against all foreign admixture. Christianity is eminently suitable for its eternal way through the world. At the hand of its Man-God it marches on, unlike the Jew, full of conquering strength. “… for flesh and blood will submit only to that which is, like itself, of flesh and blood. And just that element of “heathenism” enables the Christian to convert the heathens.”<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 115 [ibid., p. 350].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.24","To formulate again and again the distinction between Judaism and Christianity, between the Jew and the Christian, seems to be an obsession with Rosenzweig. He forever defines his Judaism in juxtaposition to Christianity. “To be rooted in deepest self was the secret of the eternal people. To spread through everything outside itself is the secret of the eternal way.”<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 112 [ibid., p. 348].</i> Because the Jew has his eternity within, anchored in his essential nature, as he descends into his innermost self, he ascends to the highest. Therein lies the deepest difference between the Jew and the Christian. Whereas the Jew is Jew from home and certainly from birth, the Christian is a heathen at least from birth. Thus the way of the Christian must be a way of alienation from himself. He must forever move away from himself. He must give up his natural self in order to become a Christian. Whereas the Christian life “denationalizes” the Christian, Jewish life leads the Jew more closely to the “Jewish kind” of his inborn nature.<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 190 [ibid., p. 408].</i> This rootedness of the Jew within himself, this self-sufficiency, as it were, Rosenzweig compares to a self-sustaining fire (as referred to earlier). This fire is the symbol of the eternal life of the Jew. Therefore, speaking metaphorically, Rosenzweig would also say that because of this self-sustaining fire the Jew is in no need of the sword to go out into the forests of the world to get what it needs to feed the flame.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 95 [ibid., p. 335].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.25","As the eternal life of the Jew is the fire, so is the eternal way of the Christian the rays, the rays from the fire, which shining into the world, illuminate the way. Judaism and Christianity are thus linked to each other in the philosophy of Rosenzweig. The same light, in different forms, determines them both; the fire at the center—the eternal life of the Jew, the illumination of the rays—the eternal way of the Christian. Rosenzweig maintains therefore that “both Jew and Christian, are workers on the same task before God. He can spare neither of them.”<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 200 [ibid., p. 415].</i> Neither of them is capable of accomplishing the task by himself. “We [speaking for the Jews] behold in our hearts the faithful image of the truth; however, because of it, we turn away from the temporal life and the temporal life turns from us. They, on the other hand, are running after the stream of time, but have the truth behind them.”<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 200 [ibid., pp. 415-6].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.26","With the help of these ideas Rosenzweig is able to offer us an original interpretation of the Christian hatred of the Jew. The way of Christianity through the world has been most successful. It has triumphed over the gods of the peoples, their myths, their heroes, and their entire cosmos. Christianity has been uniquely triumphant. Who would dare to challenge it! Yet, the Jew does it; not in words but by his mere existence. “This existence of the Jew forces the thought upon Christianity at all times that it is not reaching the goal, that it is not coming to the truth, but remains forever on the way. This is the deepest reason for the Christian Jew hatred which, ultimately, is only self-hatred, transferred onto the objectionable, silent reproacher, who yet reproaches only by his existence—hatred against one’s own imperfection, against one’s own not-yet.”<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 197 [ibid., p. 413].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.27","Nevertheless, Rosenzweig does look forward to ultimate reconciliation; he sees it in the metaphor of Yehuda Halevi, the poet and philosopher of Judaism in the eleventh century. God has a secret plan with the Jew, which may be compared to a plan with a seed that falls to the ground. In the earth it appears to change into soil, water, and dirt. Nothing seems to be left to be recognized by the eye. Yet, it is itself which transforms the soil and the water into its own substance and, degree by degree, breaks down their elements and, reforming them, incorporates them into its own being. The tree then grows, it yields the fruit, a fruit like the one from which its own seed came. Similarly, the Torah of Moses transforms all those who follow after it to its own truthfulness, though they appear to reject it. These nations, followers of other religions, are the preparation for the expected Messiah, who is the fruit. They will all become his fruits as they recognize him. The tree then will become one. They will then honor and praise the root, which they had despised.<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">Halevi, <i>Kuzari</i>, IV, 23; quoted in the <i>Stern</i>, p. 153 [ibid., p. 379].</i> In that hour, when the fruits will be ripe and recognize the seed from which they sprang, the nations will have arrived at the goal towards which they were moving all through history, at the goal where Israel stands waiting for them. “The way is at an end when the home is reached. The way may be eternal, since its end is eternity; yet, it comes to an end, for eternity is its end. Where everything is aflame, there are no rays any more. There everything is one light.”<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 154 [ibid.].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.28","In the meantime, the Jew may wait. He may be oblivious to the rays. He who has the flame is in no need of its rays. The flame burns silently and forever. The seed of eternal life has been planted; it can wait now till it will spring up. Of the tree which grows from it the seed knows nothing, though it cast its shadow over the world. One day, however, a seed will come from the fruits of the tree that will be like its original. Blessed be the One who has planted eternal life in our midst.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 96 [ibid., p. 335].</i> In the light of all this, one may be justified in saying that Rosenzweig makes room for Christianity by removing Judaism from history, but the Christian will find eternal life by returning to Judaism. In time, Christianity is triumphant; in eternity, it is Judaism. The Christian is needed, for there is a job in the unredeemed world which the Jew, already living the “lifeless” life of redemption, cannot perform."

"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.31","With all due respect to the saintly genius of Franz Rosenzweig, it would seem to us that it is impossible to accept any of his categories as fitting either the essence of Judaism, the nature of the Jew, or the history of the Jewish people."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.32","It is true that the history of the Jewish people commenced in exile, that Israel became a people in exile. Yet, it was history in the time of the world and not outside of it. The holy land was the land of their longing, but not as Rosenzweig interprets the term as a device by which the Jews were prevented from finding a home anyplace in the world. On the contrary, it was the land of the divine promise, a very real land in time and space, where they were to find a home, a place of rest. For centuries the holy language was the everyday language of the people in which the Jew communicated not only with his God, but also with his fellowmen, it was the language in which he prayed, in which he spoke to his beloved, and cursed his neighbor, in which he spoke the truth and told a lie. The state, far from being alien to Judaism was envisaged by the Torah, and had—at least in theory—a Torah constitution; it was to be organized by the laws of the Torah. Yet, according to Rosenzweig all this could not have been. For with the covenant of the revelation God planted eternal life in the midst of the people. With it Israel was completed; it reached the goal; it was taken out of history. When did that happen? In 70 <small>C.E.</small> at the destruction of the Second Commonwealth? Surely, not. He could only mean the revelation at Sinai. Was, then, everything that followed already outside of history? Was it not Jewish history in time and worldly space? Or was there some kind of development of the Jewish people to the genuine Judaism of the “lifeless” life of holiness at the goal? At least in one place Rosenzweig does refer to Jewish history as having become petrified.<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 140 [ibid., p. 369].</i> But when did that happen and why? What was it and what Judaism, prior to the petrification? Did it acquire eternity through petrification and not through revelation? Is it possible to read the Bible without realizing that its main theme is the story of an eminently historical people?"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.33",The God of the Bible is the God of history. The prophets are the earliest people for whom history is not a mere repetition of the past but a flow toward a goal whose progress is determined by the ethical interaction between God and man and by man’s conduct in the sight of God. Whatever happens is of importance because it occurs in the space-time dimension of daily human existence.
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.34","Judaism and the Jew are vitally involved in the history of all mankind. The very significance of both lies in the fact that the viability of a specific way of life is demonstrated in the same historical time in which all mankind lives. The goal, far from having been reached, is always in the future. Much more than the history of any other people, Jewish history is future-oriented. Its very essence is not the eternal “now” of Rosenzweig, but the everlasting “not-yet.” It is the history of a promise that God and man made to each other, the world history of the struggle for the realization of that promise. Its entire value and meaning lies in the fact that it is battling for its realization along the path that is trodden by all mankind. The eternal life of Israel has universal relevance because it leads through the time of the world, because it is woven into the fabric of world history. Unfortunately, Rosenzweig’s categories blind him to the historic reality of Judaism as well as of the Jew."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.35",<b>2. <i>Holiness and the Law</i></b>
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.36","One of the keys to Rosenzweig’s inability to recognize the historical reality of Israel can be found in a short sentence to which we had occasion to refer earlier in our presentation of his ideas: “As life becomes sanctified it is no longer alive.”<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 55 [ibid., p. 303].</i> We can hardly think of a statement less characteristic of Judaism than these words of Rosenzweig. According to him the sanctification is effected by the eternal law. A number of statements are made about the law in the third part of <i>Der Stern</i>, but only one aspect of the law is actually discussed and interpreted: its ritual aspect in the limited sense in which it found expression in the holy days of the Jewish year and in its liturgical formulation. But it is not in this extremely narrow sense that one can grasp the essential nature of the law. In fact, there is no safer way of missing the essential quality and purpose of the law than by trying to explain them within such a very limited and artificial frame. The law is all-embracing. It comprehends every aspect of the life of the individual as well as that of the entire Jewish people. It regulates all interhuman relationships; it lays down the principles of an economic and social order; it provides the constitution of a state—its judicial system, its civil and criminal laws. Its significance lies in the fact that it deals with the temporal life of the Jew and of the Jewish people. Its whole purpose is to give meaning and direction to the daily life of the Jew. It aims at life, this life, in time and history. Can one doubt it, for instance, in the light of the words in Deuteronomy?<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">Deuteronomy, 30, 19–20.</i> “I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed; to love the Lord thy God, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave unto Him; for that is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.” The emphasis is forever on life on this earth in the world’s time. “Mine ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep to walk therein: I am the Lord your God. Ye shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them….”<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">Leviticus, 18: 4–5.</i> The rabbis comment on it: “… that he shall live by them and not that he shall die by them.”<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">Talmud Babli, <i>Yoma</i>, 87/B.</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.37","The law does sanctify life, but sanctification does not remove the Jew from history; on the contrary, its very significance lies in the fact that it is the sanctification of life in time and history. The biblical chapter that begins with the words: “Ye shall be holy, for I the Lord your God are holy”<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">Leviticus, 19:2.</i> deals mainly with the sanctification of the daily intercourse with one’s fellow men. Let only a very few of the laws of sanctification stand here to illustrate the point."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.38","Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another. And ye shall not swear by My name falsely…. Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor, nor rob him; the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning … and if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong. The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself…. Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.39","The whole of the Torah is dedicated to life, for life, the everyday life of man, has to be dedicated. “The living, the living, he shall praise Thee, as I do this day”<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">Isaiah, 38: 19.</i> exclaims the prophet; it is the living in time and the praise from history that really matter. Sanctification is not to remove man from time, but to bring holiness into time. Rosenzweig’s interpretation of the Day of Atonement is movingly beautiful, yet it is not the <i>Yom Kippur</i> of the Jew through the ages. It is a misinterpretation because it is a perfect application of his category of holiness as “lifelessness.” We have heard him describe it as the day in which the Jew, clothed in his burial garments, faces God from beyond the grave, having already everything behind him. It is hardly conceivable how anyone familiar with the liturgy of that holiest of days, as surely Rosenzweig must have been, could have made such a statement. Practically every page of the <i>Maḥzor</i>, the festival prayer book, is concerned with life, the life lived daily by the Jew and by all peoples of the earth. It is a day for the sake of life, for the right and better life of tomorrow. The confession of sins and the prayer for forgiveness is felt to be a necessity as a first step toward a new day. A basic element in the act of <i>t’shuba</i>, of return to God, is the resolution for the life one is determined to lead in the future. Everything is directed at the renewal of man for the year that is ahead. Everything is prayer for the spiritual and material blessing in the days ahead. Far from having everything behind him on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, he has everything before him: his past life as a subject of examination; the future, for which to prepare. A recurring prayer of the day is: “Bring us back unto thee, O God, and we shall return; renew our days as of old…. O cast us not away from thy presence, nor take thy holy spirit from us. O cast us not off in old age, forsake us not when our strength fails.” Are these the words of people who have everything already behind them and have retained the “lifeless” life of eternity? Or is it the prayer that the dominion of wickedness may disappear from the earth, that God may grant honor to his people, hope and praise to all those who fear him, seek him, and want him, joy to his land of Israel and to his city of Zion, speedily in our days? Is this spoken from beyond history, in a state beyond all wishes, desires and needs? How is it possible to maintain that the great <i>Abinu Malkenu</i> prayer, recited at least three times during the day, is prayed from beyond the grave and not from the very midst of man’s temporal life!"

"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.47","The prayer characterizes the mood of the entire day. Though withdrawn completely from all normal daily activities, on <i>Yom Kippur</i> the Jew faces God from the very heart of his personal existence as well as from the very core of the historical existence of his people, for the sake of that life from which he so completely withdraws on that day. Like all Jewish history, the Day of Atonement too is future-directed. It is a day in the midst of life, a day of sanctification of living in time far beyond the limits of that one day. Never is the Jew more concerned about his life on earth, in the world, and with the world, than on the Day of Atonement. It is the day, from which he derives his main strength to remain in time, to face the trials and tribulation, to give it meaning and direction, to sanctify it."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.48","A holiness of eternity, one which is—to use a phrase of Rosenzweig’s —“bought at the price of man’s temporal life” is no concern of Judaism. Eternity needs no holiness; it is man’s desires and wishes, his needful temporal life that alone requires sanctification. Thus “the holy land” is not the never-never land of the Jew’s longing that is to separate him from all these worldly attachment to any land, as Rosenzweig sees it; but the land that because it is the land of the Jews is the most conducive place on earth for the sanctification of the life of an entire people. The holy language is not holy because it is not used for communication between Jew and Jew, but because in it the Jew was called to the life of Judaism on this earth, because in it the “Torah of life,” the Torah for this earthly life, was planted in his midst. Rosenzweig sees the holy law of the Torah as taking hold of the this-worldly and transforming it into the contents of the future world, the world beyond.<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Stern</i>, vol. III, p. 188; cf. also what he says about the “Blessings,” ibid., p. 60 [Ibid., p. 406; cf. also p. 307].</i> We know nothing of that. The law does not change the this-worldly into the other-worldly, but transforms the profanity of the this-worldly into the sanctified this-worldly. The Jew sees in the transformation not only his goal, but that of all history. Just because of that neither Israel, nor the world have as yet arrived at the goal; just because of that the place of the Jew and of Judaism is in time and history. Eternity is in no need of holiness; the Torah was not given to angels, say the rabbis.<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">Talmud Babli, <i>Kiddushin</i>, 54/a.</i> Not even the Torah is eternal according to Jewish tradition. As one of the great teachers of the Talmud said: “The commandments of God were given in order to purify man.” <sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Bereshit Rabba</i>, 44; <i>Tanhuma, Sh’meenee.</i></i> Once the goal is achieved, the Law will no longer be necessary. Only in the imperfection of the temporal world does the law serve a purpose."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.49",<b>3. <i>Exile and Redemption</i></b>
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.50","Rosenzweig’s categories cannot recognize the historic reality of Israel’s exile. The word does occur two or three times in <i>Der Stern</i>, but its only significance for him lies in the fact that Israel became a people in exile; beyond that there is no place for it in the thought of Rosenzweig. Whereas through the centuries Jews have been declaring that “because of our sins we have been exiled from our land,” Rosenzweig says that trusting their blood community they left the land.<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Der Stern</i>, vol. III p. 50 [ibid., p. 299].</i> According to him, one would have to say that exile was not so much a loss as a desired liberation from a dangerous attachment. We referred earlier to his statement that the Jewish people could not tie their life to anything dead, like a land. It would have jeopardized their eternity which must not depend on anything outside itself. One would also have to assume that according to his views in <i>Der Stern</i>, the prayers of the Jews through the ages for a return to Zion and Jerusalem were pointless. The Jews were at the goal; they had arrived; there was nowhere for them to return to. They were only waiting beyond the river of time for the nations to arrive at eternity, which was their condition. If anything, homelessness was an achievement; the right condition of a people that was complete in itself. Exile would then mean being bodily attached to the not-yet-redeemed world of the nations. Rosenzweig does say that to be “the Beloved of God” is only the beginning and that man remains unredeemed as long as only this beginning is realized. But it is not his opinion that the Jew is at the beginning. For the Jew there is no road; he is at the <i>eschaton</i>. And thus Rosenzweig adds in the same context: “As against Israel the eternal Beloved of God, the ever faithful, the forever complete, stands the eternally coming, eternally waiting, eternally wandering, eternally growing—stands the Messiah.”<sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 60 [ibid., p. 307].</i> From this and other similar passages<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 185–186, 204 [ibid., pp. 404, 419].</i> it would seem that the logic of Rosenzweig’s position indicates that the Messiah comes to the gentiles only, bringing them redemption. The Jewish people received eternal life in the revelation and changes no more."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.51","Needless to say, this metaphysical neglect of Israel’s exile and this concept of its relationship to the holy land is contrary to the entire Jewish tradition. It is contradicted by the rich prophetic pronouncements on the subject. When the prophets spoke of exile they meant the homelessness of the Jew expelled from his land; and when they spoke of the promise of return, they meant return home to Zion and Jerusalem, in its literal sense. What follows from Rosenzweig’s ideas is a rejection of every word of prophecy on the subject. Rosenzweig does not see how necessary the connection is between the spiritual and the material; that homelessness affects not only the body, but also the spirit of the Jewish people. The law, because it is not just synagogue and home ritual and liturgy, but all-embracing, is not realizable in the political, economic, social unfreedom of the homelessness of the Jewish people. The “lifeless life” of holiness is life stunted, life denied. Holiness must have its base in life, must build on its this-worldly secular reality. Rosenzweig does not see that in the homelessness of the Jewish people the law too is in exile; he is not aware of what Judaism has called the <i>galut hashkhina</i>, the exile of the divine Presence. He also disregards completely the material condition of the Jewish people in exile. There is not the slightest attempt made to come to grips with the martyrology of Jewish homelessness, as if the life of the Jews were nothing more than a metaphysical enterprise."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.52","The <i>galut</i>, the exile of the Jewish people that features prominently in the Jewish consciousness and has overwhelming significance for the understanding of the place of Judaism and that of the Jew in world history, has to be ignored by Rosenzweig beacuse of his understanding of the “lifeless” life of eternity. Towards the end of <i>Der Stern</i> he writes, for instance: “To live in time means to live between Beginning and End. He who would live outside of time—which the one must do who desires to live, not in the temporal but the eternal life—he who wants that must deny the in-between.”<sup>48</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 205 [ibid., p. 420].<br>49. Ibid., p. 159, vol. II, pp. 194–5 [ibid., pp. 383, 238].</i> This, of course, is said of the life of the Jew. He denies the “in-between,” but the “in-between” is the <i>galut</i>. Since the Jew is already at the end, there is really no <i>galut</i>. Exile is really a misnomer. The Jew might think he is in exile; in truth his is eternal life; he has reached redemption already, the end toward which the history of the world is moving. At this point, the vast difference between the categories of Rosenzweig and those of Judaism becomes once more clear. Redemption, for Rosenzweig, is the condition of wishless fulfillment; it is the overcoming of all temporal existence. It is timelessness. When it is complete, all life ends. Not only man and the world are redeemed, but, most directly, it is the redemption of God, who is freed from what is not himself, freed of the world as well as from the concern for the soul. The three elements of Rosenzweig’s philosophical structure, God, man, and the world, everything, will be as it was originally prior to creation. The All will become reality. God will be Alone and He will be the All. Now in Judaism redemption is within time and history. God is the redeemer of Israel because he redeemed his people from Egypt, from Babylon. He is the Redeemer from exile. He is the Redeemer of man because he saves him from the hand of his enemies, from oppression and persecution, at times even from the grasp of death. Redemption in Judaism is altogether this-worldly and not other-wordly."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.53",<b>4. <i>The Blood Community</i></b>
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.54","Nothing is more surprising in Rosenzweig’s thoughts on Judaism than his idea that the survival of the Jewish people through the world time of the unredeemed world is due to the community of blood, on which alone the Jew relies. The Jew has his anchor within himself and is thus independent of anything outside himself. His independence is the guarantee of his immortality. Rosenzweig makes some astounding statements in this connection. According to him, the leaving of the land and trusting the blood guaranteed survival. For, whereas other nations, tied to a land, let the blood of their sons be spilled for the land and over it, the Jews alone, having been freed from the burden of the land, “were able to save the precious life juice, which guaranteed them their own eternity.” <sup>50</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., vol III, p. 50 [ibid., p. 299].</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.55","It is hardly believable to what extent metaphysical preoccupation could blind a brilliant mind to facts. What Rosenzweig is saying is that the state of homelessness in time and place, enabled the Jews to preserve their life blood, which alone secured their survival. One sees here how radically he denied the “in-between” of the <i>galut</i>. Has exile through the centuries indeed been “a saving of the precious life juice”? Is there any nation on earth that has spilled as much of its blood over its land as the Jewish people have lost in their homelessness? What guarantee is there in the blood of a people that has been materially as powerless as the Jewish people has been in its exile? When Rosenzweig maintains that there was no need to trouble the spirit in order to survive, because survival was safeguarded automatically in “the natural procreation of the body”<sup>51</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 49 [ibid.].</i> he, without realizing it, desecrates the self-sacrificial martyrology of the <i>galut</i>. The Christian world saw to it that to be a Jew had always to be a response to an ever renewed challenge. The gates for desertion were wide open. The pressure and the temptation to give up Judaism and to join the Christian masters of the earth were ever present. To be a Jew was a continuous decision to remain a Jew. The privilege of remaining a Jew had to be purchased daily anew with sweat and blood. Jewish survival through the hell of world history may indeed be one of the great mysteries in all human experience. It is, however, certain that it could never have been accomplished without the supreme spiritual commitment of the Jew to the truth as he saw it. The blood was helpless; it was the spirit that sustained it."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.56","Indeed, there is a Jewish blood community. The Jews are a people; Judaism is not a church, it is not even the synagogue. However, in Rosenzweig’s thoughts the blood community appears as something naturally given. The idea sounds almost racist when he says that in order to preserve itself the eternal people had “to seal off the pure wells of its blood against all alien admixture.”<sup>52</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 104 [ibid., p. 341].</i> It shows how little Rosenzweig understood the basis and the nature of the blood community of the Jews. The truth is that there is nothing in Judaism that aims at preserving “the pure wells of the blood,” but there is a great deal to preserve the pure wells of the spirit that are the lifestream of Judaism and of the Jewish people. It is true, Judaism is against mixed marriage, but only when the non-Jewish partner does not convert to Judaism at all or converts without inner conviction. Mixed marriage is frowned upon not because of the mixing of the blood, but because of the mixing of the faiths. As the rabbis say, the doors are always open and anyone who wishes to enter may enter.<sup>53</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Sh’mot Rabba</i>, 19, 4.</i> What is required is sincere acceptance of Judaism. In the course of the centuries many have indeed entered. They have been considered the children of Abraham, who himself was a “convert.” There are no “pure wells” of Jewish blood."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.57","It is true, Judaism is not a missionizing faith. This, however, has nothing to do with the protection of the purity of the blood, as Rosenzweig believes. He misses the vital distinction here between Judaism and Christianity. Christianity must missionize, but not because of Rosenzweig’s fanciful construction of the eternal way that must expand into eternity. It must missionize because of its basic dogma. According to that dogma God gave his only begotten son to all men; he died in order to bring salvation to the entire human race. If so, the “good news” must be brought to the notice of all mankind. Christianity cannot help missionizing; without it, it could not be Christian. Not so with Judaism. It does not maintain that Judaism is the way of salvation for all men. The Torah was given only to the Jews. From the Christian position, it is obligatory upon every human being to acknowledge Jesus; from the Jewish point of view, it is not obligatory upon non-Jews to accept the Torah. Judaism is obligatory only for the Jews just because it does not believe that it is the only way to the salvation of man. The prophet Micah speaking of “the end of days,” when the nations will “flow to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob,” also says: “For let all the peoples walk each one in the name of its God, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.”<sup>54</sup><i class=""footnote"">Micah, 4:5.</i> Since it is the time when the nations will desire to learn from the God of Jacob, their God must be the God of the universe, just as “the Lord our God” is the God of all creation. By “its God” of the text is then meant each nation’s specific way, its specific approach to the God of All."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.58","The prophetic teaching has been intensified by a rich rabbinic tradition. We shall quote only a few examples. In the <i>Tanna debe’Eliyahu Rabba</i> the following words are put in the mouth of the prophet Elijah: “I call to witness heaven and earth that be one a Jew or a gentile, man or woman, male or female slave, the holy spirits rests upon a person in accordance with his deeds.” <sup>55</sup><i class=""footnote"">Op. cit., chapter 10.</i> Another characteristic midrashic passage is attached to a verse in Psalms in the form of a commentary. The verse maintains: “No good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly (literally: in wholeheartedness).<sup>56</sup><i class=""footnote"">Psalms 84: 12.</i> The explanation of the rabbis runs as follows:"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.59","He that walks “in wholeheartedness” is Abraham. To him were the words addressed: “Walk before Me and be wholehearted.” But if the verse meant only Abraham, why the plural form, “<i>Them</i> that walk in wholeheartedness”? This teaches us that as in the case of Abraham, who, because he walked in wholeheartedness before the Holy One blessed be He, God became his shield, so it happens to everyone who walks before Him in wholeheartedness, God becomes his shield. And how does the text continue? Abraham is not mentioned here, but “man”; it applies to any man.<sup>57</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Midrash T’hillim</i>, 1, 1.</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.60","It was the opinion of the rabbis that one did not need to be a Jew in order to walk before God “in wholeheartedness.” Thus they could also declare: “The righteous of all the nations have a share in the world to come.”<sup>58</sup><i class=""footnote"">Maimonides, <i>Yad Hahazaka, Melakhim</i>, 8, 11, based on <i>Talmud Babli, Sanhedrin</i>, 105/a.</i> Judaism is the Jewish way; others may have different ways. Ultimately decisive is not the creed, but the deed. This is the essence of Jewish universalism.<sup>59</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. this author’s essay in <i>History and the Idea of Mankind</i>, ed. by W. Warren Wagar, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1971.</i> Not so with Christianity. It maintains that no one may get to the Father except by way of the Son. It has to say it, since otherwise the sacrifice was unnecessary. It has to say it because on account of original sin no human being can be saved unless by the supernatural intervention of the divine sacrifice. Judaism, on the other hand, rejects the idea of the corruption of human nature. Man is responsible for his actions; though he needs divine assistance, he has to seek the way himself and may find it, any man. The rabbis believed that because of this to impose Judaism on a non-Jew would be the imposition of an unnecessary burden. The universalism of Christianity is totalitarian, that of Judaism democratic. Christianity has to conquer the world; Judaism is available to all."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.61","In a certain sense it is possible to say that Judaism is a community of blood, but not to the exclusion of any alien blood. Because of the nature of the faith, any new blood that enters is absorbed into the community of the people. This is due to the specific nature of Judaism. Judaism is not a religion in the normally accepted sense of the term; it is the life of a people lived in the awareness that all life is forever lived in the sight of God. What is more, it is not the people that conceived Judaism, but Judaism that formed the people. Because the Torah comprehends the entire life of man, because the law deals with every aspect of human existence, it is people-founding. The structuring of the whole of life, personal and communal, economic, civic, social and political, that the Torah prescribes, the all-comprehensive deed which is required, can ideally be achieved only by a community that is in control of its daily life. Such a community in history thus far has to be not a church or a synagogue, but a nation. Even the mere striving by men for the realization of life in accordance with the Torah would lead to their becoming a biological entity, a blood community, a blood community formed by the spirit of man. Saadia Gaon expressed it saying: Our people is a people only because of the Torah.<sup>60</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Emunot V’Deoth</i>, chapter III; cf. also this author’s <i>God, Man and History</i>, chapter XI, <i>Israel.</i></i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.62","Only because of this is it true when Rosenzweig asserts that the more the Jew identifies himself with the natural inheritance of his birth, the more Jewish he becomes. This, however, is not due to “the blood community,” but to the fact that the blood community has its foundation in the spirit community of Judaism. It is rather different with Christianity. Its main concern is not with man’s all-comprehensive deed, but with the right creed, the creed that saves. Christianity is essentially individualistic. The creed is a personal affair between the individual soul and its God. What really matters is the salvation of the individual. Thus, the community formed by the faith is of a necessity a church, a collection of individual souls. Christianity never created a nation. Notwithstanding the rhetoric to the contrary, in all history there has never been a Christian nation. Apart from the Jews no other nation—as a nation—ever concluded a covenant with God, which is the true meaning of the chosen people. The Jewish people is not a blood-community, but—as my teacher the late Rabbi Yeḥiel Yaacob Weinberg called it in an essay—a faith nation. The juxtaposition between Judaism and Christianity is not valid. Christianity is a religion, Judaism is not. The juxtaposition should be between the secular nations and the faith nation."

"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.65","As indicated earlier, Rosenzweig’s views on Judaism in <i>Der Stern</i> are developed in continuous contradistinction from Christianity. Thus, his philosophy of Judaism is intrinsically linked to his understanding of Christianity. The two faiths complement each other. One might also say that Rosenzweig’s philosophy of Judaism as developed in <i>Der Stern</i> is the final form of his answer to his cousin, Eugen Rosenstock, a convert to Christianity, with whom he had been engaged in an intense dialogical correspondence on the subject in 1916.<sup>61</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf., the edition of this correspondence in English under the title, <i>Judaism Despite Christianity</i>, Schocken, New York. All our references are to this edition.</i> In a sense, in <i>Der Stern</i> Rosenzweig was still answering Rosenstock."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.66","Rosenstock was hitting Rosenzweig with all the tactless zeal with which Jews have been familiar through the centuries and that has remained to this day so typical of the renegade Jew. The trouble with the Jews is that they won’t listen to the truth. Thus, the Christians alone know the truth and, of course, nothing proves it better than the fact that they say so themselves. The Jews are stubborn and proud. They are a tribal blood union, who do not care for the growth of men to a united universe under the scepter of Christianity and, as a chosen people, know nothing of a final union of all the children of the Father. They do have some faith that one day all the peoples will assemble in God’s house in Jerusalem and yet they crucify <i>daily</i> the one who comes to make good this promise. In truth the Jews are the image of Lucifer on earth. The Jews don’t die for any country, for any cause. They really have nothing, that is why they are so proud of what they had. They can only participate in the life of others. They live on credit, always borrowing from others everything that makes life worth living.<sup>62</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf., letter of Oct. 30, 1916.</i> There is nothing missing here of the threadbare arguments from the medieval armory of the Christian “theological” contempt and hatred of the Jew."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.67","Rosenstock did add something rather original to the medieval equipment. He compares the sacrifice of Abraham to that of Jesus. Abraham sacrifices only what he has, only his son; but Jesus, what he is. One wonders how crude a renegade Jew may become once he embraces the truth of Christianity. He treats a child as a piece of property. Abraham gave up something that he owned, but not his own life. As a Jew one cannot help wondering what kind of a perversion must it be that allows a human being to maintain that it is easier for a man to kill his only child with his own hand than to surrender his own life! Ultimately, the argument reveals an ethical insensitivity that is, from the point of view of Judaism, typically heathen, i.e., that it is easier to kill someone else then to die oneself."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.68","A Jew once came before the Talmudic teacher Raba: “Rabbi! The ruler of the city has commanded me to kill someone. If not, I shall be killed. What shall I do?” He was given the answer: “Who told you that your blood is redder than his!”<sup>63</sup><i class=""footnote"">Talmud Babli, <i>Pesaḥim</i>, 25/B.</i> According to Judaism, the saving of a life supersedes all the other commandments of the Torah, except that one must rather die than save oneself by taking another life. To maintain that it was easier for Abraham to sacrifice another human being—even if it were not his only son—than to give his own life, is akin to the arguments of the Nazi murderers of Jews who defended themselves by saying that had they not killed, they would have been killed. And who can say that there was no causal nexus between the Germanic Christianity of a Rosenstock and the way some of the more decent Nazi murderers evaluated their own lives as compared with the lives of others?"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.69","Not unrelated to Rosenstock’s evaluation of Abraham’s sacrifice is the statement that the Jew lives by “a ghostly reflection of all real life, which is unthinkable without sacrificial death and nearness of the abyss.”<sup>64</sup><i class=""footnote"">Op. cit., p. 126.</i> One wonders what sacrificial death and nearness of abyss he was speaking about? When was the last time that Christians had to bear witness—and did bear witness—to their faith with their lives and what did they know as Christians of the nearness of the abyss! How largely looms the figure of the author of the “Attack upon Christendom” besides the sickness of the renegade Jew! How glorious a Kierkegaard’s struggle to penetrate the drama of faith revealed in the sacrifice of Isaac as compared with the vulgarity of a Rosenstock! But to say to Jews that they live by a ghostly reflection of real life because they live “without sacrificial death” and because they don’t know of “the nearness of the abyss” is no longer vulgarity; it is obscene."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.70","Rosenstock’s attack on the Jews is a convincing illustration of how near the theological enmity of Christianity is to the most vicious forms of anti-Semitism. Stripped of its theological trappings Rosenstock’s letters to Rosenzweig contain all the familiar accusations: the selfish Jew, who is only concerned with his possessions; the Jew, the devil; the Jew, the deicide; the Jew, the parasite; the Jew, the coward; the Jew, without beauty, without creative ability, without idealism; the Jew, an uncanny ghostly creature. There is only one short step from Rosenstock’s theology in the letters to discrimination, pogroms, massacres. Indeed, however innocent Rosenstock might be in this respect, for the less sophisticated, the ultimate logic of his theology leads to the crematoria."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.71",<b>2. <i>The Christianizing of Judaism</i></b>
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.72","Our concern is not with Rosenstock. He was neither the first, nor will he be the last in the line of theological Jew haters. One must, however, listen well in order to understand fully Rosenzweig’s own position. In his essay, <i>Das Neue Denken</i>, Rosenzweig writes that the greatest single influence in writing <i>Der Stern</i> was Rosenstock.<sup>65</sup><i class=""footnote"">The essay is found in the “Smaller Writings,” entitled <i>Zweistromland.</i> Philo Verlag, Berlin, 1926; the passage referred to on p. 256.</i> It would seem to us that it is especially visible in Rosenzweig’s own philosophy of Judaism. Actually, the vulgarity of Rosenstock’s attack on the Jews, so familiar to the Jew, deserved no answer. Yet, Rosenzweig had to meet it, because in a sense it was written from the same position that was reached by Rosenzweig himself in that nightlong discussion in the summer of 1913 between Rosenstock, Rosenzweig, and another cousin and convert to Christianity, Rudolf Ehrenberg. It was as the result of that discussion that Rosenzweig decided to convert to Christianity. In a letter to Ehrenberg, in which he announced that conversion was no longer possible for him, he explains that at the close of the discussion he realized that there was no room for Judaism in this world.<sup>66</sup><i class=""footnote"">Rosenzweig, <i>Briefe</i>, Schocken Verlag, Berlin, 1935, p. 72.</i> On the other hand, the gist of Rosenstock’s attack on the Jews was that they did not realize that, indeed, there was no room left for them on earth. He was, in other words, calling Rosenzweig back to the position of July 1913."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.73","It would seem to us that to the end Rosenzweig never overcame the position that there was no place for the Jew in the world. He really accepted most of the assumptions of Rosenstock, but he gave them a different significance. It is true that the Jews have no place in this world, that real life belongs to the Christian nations, but that has its valid reason. The Jew leads a life of holiness, and holiness is lifelessness; holiness is not of this world. The Jew lives in eternity, in redemption, and pays for it by forgoing all temporal life. The Jew is beyond time, outside of history. The Jew has nothing? Indeed, it is so; but because he is already beyond everything; everything is “behind him.” He is at the goal. The temporal life of the Jew is indeed “a mere ghostly reflection of real life”; the Jew has given up historical reality. He does not die for any country, any cause? That is so. His “holy land” is merely the “land of his longing,” to prevent him from finding home anywhere in space and time where he does not belong. Yes, he does not know of “sacrificial death and the threatening abyss”; and rightly so. Being at the goal, his deathlessness must be secured. Therefore, he does not make his survival dependent on anything outside himself. He carries his immortality in his blood. The “precious life juice” must not be wasted on such things as “country and cause.” Neither can the blood community go out into the world and toil for the universal reconciliation of all the nations, their union as children of the one Father. It cannot do it for two reasons: It cannot spend the energies of its redeemed soul on an unredeemed world; having reached God without a divine mediator incarnate, it could not bring the “message” to the heathens. Christianity had to be called in. The Christian is born a heathen and a “piece” of the heathen remains with him forever; thus, it alone is equipped to bring God to the heathens. As to Abraham’s sacrifice, Rosenstock is almost right. That is to say, he is not wrong, because for an Abraham it would have been much easier to give his own life than to sacrifice the life of another human being, and especially his own child. He is wrong, because Abraham sacrificed not only what he was, but everything he could have become through his son.<sup>67</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. <i>Judaism Despite Christianity</i>, p. 184.</i> In other words, Abraham’s sacrifice was very much like that of Jesus, only more so. In <i>Der Stern</i> this became the contemporaneous existence of all the generations of the Jews, as the result of which, when a grandson and a grandfather look at each other, they behold the first ancestor and the last offspring, which is the secret of the “eternal now,” of true immortality."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.74","In <i>Der Stern</i> he moves even more strictly within the framework of Rosenstock’s categories than in the <i>Correspondence</i>. The blood community of the Jews is really an old Christian concept, repeated by Rosenstock. In the letters, Rosenzweig responds to it by saying that the law “must keep open the possibility of proselytism, because of the messianic character of Judaism. According to this the blood relationship is maintained only on account of its symbolic meaning.”<sup>68</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 138.</i> In <i>Der Stern</i> the blood community is not a bit symbolic, just as it was not symbolic for Rosenstock. It is a closed community that protects itself against any admixture of alien blood from without. The “pure wells of the blood” have to be safeguarded. In the <i>Correspondence</i>, Rosenzweig declares that Judaism cannot make common cause with the world-conquering fiction of Christian dogma, “because it is a fiction.”<sup>69</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., p. 112.</i> In <i>Der Stern</i>, Christianity is a truth. Rosenstock is right again, Jews don’t acknowledge the truth of Christianity, but one cannot really say that that is the trouble with the Jews. There are two truths, the Jewish truth, valid at the goal, in the <i>eschaton</i>, in which Jews already live, and a Christian truth in time and history, which is the place of Christianity. Or as one might also say: There is only one truth—with a Jewish half and a Christian half. Keeping the blood community open now for the proselyte? The idea has to be abandoned now. There is a strict division of labor now, time and the work in time belongs to Christianity; Judaism, at the goal, is just waiting for the harvest of history to be garnered into eternity. Judaism is no longer messianic, as it still was in the <i>Correspondence</i>. It is already at the goal. Only Christianity is messianic, for it is the nations of history that are in need of redemption."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.75","The two agree with each other even in their attitude to Zionism, though for Rosenzweig Zionism has a different significance. According to Rosenstock Zionism is the end of the “Wandering Jew.” But the eternal Jew’s return to Zion is not the fulfillment of a messianic promise. How could it be? If it were, it would mean the refutation of everything he believed in and stood for. It is the end, in the literal sense; the end, not as a goal, but the end, the finish; the finish of the people of the Bible—in other words, the end of the Jew and Judaism.<sup>70</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ibid., pp. 140–141.</i> Zionism as an element in the continuity of Jewish history is inconceivable to Rosenstock. And rightly so from his point of view. In essence, it is also Rosenzweig’s evaluation of it. He could not see it as a moment within the history of the Jewish people. Where there is no history, there can be no continuity either. A people redeemed is in no need of a return to Zion. The true Jew is, indeed, the wandering Jew, just as Rosenstock also believed. Only Rosenstock could not understand the true significance of that fact. He believed that Jew had to be an eternal wanderer because he was rejected; Rosenzweig maintained that the Jew had to wait and wander along “the banks of the flow of world time” because he was elected. For both of them Zionism was not for real. In the letters, the martyrdom of Israel in a Christian-dominated world still has some significance, but in <i>Der Stern</i> “the lifeless life” of eternity has taken such possession of Rosenzweig that only once or twice is there a fleeting reference to the “body of the Jew” which was rather embarrassingly attached to a temporal reality, where there was really no place for it. Rosenzweig never understood what exile meant. Had he understood it, his entire philosophy of Judaism and of Christianity would have been altogether different. It would have allowed him a genuine breakthrough from the prison of his intellectual preconditioning into a more authentic interpretation of Judaism."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.76","The entire philosophy of Judaism in <i>Der Stern</i> is anticipated in the letters in three pithy sentences in Latin: <i>fiat veritas, pereat realitas</i>—let there be truth and let reality perish; <i>fiat regnum Dei, pereat mundus</i>—let there be the kingdom of God and let the world be destroyed; <i>fiat nomen Dei Unius, pereat homo</i>—let the name of God be One and let man pass away. This is the essence of what is taught in <i>Der Stern</i>. The Jew beholds the truth within himself by turning away from outside reality. That the Kingdom of God is the kingdom of priests, and a holy people is outside of time and history implies a rejection of the world. And the name of God becomes One when He becomes All in All and man and nature return into the divine bosom as it all was before creation."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.77","I dare say that nothing of this is found anywhere either in the sources of Judaism or in Jewish tradition. It all sounds much too Christian. That the Kingdom of God is not of this world is classical Christian dogma. The truth that requires a turning away from reality makes good sense within an outlook that sees all reality as fallen and corrupt because of original sin. And finally, the name of God, One without man and the world, is reached in Christian dogma when Jesus brings mankind back to God and he surrenders his lordship—God thus becoming All in All. This is completely alien to Judaism. The goal of the Jew is to be realized on earth in working for the establishment of the world as God’s Kingdom. Truth is meaningful for man only insofar as it finds its place in reality. It is man’s responsibility to make room for it in reality. Jeremiah calls God the God of Truth and that is for him the parallel to <i>Elohim Ḥayim</i>,<sup>71</sup><i class=""footnote"">Jeremiah 10:10.</i> the God of Life; the true God is the living God. And the living God is the God who is present, however mysteriously, in the life of man and the history of the nations. Where the psalmist exclaims: “Thou has redeemed me O Eternal, Thou God of Truth,”<sup>72</sup><i class=""footnote"">Psalms, 31:6.</i> he does not mean: redeemed from all this-worldly desires which enable him to exist, as the Jew on <i>Yom Kippur</i> does according to Rosenzweig, as if beyond the grave. What he means is clearly indicated in the context: God is his “rock and fortress”; God “leads and guides” him and brings him out of “the net that they have hidden” for him. In the Bible of the Jew, “God is true” means that man may rely on him, trust in him in time and history.<sup>73</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. the author’s, <i>Man and God, Studies in Biblical Theology</i>, Chapter 6, <i>Emeth, the Concept of Truth.</i></i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.78","The Psalmist also says: “Truth springeth out of the earth.”<sup>74</sup><i class=""footnote"">Psalms 85:12.</i> The rabbis declared truth to be one of the three pillars of the world maintaining it together with justice and peace.<sup>75</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Mishnah, Abot</i>, I, 18.</i> All three must be real in time. A truth which is not to be realized in this world is no concern of man. A Jew will give his life for the truth of God so that it may grow from the earth. Finally, in Jewish tradition, when God’s name will be one, he will not be All in All. Man will be man; nations will be nations; and nature will be nature—as God intended them to be. On that day, when God will be One and His name one, he “shall be On that day, when God will be One and His name one, he “shall be King over all the earth.” There will be earth, and there will be man; and “all the land shall be turned as the Arabah … and man shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more extermination, but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.”<sup>76</sup><i class=""footnote"">Zechariah, 14:9–11.</i> The purpose of God with man and the world has to be fulfilled in time and history. Let there be truth so that reality may not be absurd; let there be the Kingdom of God on earth “speedily in our days”; let God be One and His name one, so that—to quote from the great prayer of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> and <i>Yom Kippur</i>—“men may become one brotherhood to do thy will with a perfect heart.”"

"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.80","Rosenzweig’s other-worldly categories fit Christianity far better than Judaism. At least, in its basic dogmas Christianity is other-worldly. Accordingly, the Kingdom of God is not of this world. This other-worldly Kingdom was “at hand” and it was to be revealed in the Second Coming, which, according to the faith, was to have been immediate. In its original intention Christianity was a move out of history, against history. More recent Christian theologians put it succinctly. Mircea Eliade formulated it as follows:"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.81","… it must not be lost sight of that Christianity entered history in order to abolish it: the greatest hope of the Christian is the second coming of Christ, which is to put an end to all history.<sup>77</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. this author’s <i>Man and God, Studies in Biblical Theology</i>, the chapter, <i>Sedeq and S’daqah</i> especially conclusion of chapter.</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.82","Rudolf Bultmann, quoting another author, writes:"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.83","To the Christian the advent of Christ was not an event in that temporal process which we mean by history today. It was an event in the history of salvation, in the realm of eternity, an eschatological moment in which rather this profane history of the world came to an end. And in an analogous way, history comes to an end in the religious experience of any Christian who is in Christ.<sup>78</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. R. Bultmann’s essay, <i>History of Salvation and History</i> in his Existence <i>and Faith.</i></i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.84","Within Christianity, the Kingdom and history are antithetical. All history is Fall and all cultures fall into history. At the very heart of Christianity there is a split between civilization and faith, between culture and redemption, between the city of man and the city of God.<sup>79</sup><i class=""footnote"">This author has discussed this subject more thoroughly in an article, <i>The Death of a God</i>, published in <i>Judaism</i>, Winter, 1971.</i>"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.85","How then did Christianity enter history? The problem arose from what is known as the “delayed <i>perousia</i>”. Jesus came and went, but the promise of an other-worldly redemption remained unrealized. This was rather embarrassing. Some compromise had to be reached between the utopian other-worldly Kingdom and the actual condition of human existence. Christianity entered history with a vengeance. The compromise has been continuous, an ongoing surrender of the original other-worldliness in order to gain the world. Christianity became the Church, and the Church, a conqueror. Thus, the world was given Christian culture, Christian civilization, and Christian history. Thanks to the sword of Constantine, Christianity became a this-worldly power of the first magnitude. According to the rhetoric, it was the Word turned Flesh that was victorious. It would indeed have been important to see what the Word could have accomplished in history without the sword. Christianity became extremely successful in this world; and the more it compromised its original conscience the more successful it became. On the scene of world history, Christianity became the rhetoric of humility, mercy, love, universal brotherhood, redemption; in fact, it was intolerance, violence, persecution, massacre, war—the most distinguishing features of Western civilization. The Jew was not impressed; nor was he fooled. No one knew better than he, how unredeemed the world was. Redemption, indeed!"
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.86","Is the Jew outside of history? Yes, outside the history of success. The Jew preferred faithfulness to success. There are really two histories: power history and faith history. The Church, which has been triumphant with the sword of Constantine, decided to move into power history; the Jew lives in faith history. For the superficial eye, it is far less glorious there, far less majestic. But it is surely cleaner. The Jew will not accept Rosenzweig’s neat division of labor between Judaism and Christianity. As long as the world is not at the goal, the Jew is not at the goal either. The Jew toils in history, works in history, no less than the Christian. But the Jew works in the faith dimension of history; Christianity, in its power dimension. The methods are different and one also judges failure and success differently. In the letter to Rudolph Ehrenberg, to which we have referred earlier, Rosenzweig wrote that when he agreed to convert to Christianity he realized the staff of Judaism was a broken one. He envied Christianity its ruler staff. The two staves are of course nothing but a self-flattering Christian fairy tale. The staff of Judaism is not broken, simply because Judaism never held the ruler staff in its hand. In the realm of faith history there are no rulers. Judaism never had the ambition to conquer. Judging history by Germanic-Christian standards Rosenzweig believed that there was no place for the Jew in <i>the</i> world. He was right and yet not right. There is indeed no place for the Jew in <i>that</i> world. Yet, he lives in the world. The true significance of his life is that he makes a stand in time and history and is still there without might and without power, the only proponent of the feasibility of life in the faith dimension of history, which may be the mysterious point that God wishes to make through the Jew at this juncture of man’s pilgrimage on earth."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.87","Rosenzweig relates Judaism and Christianity to each other. The truth is that while Christianity cannot do without relating itself to Judaism and without defining itself in contradistinction from Judaism, Judaism as such has no relationship to Christianity. Unlike Rosenzweig, who, because of specific circumstances, was returning from the very edge of Christianity, a Jew does not have to affirm his identity by continuous discussion with Christianity. Christianity is irrelevant for being a Jew. Just as Rosenzweig was deeply influenced by Rosenstock in his interpretation of Judaism, so, it would appear, was Rosenstock influenced by Rosenzweig in his final view of Christianity.

In a poem Rosenstock said of the mutuality of this relationship: “Enemies in space, brethren in time.” This, of course, is the Christian view. It has the added advantage that it makes the inhumanity and barbarism inflicted by Christianity on Judaism quasi reasonable and justifiable. A Jew will not accept it. Just because the Jew does not have to define himself in contradistinction to Christianity, he has no enmity either towards Christianity or Christians. If he hates, he will hate oppressors, persecutors, and murderers, because they oppress, persecute, and murder, but not because they are Christians. “Brethren in time” true, and not only in time, whatever that may mean, but in time as well as in space; and not only Jews and Christians, but all men, brethren in the sight of God, brethren in truth—but alas! not yet in history."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.88","Franz Rosenzweig: we can only think of him with love and stand before his memory in awe—the great Jewish soul who found home to brighten the sky over German Jewry as the lights were about to go out. And yet, intellectually he was unable to liberate himself from the net of an arrogant civilization that claimed to be the world."
"Major Themes., 2: Franz Rosenzweig’s Philosophy of Judaism (1886–1929.89","What was started in 333 <small>C.E.</small> with the sword of Constantine the Great was completed in the concentration camps and crematoria. At Auschwitz, Christian history and civilization as we have known them came to an end—long before omega, long before the <i>eschaton</i>. And in Zion and Jerusalem a new dawn is mysteriously breaking for the land, the language, and the law, that were lifelessly holy for Rosenzweig."
"Major Themes., 1.1","Ever since the Christian apostle, Paul, subjected the concept of the law to his devastating criticism and opposed to it the idea of faith, faith and law have become related to each other antithetically. It is assumed that he who lives by his faith is in no need of the law, and he who lives by the law is lacking in inwardness of faith. The Western Jew, who is on all sides surrounded by the traditions of Western civilization, is continually exposed to the impact of this antithesis and often accepts its validity almost subconsciously. From the Jewish point of view, however, this manner of confrontation between faith and law is the result of a misunderstanding of the function of the law and, with it, of the very purpose of Judaism. The law is not an end in itself; it is a means to an end. The law shows a way and teaches a deed, “the way that they should go and the deed that they should do.” According to the Talmud, the teaching of the law is of decisive importance because it leads to the deed. The Torah is the guide to the Jewish way, it prepares man for the Jewish deed. The emphasis on the law is due to the emphasis on the <i>Ma’aseh</i>. It is for this reason that the law in Judaism is known by the term <i>Halachah</i>, which, because of its derivation from the root <i>haloch</i>, to walk, is best rendered as the discipline for going along one’s way as a Jew. The confrontation is not between faith and law but between faith and deed. The question is not what importance one attaches to the law in relationship to faith, but what significance one ascribes to the deed as compared to faith."
"Major Themes., 1.2","Having reached this point, we have to be on our guard. What do we mean by faith? The faith of Judaism? Certainly not. Within Judaism the conflict between faith and law or between faith and deed does not arise. That “the righteous lives by his faith” was not a discovery of the Christian apostle, Paul. Using those words, he only quoted the Jewish prophet Habakkuk. That the words of the prophets were not lost on Judaism, one may judge by the talmudic interpretation that the six hundred and thirteen commandments of the Torah were summed up in the one principle of Habakkuk, that of living by one’s faith. Faith in Judaism requires that the deed be done in accordance with the will of God as made manifest in His law. He who rejects the law rejects the deed. But since the deed is prescribed by a law whose acceptance is based on faith, the rejection of the deed implies a rejection of the faith too. Rejecting the deed, the Christian apostle did not choose faith but formulated a new concept of faith. The antithesis is, therefore, not between faith and law but between the Christian concept of faith and the Jewish concept of law. But again, since the Jewish concept of the law and the deed is not to be separated from the Jewish concept of faith, the confrontation between faith and law is based on a confusion of issues. In truth, the antithesis is between faith and faith—which, of course, should not be a bit surprising."
"Major Themes., 1.3","One may discuss the relationship between faith and deed in Judaism successfully with the help of the understanding of the new concept of faith that emerged from Christianity’s rejection of the law and of the deed. The source of the rejection was not a new insight into the nature of faith but rather a new evaluation of life, of human existence. With the depreciation of the law, the deed—to which it leads—was devalued. The deed was degraded because one had lost faith in the meaning of the works of man. At the root of it all was despair over man and the world. In the philosophy of the Christian apostle, man and the world stood in the sign of hopelessness. This meant, of course, not only the rejection of the law but also the rejection of the old faith. According to Judaism, faith in God extends to God’s creation too. Because he trusts in God, the Jew knows that God’s evaluation of His creation, <i>ki tov</i>, that it is good, is valid forever. It applies to man no less than to the rest of creation. Man, too, is good, because he is capable of goodness, because he may well serve the purpose which God intended for him in his creation. Because of this, his life, in all its creaturely existence, is significant; it carries on itself the marks of divine approval. Because of it, what he does, how he lives does matter; the human deed is all-important. When this faith was lost, the human deed, too, became meaningless. Those who were overwhelmed by a sense of hopelessness over man and history needed a new faith that held out hope in an other-worldly salvation."
"Major Themes., 1.4","What are the characteristic features of such a faith? It is a faith most intimately private and personal. It aims at the closest possible relation between man and his Maker. Since it is altogether spiritual, and a flight of the soul from the indignities of bodily existence in the valley of darkness, one should better say that this faith is a relation of trust between a soul and God. The human being in his wholeness may not enter into the relation; the body, man’s biological reality, is left outside. Furthermore, in pure faith the soul “detaches” itself not only from the body but also from other human beings. Dedicated as one is in faith to the exclusive concern for one’s soul and its bliss, one clings to God in solitude, as a being apart, alone with the Alone. Whatever is happening between God and the individual soul is outside the dimension of space and time. Man in his biological reality and society in its this-worldly historicity are unredeemable. The result is a kingdom of God which is not of this world, a religion which is essentially indifferent toward history and society. There is no room left here for the deed, nor any function for the law."
"Major Themes., 1.5","Not such is the faith of Judaism. Since its trust in God embraces an attitude of confidence in His creation, as man turns to God he is led to life by his faith. The relation, however intimate, is never truly private, for it is open to the world and man’s responsibility in it. It is by his faith that the Jew learns of his place in the world. He may seek God in loneliness, but once he has found Him he stands in the midst of life. He draws near God not as a soul but in his full humanity: “The soul is thine, and the body, Thy work.” He longs for redemption not as a spiritual being but as a human being. Man in all his creaturely existence is to be redeemed. Redemption is an event in history. This world is to be established as the Kingdom of God. The deed, man’s daily life in space and time, must find its place in the Kingdom; it builds the Kingdom. The deed is the act of the integrated human being. It is not performed by the soul, nor can it be done by the body alone. It comes into existence through the coordination of the spiritual and material powers of man. It is through the deed alone that man may relate himself to God in the fullness of his humanity. The deed, being the stuff out of which history is made, is never private; it is always public, as history itself. The true dimension of the deed is between man and man. It is always performed among people. The faith that motivates the deed links the Jew to God; the dimension of the deed joins him to mankind. The faith may be private and individual; the deed is public and social. The deed is an act of faith in God and an act of faithfulness toward man; it is trust in God and responsibility toward man. The faith needs no law. But the faith leads to the deed and the deed is never without a law, without an understanding of what is required, of what ought to be. Nor is the deed the act of an individual; it is that of man in community with other men. The deed of a community must be informed by a law for the community. A faith in God that leads to the deed in the presence of God asks for a law of God."
"Major Themes., 1.6","There is, in truth, no genuine confrontation between faith and law; there is no choice between them. If one starts out with a philosophy of despair and is willing to abandon life in its biological and socio-historical fullness to its doom of futility and meaninglessness, one is bound to seek salvation in some otherworldly spiritual redemption. One has not chosen faith and rejected law; one has rejected life and thus needs no law. One is left with one’s faith. But he whose faith in God includes faith in the value of God’s creation, he must do and live in the presence of God, he must do so in the company of men, together with his fellowmen. He embraces the law as he embraces the life which reaches him from God. He has no choice. He must do so if he wishes to live by his faith. Indeed, others may desire to be <i>saved</i> by their faith; he alone <i>lives</i> by his."
"Major Themes., 1.7",<b>2.</b>
"Major Themes., 1.8","There is, however, another sense in which faith and law may be considered antiletical to each other. The confrontation between them may be seen as a conflict between authentic subjective inwardness and conformity to an external objective norm. In this form, the antithesis has been accentuated in our days as a result of existentialist thinking. Faith as the realm of the most intimately personal requires personal involvement. It is an act of free individual commitment. In its very essence, it is altogether subjective. Law, one the other hand, stands for heteronomy. It is objectively given, and that means it is imposed from without. By its very nature, law is impersonal and, as such, destructive of individuality, the lifeblood of faith. In our opinion the antithesis, so considered, is due to the dilemma which is at the very heart of the existentialist position. To view the relationship between faith and law within Judaism as one of insoluble conflict is due to the unresolved existentialist dilemma which casts its misunderstood shadow on the Jewish canvas. What is the nature of this dilemma?"
"Major Themes., 1.9","Subjectivity is truth, said Kierkegaard, and, of course, he was right. Without vital involvement of the whole human being in it, without living commitment to it, truth is meaningless. Yet, at the same time the principle that subjectivity is truth may also be very wrong. Kierkegaard’s main concern was the “how” of man’s involvement in truth. He was rather indifferent toward the “what” of truth. He believed that if only the “how” were right, the “what” of truth would follow automatically. In fact, however, personal involvement is not enough. One may be most truly committed to something that is utterly untrue and false. Kierkegaard’s indifference toward objectivity may prove disastrous. Martin Heidegger, in his pursuit of authentic being, ended up in the Nazi camp. The existentialist emphasis on the individual and the personal is important, but it is not enough. Objectivity, too, is needed."
"Major Themes., 1.10","The second aspect of this existentialist dilemma derives directly from the human situation. At this point, existentialism is self-defeating. It insists on the importance of the individual, and, because of that, it must also insist on the importance of the deed. Living one’s own life authentically demands that the existentialist commitment issue into action. But only faith, i.e. affirmation without action, is purely individual. With action one breaks through the category of the individual—Kierkegaard called this his discovery—into the public, the communal. All action takes place in the midst of people. If one desires to live, one must take cognizance of the nonindividual, nonpersonal, the other. Calling himself the individual, how little satisfying was Kierkegaard’s life with other people! Here existentialism is up against something purely objective—the objective givenness of other people; indeed, the objective givenness of reality, including the individual subject."
"Major Themes., 1.11","We may sum up the existentialist dilemma by saying: if the necessary concern for the nature of the “what,” to which a person commits himself, requires a decent respect for objectivity, the givenness of the human situation, in which the commitment is enacted makes the encounter with objectivity inescapable."
"Major Themes., 1.12","The significance of the dilemma of our theme now becomes obvious. In the light of the nature of the dilemma, faith and law can no longer be considered antithetical to each other in an unfriendly manner. The subjectivity of faith in purity is untenable. If such subjectivity remains unrelated to objectivity in some adequate fashion, its very subjectivity may render faith either futile or dangerous. Since faith, if it is truly existential, requires the deed, the demand for objectivity in faith as well as in the deed is in truth a demand for law. Without subjectivity of affirmation, faith is hollow; without objectivity and lawfulness of contents, faith is truly blind."
"Major Themes., 1.13","Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig, the two outstanding Jewish existentialists, have attempted to resolve the dilemma. Martin Buber, of course, does not accept the traditional notion of a revealed law. Instead, he knows of the silent, wordless address of God that speaks to man from every experience of his life. Man is called to respond, and he responds with his deed. It is the deed that man chooses from among the numberless possibilities of his concrete situation. He alone must choose and do in complete freedom of commitment. Thus, the commitment is altogether subjective. Yet, the deed that follows also has its objective side. Among the innumerable possibilities of the concrete situation there is the one deed that is waiting to be done by man, that “means” him, that is intended for him. It is as if God had planted it there in order to be selected by man in his own unique situation. While it all depends on man, man is called to “his” deed, which is “his” even before it is undertaken by him. At times, Buber even speaks of the law of God. But it is not a law which is thrust upon man from without; “it rests deep within him.” It is up to man to awaken it when the “call” reaches him. Thus, by discovering his own innermost being he also embraces the law of God. The subjective commitment and the objective law become one when man chooses the deed. They are like “two notes that are one chord.” In this manner, Buber hoped to have solved the conflict between autonomy and heteronomy."
"Major Themes., 1.14","We are, however, unable to accept his solution. Since revelation, according to Buber, is a call to man, a challenge as it were—to find the deed and to do it—but otherwise is without contents, we remain completely in the realm of pure subjectivity. It is man alone who makes the decision; it is he alone who chooses the deed and judges that it is the deed that “means” him; it is but he who discovers the law of God at rest deep within him; it is only on the strength of his personal authority that he declares it to be the law of God within his heart. At every point everything depends on one’s subjective affirmation."
"Major Themes., 1.15",These subjective affirmations and commitments are sufficient for Buber. They are all there is. He has not really moved one step beyond Kierkegaard in this respect. It is still subjectivity that is acknowledged as truth.
"Major Themes., 1.16","Franz Rosenzweig, in his famous essay about the law which he addressed to Martin Buber, attempts a different solution. Unlike Buber, he acknowledges the law. His problem is how to make it relevant for the contemporary situation, for today. If, for Buber, in the dialogical situation man seeks to respond by discovering “his” deed and doing it, for Rosenzweig the task of the Jew is to make the law “his” law, the law for himself. But the law becomes my law if I have to carry it out, not because I am orderd to do so by some outside authority, but because I, in the fullness of my being, cannot leave it undone. One does not execute the law because one wills it, but because one is able to execute it. The law itself must turn into strength with the power of one’s individual being. In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the modern Jew, estranged from Judaism and from his people as he is, should once again become a link in the chain of the generations. Thus, the law itself may turn into Jewish vitality within him. He will carry out the law because he will act with the newly gained strength of his whole being. He will do it in order to give expression to his innermost nature. He will do what he can because he can do no other. Out of existential need, the ability to do so will become a necessity. It should, however, be understood that Rosenzweig, who found the way back to Judaism, spoke from a situation of estrangement to a generation of estranged Jews. His position is not a solution to the philosophical or theological problem; it is, rather, advice—and probably very good advice—in the accidental historical situation of an attempted return to Judaism. Philosophically speaking, even with Rosenzweig we remain caught in the net of subjectivity. The strength that enables us to carry out the law because we are able to do it flows to us as it lists. It comes when it comes and as it comes. We accept it, we do not examine it, we do not judge it. It is our strength; it is we. We carry out the law, because in possession of the ability to do it, which is identical with our very being, we cannot leave it undone. But we do what we can, what we are able to do. Thus, we carry out the law selectively. We do only what we are able to do; only <i>that</i> do we have to do existentially. However, we have no objectively valid principle of selection. The selection is not determined by our will, but only by our ability. Now, ability to do is, of course, not physical ability; that may be always present. It is existential ability that, when turned into the fulfillment of the law, gives meaningful expression to our whole being and that, therefore, must be employed if we wish to be ourselves. While there is a law which is given to the Jew, it is valid only when he is able to make it his own. The validation of the law is altogether subjective. Rosenzweig envisages not only “selection” from the inherited law but even the increase of the law by the institution of new laws through the inability of leaving that undone which one is able to do and, therefore, must do. Rosenzweig is, of course, much closer to what we consider to be the authentic Jewish position. In essence, however, he has not advanced far beyond Kierkegaard either. What he is saying in fact is that the “how” of our involvement with the law is more important than the “what,” that if only the “how” is truly personal and subjective it is bound to lead us to the objectively valid “what.” This, however, is more than questionable. The core of the existentialist dilemma remains unresolved."
"Major Themes., 1.17",<b>3.</b>
"Major Themes., 1.18","It would seem that the individual, as individual, must reach beyond the individual in order to find truth not in subjectivity alone or in objectivity alone, but in the meeting of subjectivity and objectivity. In Judaism, the point of meeting between the two is the law."
"Major Themes., 1.19","What type of faith is that of the Jew? Notwithstanding the Christian apostle Paul, it is wholly personal. Who can doubt it who knows of the life and work of the endless galaxy of Jewish giants of faith—men and women wholly committed to Judaism—finding in it the entire meaning of their lives, choosing it daily anew, discovering the ultimate of personal fulfillment in giving themselves to it without reservation? Yet, these people of faith did not experience the law as an impediment to the subjectivity of the “how” of their commitment. If one wishes to understand the relationship between faith and law in Judaism, one should not ask those to whom the law has become a meaningless yoke or a chain of slavery. The law in Judaism is not what it is to those who reject it but what it means to those who—often in full awareness of its critiques—accept it and strive to live by it. Only the Jews of faith-and-law can testify to the nature of the relationship between the two. For them, the law is naturally incorporated in their faith of unqualified personal commitment. The law itself, the <i>mitzva</i>, is the inexhaustible source of religious inspiration; it is the joy of the heart that enriches the very subjectivity of human existence and renders it personally more meaningful. “Sweeter also than the honey and the honeycomb” is the law for the Jew of faith-and-law. For him, the <i>simcha shel mitzva</i>, the joy that he derives from doing the will of God, is the highest form of existential fulfillment. In the <i>simcha shel mitzva</i>, the “how” of the truth is valid, yet the “what” of the truth has its source in the acceptance of the objectively given law and command. How is this to be explained?"
"Major Themes., 1.20","From the religious point of view, man and law have something in common which is essential to both: the law is God’s law, and man, too, is God’s. He is God’s man. This is not to be understood only in the external sense that he <i>has</i> to do the will of God, that he <i>has</i> to submit to a superior power, that he has to obey. That man is God’s is an ontological statement about man—such is his being, such his nature. Man is God’s existentially. God is given to him, to his individuality. Such is the nature of human subjectivity that it can realize itself only by taking due cognizance of the objectively given reality that is God. Such is the essence of man’s individuality that it may find fulfillment only in the presence of God. Thus, the very subjectivity of faith requires living in the sight of God and doing the will of God."
"Major Themes., 1.21","Especially existentialist thinkers speak of faith as if it were a personal relation between one subject and another, between an I and a Thou. This is a mistake. In the actuality of the encounter between God and man, in the I-Thou relation, there is no need for faith. However, such actualization of the relation is extremely rare. Only exceptional people experience it at exceptional moments of their lives. But beyond the I-Thou relation, God remains the objectively given reality that forever accompanies man’s individual existence. Faith acknowledges this fact by affirming the relation between God and man beyond the actuality of the I-Thou situation. In the act of faith the law represents the objectivity of the givenness of God for man’s individuality; by means of the law the relationship is sustained beyond the actualization of the Divine Presence; by doing the will of God man remains Godward turned, related to Him, and only thus fulfilling the ontic meaning of his God-given and God-anchored subjectivity. In the act of faith the law is God’s messenger, His representative. It is in this sense that a midrashic interpretation has the boldness to say of each of the <i>arba minim</i> (the four plants) of the Succot festival: “<i>Ze ha’kadosh baruk hu</i>, it is the Holy One, blessed be He.” (<i>Midrash Rabba</i>, Vayikra 30:9) Acknowledging each <i>mitzva</i> as God’s messenger to man, the Jew of faith is in contact with God by fulfilling His commandment."
"Major Themes., 1.22","Man is God’s we have maintained, and, of course, so too is the law. The proper understanding of this concept may further clarify the idea that the law is the meeting point of subjectivity and objectivity. The true significance of the God-given law is not that it is imposed from without. Theonomy is not heteronomy. God knows man; God considers man, his essenial nature. He considers not only man in general, <i>i.e.</i>, mankind, He knows man the individual, every individual in his uniqueness and in the uniqueness of his situation. Thus, when He revealed His law to Israel, He directed it to all Israel, to every individual Jew, in his situations at all times. This is the meaning of the midrashic teaching, that all the souls of all generations yet to come were assembled at Sinai to receive the Torah together with the contemporary generation of Jews. Because it is God’s law, it possesses the quality of being able to confront man in full consideration of his subjective nature. Because it is divine law, because God does consider man, the human subjectivity of faith and the objectivity of the law complement each other."
"Major Themes., 1.23","If our thesis is correct, while the form of the law is uniformly established for all times, its meaning, its address to the individual must be inexhaustible. It carries its own single message to every individual in the singleness of his own condition. The form is objective; the meaning of its contents is subjectively directed to each man in his time, to his individuality, by the One who knows him and gives him His law <i>because</i> He knows him. According to midrashic interpretation, on the occasion of the revelation at Sinai each one of the assembled received the Torah in a manner commensurate with his strength and receptive capacity. We see the eternal validity of the Torah in this its quality of revealing itself to everyone according to his own condition. The objectivity of form hides riches of meaning that are capable of speaking ever anew to the present man in the contemporary situation. This is the meaning of the old rabbinic teaching that one should read the Torah as if it were given today. One should read it in this manner because it is indeed directed to us each day anew."
"Major Themes., 1.24","There is, of course, tension between the subjectivity of faith and the objectivity of the law. But the tension is necessary. It is the creative irritant in the continuous unfolding of meaning and contents. By means of the tension, each generation—and every individual Jew—discovers the layer of meaning in the law God intended for it, for him. Not all is given. The meaning intended for us must be discovered by us and made our own in the fullness of our individuality within the frame of the God-given objectivity of our situation, in which our very subjectivity, too, has its root and origin."
