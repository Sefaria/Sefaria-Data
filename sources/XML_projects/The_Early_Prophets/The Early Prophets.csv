"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.1","Setting the Stage: The opening chapter is a fitting beginning to the book, focusing as it does on key themes to come but also purposely linking up with the ideas and vocabulary of the previous book, Deuteronomy. For example, as Polzin (1980) and others have noted, vv.3–7 contain almost literal citations of Deut. 11:24–25 and 31:7–8. And just as in an earlier example of this phenomenon, where the opening words of Leviticus take us back to the book of Exodus, thus aligning itself within the Five Books, so Joshua’s beginning assures us that the words of Deuteronomy will be fulfilled. This is further reinforced by the vocabulary in Chap. 1, featuring such Deuteronomic phrases as “the servant of YHWH” (v.1), “Be strong and courageous” (v.6), and the obvious multiple repetitions of “give” and “land,” which support both YHWH’s long-standing promise to the Israelites and Yehoshua’s worthiness to succeed Moshe. Nelson likens the chapter to the account of a “royal installation,” not that of a general’s commissioning, and thus it is, appropriately, societal leadership which stands at the center here, as indeed it will throughout the four-book sequence of The Early Prophets. So what could have been a time of instability—the predicted outcome of succession after a great leader has died—is treated by the text in a manner that gives weight to the new leader."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.2","The boundaries cited here are at best ideal borders as conceived at a later period. They do not correspond to any known historical reality, in the Bible or elsewhere. But the language is reminiscent of Assyrian imperial thinking, an influence that appears throughout the first half of the Bible. The generalities of the boundaries—wilderness, mountains (“the Levanon”), river, and sea—are typically used in Assyrian records to indicate a king’s vast rule (see Wazana 2003)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.3","The simple word “all” recurs throughout this chapter, signifying alternately the whole people, the army, the land to be conquered, and the sum total of God’s stipulations and teachings. Clearly the text wishes to impress on the audience that following “all” of God’s laws will lead to possession of “all” the land."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.4","From v.12 to the end of the chapter, the text introduces an issue that will never fully be resolved in Joshua. Two and a half tribes out of the twelve request permission to remain on the east bank of the Jordan, in the fertile region known as Gil’ad. On condition that they aid the others in conquering the west bank of Canaan, Yehoshua grants their wish. It is fulfilled in the first part of Chap. 12, but, as the opening of Chap. 22 demonstrates, biblical Israel was apparently ambivalent about the occupation of the eastern territory."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.5","1:1 Now it was, after the death of Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.6","that Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua son of Nun, the attendant of Moshe, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.7",2 Moshe my servant is dead.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.8","So-now, arise, cross this Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.9","you and all this people,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.10","into the land that I am giving to them, to the Children of Israel."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.11","3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.12","to you I have given it,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.13",as I promised Moshe;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.14","4 from the Wilderness and this Levanon up to the Great River, the River Euphrates,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.15","all the land of the Hittites as far as the Great Sea, toward the coming in of the sun,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.16",shall be your territory.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.17","5 No man will stand up before you, all the days of your life;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.18","as I was with Moshe, I will be with you,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.19","I will not desert you, I will not abandon you!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.20",_____________
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.21","1:1 <b>Moshe:</b> Pronounced <i>mo-SHEH;</i> traditional English “Moses.” <b>Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> As explained above in “On Using This Book,” the name of God in the Hebrew Bible, whose pronunciation is not precisely known, is traditionally transcribed as “the Lord.” Here it is printed according to the way it appears in the Hebrew text, and the reader may choose how to say it (other possibilities include “the Eternal,” <i>“Adonai,”</i> etc.). <b>the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The use of this title links the beginning of Joshua to the conclusion of Deuteronomy (34:5), emphasizing the unbroken continuity between Moshe and his successor. The term is also attached to David and some of the kings of Judah who followed him, indicating the concept of the sacred task of the biblical leader (Gray 1986). Regarding Moshe it is used fourteen times in the book of Joshua, a significant patterned number (two times seven). <b>Yehoshua:</b> Pronounced <i>yeho-SHOO-ah;</i> trad. English “Joshua.” <b>the attendant of Moshe:</b> Yehoshua’s title already when we first meet him in Exod. 24:13."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.22","2 <b>arise, cross:</b> Kimhi understands this (starting with Heb. <i>q-y-m</i>) in the spirit of “go cross,” or “go ahead and cross.”"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.23","3 <b>Every place … to you I have given it:</b> This probably reflects an ancient legal practice of walking out a boundary to establish ownership of territory; see also Gen. 13:14–17, where God has Avraham do the same (Fishbane). The repetition of “give” in the chapter emphasizes that, in ancient legal language, this is a land grant."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.24","4 <b>this Levanon:</b> Pronounced <i>leh-vah-NOHN;</i> trad. English “Lebanon,” the “white” mountain range to the north of Israel, from which the present-day country derives its name. <b>the land of the Hittites:</b> Most of the references to “Hittites” in the Bible, and Assyrian documents, seem to refer to a localized Canaanite group, which may or may not be related to the more prominent Hittite kingdoms farther north. <b>the Great Sea:</b> The Mediterranean. <b>territory:</b> Heb. <i>gevul</i> can also, as often throughout the book, mean “border, boundary.”"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 1.25",5 <b>No man will stand up before you:</b> No one will be able to stand against you. <b>not desert you … not abandon you:</b> A new expression of God’s reassurance; Moshe had been told on several occasions that “I will be with you.”
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 2.1","The Spies and Their Hostess: Instead of launching into details about the beginning of a military campaign, as ancient Near Eastern battle accounts conventionally do, the Bible here presents a dramatic story with multiple interests. By focusing on a central character, the prostitute Rahav, who is the only named personality in the narrative (Nelson), the text is able to convey the fear in which the citizens of Jericho hold the Israelites, the practical problems and tensions of conquest, and, above all, the hand of God in what is to come. Rahav’s humanity, unexpected as it is, moves the narrative from a dry reconnaissance account to one of emotional depth."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 2.2","The story also introduces a key theme in Joshua: trying to explain why some Canaanites are still living among the Israelites in the audience’s time. And since loyalty to God is to be a major factor in the Israelites’ coming military actions, it makes sense to start with a story about Rahav’s and the soldiers’ loyalty to one another."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 2.3","Fishbane draws attention to the repetition of “send” in the narrative, which marks both “principal actions … and the main spatial units.” But there is more. The repeating vocabulary of the chapter emphasizes, on the one hand, what one would expect—“spies,” “look over,” “search out,” and “seek”—but also the aforementioned “loyalty” (<i>hesed</i>), and, most notably, a verb which in the Torah is often connected to acknowledgment of God’s power by foreigners: “know” (see v.9). In addition, as McCarthy has shown, the vocabulary of fear in vv.9 and 11—“dread,” “quivering,” and “our hearts melted”—recalls phraseology used in the ancient Near East of a common and potent image, the Divine Warrior."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 2.4","The Israelites achieve their first, and perhaps most stunning, victory, then, not through advanced strategy but via the hand of God, and it is typically manifested through an actor of low social status, Rahav. Liberation from bondage in the book of Exodus began with decisive action taken by women (the midwives, Moshe’s mother and sister, and Pharaoh’s daughter); the conquest of the Promised Land opens similarly."

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 2.44","17 just as we hearkened to Moshe, so we will hearken to you!"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 2.50",They went and they came to the house of a whore woman—her name was Rahav—

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.2","If we had any doubts as to Yehoshua’s leadership capabilities, they are dispelled by his Moshe-like act of splitting the waters of the Jordan—although Yehoshua himself does not stretch out a staff as Moshe and Aharon had done; this time, the act of cleaving the river is portrayed as coming directly from God. Only once will such a splitting of waters occur again, with Eliyyahu (Elijah) in II Kings 2. He too is presented as a kind of second Moshe, in acknowledgment of another great crisis in Israel’s history."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.3","The motif of a religious object such as the Coffer (Ark) leading troops into battle is known all over the ancient and medieval world. Although the present chapter involves no fighting per se, it seems wholly appropriate that the Coffer, borne by priests, spearheads the long-awaited fording of the Jordan and thus inaugurates the conquest of Canaan."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.4","Despite the dramatic moment in our text, the narrative is confusing at points. This has already been the case in previous accounts, such as the description of the revelation at Sinai (Exod. 19), and such confusion will also occur in Chaps. 4 and 6 below, as Nelson notes. This lack of clarity may stem from a complicated history of writing or transmitting the text, or from the desire to include all relevant traditions, no matter how inconsistent or contradictory."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.5","Key words in the chapter include, not surprisingly, “cross” and “people,” with clusters of “carry,” “Coffer,” and “priests,” and “waters” and “stand.” In the end, the crossing of the Jordan, in contrast to the cosmic upheaval at the Sea of Reeds in Exodus, is orderly and hierarchical. Once again, ceremony and what it stands for—bonding the social unit together—trump historical reporting."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.6","Those who seek a “scientific” explanation for the events of this chapter have noted the existence of clay riverbanks in the area, a soil composition that could lead to a temporary blockage (Rainey, following Aharoni). The text itself is wholly uninterested in such an approach."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.7",3:1 Yehoshua started-early in the morning;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.8","they marched on from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the Children of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.9","and they spent the night there, before they crossed over."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.10",2 Now it was at the end of three days
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.11",that the officials crossed into the midst of the camp
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.12","3 and commanded the people, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.13",When you see the Coffer of the Covenant of Y<small>HWH</small> your God
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.14","with the priests and the Levites carrying it,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.15",you yourselves are to march on from your place
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.16",and walk behind it.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.17","4 However—let it be far between you and it, about two thousand cubits in measure;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.18","do not come near it,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.19","in order that you may know the way that you are to go,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.20",for you have not crossed that way yesterday [or] the day-before.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.21",5 Yehoshua said to the people:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.22","Make yourselves holy,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.23",for tomorrow Y<small>HWH</small> will perform wonders in your midst!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.24","6 And Yehoshua said to the priests, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.25",Carry the Coffer of the Covenant
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.26",and cross over before the people!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.27",So they carried the Coffer of the Covenant
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.28",and walked before the people.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.29",7 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.30","Today I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.31",that they may know
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.32","that as I was with Moshe, I will be with you!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.33",_____________
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.34","3:3 <b>Coffer of the Covenant:</b> Ancient Israel’s central cultic object, this chest (trad. English “Ark”) contained the tablets on which the Ten Commandments (Exod. 20) were written. See Exod. 25:1–22 for a full description. <b>the priests and the Levites:</b> Others, “the Levitical priests.” The term is problematic; given that it is hardly used in the subsequent books of the Early Prophets, it may indicate a southern (Jerusalem) writer’s bias against Levites (Boling 1982)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.35","4 <b>let it be far:</b> Proper distance from holy objects must be observed, lest one incur divine wrath. <b>two thousand cubits:</b> Biblical cubits measured from eighteen to twenty-two inches, so the distance in question would have been half a mile or more. <b>go:</b> Or “walk.” <b>yesterday [or] the day-before:</b> An idiom meaning “the past.”"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.36","5 <b>Make yourselves holy:</b> That is, put yourselves in a state of ritual purity, by washing yourselves and abstaining from sexual relations. The same had been required of the people at Sinai (Exod. 19)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 3.37",6 <b>Carry … Coffer … Covenant:</b> The Hebrew is not alliterative.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.1","Memorializing the Crossing: Here, as Nelson notes, recounting the act of “crossing” (once again a key word in the narrative) attains the identity-forming position suggested in the last chapter. In his words, the “act of retelling … would perform the function of reinforcing peoplehood.” The account of river fording described in the text is thus as much a rite of passage for Israelite audiences, as well as for Jewish and Christian ones of later periods, as it is a dramatic moment in the text itself. As typically laid out in Deuteronomy, historical events are prized mainly for their later meaning; here, all-important is the issue of children asking their parents, “What are these stones?” Only when we get to v.12 is there finally a mention of war. But even this does not overshadow the elevation of Yehoshua’s status as leader, despite the fact that no swords have yet been drawn and no arrows have yet flown."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.2","In v.24 there is a reiteration of the verb “know,” which had been so meaningfully used in Chap. 2."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.3","8 And you, command the priests, those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.4","When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.5",in the Jordan you are to stand-still.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.6",9 Yehoshua said to the Children of Israel:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.7",Approach here and hearken to the words of Y<small>HWH</small> your God.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.8",10 Then Yehoshua said:

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.19","carrying the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>, the Lord of All the Earth, come to rest in the waters of the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.20",the waters of the Jordan will be cut off;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.21",as for the waters coming down from above—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.22",they will stand as one heap!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.23","14 So it was, at the people’s marching from their tents to cross the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.24","with the priests, those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant, before the people:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.25","15 that when those carrying the Coffer came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests, those carrying the Coffer, dipped in the edge of the water"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.26","—the Jordan being full to its banks, all the days of the harvest-cutting—"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.27","16 the waters stood still, those coming down from above;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.28","they rose as one heap, very far away, at Adam, the town that is beside Tzaretan,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.29","while those going down to the Sea of the Plain, the Sea of Salt, were completely cut off,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.30","and the people crossed over, opposite Jericho."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.31","17 And the priests, those carrying the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant, stood fast on dry-ground, in the middle of the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.32","while all Israel crossed over onto dry-ground,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.33",until the entire nation had completed crossing over the Jordan.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.34","4:1 Now it was, when the entire nation had completely crossed over the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.35","that Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.40",have them cross over with you
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.41",and place them at the night-lodging where you will lodge tonight.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.42","4 So Yehoshua called for twelve men whom he had confirmed, from the Children of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.43","one man, one man [apiece] per tribe,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.44",5 and Yehoshua said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.45","Cross over before the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> your God, into the middle of the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.46","and raise yourselves, each one, a stone onto his shoulder,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.47","corresponding to the number of tribes of the Children of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.48",6 in order that this may be a sign in your midst:

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.51",7 you are to say to them

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.53","when it crossed into the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.54","And these stones are to be a reminder to the Children of Israel, into the ages!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.55","8 The Children of Israel did thus, as Yehoshua had commanded:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.56","they lifted up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.57","as Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken to Yehoshua,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.58","corresponding to the number of tribes of the Children of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.59","and had them cross over with them to the lodging-place, and deposited them there."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.60","9 And the twelve stones Yehoshua erected in the middle of the Jordan, beneath the firmstanding-spot of the priests’ feet, those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.61",they are there until this day.

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.63","until all the matter that Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Yehoshua to speak to the people was completed,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.64",exactly as Moshe had commanded Yehoshua;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.65","the people went quickly, and they crossed over."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.66","11 And it was, when all the people had completed crossing over,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.67",that the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> and the priests crossed over before the people.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.68",_____________
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.69","8 <b>you are to stand-still:</b> Or “stop.” The reader does not yet know why, but it clearly anticipates something dramatic."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.70","10 <b>By this you shall know:</b> A dramatic phrase, used elsewhere only in the story of Korah (Num. 16:28) (Boling 1982). <b>the Living God:</b> Heb. <i>elohim hayyim</i>. The phrase probably carries the connotation of “active,” “vital”; I could not find an adequate English translation. <b>the Canaanite … :</b> An enumeration of indigenous “nations” which, in one form or another, occurs frequently in the Five Books of Moses. See Gen. 15:19 for the first such list. <b>Yevusite:</b> Trad. English “Jebusite.”"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.71","13 <b>coming down:</b> Heb. <i>ha-yoredim</i>, echoing the name of the river Jordan (Heb. <i>Yarden</i>, “The Descender”). <b>heap:</b> Used elsewhere only regarding the crossing of the Sea of Reeds in Exod. 15:8 (Meyers 2004)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.72","15 <b>the days of the harvest-cutting:</b> In the spring, after the yearly rains have stopped, and extending into early summer. The waters would then be high, making the crossing more difficult and thus miraculous."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.73","16 <b>Adam … Tzaretan:</b> Location unclear. <b>the Sea of the Plain, the Sea of Salt:</b> The Dead Sea."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.74",17 <b>nation:</b> A term (Heb. <i>goy</i>) rarely used of Israel; more common is the kinship-based term “people” (<i>’am</i>). Its usage here suggests that the crossing of the Jordan is an act of nation-founding.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.75",4:3 <b>firmstanding:</b> Not connected in Hebrew to the recurring “stand [still].”
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.76","6 <b>What are these stones to you?:</b> That is, what do they mean to you?"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.77","7 <b>these stones are to be a reminder:</b> This function is a common one in the Bible; see Gen. 28:18, where the stone that serves as Yaakov’s pillow becomes a “standing-pillar,” marking a holy or memorable spot."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 4.78","9 <b>until this day:</b> An important phrase in DH, occurring fully fifteen times in Joshua. Some scholars see it as confirming that such traditions are preexilic (see Geoghegan)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.1","The Transition to Canaan: The saga of passage across the Jordan now comes to its completion. The river itself has been crossed, but the people are somehow not yet fully Israelite. To accomplish this, the text first recounts the circumcision of the new, non-slave generation of males, which in biblical terms must now slough off its desert persona and become “civilized” as Israelites. The other ethnic marker described in the chapter is the observance of Passover, not so much as a holiday that recalls the dramatic events of deliverance from Egypt, but as a primarily agricultural festival, tied inextricably to the land, with the noticeable substitution of the “yield of the land” for the manna that had sustained the people in the wilderness. Israel is thus initiated into its full identity at the very moment that it physically sets foot on the soil of Canaan. The pairing of circumcision and Passover had already occurred at a parallel moment in Exod. 12, as Fishbane notes; and Hamilton nicely observes that “it is vital at this point to demonstrate that Israel belongs to Yahweh and not to Egypt. They are not Pharaoh’s property.”"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.2","Finally, just as Moshe was addressed by God at the start of Israel’s earlier nation-becoming, Yehoshua encounters a divine messenger, at least briefly. The appearance of the mysterious figure, sword drawn in hand, recalls the victorious divine stance often portrayed in ancient Near Eastern iconography. At this point, the path to war has been properly paved. A people and its leader are ready."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.3","In sum, the conquest reiterates the “prototype” of earlier days, as “the great paradigms of the past are renewed for future generations” (Fishbane). This statement could apply to the entire four-book collection that has come down to us as the Early Prophets."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.4","12 And the Children of Re’uven, the Children of Gad, and the half tribe of Menashe crossed over, armed, before the Children of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.5",as Moshe had spoken to them;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.6","13 about forty units of specially-drafted [men] from the armed-forces crossed over in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> to battle,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.7",to the Plains of Jericho.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.8",14 On that day Y<small>HWH</small> made Yehoshua great in the eyes of all Israel;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.9","they held him in awe, just as they had held Moshe in awe,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.10",all the days of his life.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.11","15 Then Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.12","16 Command the priests, those carrying the Coffer of the Testimony,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.13",that they should come up from the Jordan.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.14","17 So Yehoshua commanded the priests, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.15",Come up from the Jordan!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.16","18 And it was, upon the coming up of the priests, those carrying the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant, from the middle of the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.17",—the soles of the priests’ feet were drawn up onto the dry-ground—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.18",that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.19","and went on as yesterday [and] the day-before, to all their banks."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.20","19 Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.21","and encamped at Gilgal/Circle, at the sunrise edge of Jericho."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.22","20 And these twelve stones that they had taken from the Jordan, Yehoshua erected at Gilgal."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.23","21 He said to the Children of Israel, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.24","When your children ask their fathers on the morrow, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.25",What are these stones?
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.26","22 You are to make known to your children, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.27","On dry-land did Israel cross this Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.28","23 when Y<small>HWH</small> your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you, until your crossing over,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.29","just as Y<small>HWH</small> your God had done at the Sea of Reeds, which he dried up before us, until our crossing over—"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.30","24 in order that all the peoples of the earth might have knowledge of the hand of Y<small>HWH</small>, how strong it is,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.31","in order that you might hold Y<small>HWH</small> your God in awe, all the days [to come],"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.32","5:1 Now it was, when they heard—all the Amorite kings who were across the Jordan seaward,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.33","and all the Canaanite kings who were by the Sea,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.34","that Y<small>HWH</small> had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Children of Israel, until they had crossed over,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.35","their heart melted [in fear],"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.36",and they were left breathless before the Children of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.37","2 At that time, Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.38",Make yourself knives of flint
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.39","and again circumcise the Children of Israel, a second time."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.40",3 So Yehoshua made himself knives of flint
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.41","and circumcised the Children of Israel, at the Hill of Foreskins."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.42",4 And this is the matter concerning which Yehoshua circumcised them:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.43","all the people coming out of Egypt, the males, all the men of battle,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.44","had died in the wilderness, on the way,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.45",upon their going out of Egypt.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.46","5 For they had been circumcised, all the people who had gone out,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.47","while all the people who were born in the wilderness on the way, upon their going out of Egypt, had not been circumcised."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.48","6 For the Children of Israel had traveled forty years in the wilderness,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.49","until the entire nation was gone, the men of battle, who had come out of Egypt,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.50","who had not hearkened to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.51",those to whom Y<small>HWH</small> swore that he would not let them see the land
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.52","that Y<small>HWH</small> had sworn to their fathers to give them,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.53",a land flowing with milk and honey.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.54","7 But their children whom he had raised up in their place,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.55","<i>them</i> Yehoshua circumcised, for they were foreskinned,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.56",since they had not been circumcised on the way.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.57","8 Now it was, when the entire nation was done being circumcised,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.58","that they stayed in their place in the camp, until their recovery."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.59",9 And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.60",Today I have rolled the disgrace of Egypt from off you!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.61","So the name of that place has been called Gilgal/Rolling, until this day."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.62","10 The Children of Israel encamped at Gilgal,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.63","and they performed the Passover offering on the fourteenth day of the month, at sunset,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.64",in the Plains of Jericho.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.65","11 They ate from the yield of the land on the morrow of Passover: unleavened cakes and parched grain,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.66",on this very day.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.67","12 And the <i>mahn</i> ceased on the morrow, when they ate the yield of the land;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.68","there was no more <i>mahn</i> for the Children of Israel,"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.70","13 Now it was, when Yehoshua was at Jericho,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.71",that he lifted up his eyes and saw:

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.73",with his sword drawn in his hand!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.74",Yehoshua went toward him and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.75",Are you for us or for our foes?
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.76","14 He said: No,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.77","rather, I am the commander of Y<small>HWH</small>’s forces."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.78",Now I have come!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.79","Yehoshua flung himself on his face to the ground and bowed low,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.80",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.81",What does my lord have to speak to his servant?
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.82",15 The commander of Y<small>HWH</small>’s forces said to Yehoshua:

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.85",And Yehoshua did thus.

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 5.88","13 <b>units:</b> Agreeing with a number of scholars, Boling (1982) included, who understand the word <i>elef</i> as a military “contingent,” thus reducing the numbers drastically in these stories.

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.1","The Fall of Jericho: The first military action recorded in the book of Joshua is also the most memorable. While a historian of warfare might remark on the strategic genius of the siege of Jericho—troops silently marching around a city for six days might well be completely unnerving and demoralizing to its captive population—tactics and psychology are probably not the point of the narrative. Once again we have what looks like a ritual procession, almost as if an audience, by being receptive to the story, is experiencing the events as part of a communal festival of some sort (and Hawk 2000 notes the use of both shofar and shouting, integral to the story, in other biblical ritual contexts). In addition, there is a magical element, given that many ancient and later stories speak of a taking-possession by means of drawing a circle. In the present context, these devices, including the famous blowing of the shofars, have the effect of moving the credit for the victory away from the armies and squarely toward God. The way is cleared for the Israelite troops, and the actual conquest is easily accomplished."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.2","The vocabulary of the chapter naturally centers around circling, sounding blasts on the <i>shofars</i>, and shouting; at the same time, a major theme in the book, that of “devoting-to-destruction,” a holy war concept, makes its first pointed appearance here. Notably, the Coffer also makes its last appearance (Auld 1998), suggesting once again that the present version of the story is ritually based."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.3","Nelson points out that vv.18–19 foreshadow the next story, about Akhan, in their use of “desire,” “silver and gold,” and “disaster.” But as Chap. 4 did, this one chapter at least ends with a notice about Yehoshua’s greatness."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.4",6:1 Now Jericho closed up and was closed-up-tight before the Children of Israel;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.5",no one went out and no one came in.

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.28","with the seven priests carrying the seven <i>shofars of</i> rams in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.29",that they crossed over

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.57","16 And it was, at the seventh time,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.58","that the priests sounded blasts on the <i>shofars</i>,"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.67","18 And you, only be careful regarding the devoted-things,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.68",lest you feel desire and take from the devoted-things
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.69","and render the camp of Israel devoted-to-destruction,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.70",and bring disaster upon it.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.71",19 For all silver and gold and vessels of bronze and iron—

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.83",with the mouth of the sword.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 6.84","22 But to the two men, those spying out the land, Yehoshua said:"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 7.1","Breaking Faith; The Valley of Disaster: All has gone well so far. The Israelites, led by a pious and faithful general, have crossed the boundary into the Promised Land, secured the memory of the event for future generations, and recovered and renewed some of the most significant and symbolic ritual practices of their ancestors. Crowning this sequence, they have witnessed and participated in the miraculous destruction of an ancient and heavily fortified city. Now, however, disaster strikes, not for lack of effort or strategy, but for one reason only: the committing of sacrilege against God. One of the troops that took Jericho is unable to suppress the common soldier’s craving for plunder and tries to conceal his theft. The seriousness of the offense is indicated by the repeated use of the verb “take,” which will later (I Sam. 8) be highlighted in the text’s warning about the perils of kingship. Interestingly, the perpetrator Akhan stems from Yehuda (Judah), the southern tribe and region so often preferred in The Early Prophets. This might further support a northern authorship for the story."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 7.2","The drama of the narrative is heightened by the drawing of lots, with the confession coming only after their “capture,” as Hebrew usage has it. Akhan’s fate is execution by stoning, and, as in the case of Korah in Num. 16, includes all of his family and possessions. This serves to emphasize the seriousness of violating the rule of <i>herem</i>, plunder which is to be set aside (“devoted”) for God. In general it reinforces the book’s concept that ownership, of land as well as of movable goods, is ultimately God’s. To forget this is to incur a wrath so great that it results in unexpected military defeat, and thus the episode is a helpful reminder in the text that the conquest is a privilege, not a foregone conclusion."

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.1","The Conquest of Ai: This is the longest battle scene in the book. It mostly concerns the strategy of ambush and its execution; but significantly, the chapter ends (vv.30–35) with a covenant scene in which the divine “Instruction” is renewed in the manner prescribed by Moshe (see Deut. 27). Thus, despite the long description of strategy, which is of great interest to future military minds, and the geographically accurate details of the story, the chapter is really about the resolution of the Akhan debacle and the return to the original state of affairs in which God protects the Israelites in battle. To underscore this, in vv.8 and 27 the Israelites are first commanded to and then described as hearkening to “the word of YHWH”; in v.35, the assembled nation hears the word of Moshe read aloud (Nelson). Thus it is confirmed that the successful battle plan derives not from the general himself, but from the divine word. From now on, there will be no more question about how to defeat the Israelites, and in the very next chapter, a group of fearful Canaanites will have to resort to a ruse in order to simply survive."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.2","Vv.30–35 read like an interruption in the war account, but they seem to have been placed here to reestablish the distinctive relationship between Israel and Y<small>HWH</small>, which had been ruptured. In that sense, this little story is reminiscent of the regiving of the divine tablets in Exod. 34, which occurs after a parallel breach of the covenant. It is also an example of the book of Joshua faithfully carrying out Mosaic law, in this case the requirement of renewing the covenant as set forth in Deut. 27. Indeed, the language in vv.30–35 is constructed from phrases in Deuteronomy (Rösel)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.3","It has often been noted that Ai, “the Ruin,” was almost certainly not inhabited in the time of Yehoshua and that it was perhaps the very ruins that became entwined in popular imagination with the events recorded in our chapters."

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.23",like this and like that I did:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.24","21 I saw among the spoils a goodly Shin’ar mantle, and two hundred weights of silver,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.25","and an ingot of gold, fifty weights its weight;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.26",I desired them and I took them—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.27","and here they are, hidden in the ground, within my tent, along with the silver beneath it."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.28",22 Yehoshua sent messengers;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.29","they ran to the tent,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.30","and here, [it was] hidden in his tent, with the silver beneath it!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.31","23 They took them from amid the tent and brought them to Yehoshua and to all the Children of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.32",and they emptied them out in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.33",24 Then Yehoshua took Akhan son of Zerah
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.34","and the silver, and the mantle, and the ingot of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his ox, and his donkey, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that belonged to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.35",—all Israel was with him—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.36",and they brought them up to the Valley of Akhor/Disaster.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.37",25 Yehoshua said:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.38",How you have brought-disaster-on us!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.39",Y<small>HWH</small> will bring-disaster-on you this day!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.40",And all Israel pelted him with stones;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.41",they burned them with fire
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.42","and stone-heaped them with stones,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.43","26 and erected over him a large mound of stones, until this day."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.44",So Y<small>HWH</small> turned back from his flaming anger.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.45","Therefore the name of that place is called the Valley of Disaster, until this day."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.46",8:1 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.47","Do not be frightened, do not be dismayed;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.48",take all the people of battle with you
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.49","and arise, go up to Ai."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.50","See: I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.51",2 You are to do to Ai and to its king
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.52",as you did to Jericho and to its king;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.53",only its spoils and its animals may you plunder for yourselves.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.54","Set yourself an ambush for the city, behind it."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.55","3 So Yehoshua arose, along with all the people of battle, to go up against Ai."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.56","And Yehoshua chose thirty thousand men, mighty-men of valor,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.57",and sent them off at night;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.58","4 he charged them, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.59","See: you are setting an ambush for the city, behind the city;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.60","do not go exceedingly far from the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.61",but all of you be ready.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.62","5 As for me and all the fighting-people who are with me,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.63","we will come near to the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.64",and it shall be:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.65","when they come out to meet us, as at the beginning,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.66",we will flee before them.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.67","6 But when they come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.68",—for they will think: They are fleeing before us as at the beginning!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.69",and we flee before them—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.70",7 then <i>you</i> are to arise from the ambush
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.71",and take possession of the city;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.72",Y<small>HWH</small> your God will give it into your hand!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.73","8 And it will be, when you seize the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.74",that you are to ignite the city with fire;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.75",in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> you are to do.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.76",See: I have charged you!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.77","9 Yehoshua sent them off, and they went to the [place of] ambush"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.78","and stayed between Bet-El and Ai, seaward from Ai,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.79",and Yehoshua spent the night on that night amid the fighting-people.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.80",10 Yehoshua started early in the morning and mustered the fighting-people;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.81","then he went up, he and the elders of Israel, ahead of the fighting-people to Ai,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.82","11 while all the people for battle who were with him went up and approached, coming opposite the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.83","and encamped north of Ai,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.84",with a ravine between them and Ai.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.85",12 He took about five thousand men
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.86","and set them in ambush between Bet-El and Ai, seaward of the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.87","13 while the fighting-people set up the entire camp that was north of the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.88","as well as its rearguard, seaward of the city."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.89",And Yehoshua lodged that night in the middle of the valley.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.90","14 Now it was, when the king of Ai saw,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.91","that they went quickly and started-early, and the men of the city came out to meet Israel in battle,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.92","he and all his fighting-people, to the appointed place in front of the plain"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.93",—but he did not know that there was an ambush for him behind the city.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.94",15 And Yehoshua and all the fighting-people acted as if beaten before them;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.95",they fled by way of the wilderness.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.96","16 Then all the fighting-people who were in the city were summoned to pursue after them,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.97","and they pursued after Yehoshua and let themselves be torn away from the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.98",17 so that not a man remained in Ai or in Bet-El who had not gone out after Israel;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.99",they left the city open
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.100",and pursued after Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.101",18 Then Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.102","Stretch out the scimitar that is in your hand toward Ai,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.103",for into your hand I give it!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.104","So Yehoshua stretched out the scimitar that was in his hand toward the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.105",19 and the ambush quickly arose from its place
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.106","and ran, at the stretching out of his hand;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.107","they came to the city and captured it,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.108",and quickly ignited the city with fire.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.109",20 The men of Ai faced about behind them and saw:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.110","now here, the smoke of the city went up to the heavens!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.111",But they had no [place] at hand to flee to here or to there.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.112",And the fighting-people who had fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.113",21 Now Yehoshua and all Israel saw
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.114","that the ambush had taken the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.115","and that the smoke of the city was going up,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.116",so they returned and struck down the men of Ai.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.117","22 These went out of the city to meet them,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.118","and they were, regarding Israel, in the middle: these were on this-side and those were on that-side,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.119",and they struck them down
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.120",until they left them no survivor or fugitive.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.121","23 As for the king of Ai, they seized [him] alive"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.122",and brought him near to Yehoshua.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.123","24 Now it was, when Israel had finished killing all of the settled-folk of Ai, in the open-field and in the wilderness where they had pursued them,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.124","—all of them fell by the mouth of the sword, until they were gone—"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.125",that all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the mouth of the sword.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.126","25 And all those falling on that day, from man to woman,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.127","were twelve thousand, all the inhabitants of Ai."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.128",26 Now Yehoshua did not turn back his hand with which he had stretched out the scimitar
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.129",until he had devoted-to-destruction all the settled-folk of Ai.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.130","27 Only the animals and the spoils of that city did Israel plunder for themselves,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 8.131",in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had commanded Yehoshua.

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.1","The Unexpected Treaty: After the long and detailed battle narrative of the previous chapter, this text provides a colorful break. It also serves to demonstrate how the Israelites have returned to following God’s commands. The Giv’onites fulfill the legal role of a city that surrenders in Deut. 20; as a result, they are not destroyed by the invaders but become subject to forced labor."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.2","The text opens with a deception occasioned by fear, just as Rahav in Chap. 2 had begun the account of the Jericho campaign with an acknowledgment of God’s power. It is also the classic treatment of a recurring theme in Joshua and Judges: the conquest was not quite complete."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.3","A key word in the chapter is “far,” an ironic usage here. Giv’on was in fact close to Jerusalem, and also not a great distance from what the text represents as the recently destroyed Ai. More significant is the location of the region on major trade routes to the Mediterranean coast. No wonder that in the next chapter, Jerusalem spearheads a coalition to attack Giv’on (Rainey/Notley)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.4","The scenario of a terror-stricken group surrendering as slaves to an invader rather than being slaughtered has many ancient Near Eastern parallels. In those cases, the purpose of the account seems to be to boost the fame of the conquering king (Younger)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.5",28 And Yehoshua burned down Ai;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.6","he made it into an everlasting mound, a wasteland, until this day."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.7","29 As for the king of Ai, he hung him on a wooden-stake, until the time of sunset,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.8","and when the sun came in, Yehoshua commanded that they take his corpse down from the stake,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.9",and they threw it by the entrance to the city gate
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.10","and erected over it a large mound of stones, until this day."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.11","30 Then Yehoshua built a sacrificial-altar to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, on Mount Eval,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.12","31 as Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had commanded the Children of Israel,"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.25","34 After that, he read aloud all the words of the Instruction, the blessing and the curse,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.26",exactly as was written in the Record of the Instruction.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.27",35 There was not a word from all that Moshe had commanded

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.41","6 And they went to Yehoshua, to the camp at Gilgal,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.42",and said to him and to the men of Israel:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.43",From a far-off land we have come;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.44","so-now, cut a covenant with us!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.45",7 The men of Israel said to the Hivvites:

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 9.48",8 They said to Yehoshua:

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.1","The Defense of Giv’on; Southern Victories: The peace treaty concluded in the last chapter provokes a strong reaction from the neighboring “kingdoms” (actually city-states). Just as Israel seeks to obliterate the Canaanites, the latter will have no truck with those who attempt to make peace with them. In a war reminiscent of another wide-ranging one in Gen. 14 (“the four kings against the five”), in which Avraham had intervened as warrior, Yehoshua engages the coalition led by the ruler of Jerusalem and defeats them with, of course, the help of God. This time the divine intervention is more directly miraculous. As the stars will later be said to fight on the Israelites’ behalf in Judg. 5:20, so God hurls hailstones down upon the hapless enemy here. Also connected to this event in the final form of our text, though perhaps not originally, is the memorable fragment about the sun and the moon “standing still” for Yehoshua. As Nelson notes, the verb may actually indicate something else (such as “remaining dark” or “being silent”), but in any case, Yehoshua is once again magnified as army commander, one who can enlist even the forces of nature in the cause of victory."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.2","The fate of the vanquished kings in vv.16–28 serves to set the tone for the conquest to follow. By focusing on such details at the beginning of the sequence of conquest, we are not left in any doubt as to the eventual outcome. Thus the passage functions, once again, as a literary rather than as an annalistic introduction."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.3","After v.28, the text proceeds with the blow-by-blow campaign of conquest, with this chapter focusing on the south and thus once again pointing to the eventual primacy of Yehuda. At long last, the book begins to resemble other conquest accounts from the ancient Near East, using a stock vocabulary for each paragraph and town conquered (“battle,” “strike [down],” “capture,” “sword,” “devote-to-destruction,” and “he left no survivor”). As Hess points out, from Chap. 10 on, the conquest will proceed at an ever-quickening pace, heightening the drama."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.4","Notable from this point through 12:1 are multiple occurrences of the word “all”—some forty-five of them, according to Hawk’s (2000) count. He rightly takes this as a sign of “Israelite integrity, comprehensive conquest, and obedience to Y<small>HWH</small> and the commands of Moses.” I have been unable to reproduce the repetition without undue violence to English; the reader will have to be content with noting “all” and “every [person].”"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.5",15 And Yehoshua made peace with them:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.6","he cut a covenant with them, letting them live,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.7",and the exalted-leaders of the community swore [an oath] to them.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.8","16 But it was, at the end of three days after they had cut a covenant with them,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.9","that they heard that they [dwelt] near to them,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.10",and that it was in their midst that they were settled!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.11",17 So the Children of Israel marched out and came to their towns on the third day
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.12",—now their towns were Giv’on and Kefira and Be’erot and Kiryat-Ye’arim.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.13","18 But the Children of Israel did not strike them down, since the leaders of the community had sworn to them by Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.14",so the entire community grumbled against the leaders.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.15",19 And all the leaders said to the entire community:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.16","We ourselves swore to them by Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.17",so now we are not able to harm them!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.18",20 This [is how] we must act toward them:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.19","let them live,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.20",that there not be fury against us regarding the sworn-oath that we swore to them!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.21",21 And the leaders said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.22",They may live.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.23","So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the entire community,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.24",as the leaders had spoken concerning them.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.25","22 But Yehoshua called for them and spoke to them, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.26","Why did you deceive us, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.27","We are exceedingly far from you,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.28",when you are settled in our midst?
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.29","23 So-now, doomed are you:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.30",never shall a servant be cut off from you
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.31",either as hewers of wood or drawers of water for the house of my God!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.32",24 They answered Yehoshua and said:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.33","It was because it was told, yes, told to your servants"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.34",that Y<small>HWH</small> your God had commanded Moshe his servant
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.35",to give you all the land
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.36",and to wipe out all the settled-folk of the land before you—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.37","so we were very afraid for our lives before you,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.38",and we did this thing.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.39","25 But now, here we are in your hand;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.40","as is good, as is right in your eyes to do with us, do."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.41",26 So he did thus with them:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.42","he rescued them from the hand of the Children of Israel, so that they did not kill them,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.43","27 but Yehoshua made them on that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the community,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.44","and for the sacrificial-altar of Y<small>HWH</small>, until this day,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.45",at the place that he chooses.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.46","10:1 Now it was, when Adoni-Tzedek, king of Jerusalem, heard"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.47","that Yehoshua had captured Ai, and had devoted-it-to-destruction,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.48","—as he had done to Jericho and to its king, so he had done to Ai and to its king—"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.49",and that the settled-folk of Giv’on had made peace with Israel
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.50","and were remaining in their midst,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.51","2 he was exceedingly afraid,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.52","for Giv’on was a large city, like one of the royal cities"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.53","—indeed, it was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty ones."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.54",3 So Adoni-Tzedek king of Jerusalem sent [word]
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.55","to Hoham king of Hevron, and to Pir’am king of Yarmut, and to Yafia king of Lakhish, and to Devir king of Eglon, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.56","4 Come up to me and help me,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.57","that we may strike Giv’on,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.58",for they have made peace with Yehoshua and with the Children of Israel!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.59","5 They gathered together and went up, the five Amorite kings—"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.60","the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hevron, the king of Yarmut, the king of Lakhish, and the king of Eglon,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.61","they and all their camps,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.62","and they encamped against Giv’on, and did battle with it."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.63","6 The men of Giv’on sent [word] to Yehoshua, to the camp at Gilgal, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.64",Do not let your hand slacken from your servants;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.65",come up to us quickly
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.66","and deliver us, help us,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.67","for all the kings of the Amorites, the settled-folk of the highlands, have gathered against us!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.68","7 So Yehoshua went up from Gilgal,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.69","he and all the people of battle with him,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.70",and all the mighty-men of valor.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.71",8 And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.72","Do not be afraid of them,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.73",for into your hand I have given them;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.74",no man among them will be able to stand up before you!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.75","9 Yehoshua came against them, suddenly,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.76",having gone up all night from Gilgal.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.77","10 And Y<small>HWH</small> panicked them before Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.78","so that they struck them, a great striking-down, at Giv’on,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.79",and pursued them by way of the Bet-Horon Pass;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.80",they struck at them as far as Azeka and as far as Makkeda.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.81","11 Now it was, when they were fleeing before Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.82",—they were at the descent of Bet-Horon—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.83","that Y<small>HWH</small> threw down upon them large stones from the heavens, as far as Azeka, and they died;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.84",[there were] more who died by the stones
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.85",than those whom the Children of Israel killed with the sword.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.86",12 Then Yehoshua spoke to Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.87",on the day of Y<small>HWH</small>’s giving the Amorites before the Children of Israel;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.88",he said before the eyes of Israel:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.89","O sun, at Giv’on be still,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.90","O moon, in the Valley of Ayyalon!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.91","13 So the sun was still, and the moon stood fast,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.92",until a nation was avenged on its enemies.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.93",—Is it not written in the Record of the Upright:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.94",The sun stood fast in the midst of the heavens;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.95",it did not hasten to come in as on a whole day?
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.96","14 There has been none like that day before it or after it,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.97","for Y<small>HWH</small> to hearken to a man’s voice,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.98",since Y<small>HWH</small> was fighting for Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.99",15 Then Yehoshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.100",16 And these five kings fled
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.101",and hid themselves in a cave at Makkeda.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.102","17 And Yehoshua was told, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.103",The five kings have been found hiding in a cave at Makkeda!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.104",18 Yehoshua said:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.105","Roll large stones over the mouth of the cave,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.106",and assign men over it to watch them.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.107","19 As for you, do not stand around—"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.108","pursue after your enemies, attack-their-tail;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.109","do not allow them to come back to their cities,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.110",for Y<small>HWH</small> your God has given them into your hand!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.111","20 So it was, when Yehoshua and the Children of Israel had finished striking them, a very great striking-down, until they were gone,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.112",while the survivors had escaped from them and had come back to the fortified towns—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.113","21 that all the fighting-people returned to the camp, to Yehoshua at Makkeda, safely;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.114",not a man wagged his tongue against the Children of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.115",22 And Yehoshua said:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.116",Open the mouth of the cave
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.117",and bring out these five kings to me from the cave!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.118",23 They did thus:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.119","they brought out these five kings to him from the cave,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.120","the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hevron, the king of Yarmut, the king of Lakhish, the king of Eglon;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.121","24 and it was, upon their bringing out the kings to Yehoshua,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.122",that Yehoshua called for all the fighting-men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of battle who had gone with him:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.123","Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.124",So they came near and put their feet on their necks.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.125",25 Yehoshua said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.126","Do not be frightened, do not be dismayed;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.127","be strong and courageous,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.128",for thus will Y<small>HWH</small> do to all your enemies with whom you do battle!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.129","26 And Yehoshua struck them down after that, and put them to death;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.130","he hung them on five stakes,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.131",and they were hung on the stakes until sunset.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.132","27 Now it was, at the time of the sun coming in,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.133","that Yehoshua commanded [them] and they took them down from the stakes,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.134",and they threw them into the cave where they had hidden.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.135","Then they put large stones over the mouth of the cave,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.136",[there] until this very day.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.137","28 As for Makkeda, Yehoshua captured [it] on that day;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.138","he struck it with the mouth of the sword, along with its king,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.139","and he devoted-it-to-destruction, along with every person that was in it—"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.140",he left no survivor.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.141",And he did to the king of Makkeda as he had done to the king of Jericho.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.142",29 Yehoshua and all Israel with him crossed over from Makkeda to Livna
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.143",and did battle with Livna.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.144","30 And Y<small>HWH</small> gave it too into the hand of Israel, along with its king;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.145","he struck it with the mouth of the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.146",along with every person that was in it—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.147",he left in it no survivor.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.148",And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.149",31 Yehoshua and all Israel crossed over from Livna to Lakhish;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.150",they encamped against it and did battle against it.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.151","32 And Y<small>HWH</small> gave Lakhish into the hand of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.152",so that he captured it on the second day;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.153","he struck it with the mouth of the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.154","along with every person who was in it,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.155",exactly as he had done to Livna.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.156","33 Then Horam king of Gezer went up to help Lakhish,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.157","but Yehoshua and his fighting-people struck him,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.158",until he left him no survivor.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.159",34 Yehoshua and all Israel with him crossed over from Lakhish to Eglon;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.160",they encamped against it and did battle with it
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.161",35 and captured it on that day.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.162","They struck it with the mouth of the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.163","while every person who was in it on that day devoted-to-destruction,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.164",exactly as he had done to Lakhish.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.165",36 Yehoshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.166","Hevron, and did battle with it;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.167",37 they captured it
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.168","and struck it with the mouth of the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.169",along with its king and all its towns and every person that was in it—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.170","he left no survivor,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.171",exactly as he had done to Eglon:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.172","he devoted-it-to-destruction, and every person who was in it."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.173","38 Yehoshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Devir, and did battle with it;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.174","39 he captured it along with its king and all its towns,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.175",and struck them with the mouth of the sword and devoted-to-destruction every person that was in it—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.176",he left no survivor;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.177","as he had done to Hevron, thus he did to Devir and to its king,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.178",as they had done to Livna and to its king.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.179",40 So Yehoshua struck the entire land:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.180","the highlands, the Negev, the lowlands, and the slopes,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.181",along with all of their kings—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.182","he left no survivor,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.183","while all those breathing he devoted-to-destruction,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.184","as Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, had commanded."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.185","41 Yehoshua struck them from Kadesh-Barne’a to Gaza,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.186",and all the region of Goshen and as far as Giv’on.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.187","42 All these kings and their land, Yehoshua captured at one time,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.188","since Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, was doing battle for Israel."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 10.189","43 Then Yehoshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal."

In a way, the whole chapter is a kind of summary of the conquest. It also parallels many structural elements of the previous chapter: a coalition of enemy kings, divine reassurance, the verb “give” as a promise of victory from God, Israelite triumph and summary (Hamilton)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.2","Nelson sees an idealized past predominating over the strictly historical here as before, as demonstrated by the mention of Hatzor.

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.5","that he sent to Yovav king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Akhshaf,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.6","2 and to the [other] kings that were in the north,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.7",in the highlands and in the plain south of the Kinneret and in the lowlands
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.8","and in the Heights of Dor, toward the Sea,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.9","3 the Canaanites toward sunrise and toward the Sea,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.10","and the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Yevusites in the highlands,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.11","and the Hivvites beneath Hermon, in the region of Mitzpa."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.12","4 They went out, they and all their camps with them,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.13","an abundance of fighting-people, like the sand that is on the seashore in abundance,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.14","and horse and chariot, an exceedingly abundant [number]."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.15",5 All these kings met;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.16","they came and encamped together at the Waters of Merom, to do battle with Israel."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.17",6 And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.18","Do not be afraid before them,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.19",for tomorrow at this same time I myself will make all of them slain-ones before Israel;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.20","their horses you will maim,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.21",and their chariots you will burn with fire!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.22","7 So Yehoshua came, and all the people of battle with him, against them by the Waters of Merom, suddenly,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.23",and they fell upon them.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.24","8 Y<small>HWH</small> gave them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.25","and pursued them as far as Greater Sidon and up to Misrefot-Mayim and as far as the Cleft of Mitzpe, toward sunrise—"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.26",they struck them until they had left them no survivor.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.27",9 Yehoshua did to them as Y<small>HWH</small> had said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.28","their horses he maimed, and their chariots he burned with fire."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.29","10 And Yehoshua turned back at that time and captured Hatzor,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.30","while its king he struck down with the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.31",for Hatzor in former-times was the head [city] of all of these kingdoms.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.32","11 They struck down every person who was in it, with the mouth of the sword;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.33",he devoted-them-to-destruction
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.34",—no one breathing remained—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.35",while Hatzor he burned with fire.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.36","12 And all the towns of these kings, along with all their kings, Yehoshua captured and struck them with the mouth of the sword;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.37","he devoted-them-to-destruction,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.38","as Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had commanded."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.39","13 However: all the towns that were standing on their mounds, Israel did not burn;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.40",only Hatzor alone did Yehoshua burn.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.41","14 Now all the spoils of these towns, and all the cattle, the Children of Israel plundered for themselves;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.42","only all the humans did they strike down with the mouth of the sword, until they had wiped them out—"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.43",they left no one breathing.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.44","15 As Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe his servant,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.45","thus had Moshe commanded Yehoshua,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.46",and thus Yehoshua did;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.47",he did not omit a thing of all that Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.48",16 So Yehoshua took all this land:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.49","the highlands, all the Negev, and all the region of Goshen,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.50","the lowlands, and the Plain,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.51","the highlands of Israel and its lowlands,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.52",17 from Mount Halak that goes up toward Se’ir
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.53","as far as Baal-Gad in the Cleft of the Levanon, beneath Mount Hermon."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.54",All their kings he captured;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.55",he struck them down and put them to death.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.56",18 For many years Yehoshua engaged all these kings in battle.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.57",19 There was not a town which had concluded peace with the Children of Israel
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.58","except for the Hivvites, the settled-folk of Giv’on;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.59",all were taken in battle.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.60","20 For it was from Y<small>HWH</small>, to make their heart strong-willed toward battle with Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.61","in order to devote-them-to-destruction,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.62",without there being any compassion toward them;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.63","indeed, it was to wipe them out,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 11.64",as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe.

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 12.1","The Vanquished Kings: This brief chapter may serve as a summary of either what has come or what will follow. Indeed, many such lists in the Bible function as textual dividers. While the precise names in lists of this kind are notoriously susceptible to error, the overall effect is rhythmic and hence fitting as a literary marker. The fact that the movement is basically from south to north supports what has gone before. Auld (1998) suggests that the fate of these kings hints at a view often found in this part of the Bible: that there is something problematic in the institution of kingship itself."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 12.2",21 Yehoshua came at that time

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 12.66","21 <b>Anakites:</b> They were taken to be a race of giants and are referred to a number of times in relation to the conquest. <b>Judah … Israel:</b> Reflecting the later political division of the country into two kingdoms; here, it is either anachronistic or purely geographical."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 12.67",22 <b>Gaza … Gat … Ashdod:</b> Three of the five cities that come to be connected with the Philistines; the others were Ekron and Ashkelon.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 12.68","23 <b>as hereditary-property:</b> Boling (1982): “in fief,” using a term from medieval Europe. The Hebrew root, <i>n-h-l</i>, has wider connotations than the generational transfer of property; it is closer to a property <i>claim</i> and is frequently paralleled with “share/allotment” (Hawk 2000, who suggests “legitimate share”)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 12.69",12:1 <b>Wadi Arnon:</b> A stream which empties into the Dead Sea and creates a deep gorge; it served as a boundary between Re’uven in the north and Moav in the south. <b>all the Plain toward sunrise:</b> JPS: “The eastern half of the Arabah.”

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 12.71","4 <b>southward:</b> Here, and in 13:4, the text uses a different term for “south” (<i>teiman</i>). <b>Pisga:</b> “Peak,” overlooking, from the east, the Jordan and indeed much of the land of Israel.

Some scholars, on the other hand, simply understand them as huge, mighty warriors."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 12.72","6 <b>Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The same Deuteronomistic phrase used of him at the beginning of the book."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 12.73","18 <b>Lasharon:</b> Or “in Sharon”; LXX, on the other hand, reads the whole phrase as “Afek of the Sharon,” which parallels v.22’s “Yokne’am of the Carmel” (Rainey/Notley)."

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 13.1","Introduction to the Allotment; Eastern Lands: The book of Joshua began with the centrality of Yehoshua and the mention of the two and a half tribes who settled on the east bank of the Jordan. We now start the account of land allotment, at the book’s midpoint, with the same cast of characters (Nelson). The inclusion of the Transjordanian tribes is at best idealistic for later audiences, as their region was not a part of Israelite territory past the ninth or eighth century B.C.E. Structurally, each section regarding the two and a half tribes ends (vv.14 and 33) by alluding to another anomalous situation: the allotment of land to the Levites (Hamilton). And looking ahead, the reference to Yehoshua’s old age will return at the end of the book (23:1)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 13.2","According to many scholars, vv.2–6 are a later, perhaps even exilic or Persian, insertion. As Wazana (2011) proposes, these verses may be here to confirm the returnees’ claim to the land. Such a strategy appears elsewhere in the Bible through the use of genealogies, which tend to validate present power structures rather than accurately report ancient realities."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 13.3","The vocabulary of the chapter is composed of virtually all the previous verbs pertinent to the conquest theme: “possess,” “settle,” “give,” “apportion,” and “inherit.”"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 15.59",9 Then the border diverges from the top of the hill at the Spring of the Waters of Neftoah and goes out to the towns of Mount Efron.

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 15.75",—now the name of Devir formerly was Kiryat-Sefer.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 15.76",16 And Calev said:

The text over the next two chapters has an almost ceremonial ring to it, as it commences with the people’s assembly at the holy city of Shilo and introduces the practice of registering the territories in writing. Israel’s coming-of-age as a community had been heralded with the writing down of the covenant in Exod. 19–24; now that it becomes a full-fledged people with the acquisition of a land, writing appears once again. The text starts with Binyamin, seemingly as a logical next step in the march from south to north, but more likely based on the concept of traditional familial order, with Yaakov’s main wives’ sons first, and then those of the maidservants (Gen. 30; Nelson)."

Yehoshua’s inheritance also closes a bracket: what began in 14:6ff. with Calev’s inheritance here rounds out the parceling out of land to the tribes west of the Jordan (Hess)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.2","19:1 The second lot came out for Shim’on, for the tribe of the Children of Shim’on, for their clans;"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.15","9 From the area of the Children of Yehuda was the hereditary-property of the Children of Shim’on,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.16","for the portion of the Children of Yehuda was too large for them,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.17",so the Children of Shim’on received hereditary-property amid their hereditary-property.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.18",10 The third lot came up for the Children of Zevulun for their clans;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.19",the border of their hereditary-property is as far as Sarid.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.20","11 Their border goes up toward the Sea and Mar’ala, touching Dabbeshet,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.21",and touches the wadi that faces Yokne’am.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.22","12 Then it turns from Sarid eastward, toward the rising of the sun, to the border of Kislot-Tavor,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.23","and goes out at Dav’rat, going up to Yafi’a;"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.47","26 Alamelekh, Am’ad, and Mish’al;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 19.48","it touches Carmel seaward, and Shihor Livnat."

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 20.1","Towns of Asylum: An integral part of the plans for occupying the land, as already laid out in Num. 35:6, 9–34 and Deut. 19:1–13, is the setting aside of six towns on either side of the Jordan as safe havens for those who commit unintentional murder (manslaughter). Unlike the brief chapter here, the text in Numbers goes into great detail, both in laying out hypothetical variations on manslaughter and in specifying the punishment and its time period. But our text has also added aspects of Deut. 19:1–10, in a move that foreshadows how Rabbinic law will handle different biblical texts (Meyers 2004). Once again, we can observe an active and fluid attitude to texts on the part of the transmitters and editors."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 20.2","While one could compare this institution, which is a cut above the age-old practice of family vengeance, to other ancient Near Eastern societies’ solutions to the problem, in the context of Yehoshua it functions to cap the account of precisely how the land was to be allotted, continuing into the next chapter, which deals with another unusual case: the landless Levites."

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 22.1","Finishing Business: The Two and a Half Tribes: The final three chapters of Joshua are concerned with the community of the past and the community of the future. In that context, the long story in Chap. 22 both poses and solves the potentially dangerous problem of what constitutes proper worship of YHWH. The opening five verses are strongly Deuteronomistic in language, suggesting a resolution of the entire conquest story, with the last pieces of territory (albeit east of the Jordan) being allotted to Israelites tribes. But beginning in v.11, a major rift seems in the offing, with the bulk of the Israelite tribes, those west of the Jordan, seriously misunderstanding the construction of a gigantic altar by their eastern counterparts. They take this act as a major violation of the worship of YHWH, and hence of the covenant itself, even likening it to two major biblical stories of treachery: the account in Num. 25 of how the Israelites “went whoring” after foreign gods, and Akhan’s violation of the Israelite rules of war earlier in Joshua (Chap. 7), after which the wording here is perhaps modeled. In addition, as Hamilton notes, a specific verb for “rebel” (m-r-d, “revolt”) uses up a fifth of its appearances in the entire Bible in this chapter."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 22.2","The two and a half tribes’ impassioned reply in vv.22–29 is a stirring testament to their group loyalty and to their faithfulness to Y<small>HWH</small>. For them, the huge altar is supposed to act as a kind of giant flag or similar symbol, to signal to the Israelites and to others that they have by no means forgotten Y<small>HWH</small>’s sanctuary, where the Coffer is situated. The resolution that follows, sanctioned by the very priest (Pin’has) who had violently stemmed the tide of idolatry in Num. 25, lets the aggregate Israelite community breathe easier (vv.30 and 33, “it was good in their eyes”), and civil war is averted. Conflicts between tribes will not be so peacefully resolved in the next book, Judges. For the moment, though, Joshua can at least move toward its conclusion on a tranquil and idealizing note."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 22.3","Not all readers will accept this “happy ending”; for them, the reality of two and a half tribes existing in a geographically ambiguous situation is still cause for concern, as the continued presence of Canaanites among the new settlers had been earlier. Israelite identity is still in question on some level (Hawk 2000)."

Hamilton notes three exhortations in this speech: (1) for the leaders of the people to be faithful to God’s “Instruction”; (2) for them to maintain separation from the Canaanites; and (3) for them to love God as loyal vassals. Not surprisingly, Yehoshua uses classic Deuteronomistic words, including such terms as “strengthen,” “keep,” “observe,” “Instruction,” “[do not] turn aside,” “serve,” “cleave to,” “love,” “dispossess,” and “cross.” The sum total of this vocabulary is simply expressed: you are to love God and keep his commandments; do not turn aside from them, or else you will be dispossessed from the land. Or: having now received God’s gift of the land, do not turn to idolatry, or you will wind up in exile."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 23.2","Another notable verbal feature of the chapter is the repetition fourteen times (a doubling of the “perfect” seven) of the phrase “Y<small>HWH</small> your God.” It too recalls Deuteronomy, where it occurs some twenty-two times. So Yehoshua is once again linked to his predecessor Moshe."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 23.3","23:1 It was, many years after Y<small>HWH</small> had given Israel rest from all their enemies round about"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 23.4","—now Yehoshua was old, advanced in years—"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 23.21",7 so as not to come in among these nations that are left beside you;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 23.22","the name of their gods you are not to invoke, you are not to swear [by them],"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 23.23","you are not to serve them, you are not to bow down to them."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 23.24","8 Rather, to Y<small>HWH</small> your God you are to cleave, as you have done, to this day!"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 23.26","while as for you, no man has stood up before you, to this day."

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 23.28","23:1 <b>many years after:</b> Or “a long time afterward.” <b>given … rest:</b> This Deuteronomistic phrase appears a number of times in Judges as well. <b>advanced in years:</b> Used, for instance, of Avraham and Sara in Gen. 18:11."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 23.29","5 <b>dispossess … possess:</b> As elsewhere, the Hebrew uses different forms of the verb (<i>y-r-sh</i>)."

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.1","Parting Ceremony: In contrast to the previous speech, this long chapter has some of the earmarks of a covenant-making or covenant-renewal ceremony. All the Israelites and their various leaders are “stationed” before God at the important city of Shekhem. The speaker begins with an extended history lesson, tracing Israel’s lineage to idol-worshippers living beyond the Euphrates and proceeding through the gift of the land to the Patriarchs, the enslavement and liberation from Egypt, and God’s guidance to the Promised Land. The wording reveals the emotional underpinnings: “give” occurs six times in thirteen verses at the chapter’s beginning, just as it was central in Chap. 1. “Serve,” another key verb that figured in Chap. 1, occurs here some fourteen times. God, as the prime subject of the speech, is connected to numerous verbs of action throughout (“took,” “led,” “gave,” “sent,” “smote,” “took out,” “brought,” “rescued”), in order to emphasize that everything flows from what he has done for the Israelites. Beginning in v.14, Yehoshua, with the repeated, rhetorically significant “So-now,” launches into the official, ceremonial request, urging the people to serve God as “I and my household” do. There ensues a kind of scripted dialogue (vv.16–24), in which the leader basically goads the people to affirm and reaffirm their intention to follow YHWH, and they respond positively. All is sealed with a written document and a great stone as unshakable witnesses."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.2","As has often been pointed out, many of these elements are common to ancient Near Eastern treaty formulas, especially from Hittite documents. Missing from the usual covenant ceremony, as Nelson notes, are the pointed threats leveled at potential violators, such as we find in Lev. 26 and Deut. 27. So this chapter, while it uses common conventions, may be a dramatic device, intended to impress upon audiences the seriousness not only of the end of the book but of the whole sequence that began with the promises of Genesis. It should also be noted that vv.2–4 of the chapter were used later, by the Rabbis before the third century <small>C.E.</small>, as part of the family Passover meal text (Haggadah), and they still have that function today."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.3","Both chapter and book end with three notices related to dying or death. First, Yehoshua himself dies; then comes the final burial of Yosef’s bones, which had been brought up from Egypt at the time of the Exodus (Exod. 13:19), in conformity with his wishes in Gen. 50:24–25; and finally we are told of the death of the High Priest, El’azar. All of these leaders find their resting place on northern soil, traditions that were ultimately incorporated into the final version of the book. That the priestly figure is the last to be mentioned may suggest a priestly editor, or at least one for whom cultic matters were central. At any rate, the death notices signal that the long journey, both literal and figurative, that was begun in the book of Exodus is now over. And “the reader is left with the sense of a perfected past … for now all is well” (Fishbane)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.4","There has long been debate about this chapter among scholars, starting from the premise that it and the previous one are slightly redundant. Indeed, the openings of both are so similar in their convoking of the people and their leaders that one cannot help but think that one chapter or the other is a later addition. The location of the ceremony at Shekhem, first capital of the Northern Kingdom (tenth century), is seen by some as an indication that the hope of recovering the north, destroyed by Assyria in 722, remained a live issue in ancient Israel and perhaps influenced the composition of Joshua (Schniedewind 2004). Others have viewed our chapter as coming out of exile many centuries hence, given its troubled portrait of a “zealous” God, whom “you will not be able to serve” (v.19). But the people’s assent to staying in the covenant resonates with the desire of the Bible’s writers to remain faithful to a long-standing heritage and mission. The doubling effect created by linking Chaps. 23 and 24 serves to confirm this direction."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.5","The book of Joshua, however, ends with a paradox: a people mostly united and a land mostly conquered, with a leader dying (and no successor in sight) and Canaanites still living among them. It will be up to Judges, which picks up at Yehoshua’s death, to see if unity and proper leadership will ultimately prevail. "

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.20",not one thing of it has failed!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.21","15 But it shall be,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.22","just as there has come upon you every good thing that Y<small>HWH</small> your God promised you,"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.24",until he has wiped you from off this good ground that Y<small>HWH</small> your God has given you:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.25","16 if you cross the covenant of Y<small>HWH</small> your God which he commanded you,"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.29",24:1 Yehoshua gathered all the tribes of Israel at Shekhem;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.30","he called together all the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officials,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.31",and they stationed themselves in the presence of God.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.32",2 And Yehoshua said to all the people:

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.35",—Terah father of Avraham and father of Nahor—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.36",and they served other gods.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.37",3 But I took your father Avraham from Across the River
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.38",and I had him go throughout all the land of Canaan;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.39",I made his seed many and gave him Yitzhak.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.40","4 And I gave to Yitzhak—Yaakov and Esav,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.41","I gave to Esav Mount Se’ir for him to possess,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.42",while Yaakov and his children went down to Egypt.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.43","5 Then I sent Moshe and Aharon,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.44","and I dealt blows to Egypt, with what I did in its midst,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.45",and afterward I brought you out.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.46","6 I brought your fathers out from Egypt, and you came to the Sea,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.47",and Egypt pursued after your fathers with chariots and riders at the Sea of Reeds.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.48","7 They cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>, and he put deep-darkness between you and the Egyptians,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.49","and brought down the Sea upon them, so that it covered them."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.50",Your [own] eyes saw what I did in Egypt!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.51",And you stayed in the wilderness for many years;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.52","8 then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who were settled across the Jordan, and they did battle with you,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.53","but I gave them into your hand, so that you took possession of their land,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.54",and I wiped them out from before you.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.55","9 Then Balak son of Tzippor arose, king of Moav, and he waged battle against Israel:"

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.70","14 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.71",hold Y<small>HWH</small> in awe and serve him in integrity and trust;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.72",remove the gods whom your fathers had served across the River and in Egypt
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.73",and serve Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.74","15 But if it be evil in your eyes to serve Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.75",choose yourselves today whom you wish to serve—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.76",whether the gods whom your fathers who were Across the River served
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.77","or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are settled."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.78","But as for me and my household, we will serve Y<small>HWH</small>!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.79",16 The people answered and said:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.80","[Heaven] forbid for us, from abandoning Y<small>HWH</small>"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.81",to serve other gods!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.82","17 Rather, Y<small>HWH</small> our God,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.83","<i>he</i> is the one who brought up us and our fathers from the land of Egypt, from a house of serfs,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.84",and who performed before our eyes these great signs
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.85",and kept-us-safe on all the way that we went
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.86",and among all the peoples through whose midst we crossed—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.87","18 Y<small>HWH</small> has driven out all the peoples, the Amorites, the settled-folk of the land, before us."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.88","We too will serve Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.89","indeed, he is our God!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.90",19 And Yehoshua said to the people:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.91","You will not be able to serve Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.92",for he is a holy godhead;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.93","he is a zealous God,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.94",and will not bear your transgression and your sins!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.95","20 When you abandon Y<small>HWH</small> and serve foreign gods,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.96","he will turn and do evil to you and will finish you off,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.97",after having done good to you.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.98",21 But the people said to Yehoshua:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.99","No, rather, it is Y<small>HWH</small> we will serve!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.100",22 So Yehoshua said to the people:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.101",You are witnesses against yourselves
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.102","that you on your part have chosen Y<small>HWH</small> for yourselves, to serve him."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.103",They said:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.104",Witnesses!—
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.105","23 So-now, remove the foreign gods that are in your midst,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.106","and incline your heart to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.107",24 The people said to Yehoshua:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.108",It is Y<small>HWH</small> our God we will serve;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.109",to his voice we will hearken!
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.110",25 So Yehoshua cut a covenant with the people on that day;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.111",he made them a law and a judgment at Shekhem.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.112",26 And Yehoshua wrote down these words in the Record of God’s Instruction.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.113","Then he took a large stone and erected it there,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.114",beneath the tamarisk that was in the Holy-Place of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.115",27 And Yehoshua said to all the people:
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.116","Here, this stone shall be against us as a witness,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.117",for it has heard all the statements of Y<small>HWH</small> which he spoke with us;
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.118","it will be against you as a witness, lest you deny your God!"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.119","28 Then Yehoshua sent the people away, each one to his hereditary-property."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.120",29 Now it was some time afterward
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.121","that Yehoshua son of Nun, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, died, a hundred and ten years old;"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.122","30 they buried him in the territory of his hereditary-property, at Timnat-Serah that is in the highlands of Efrayim, north of Mount Gaash."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.123",31 And Israel served Y<small>HWH</small> all the days of Yehoshua
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.124","and all the days of the elders who [lived] long years after Yehoshua,"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.125",who had known all the deeds of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had done for Israel.

"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.127","they buried in Shekhem, in the portion of open-ground that Yaakov had acquired from the Children of Hamor father of Shekhem, for a hundred <i>kesitas;</i>"
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, 24.128",it had become hereditary-property for the Children of Yosef.

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.2","It is significant that Yehuda (Judah) is the tribe with which the chapter opens; as indicated in the Introduction, a major thrust of the book is to set up the coming of the monarchy. Although the first king will come from the tribe of Binyamin (Benjamin), the favored and permanent dynasty of David will stem from Yehuda. Thus there is a strong ideological overlay to Judges."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.3","A small episode in this chapter, little discussed by earlier commentators but more emphasized recently, may have wider implications. Vv.12–15 repeat a story that had been recounted in Josh. 15:16–19 about Akhsa, the wife of Calev, who requests landed property as part of her marriage. Klein notes how in the context of Judges, a woman in a legally stable and approved relationship (the couple are from the same tribe, and he “earns” her hand) asking for fertile land might be seen as a sign of healthy normality, parallel to Israel receiving the fertile land of Canaan from God. In stark contrast are the troubled male-female relationships in the book’s final chapters, indeed in its entire second half. Of course, it is no accident that the Akhsa episode is told about a family from the tribe of Yehuda."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.4","Embedded in the long sequence of the chapter’s second half is another brief piece (vv.22–25), this time about spies who obtain information from a watchman in return for sparing his life and that of his family in the coming battle. The tale parallels the prostitute Rahav’s in Josh. 2, creating a certain symmetry between the books."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.5",1:1 Now it was after the death of Yehoshua
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.6","that the Children of Israel inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.7",Who among us will go up first against the Canaanites to wage battle against them?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.8",2 Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.9",Yehuda will go up;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.10","here, I have given the land into his hand."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.11",3 Yehuda said to Shim’on his brother-tribe:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.12","Go up with me into my allotted-territory, and let us wage battle against the Canaanites,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.13",and I will go with you as well into your allotted-territory.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.14",So Shim’on went with him.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.15","4 Yehuda went up,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.16","and Y<small>HWH</small> gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.17","so that they struck them down in Bezek,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.18",ten thousand men.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.19","5 They found Adoni-Vezek in Bezek, and waged battle against him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.20",and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.21","6 And Adoni-Vezek fled, so they pursued after him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.22",and they seized him and chopped off the thumbs of his hands and of his feet.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.23",7 Adoni-Vezek said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.24","Seventy kings, the thumbs of their hands and of their feet chopped off,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.25",used to gather [crumbs] under my table;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.26","as I did, so has God paid me back!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.27","They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.28",8 Then the Children of Yehuda waged battle against Jerusalem:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.29","they captured it, they struck it with the mouth of the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.30",and the city they sent up in fire.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.31","9 Afterward, the Children of Yehuda went down to wage battle against the Canaanites,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.32","those settled in the highlands, the Negev, and the lowlands."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.33","10 And Yehuda went against the Canaanites, the ones settled in Hevron,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.34",—now the name of Hevron in former times was Kiryat-Arba—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.35",and he struck Sheishai and Ahiman and Talmai.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.36",11 He went from there against those settled in Devir
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.37",—now the name of Devir in former times was Kiryat-Sefer.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.38",12 Now Calev said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.39","Whoever strikes Kiryat-Sefer and captures it,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.40",I will give him Akhsa my daughter as a wife!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.41","13 Otniel son of Kenaz captured it,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.42","a brother of Calev younger than he,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.43",and he gave him Akhsa his daughter as a wife.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.44","14 Now it was, when she came,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.45",that she induced him to request fielded-property from her father.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.46","She alighted from on the donkey,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.47",and Calev said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.48",What [ails] you?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.49",15 She said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.50","Get me a blessing-gift,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.51",for you have given me arid land—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.52",you should give me pools of water!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.53",So Calev gave her the Upper Pools and the Lower Pools.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.54","16 Now the Children of the Kenite, Moshe’s father-in-law, went up from the Town of Date-Palms, along with the Children of Yehuda,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.55",into the Wilderness of Yehuda that is south of Arad;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.56",they went and settled with the people.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.57",17 And Yehuda went with Shim’on his brother;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.58","they struck the Canaanites settled in Tzefat, and devoted-it-to-destruction,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.59",so they called the name of the town Horma/Destruction.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.60",18 Then Yehuda captured Gaza and its territory
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.61",and Ashkelon and its territory
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.62",and Ekron and its territory.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.63","19 Now Y<small>HWH</small> was with Yehuda, so that he took possession of the highlands,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.64","but he was not [able] to dispossess the settled-folk of the valley,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.65",for they had chariotry of iron.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.66","20 And they gave Hevron to Calev, as Moshe had promised,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.67",and he dispossessed the three sons of Anak from there.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.68","21 But the Yevusites, those settled in Jerusalem, the Children of Binyamin did not dispossess;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.69",the Yevusites are settled along with the Children of Binyamin in Jerusalem until this day.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.70","22 Now the house of Yosef went up, they too, to Bet-El,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.71",and Y<small>HWH</small> was with them.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.72",23 The house of Yosef scouted out Bet-El
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.73",—now the name of the town in former times was Luz—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.74","24 and the watchmen saw a man going out of the town,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.75",so they said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.76","Pray let us see the way to enter the town, and we will show you loyalty."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.77","25 He let them see the way to enter the town, and they struck the city with the mouth of the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.78",but the man and his entire clan they sent free.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.79",26 The man went to the land of the Hittites and built a town;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.80",he called its name Luz
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.81",—that is its name until this day.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.82","27 Menashe did not take possession of Bet-She’an and her daughter-towns,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.83","or of Ta’nakh and her daughter-towns,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.84","or of the settled-folk of Dor and her daughter-towns,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.86",or of the settled-folk of Megiddo and her daughter-towns;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.87",the Canaanites were determined to remain settled in this region.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.88","28 And it was, when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites under forced-labor,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.89","but dispossess, they did not dispossess them."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.90","29 Now Efrayim did not dispossess the Canaanites, those settled in Gezer,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.91","and so the Canaanites remained settled in their midst, in Gezer."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.92","30 Zevulun did not dispossess the settled-folk of Kitron, or the settled-folk of Nahalol,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.93","and so the Canaanites remained settled in their midst,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.95","31 Asher did not dispossess the settled-folk of Akko, or the settled-folk of Sidon,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.98","32 So the Asherites settled amid the Canaanites, the settled-folk of the land,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.99",for they did not dispossess them.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.100",33 Naftali did not dispossess the settled-folk of Bet-Shemesh
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.101","or the settled-folk of Bet-Anat,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.102","so they settled amid the Canaanites, the settled-folk of the land,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.103",and the settled-folk of Bet-Shemesh and of Bet-Anat went into forced-labor for them.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.104","34 And the Amorites pressed the Children of Dan into the highlands,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.105","indeed, they did not give them [leave] to go down into the valley."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.106","35 The Amorites persisted in remaining settled in Mount Heres, in Ayyalon and in Shaalvim,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.107","yet the hand of the House of Yosef grew heavy [against them], so that they went into forced-labor."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 1.108","36 Now the territory of the Amorites was from Scorpions’ Pass, to the Crag and further."

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.1","The Pattern: Having made the transition from Joshua in Chap. 1, the book proper begins with a harsh message from God: Israel will not occupy the land exclusively, and this means that they will have to deal somehow with the “foreign gods” worshipped by the local population. What ensues is a causational view of history, seeking to explain what happened to the Israelites and why. It begins as the book of Exodus did, with a new generation that has forgotten the past (in Exod. 1:8, it was the Pharaoh who was thus described). The text proceeds to lay out a pattern which will serve as a general outline for what is to follow. The elements are: (1) The Israelites “abandon” God by worshipping local gods (vv.11–13); (2) God reacts in anger, abandoning them to the power of their enemies and leading them to be distraught (14–15); (3) God has pity on them and sends a “judge,” almost always a military leader, who delivers them (16, 18); over time, they rebel against God again, starting the cycle once more (17, 19); this leads to a reprise of God’s anger (20–23) and his decision to leave the Canaanites in the land as a permanent test among the Israelites."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.2","This very negative scheme would seem to lock the entire book into an ironclad pattern, but the skill of the authors and compilers varies it constantly and introduces other themes as well. And typically for the Bible, the presence of a global view does not detract from the text’s ability to portray intriguing situations and memorable characters."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.3","In the second half of the chapter, the recurrence of central words points to the key issues, as frequently happens in biblical texts. From vv.11–14, there is a chiastic (ring) structural pattern, created by the brackets of “served … abandoned” and “abandoned … served.” Six times toward the end of the chapter, the word “hand” echoes, indicating that the crucial question is one of power: Which group will control the land?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.4",2:1 A messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> went up from Gilgal to Bokhim
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.5",and said:

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.7",and I brought you to the land that I swore to your fathers;

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.12",their altars you are to demolish!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.13",But you did not hearken to my voice.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.14",Now what have you done!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.15",3 So I also say:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.16",I will not drive them out before you;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.17","they will be traps to you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.18",and their gods will be a snare to you!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.19","4 It was, when the messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken these words to all the Children of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.20",that the people lifted up their voice and wept.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.21","5 So they called the name of that place Bokhim/Weepers,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.26","and all the days of the elders who had prolonged years after Yehoshua,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.27",who had seen every great deed of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had done for Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.28","8 And Yehoshua son of Nun, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had died, a hundred and ten years old;"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.30","10 Now also that entire generation was gathered to its fathers,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.31","and another generation arose after them, that did not know Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.32",as well as the deed[s] that he had done for Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.33",11 And the Children of Israel did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.34","they served the Baals,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.35","12 they abandoned Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of their fathers,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.36","the one who brought them out of the land of Egypt,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.37","and they walked after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.38",they bowed down to them
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.39",and so provoked Y<small>HWH</small>—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.40",13 they abandoned Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.41",and served Baal and the Astartes.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.42","14 So Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up against Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.43","and he gave them into the hand of pillagers, so that they pillaged them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.44","and sold them into the hand of their enemies round about,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.45",so that they were no longer able to stand up before their enemies.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 2.46","15 Whenever they went out [to war], the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was against them for evil,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 3:7–11.1","First Judge: Otniel: The first of the military leaders whom God sends as a response to Israel’s cries is, not surprisingly, from the tribe of Yehuda. Though brief, the story displays the necessary skeletal elements of Chap. 2’s outline: idolatry, oppression (by an enemy king with a stereotyped name), the Israelite outcry, a leader who is possessed of God’s “spirit,” a quick victory, and a land that remains tranquil for a defined period. As Amit (1999a) notes, it also contains “the largest concentration of formulaic phrases in the book” (fifteen of them, such as “And the people of Israel did what was evil in the eyes of YHWH,” “served the Baals and the Astartes,” “YHWH sold them into the hand of … ,” “YHWH raised up a deliverer,” and “the land was quiet for x years”). The pattern is deceptively simple; from now on, a good deal of color, variation, and ambiguity will be added."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 3:12–30.1","Bravery and Burlesque: Ehud: Without much breathing room, the text immediately deviates from the standard Judges pattern represented by Otniel, as we are introduced to satire as a biblical form (Brettler 2001a). The story of Ehud and King Eglon reads like the ultimate crowd-pleaser for an oppressed people: the enemy ruler is ridiculed in scatological terms and dies an incredibly violent death, with the hero escaping easily. While we do not possess much information about humor in the Bible, and it is always tricky to divine what is amusing to an ancient culture, one can nevertheless imagine Israelite audiences enjoying the picture of the enemy king wallowing in his own filth and blood, while his hapless servants cannot figure out what is taking him so long in the “cool upper-chamber.” The means of killing is described in a well-thought-out and clever plot, and while a modern nonviolent reader may recoil at the particulars, we are served notice by the text that this is a heroic age, in which details of death in battle and assassination are matters of intense interest and detailed description."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 3:12–30.2","As Brettler (2001a) and others have noted, the narrative uses multiple terms for sacrifice, beginning with the name of the king himself. “Eglon” carries the connotation of a calf or bull, ready for the slaughter. The term for “gift” or “tribute” (Heb. <i>minha</i>), while normal in this context, can also indicate a sacrifice of grain. The verb “bring near” (<i>k-r-b</i>), similarly, is the conventional one for offering a sacrifice."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 3:12–30.3","Another cluster of images is sexual: doors and locking, “hand” (sometimes in the Bible a euphemism for male genitalia), and the phrase “come [in]to” (v.20), a common biblical expression for intercourse. Such imagery is undoubtedly used in this chapter to humiliate the enemy king, similar to the English language usage of overtly sexual terms in anger or humor not always directly related to sexuality. It is also worthy of note that we are dealing here with a Moabite king, and the Bible is unabashed in its negative (and sexual) portrayal of that nation, from its putative origins in incest in Gen. 19 to its causing Israel to go “whoring” after other gods in Num. 25."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 3:12–30.4","The text progressively isolates the two characters. Tribute is usually delivered in public, in a crowd; but here we have, first, Ehud’s men retiring, then Eglon’s, until the two principals are left alone in the “cool upper-chamber” of the palace. There will be only one who will exit the room. It will take the courtiers’ unlocking the door to unlock the mystery of what has happened."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 3:12–30.5","Eglon’s is the kind of downfall that will happen to many of Israel’s enemies in the book: defeat and death through stealth and daring, understood as aided primarily by God. The story is thus a good example of what Brettler (2001a) calls an “ideological” text, and its actual historical value is probably moot."

Perhaps, as Brettler (2001a) suggests, this brief notice was inserted after the core of Judges was written.

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.1","Devora and Barak; Ya’el and Sisera: In another shift from the norm established in Chap. 2, the text here presents multiple heroes, two of them women (unexpected in a book recounting violent exploits). The character of Devora broadens and deepens the question of leadership, introducing a “judge” who indeed sits and governs the people in a way that most of the male judges do not, and who is even described as a “prophet.”"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.2","Coming as it does after the stunning deeds of several warrior-judges, the chapter serves to warn the audience that victory ultimately comes from God alone. It accomplishes this by tying the triumph to circumstances unusual for a war: the Israelite commander depends closely on a woman’s counsel, stressing the idea that “it will not be your glory” (v.9), and the enemy general is slain by a noncombatant, also a woman. Indeed, the use of the typical phrase “I will give the enemy into your hand” (here in vv.7 and 14) is nicely counterbalanced by “hand,” referring twice to Ya’el (vv.9 and 21)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.3","The battle scene itself utilizes stock biblical battle language (“panic” in v.15, “not even one was left” in v.16) and is typically brief, preferring to shift the chapter’s focus to the interaction between the characters before and after the actual fighting."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.4","As in the Ehud story, the narrative uses stealth as a major feature. We do not expect betrayal from a covenant partner, nor murder at the hands of a woman, especially one who acts in so maternal a manner: Ya’el covers Sisera (tucks him in!), gives him milk, and stands guard in the tent. Her utter single-mindedness and fearlessness contrast with Barak’s initial hesitation in v.8."

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.7","that he gave a thrusting-blast on the <i>shofar,</i> in the highlands of Efrayim,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.8","and the Children of Israel went down with him from the highlands, with him ahead of them."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.9",28 He said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.10","Come down after me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.11","for Y<small>HWH</small> has given your enemies, Moav, into your hand!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.12",They went down after him
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.13",and took the Jordan crossings from Moav;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.14",they did not let a man cross.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.15",29 And they struck Moav at that time—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.16","about ten thousand men,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.17","all stout ones, all men of valor;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.18",not a man escaped.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.19",30 Thus Moav was humbled at that time under the hand of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.20",And the land was quiet for eighty years.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.21",31 After him was Shamgar son of Anat:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.22","he struck the Philistines, six hundred men, with an ox-goad;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.23",thus he too delivered Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.24","4:1 But the Children of Israel again did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.25",and Ehud was dead.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.26","2 So Y<small>HWH</small> sold them into the hand of Yavin king of Canaan, who reigned as king in Hatzor;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.27",the commander of his armed-forces was Sisera.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.28",Now he sat [enthroned] at Haroshet of the Nations.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.29","3 And the Children of Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.30","for he had nine hundred iron chariots,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.31",and he had been oppressing the Children of Israel strongly for twenty years.

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.34","5 She was sitting [as judge] under the Palm of Devora, between Rama and Bet-El, in the highlands of Efrayim,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.35",and the Children of Israel would come up to her for judgment.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.36","6 She sent and called for Barak/Lightning son of Avino’am, from Kedesh in Naftali,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.37",and she said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.38","Has not Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, charged you?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.39","Go deploy at Mount Tavor,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.40",and take with you ten thousand men from the children of Naftali and from the Children of Zevulun;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.41","7 I will deploy against you, at Wadi Kishon, Sisera, the commander of Yavin’s forces, along with his chariotry and his throng,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.42",and I will give him into your hand.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.43",8 Barak said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.44","If you go with me, I will go,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.45","but if you do not go with me, I will not go!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.46",9 She said:

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.48",but it will not be your glory on the way that you are going.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.49","Rather, it is into the hand of a woman"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.50",that Y<small>HWH</small> will sell Sisera!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.51",And Devora arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.52","10 So Barak called up Zevulun and Naftali to Kedesh,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.53","and behind him came up ten thousand men,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.54",while Devora came up with them.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.55","11 —Now Hever the Kenite had parted from the Kenites,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.56","from the Children of Hovav, Moshe’s father-in-law;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.57","he had spread his tent as far as the oak in Tzaananim, which is near Kedesh.—"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.58","12 And Sisera was told that Barak son of Avino’am had come up to Mount Tavor,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.59","13 so Sisera summoned all his chariotry, nine hundred iron chariots,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.60","and all the fighting-people who were with him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.61",from Haroshet of the Nations to Wadi Kishon.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.62",14 Devora said to Barak:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.63","Arise, for this is the day that Y<small>HWH</small> is giving Sisera into your hand!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.64",Does not Y<small>HWH</small> go out [to war] before you?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.65","So Barak came down from Mount Tavor,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.66",with ten thousand men behind him.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.67","15 And Y<small>HWH</small> panicked Sisera and all the chariotry and all the camp, with the mouth of the sword, before Barak,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.68",and Sisera got down from the chariot and fled on foot.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.69","16 Now Barak was pursuing after the chariotry and after the camp, as far as Haroshet of the Nations,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.70",while all the camp of Sisera fell by the mouth of the sword;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.71",not even one was left.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 4.72","17 Now Sisera had fled on foot, to the tent of Ya’el, the wife of Hever the Kenite,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.1","The Song of Devora: The victory recounted in Chap. 4, probably based on some kind of historical incident, clearly played a key role in Israel’s later vision of itself. Set as it is after the prose account, the poem in the present chapter is parallel, as previously mentioned, to the events of Exod. 14, which similarly is followed by an archaic-sounding poem."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.2","Cross/Freedman and others have maintained that Chap. 5 is one of ancient Israel’s oldest texts, dating perhaps to the period when the event is to have taken place. It contains a number of constructions characteristic of early Hebrew. Brettler (2001a), however, summarizing several decades of recent scholarship, concludes that the bulk of the chapter’s language is “standard biblical Hebrew” and that we can actually draw no conclusions about a composition date. It has long been known that oral literature—if that is what is at play here, as some scholars who make claims for the poem’s historical authenticity maintain—is not actually preserved unaltered for centuries. But if Judg. 5 is not, then, an accurate rehearsal of historical events, or such events are not fully recoverable, what exactly is it, at least as it now appears in the Bible? Brettler’s proposal in this regard is an intriguing one: that the poem may have been used in ancient Israel to rally troops to battle. While he floats this as only a theory, I would add that there exists a more modern American parallel, familiar to schoolchildren of past generations: “Paul Revere’s Ride” by Longfellow. Many, perhaps most, of those made to memorize its famous lines grew up convinced that this was precisely the way events had unfolded in 1775. But the poet composed his piece in 1861, shortly before the first shots were fired on Fort Sumter, and it was dragged out again two years later, at the height of Lincoln’s attempt to get reluctant northerners to enlist in the Union army. Thus the poem, like its ancient relative, was written, or at least used, in Brettler’s words, to “persuade and convince.” In the case of Judg. 5, then, as so often in biblical texts, the events of the past, however accurate their portrayal, may here serve primarily to illuminate some present situation."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.3","The chapter contains memorable imagery, from the distinctive descriptions of the tribes, Y<small>HWH</small> as warrior, the gathering soldiers, and the involvement of the very cosmos (in the person of the stars) in the battle. Vv.4 and 21 in fact point to a rainstorm as a key element in Israel’s victory. Finally, the theme of voluntarism which is emphasized in the poem, lauding those who participated and castigating those who did not, parallels early heroic poetry in other cultures."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.4","Of particular note is the description of Sisera’s assassination in v.27. On the surface, its rhythms are significant, with the repetitions in v.26 reminiscent of slow-motion death scenes in film. But more than that: as feminist readers of the Bible have pointed out, the verbal imagery is actually sexualized. The traditional “at her feet” can quite reasonably be rendered “between her legs,” and the verb “crouched” (Heb. <i>kara</i>’) is used with sexual meaning in Job 31:10. Thus our narrative brilliantly paints Ya’el as a many-faced figure, much as in fairy tales—nurturing mother, potential or actual lover, and finally, of course, gruesome killer. The images do double duty: the milk is a symbol of motherhood, but is also effective in putting Sisera to sleep; the netting/blanket serves to cover him as one would a child, but also ultimately functions as a covering for a corpse; and the tent peg and mallet, which normally betoken domesticity, are transformed into murder weapons, with unavoidably phallic imagery."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.5","In fact, as many interpreters have noted, there are multiple images of the mother here: Devora, described as a “mother in Israel,” is a classic “good mother” figure, whereas Ya’el melds the nurturing and dangerously erotic images of mothering in the strongest way, as mentioned above. The last of the triad of women, Sisera’s mother, combines the picture of parental concern with a condoning reference to rape by the expected victors (v.30, “a lass [literally, ‘a womb’] … for each warrior chief”). Thus conflicting images, which could be understood as varying sides of the same coin, coalesce to express the ambivalence of the Bible’s male writers. Historically speaking, this is not unusual in male-female relations, but its expression is particularly notable in this story."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.6","Most striking of all in the poem, however, is the inclusion at the end of the episode regarding Sisera’s mother, whom we have not met previously, and whose passivity contrasts with Ya’el’s activism. The wrenching image of women helplessly waiting and watching for their husbands, brothers, or sons to return safely from battle, which can be found in the ballads of many cultures up to our own time, is used here to maximum effect. The poet masterfully contrasts the mother’s natural fears, occasioned by her son’s lateness, with her self-delusion, which is punctuated by literally colorful visions of captive women and scarves. These serve only to set up the fiercely triumphant moment of v.31: “So perish all your enemies, O Y<small>HWH</small>!”"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.7",18 Ya’el came out to meet Sisera
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.8",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.9","Do turn aside, my lord, do turn aside to me, do not be afraid!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.10","So he turned aside to her, to the tent,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.11",and she covered him with a blanket.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.12",19 He said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.13","Now let me drink a little water, for I am thirsty!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.14","She opened a skin of milk, gave him drink, and covered him."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.15",20 Then he said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.16","Stand at the entrance to the tent,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.17","and let it be: if anyone comes and asks you, and says:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.18",Is there anyone here?

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.21",and came to him silently

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.23","—now he had been sound asleep, for he was weary—"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 5.24",and he died.

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.1","Gid’on I: The Commission: This first full cycle of stories about a hero in Judges opens by utilizing an important category of religious texts: the “call.” A hero is addressed by God or his messenger and is charged with leading the people out of oppression or danger. Here it is prefaced, like the call of Moshe in Exod. 3, by a description of Israel’s sufferings, this time under the Midyanites (vv.2–6). The variation on the classic Judges pattern of Chap. 2 here appears in vv.8–10, where God responds to the Israelites’ usual outcry with the moral equivalent of “What do you expect, given your idolatrous behavior?” Only then can the deliverer be sent."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.2","The call narrative in Judg. 6 looks forward as well as backward. The image of divine fire consuming a sacrifice, and the realization that what appeared to be a man is actually a messenger from God, are both elements of the Shimshon (Samson) birth story in Chap. 13. And the use of “signs” here and elsewhere in the story introduces that major motif into the book (Amit 1999a) as a whole."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.3","There are other variations from the Chap. 2 paradigm in this chapter. The oppression, in this case wrought by the Midyanites, is much more detailed than before; Israel’s very food supply is threatened, and the size of the enemy hordes is vividly described. Then too, instead of directly launching a war of liberation against the Midyanites, vv.25ff. establish Gid’on as a fighter against idolatry, although they also indicate further weakness of character: he is unwilling to risk the wrath of the locals by tearing down the altar to Baal in the daylight hours. The little story here is an etiology, a narrative that explains an important name (in this case “Yerub-baal” for Gid’on). Whereas in the account of Ehud idolatry was on the periphery (suggested only by the mention of “carved images,” or a name with similar meaning), here it becomes central, and surfaces again in Chap. 8. Judges will not let us forget the core issue of the people’s apostasy."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.4","Vv.33–40 return to Gid’on’s need for proof through “signs,” a doubling that suggests not only the hero’s need for reassurance but also that of the audience."

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.55","and took you out of a house of serfs,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.56",9 and rescued you from the hand of Egypt

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.58",I drove them out from before you
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.59",and gave you their land.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.60",10 And I said to you:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.61",I am Y<small>HWH</small> your God;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.62","you are not to hold in awe the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are settling—"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.63",but you did not hearken to my voice!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.64","11 Now a messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> came and sat under the oak that is in Ofra, that belonged to Yoash the Avi’ezrite,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.65","while Gid’on/Hewer his son was beating down wheat in the winepress,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.66",to whisk it away from before Midyan.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.67",12 And Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger was seen by him;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.68",he said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.69","Y<small>HWH</small> is with you, O mighty-man of valor!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.70",13 Gid’on said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.71","Please, my lord,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.72","if Y<small>HWH</small> is with us,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.73",why has all this found us?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.74","Where are all the wonders which our fathers recounted to us, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.75",Was it not from Egypt that Y<small>HWH</small> brought us up?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.76","Yet now, Y<small>HWH</small> has forsaken us"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.77",and has given us into the grasp of Midyan!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.78",14 Y<small>HWH</small> faced him and said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.79",Go forth in this strength of yours
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.80",and deliver Israel from the grasp of Midyan!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.81",Have I not sent you?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.82",15 He said:

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.84",whereby shall I deliver Israel?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.85","Here, my family is the weakest in Menashe,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.86",and I am the youngest in my Father’s House!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.87",16 Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.88","Indeed, I will be with you;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.89",you will strike down Midyan as [if they were] one man!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.90",17 He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.91","Now if I have found favor in your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.92",make me a sign that it is you speaking to me:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.93",18 now do not depart from this-place until I come back to you
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.94",and have brought out my gift and placed it before you!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.95",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.96",I will stay until your return.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.97",19 So Gid’on came out
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.98",and made ready a goats’ kid with an <i>efa</i> of unleavened meal:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.99","the meat he put in a basket, while the broth he put in a boiling-pot,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.100","and he took them out to him beneath the oak, and brought them close."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.101",20 And God’s messenger said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.102","Take the meat and the unleavened bread and place them on this boulder,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.103","and the broth, pour out."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.104",He did so.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.105",21 And Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger stretched out the tip of the crook that was in his hand
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.106",and touched the meat and the unleavened bread;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.107",and fire went up from the rock
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.108","and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.109",while Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger went away from his eyes.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.110","22 Gid’on saw that he was Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.111",so Gid’on said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.112","Alas, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.113",for now I have seen Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger face to face!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.114",23 Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.115",Peace be to you—do not be afraid; you will not die.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.116","24 Gid’on built there a sacrificial-altar to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.117",and he called it: Y<small>HWH</small> of Peace.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.118","Until this day, it is still in Ofra of the Avi’ezrites."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.119",25 It was on that night that Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.120","Take an ox bull that belongs to your father,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.121","a second-born bull, seven years old:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.122","you are to tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.123","and the Ashera-pole that is next to it you are to cut down,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.124",26 and you are to build an altar to Y<small>HWH</small> your God
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.125",on the top of this stronghold in an arrangement [of stones];
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.126",then you are to take the second-born bull
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.127","and are to offer it up as an offering-up, with the wood of the Ashera-pole that you cut down."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.128",27 Gid’on took ten men from his servants
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.129",and did as Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken to him.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.130","Now it was, because he was too afraid of his Father’s House and of the men of the town to do it during the day,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.131",that he did it during the night.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.132","28 The men of the town started-early in the morning,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.133","and here, the altar of Baal had been demolished,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.134","and the Ashera-pole that was next to it had been cut down,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.135",and the second-born bull had been offered up upon the rebuilt altar!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.136","29 They said, each one to his fellow:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.137",Who did this thing?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.138","They made inquiry and searched,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.139",and they said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.140",Gid’on son of Yoash did this thing!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.141",30 So the men of the town said to Yoash:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.142","Bring out your son, that he may die,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.143","because he demolished the altar of Baal,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 6.144",and because he cut down the Ashera-pole that was next to it!

While the meaning of the symbolism of the soldiers drinking from the stream is elusive, it is clear that Gid’on will succeed militarily, as Yehoshua did, only through God’s intervention, although in the coming battle there are elements of strategy as well."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.2","The dream of the Midyanite soldiers (vv. 13–14) functions as a further sign that God will supply the victory. It is tempting to see in this scene one of the sources of Shakespeare’s famous prebattle dream sequences. A nice touch is supplied by the fact that it is not the hero who has the dream here, but an enemy soldier, who recounts it secondhand."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.3","We do not get to the battle itself until v.17. The victory is quite unorthodox—upside down, as the dream has it: instead of the Israelites doing the slaughtering, it is the confused Midyanites who put each other to the sword. Only the fierce and symbolically named enemy commanders are cited as direct victims of the Israelites, although obviously many of their soldiers would have died in the Israelites’ pursuit."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.4",31 But Yoash said to all who were standing [in attendance] around him:

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.32",39 Then Gid’on said to God:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.33","Do not let your anger flare up against me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.34",but let me speak just one [more] time:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.35",pray let me make a test only one [more] time with the clipping;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.36","pray let there be dryness on the clipping alone,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.37",but on all the ground let there be dew.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.38",40 And God did so on that night:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.39","here was dryness on the clipping alone,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.40",but on all the ground there was dew.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.41",7:1 Now Yerub-baal—that is Gid’on—and all the fighting-people who were with him started-early;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.42","they camped by En Harod/Spring of Trembling,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.43","while the camp of Midyan was north of it,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.44","at Giv’at Ha-Moreh/Hill of the Sage, in the valley."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.45",2 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.46",Too many are the fighting-people who are with you
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.47",for me to give Midyan into their hand.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.48","—lest Israel honor itself over me, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.49",<i>My</i> [own] hand delivered me!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.50","3 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.51","pray call out in the hearing of the people, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.52",Who is fearful and trembling?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.53",Let him turn back and depart from Mount Gil’ad!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.54","So there turned back from the people twenty-two thousand, while ten thousand remained."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.55",4 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.56",Still the people are too many!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.57","Lead them down to the water,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.58",that I may refine them for you there:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.59","it will be, [the one] about whom I say to you: This one shall go with you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.60","he shall go with you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.61","and [the one] about whom I say to you: This one shall not go beside you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.62",he shall not go.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.63","5 So he led the people down to the water,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.64",and Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.65","Whosoever licks with his tongue from the water, as a dog licks,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.66","set him aside,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.67",but whosoever crouches on his knees to drink …
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.68","6 Now the number of those who licked, from their hand to their mouth,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.69","was three hundred men,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.70",while all the rest of the people crouched on their knees to drink water.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.71",7 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.72","By the three hundred men, those who were licking, I will deliver you;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.73","I will give Midyan into your hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.74","and then all the people will go, each one back to his place."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.75","8 So they took the people’s provisions in their hand, along with their <i>shofars,</i>"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.76","while all the fighting-men of Israel he sent away, each to his tents,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.77",but of the three hundred men he kept hold.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.78","Now the camp of Midyan was beneath him, in the valley."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.79",9 And it was on that night
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.80",that Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.81","Arise, go down against the camp,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.82",for I have given it into your hand!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.83","10 And if you are afraid to go down [to attack],"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.84","go down, you along with Pura your serving-lad, to the camp,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.85",11 and hearken to what they are saying;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.86","afterward your hands will be strengthened, so that you may go down against the camp."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.87","So he went down, he and Pura his serving-lad, to the edge of the armed men who were in the camp."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.88","12 Now Midyan and Amalek and all the Children of the East were sprawled out in the valley, like locusts in abundance,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.89","and their camels had no number,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.90",like the sand that is on the shore of the sea in abundance.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.91","13 And Gid’on came, and here, a man was recounting a dream to his fellow;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.92",he said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.93","Here, I have dreamt a dream,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.94","and here, a loaf of barley bread was turning over in the camp of Midyan."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.95","It came as far as the tent and struck it, and it fell;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.96","it overturned it, upward,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.97",and the tent fell down!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.98",14 His fellow spoke up and said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.99","This is none other than the sword of Gid’on son of Yoash, the man of Israel!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.100","God has given Midyan into his hand, yes, the entire camp!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.101","15 It was, when Gid’on heard the recounting of the dream and its interpretation,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.102",that he bowed low;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.103",then he returned to the camp of Israel
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.104",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.105","Arise, for Y<small>HWH</small> has given into our hand the camp of Midyan!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.106","16 He split up the three hundred men into three companies,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.107","and he placed <i>shofars</i> in everyone’s hand along with empty jugs, and torches inside the jugs,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.108",17 and said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.109",Look at me and do thus:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.110","when I come to the outskirts of the camp,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.111","let it be: as I do, so you are to do:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.112","18 I will sound a blast on the <i>shofar,</i> I and all who are with me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.113","and then you are to sound a blast on the <i>shofars,</i> you as well, all around the entire camp,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.114",and you are to say:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.115",For Y<small>HWH</small> and for Gid’on!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.116","19 So Gid’on came, along with the hundred men who were with him, to the outskirts of the camp,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.117",at the beginning of the middle watch
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.118","—they had just installed, installed the watchmen—"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.119","and they sounded blasts on the <i>shofars,</i> with the jugs that were in their hand [ready to be] shattered."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.120","20 And the three companies sounded blasts on the <i>shofars,</i> and broke the jugs;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.121","they gripped the torches in their left hands,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.122","and in their right hands, the <i>shofars,</i> to sound blasts,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.123",and called out:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.124",A sword for Y<small>HWH</small> and for Gid’on!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.125","21 Then they stood still, each one in his position all around the camp,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.126",and the entire camp was on the run;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.127",they shouted and they fled.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.128","22 The three hundred <i>shofars were</i> sounded,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.129","and Y<small>HWH</small> put each one’s sword against his fellow, that is, against the entire camp,"

Normally, later scribes polemically substituted <i>bosket,</i> “shame,” for the Baal part of such names (see also “Ish-Boshet” for “Ish-Baal” in II Sam. 2:8,10). Here, though, they did not, because of the centrality of the name Baal in this episode (Burney)."

Some emend to <i>’-v-r,</i> “cross over,” among others. On the other hand, it sounds like the word for “bird/sparrow,” and so possibly suggests “fly away like a sparrow,” or even “Let him turn back twittering.” <b>Gil’ad:</b> Possibly with the connotation of “fright” (Burney traces it to Babylonian <i>gadalu,</i> “to be afraid”), given that no “Mount Gil’ad” is attested in the Bible."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 7.139","4 <b>refine:</b> The Heb. <i>tz-r-f</i> is a metallurgical term for “smelt, test the mettle.” It may also be a play on the <i>tz-p-r</i> of v.3, since <i>p</i> and <i>f</i> are the same root letter in Hebrew (Boling 1975)."

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.1","Gid’on III: Aftermath and Climax: The battle against the Midyanites is not yet over: Gid’on must pursue two of their kings across the Jordan. Before this, however, there is a brief moment of “strife” (recalling the meaning of the name Yerub-baal) with the men of Efrayim—the kind of intertribal problems that will plague the Israelites numerous times in Judges. Gid’on’s treatment of both his fellow Israelites and the enemy is harsh: he ends up threshing and killing the men of Sukkot, and he slays the enemy kings with his own hands."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.2","The chapter caps a turning point in the book, as Schneider comments. Gid’on is the first man to whom the crown is offered, but his rejection of it, while noblesounding and providing a catchphrase for the entire span of the Early Prophets, is followed immediately by his constructing of a semi-idolatrous image which becomes a “snare” for his whole family. And despite Gid’on’s positive death notice in v.28, the moment he dies, the Israelites go back to “whoring after the Baals.” So the mere suggestion of kingship leads to trouble, paralleling Moshe’s experience: even when God is acknowledged as the true king, the people still feel compelled to search for a concrete symbol to worship (Amit 1999a). In addition, the classic Judges pattern has been broken, for the people no longer “cry out” to God for deliverance, and the new, chosen leader is flawed (Schneider). A full reckoning will come in the form of a curse acted out in the next generation."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.3","and the entire camp fled as far as Bet-Shitta, toward Tzerera, to the border of Avel- Mehola, near Tabbat."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.4","23 The men of Israel were mustered from Naftali, from Asher, and from all of Menashe,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.5",and they pursued after Midyan.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.6","24 Now Gid’on had sent messengers throughout all the highlands of Efrayim, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.7","Go down to meet Midyan [in battle], and take the water from them, as far as Bet-Bara and the Jordan!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.8","So all the men of Efrayim were mustered, and they captured the water, as far as Bet-Bara and the Jordan."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.9","25 And they captured the two commanders of Midyan, Orev/Raven and Ze’ev/Wolf;"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.15",when you went to do battle against Midyan?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.16",And they strove with him strongly.

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.28","for they are weary,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.29","while I will pursue after Zevah and Tzalmunna, the kings of Midyan."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.30",6 The commanders of Sukkot said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.31","Is the grasp of Zevah and Tzalmunna now in your hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.32",that we should give your forces bread?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.33",7 Gid’on said:

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.35","when God gives Zevah and Tzalmunna into my hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.36",I will tread over your flesh with wilderness thorns and with nettles!

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.38",and the men of Penuel answered him
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.39",as the men of Sukkot had answered.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.40","9 So he said also to the men of Penuel, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.41","Upon my return in peace,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.42",I will demolish this tower!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.43","10 Now Zevah and Tzalmunna were in Karkor,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.45","all who were left from the entire camp of the Children of the East,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.46",for those fallen were a hundred and twenty thousand men drawing the sword.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.47","11 And Gid’on went up by the Road of the Tent Dwellers, east of Novah and Yogbeha,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.48","and he struck the camp, while the camp was feeling-secure."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.49","12 Zevah and Tzalmunna fled, but he pursued after them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.50","and he captured the two kings of Midyan, Zevah and Tzalmunna,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.51",and made the entire camp tremble.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.52","13 Gid’on son of Yoash returned from the battle, from Heres Pass,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.53","14 and he captured a lad from the men of Sukkot, and questioned him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.54","and he wrote out for him [the names of] the commanders of Sukkot and its elders,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.55",seventy-seven men.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.56",15 Then he came to the men of Sukkot
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.57",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.58","Here are Zevah and Tzalmunna, with whom you mocked me, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.59","Is the grasp of Zevah and Tzalmunna now in your hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.60",that we should give your weary men bread?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.61","16 So he took the elders of the town, and the wilderness thorns and the nettles,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.62","and trod over the men of Sukkot with them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.63","17 while the tower of Penuel he demolished, and killed the men of the town."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.64",18 Then he said to Zevah and Tzalmunna:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.65",What about the men whom you killed at Tavor?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.66",They said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.67","Like you were they,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.68",every one like the appearance of the king’s sons.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.69",19 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.70","They were my brothers, the sons of my mother!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.71","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.72","if [only] you had let them live,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.73",I would not have to kill you!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.74",20 And he said to Yeter his firstborn:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.75","Rise up, kill them!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.76","But the lad would not draw his sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.77","for he was afraid,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.78",for he was still a lad.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.79",21 Then Zevah and Tzalmunna said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.80","Rise up, you yourself, and attack us,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.81","for as the man is, [so] is his might!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.82","So Gid’on arose and killed Zevah and Tzalmunna,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.83",and he took the crescent-ornaments that were on their camels’ necks.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.84",22 Now the men of Israel said to Gid’on:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.85","Rule over us—so you, so your son, so your son’s son,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.86",for you have delivered us from the hand of Midyan!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.87",23 Gid’on said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.88","<i>I</i> will not rule over you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.89",my son will not rule over you—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.90",Y<small>HWH</small> will rule over you!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.91",24 Then Gid’on said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.92",I have a request to request of you:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.93","Give me, each one, a ring from his spoils!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.94","—for they had gold rings, for they were Yishmaelites."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.95",25 They said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.96","We will give, yes, give [them] over."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.97",So they spread out a cloth
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.98","and threw there, each one, a ring from his spoils."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.99",26 Now the weight of the gold rings that he requested
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.100","was a thousand and seven hundred [weights of] gold,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.101","aside from the crescents and the pearl-drops and the purple garments that were on the kings of Midyan,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.102",and aside from the collars that were around their camels’ necks.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.103",27 And Gid’on made it into an <i>efod;</i>
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.104","he set it up in his town, in Ofra,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.105",and all Israel went whoring after it there.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.106",It became a snare <i>for Gid’on</i> and for his house.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.107","28 And Midyan was humbled before the Children of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.108",so that they could no longer lift up their head.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.109",And the land was quiet for forty years in the days of Gid’on.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.110",29 Yerub-baal son of Yoash went and settled down in his house.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.111","30 Now Gid’on had seventy sons issuing from his loins,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.112",for he had many wives.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.113","31 As for his concubine, who was in Shekhem, she too bore him a son;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.114",he appointed his name Avimelekh/Father-is-King.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.115","32 And Gid’on son of Yoash died at a good ripe age,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 8.143","31 <b>appointed his name:</b> Buber (1967) points to the only other occurrences of this odd expression, II Kings 17:34 and Neh. 9:7, to assert that it means “giving a new name” and suggests that Avimelekh renames himself. Ironically, the name can also mean “God (Father) Is King,” so Avimelekh is immediately identified as a usurper of both his own father, who had refused the crown, and God."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.1","Avimelekh the Usurper: The rambling three-chapter account of Gid’on is followed by the long one-chapter cautionary tale of his son Avimelekh. If leadership is indeed a theme central to Judges, as Amit (1999a) contends, then this chapter represents a decisive moment in the book. The people had requested a king in 8:22, only to see their wish rejected in the recognition that YHWH is to be Israel’s sole ruler. This is now reinforced by example, as the villain’s name suggests (see the note to 8:31, above). Despite the chapter’s protestations that its main subject is Avimelekh’s payback for his crime of killing all save one of his brothers, the clear implication is that kingship, at least when it is not sanctioned fully by God, will lead to violence and ruin. In this exploration of power and character, one in which, for a change, idolatry is not the issue, Avimelekh points ahead, as suggested above, to Shakespeare, and the story is appropriately studded with ominous features: the would-be leader is the son of a second-level wife, and he gets his power initially from the gentry of Shekhem, the very city that had been the scene of a notorious rape and murder in earlier times (see Gen. 34), and that would one day witness the coming apart of the united kingdom of Israel (I Kings 12). And, of course, Avimelekh seizes power by the wholesale slaughter of his own brothers."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.2","The story’s moral is doubled, with the first warning coming after the murder. Using a common folklore motif, the survival of the youngest of many brothers (see, for example, the Norse story of Sigmund in the <i>Volsunga Saga</i>), we are told what the inevitable outcome will be through Yotam’s famous parable of the trees (vv.8–15). Israel in its normal state is symbolized by vegetation that supplies the treasured staples of figs, olive oil, and wine. And the governing alternative of concentrating power in the hands of one man is likened to dealing with a troublesome indigenous tree, the <i>atad</i> (see the note to v.15, below), which is powerful enough to destroy even the mighty cedars of Lebanon."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.3","As in <i>Richard III,</i> the decline of the usurper takes a while to unfold, fueled by jealousies and “ill will.” Along the way he proves himself a cruel but effective warrior. The introduction of fire into the last of his victories (v.49) foreshadows the end that Yotam had predicted in v.20. Avimelekh’s fate has elements of what has gone before (Sisera’s death at the hands of a woman), and of what will happen to Israel’s first legitimate king, Sha’ul, who will also kill himself once he has been seriously wounded in a losing battle. As mentioned before, Avimelekh’s end is attributed by the text to his crime of fratricide, but the very next verse (57) notes how the men of Shekhem are punished as well, having chosen a king, and a bad one at that."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.4","8:33 Now it was, when Gid’on died,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.23","4 So they gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple-house of Baal Berit,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.24",and with them Avimelekh hired some empty and impetuous men;

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.26","5 He came to his Father’s House, to Ofra,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.32","and went and kinged Avimelekh as king,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.33",alongside the oak of the monument that is in Shekhem.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.34","7 Yotam was told [about it],"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.35",so he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.36",and lifted up his voice and called out;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.37",he said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.38","Hearken to me, O landowners of Shekhem,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.51",that I should go and hold sway over the trees?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.52",12 So the trees said to the grapevine:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.53","<i>You</i> go, reign as king over us!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.54",13 The grapevine said to them:

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.63",but if not—

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.82",__________
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.83",21 Then Yotam fled:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.84","he ran away and went to Be’er and settled there,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.85",away from the face of Avimelekh his brother.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.86",22 Avimelekh governed Israel for three years.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.87","23 Then God sent a spirit of evil between Avimelekh and the landowners of Shekhem,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.88","and the landowners of Shekhem broke faith with Avimelekh,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.89","24 so that the wrong [done] the seventy sons of Yerub-baal, and their bloodguilt, might come"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.90","to be placed on Avimelekh their brother, who had killed them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.91","and on the landowners of Shekhem,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.92",who had strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.93","25 So the landowners of Shekhem set up ambushers against him on the summits of the mountains,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.94",and they robbed all those who were crossing them on the road.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.95",And it was told to Avimelekh.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.96","26 Then Gaal/Loathing son of Eved/Slave came, along with his brothers,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.97",and they crossed through Shekhem.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.98",And the landowners of Shekhem put [their] trust in him.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.99","27 So they went out into the open-field, amassed their vineyards’ [grapes], and trod [them] out,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.100",and they made jubilation;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.101","then they entered the temple-house of their god, and ate and drank,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.102",and made light of Avimelekh.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.103",28 Gaal son of Eved said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.104","Who is Avimelekh, and who is Shekhem, that we should serve him?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.105","Is he not the son of Yerub-baal, and Zevul is his adjutant?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.106","The men of Hamor, Shekhem’s father, should serve him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.107",but why should we serve him ourselves?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.108","29 O who would give this people into my hand, that I might remove Avimelekh,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.109",that someone would say to Avimelekh:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.110",Drive off your forces and go away!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.111","30 But Zevul the commander of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Eved,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.112","and his anger flared up,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.113","31 so he sent messengers to Avimelekh at Aruma, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.114","Here, Gaal son of Eved and his brothers have come to Shekhem,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.115","and here, they are besieging the town against you!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.116","32 So-now, arise at night,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.117","you and the fighting-people who are with you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.118",and wait in ambush in the open-country;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.119","33 and it will be in the morning, when the sun rises:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.120","start-early and spread out against the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.121","and here, [when] he and the fighting-people who are with him go out to you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.122",you may do with him whatever your hand finds.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.123","34 So Avimelekh arose, and all the fighting-people who were with him, at night;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.124","they lay in ambush against Shekhem, in four companies."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.125","35 Gaal son of Eved went out and stood at the entrance to the town gate,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.126",and Avimelekh and all the people who were with him arose from the ambush.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.127","36 Gaal saw the people, and he said to Zevul:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.128","Here, fighting-people are coming down from the mountains!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.129",Zevul said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.130",It is the shadow of the mountains that you see as men!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.131",37 But Gaal continued further to speak and said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.132","Here, fighting-people are coming down from the Navel of the Land,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.133",and one company is coming by way of the Soothsayers’ Oak!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.134",38 Zevul said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.135","Where, now, is your mouth that was saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.136","Who is Avimelekh, that we should serve him?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.137",Isn’t this the people whom you rejected?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.138",Pray go out now and wage battle against them!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.139",39 So Gaal went out before the landowners of Shekhem
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.140",and waged battle against Avimelekh.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.141","40 And Avimelekh pursued him, so that he fled from his face,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.142","and many wounded fell, up to the entrance of the gate."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.143","41 Avimelekh stayed in Aruma,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.144",and Zevul drove out Gaal and his brothers from being settled in Shekhem.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.145",42 Now it was on the morrow
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.146",that the people went out to the open-country and told Avimelekh.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.147",43 So he took the fighting-people and split them into three companies
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.148",and waited in ambush in the open-country.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.149","And he saw that here, the fighting-people were going out of the town,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.150",so he arose against them and struck them.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.151",44 Now Avimelekh and the companies that were with him spread out
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.152","and took their stand at the entrance to the town gate,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.153","while the two [other] companies spread out against all those who were in the open-country, and struck them."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.154","45 Avimelekh was waging battle against the town all that day,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.155","and he captured the town,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.156","and all the people who were in it, he killed;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.157","then he demolished the town, and sowed it with salt."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.158","46 And all the landowners of the Tower of Shekhem heard,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.159",so they came to the underground-chamber of the Temple-House of El-Berit.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.160","47 And it was told to Avimelekh that all the landowners of the Tower of Shekhem had gathered,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.161","48 so Avimelekh went up the Mount of Tzalmon,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.162","he and all the fighting-people who were with him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.163",and Avimelekh took axes in his hand
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.164",and cut down tree branch-clumps;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.165","he lifted them up, put them on his shoulder"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.166",and said to the fighting-people who were with him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.167","What you see me do—quickly, do like me!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.168","49 So all the fighting-people also cut down, each one, a branch,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.169",and they went [following] after Avimelekh;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.170","they put them on the underground-chamber and kindled the cavern over them with fire,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.171","so that also all the men of the Tower of Shekhem died, about a thousand men and women."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.172",50 Avimelekh went to Tevetz
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.173","and encamped against Tevetz, that he might capture it."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.174","51 Now there was a strong tower in the midst of the town,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.175","and they fled there, all the men and women, that is, all the landowners of the town;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.176",they shut it upon themselves
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.177",and went up on the roof of the tower.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.178","52 And Avimelekh came up to the tower and waged battle against it,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.179","but when he approached the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.180",53 a woman threw a riding millstone onto Avimelekh’s head
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.181",and crushed his skull.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.182","54 Quickly he called out to his serving-lad, his weapons bearer,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.183",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.184","Draw your sword and dispatch me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.185",lest they say of me: A woman killed him!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 9.186","So his serving-lad pierced him through, and he died."

From v.6 to v.16, however, there interposes what feels like a reprise of material from Chap. 2: a laying out of the pattern of idolatry, divine anger, foreign oppression, Israelite outcry, and, this time, God’s initial refusal to rescue them. For a change (v.16), the Israelites heed God’s rebuke in vv.11–14 and actually reject their “foreign gods.”"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.1","Yiftah: Tracing the precipitous decline that marks the second half of the book, Judges now turns to the first of two problematic figures, Yiftah the Gil’adite. While he is remembered in Western thought and art exclusively for one incident which spans only eleven verses, the ill-fated vow regarding his daughter, the chapter in which this tale is embedded is fully forty verses long, in addition to another seven that round out his story in the next chapter. So it is important to examine the larger setting."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.2","Like the villain Avimelekh, Yiftah is born to a mother of low social status. He obtains leadership not through being commissioned by God (as was, for instance, Gid’on) but by human agency. The Gil’adites elect him as leader, just as Avimelekh had been chosen by the Shekhemites (Schneider). Schneider also points out the connections between Yiftah and King Sha’ul (Saul), who similarly fights the Ammonites and is chosen at Mitzpa (in I Sam. 10; that location appears in v.11 here). It will also be the site of the Israelites’ gathering immediately after the terrible events of Chap. 19."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.3","As part of his leadership role, Yiftah negotiates with the Ammonites, recounting along the way some of Israel’s traditions relating to the Exodus from Egypt. At that time, several peoples to the east of Israel had refused to grant the ex-slaves passage through their territory, leading directly to the Israelites’ God-given victory over them and the possession of their land. Ironically, the Ammonites were not among them; they seem to have been put into this chapter at a later date. In any event, the wordplay, in Yiftah’s speech, on “possess/dispossess” eight times in four verses (21–24) highlights God’s role. The repetitions are perhaps also reflective of the warrior’s forceful, maybe even stubborn, personality, with v.25 witnessing three separate double verb formulations (using “be better … strive … do battle”)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.4","Thus righteously armed, Yiftah commits his fatal error, reflected in the narrative’s wording. First, he vows to sacrifice whatever “goes out” to greet him upon his return from defeating the Ammonites, if God should grant him victory. When that turns out to be his daughter, his only child, he has no choice, according to his culture, but to go through with the pledge that had “gone out” of his mouth (v.36). Second, his harping on the verb “possess” foreshadows the loss of his most treasured possession, his daughter. Finally, we should note that the name Yiftah, while probably originally signifying the divine opening of the womb, may be subtly playing on the idea of opening the mouth."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.5","The motif of sacrificing a child to the gods to ensure success in war is widespread, and the Greeks used it most famously in the Iphigenia story (see Marcus 1986). But whereas that tale is but the beginning of a chain reaction of events stretching over many years—the arrival of the Greeks at Troy, victory after a ten-year war, Agamemnon’s triumphant homecoming, his murder by his wife and her lover, and <i>her</i> murder by their son, who must then wander condemned and tormented for years—the Yiftah story is a single incident about an unmarried woman and an obscure festival. To be sure, it is embedded in the book of Judges as an example of the ongoing decline of Israel and its leadership, but the effect is hardly the same as in the Greek example. Nevertheless, the story’s focus on leadership is crucial. Yiftah is best understood in the biblical context by way of comparison, as so often is the case in this literature, both forward and backward (see Schneider). He certainly recalls Avraham, the faithful one who was willing to sacrifice even his “only one” to God (Gen. 22)—but who, in the end, was emphatically not required to do so. And he anticipates Sha’ul, whose rash vow in I Sam. 14 invokes a nominal death sentence on his son Yonatan, but who likewise is prevented from going through with the threat, in this instance by his indignant troops. Additionally, in the text’s focus on a domestic crisis, Yiftah prepares the ground for Shimshon; despite the military triumphs of both men, they are compromised by private events. By way of summary, one could almost agree with Schneider, who sees in this judge “no qualities, no deeds, no crisis, no God.”"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.6","Not surprisingly in a narrative about a vow, language plays a central role in the text. Yiftah is overly wordy with the Ammonites, with the rhetorical flourishes noted above, but it is a single sentence that creates the ultimate disaster in his own family. And it is the family name, the ultimate language marker, which will now die with him, although in long-range perspective, it <i>will</i> survive in later literature and art."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.7","The character of Yiftah’s unnamed daughter deserves some attention. She strangely does not protest her father’s obligation to carry out his vow, either by direct refusal to play the victim or by simply running away. The way in which she retains dignity in the face of a clearly patriarchal text is to request and receive a two-month reprieve to mourn the loss of her sexual maturity in the company of female companions. As Exum (1993) notes, this secures her immortality, if nothing else. But she remains the quintessential anonymous female victim, in a book whose male figures are anything but idealized."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.8","For a more positive treatment of the daughter’s fate as tied to a rite of passage for females in ancient Israel, see Niditch (2008)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.9","9 And the Children of Ammon crossed the Jordan to wage battle also against Yehuda, and against Binyamin, and against the House of Efrayim,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.10",and Israel was exceedingly distressed.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.11","10 So Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.12",We have sinned against you!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.13",For we have abandoned our God
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.14",and have served the Baals!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.15",11 Y<small>HWH</small> said to the Children of Israel:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.16",Did not [I deliver you] from Egypt and from the Amorites and from the Children of Ammon and from the Philistines?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.17","12 And when the Sidonians and Amalek and Midyan oppressed you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.18","you cried out to me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.19",and I delivered you from their hand;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.20","13 but you have abandoned me, and served other gods—"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.21",therefore I will not continue to deliver you.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.22","14 Go cry out to the gods whom you have chosen,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.23",let <i>them</i> deliver you at the time of your distress!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.24",15 The Children of Israel said to Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.25",We have sinned!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.26","Do, you yourself, to us"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.27","according with whatever is good in your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.28",only: just rescue us this day!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.29",16 So they removed the foreign gods from their midst
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.30","and served Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.31",and he became short-tempered with the travails of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.32","17 The Children of Ammon mustered [troops] and encamped in Gil’ad,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.33",while the Children of Israel gathered and encamped in Mitzpa.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.34","18 The fighting-people, the commanders of Gil’ad, said each one to his fellow:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.35",Who is the man that will be first to do battle against the Children of Ammon?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.36",He shall be head of all the settled-folk of Gil’ad!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.37","11:1 Now Yiftah the Gil’adite was a mighty-man of valor,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.38",but he was the son of a whore woman;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.39",Gil’ad begot Yiftah.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.40","2 And Gil’ad’s wife bore him sons,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.41","but when the wife’s sons grew up,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.42",they drove Yiftah away and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.43","You shall not get hereditary-property in our Father’s House,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.44",for you are the son of a different woman!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.45",3 So Yiftah ran away from the face of his brothers
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.46",and settled in the land of Tov/Good.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.47",And there gathered around Yiftah empty men;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.48",they went out [to war] beside him.

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.52",that the elders of Gil’ad went to fetch Yiftah from the land of Tov.

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.54","Come now and become chief for us,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.55",that we may wage battle against the Children of Ammon!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.56",7 Yiftah said to the elders of Gil’ad:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.57",Is it not you who spurned me
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.58",and drove me away from my Father’s House?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.59","So for-what-reason have you come to me now,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.60",when you are in distress?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.61",8 The elders of Gil’ad said to Yiftah:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.62","Agreed, [but] now we have returned to you, so that you may go with us"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.63","and wage battle against the Children of Ammon,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.64","that you may be headman for us,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.65",for all the settled-folk of Gil’ad!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.66",9 Yiftah said to the elders of Gil’ad:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.67","If you reinstate me, yourselves, to wage battle against the Children of Ammon,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.68","so that Y<small>HWH</small> gives them before me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.69",<i>I</i> will be headman for you.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.70",10 The elders of Gil’ad said to Yiftah:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.71",May Y<small>HWH</small> be hearer between us:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.72","if we do not do so, in accordance with your word … !"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.73","11 So Yiftah went with the elders of Gil’ad,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.74",and the people set him as headman and as chief over them;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.75",and Yiftah spoke all his terms in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> at Mitzpa.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.76","12 Then Yiftah sent messengers to the king of the Children of Ammon, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.77","What is there [between] me and you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.78","that you come to me, to wage battle against my land?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.79",13 The king of the Children of Ammon said to Yiftah’s messengers:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.80","Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.81","from the Arnon as far as the Yabbok, as far as the Jordan."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.82","So-now, return it peaceably!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.83",14 Yiftah once again sent messengers to the king of the Children of Ammon;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.84",15 he said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.85",Thus says Yiftah:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.86",Israel did not take away the land of Moav or the land of the Children of Ammon;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.87","16 rather, when they came up from Egypt,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.88","Israel went through the wilderness, near the Sea of Reeds, and came to Kadesh."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.89","17 And Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.90",Now let me cross through your land.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.91","But the king of Edom did not hearken,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.92","and they sent also to the king of Moav, but he was not willing,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.93",so Israel stayed at Kadesh.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.94","18 Then they went through the wilderness and circled around the land of Edom and the land of Moav,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.95","and they came to the sun-rise [side] of the land of Moav, and encamped across the Arnon,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.96","but they did not come into the territory of Moav,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.97",for the Arnon is the territory-border of Moav.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.98","19 And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.99",Israel said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.100","Now let me cross through your land, to my place."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.101",20 But Sihon did not trust Israel to cross through his territory;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.102","Sihon gathered all his fighting-people and encamped at Yahatz,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.103",and did battle with Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.104","21 But Y<small>HWH</small> the God of Israel gave Sihon and all his fighting-people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.105","so Israel came to possess the entire land of the Amorites, the settled-folk of that land."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.106","22 They took possession of the entire territory of the Amorites,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.107",from the Arnon as far as the Yabbok and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.108","23 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.109",Y<small>HWH</small> the God of Israel dispossessed the Amorites before his people Israel—

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.123",28 But the king of the Children of Ammon did not hearken to Yiftah’s words which he had sent to him.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.124",29 Now there came upon Yiftah the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.125","he crossed over to Gil’ad and Menashe,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.126","and he crossed over to Mitzpe of Gil’ad, and from Mitzpe of Gil’ad he crossed over to the Children of Ammon."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 11.127",30 And Yiftah vowed a vow to Y<small>HWH</small> and said:

Here the Yiftah motif of language returns; this time, it is neither a pun, a doubled verb, nor a hasty vow that grabs our attention, but rather the pronunciation of a single word (shibbolet) which marks the dividing line between life and death."

Gray (1986) points to the differing Hebrew and Arabic pronunciations of one letter as a parallel (e.g., Heb. <i>shalom</i> and Arabic <i>salaam</i>). The word itself has entered English in the form “shibboleth,” meaning a password or test word. <b>understand:</b> The reading adopted by some manuscripts (<i>yavin</i>) for MT <i>yakhin</i> (“prepare”). <b>correctly:</b> Or at least according to Gil’adite pronunciation. <b>forty-two thousand:</b> The number forty-two occurs several times in the Early Prophets (e.g., the number of boys slain by bears in II Kings 2:24, and of those massacred by Yehu [Jehu] in II Kings 10:14).

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 13.1","The Birth of Shimshon: The narrative now moves on to a second impulsive character. But the story opens in leisurely and formulaic fashion, utilizing repeating words and phrases and allowing the dramatic and entertaining action to properly build up."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 13.2","The significance of the Shimshon story, which ends the core narratives about individual judges, is signaled by the appearance and involvement of a divine messenger, whose exit is miraculous and pyrotechnic, and by the repetition of rules regarding both the mother’s pregnancy and the hero’s future life. The announcement of conception to a previously barren woman is something we have encountered many times before in Genesis, where it always signifies the birth of a hero, but it receives its most elaborate treatment here. In its representation of Nazirite regulations—detailed in Num. 6 as a person taking on a special vow not to drink wine or beer, cut his/her hair, or come into contact with a corpse or carcass—there are several twists: the <i>mother</i> is given parallel rules, and, more specifically, the “Consecrated One’s” status will be lifelong and not confined to a limited time frame. It should be noted that the next book will open with a similarly lifelong devotee, Shemuel (Samuel)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 13.3","We have encountered an angel before in Judges, in the Gid’on story of Chap. 6, but the recipient of revelation here is a woman (with an absent husband), reinforcing the importance of women throughout the book and especially in the Shimshon cycle. The parallel annunciation account in the New Testament became a key scene in medieval Western art, and for this and other reasons, Shimshon was often regarded in early and later Christianity as a prefiguring (“type”) of Jesus."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 13.4","From the outset, the story (and the cycle) involves secrets and mysteries. The woman is befuddled by the appearance of a stranger who looks like a messenger of God (v.6); her husband will likewise have no clue as to the angel’s identity until the angel does something out of the ordinary (v.19). The revelation of the messenger’s secret, far from having a salutary effect, strikes fear into Manoah’s heart, which can only be calmed down after his wife reassures him. The chapter ends with the note of the birth, naming, and one-phrase childhood and adolescence of Shimshon, but what Y<small>HWH</small>’s spirit “stirring him up” will mean remains to be fully discovered. For Gid’on and Yiftah it had signified the charismatic ability to lead the troops, but that will not be the pattern here."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 13.5","The presence of secrets reminds us that the narrative is studded with folklore motifs. Besides the birth of a hero to a previously barren mother, the text begins with the fairy-tale-like opening, “There was a man” (see also, as other examples, I Sam. 1:1 and 9:1). And the angel disappears in the flame of the altar, another classic “sign” of God’s acts of deliverance (Amit 1999a). Additionally, the verbal repetitions betoken the world of folklore, as well as the Bible’s use of repetition, with “see” as a verb seven times, and “guard,” three."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 13.6","Almost lost in the details of the chapter is the notice that Shimshon “shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines” (v.5). He thus anticipates the monarchy or, more specifically, King David, who will finish the job. As is typical in Judges, Shimshon’s victory will be only a temporary one."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 13.7","In true biblical fashion, there is no childhood in the story. Shimshon does not have to display prodigious feats of strength, as the infant Herakles does in strangling snakes sent by a jealous Hera. The text need only note that God blesses him (v.24), and that Shimshon feels the beginnings of his strength on home ground. The rest will follow soon enough."

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 13.62","13.1 <b>Philistines:</b> This group, whose area of settlement lay largely on the coast of Israel, appears to have been one of the “Sea Peoples” who invaded the Near East from somewhere in the Mediterranean in the twelfth century <small>B.C.E.</small> Unsuccessful in gaining a foothold in Egypt, the Philistines became Israel’s principal foe in Judges and Samuel—technologically advanced through possession of iron weapons, and militarily powerful. Little is known of their language and religion; their pottery, however, has affinities with that of the Aegean. They quickly adopted Canaanite culture and, despite being decisively defeated by King David, survived for centuries. Ironically, their name, vocalized as “Palestine,” became that of the country after biblical kings were long gone, and is today used as the name of a proposed Arab state in the West Bank/Gaza."

This is followed by the account of how Shimshon’s wife betrays the secret of his riddle, against the background of yet another violation of his vows, as the term “drinkfest” in v.10 hints."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.3","Verbal repetitions here include “take,” “my people,” “riddle a riddle,” “not telling,” and the rhythmic fivefold mention of the place name Timna. And Shimshon’s act of “breaking off” (<i>r-d-h</i>) honey supplies the chapter’s seventh occurrence of sounds suggested by the family’s movement of “going down” (<i>y-r-d</i>) to Philistine territory."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.4","The whole chapter utilizes folk motifs: Shimshon’s slaying of the lion (a favorite subject in Western art), the honey in the carcass, the riddle, the use of numbers three and four, the pressure from the wife, and the substitution of armor for festive garments. It sets a precedent for the climactic Delila story of Chap. 16, which describes the use of feminine wiles in almost identical terms. Once the first woman has talked Shimshon into revealing his first secret, we know that the last woman will have no trouble prying the crucial one out of him in the end."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.5","The inclusion of a riddle in this chapter is another one of Klein’s examples of irony in Judges; often in folklore, solving a riddle leads to winning, not losing, the bride."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.6",15 Manoah said to Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.7","Now let us detain you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.8",that we may make ready a goats’ kid for you.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.9",16 Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger said to Manoah:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.10","If you detain me, I will not eat of your food,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.11","but if you wish to make ready an offering-up to Y<small>HWH</small>, you should offer it up"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.12",—for Manoah did not know that he was Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.13",17 Manoah said to Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.14","What is your name,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.15","so that when your words come to pass, we may honor you?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.16",18 Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.17",Now why do you ask about my name?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.18",For it is wondrous!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.19",19 Manoah took the goats’ kid and the gift-offering
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.20",and offered them up on the rock to Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.21","He did wondrously, while Manoah and his wife saw it:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.22","20 it was,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.23","as the flame was going upward from the altar to the heavens,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.24",that Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger went up in the flame of the altar.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.25","When Manoah and his wife saw it,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.26",they flung themselves upon their faces to the ground.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.27","21 Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger was not seen again by Manoah or by his wife,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.28",so Manoah knew that he was Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.29",22 Manoah said to his wife:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.30","We are going to die, yes, die,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.31",for it is a god that we have seen!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.32",23 But his wife said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.33",Had Y<small>HWH</small> desired to have us die
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.34","he would not have taken an offering-up and a grain-gift from our hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.35","he would not have let us see all these,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.36","and at that moment, he would not have let us hear such things."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.37",24 The woman gave birth to a son;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.38",she called his name Shimshon.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.39","The boy grew up, and Y<small>HWH</small> blessed him."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.40","25 And Y<small>HWH</small>’s rushing-spirit began to stir him up in Mahaneh-Dan,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.41",between Tzor’a and Eshtaol.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.42","14:1 Shimshon went down to Timna,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.43",and he saw a woman in Timna from the daughters of the Philistines.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.44",2 He came up and told it to his father and to his mother;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.45",he said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.46",A woman have I seen in Timna from the daughters of the Philistines.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.47","So-now, take her for me as a wife!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.48",3 His father and his mother said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.49","Is there not among your brothers’ daughters or among all my people a woman,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.50","that you must go to take a woman from the Philistines, the Foreskinned Ones?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.51",Shimshon said to his father:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.52","Take <i>her</i> for me, for she is right in my eyes!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.53","4 Now his father and his mother did not know that it was from Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.54",for he was seeking a pretext from the Philistines
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.55",—now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.56",5 Shimshon went down along with his father and his mother to Timna;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.57",they had come as far as the vineyards of Timna
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.58","when here, a full-maned roaring lion, [coming] to meet him!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.59",6 Y<small>HWH</small>’s spirit advanced upon him
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.60","and he tore it apart as one tears apart a kid,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.61",without a thing in his hand.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.62",But he did not tell his father and his mother what he had done.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.63",7 Then he went down and spoke to the woman—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.64",she was right in Shimshon’s eyes.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.65",8 He returned after a year to take her;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.66","he turned aside to see the fallen lion,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.67","and here: a swarm of bees in the lion’s corpse, and honey!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.68","9 He broke it off into his hands,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.69","and went along, going and eating."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.70","Then he went back to his father and to his mother,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.71","and gave some to them, and they ate."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.72",But he did not tell them that it was from the lion’s corpse that he had broken off the honey.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.73","10 His father went down on account of the woman,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.74","and Shimshon made a drinkfest there, for that is what young men do;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.75","11 and it was when they saw him, that they fetched thirty feasting-companions [who] remained with him."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.76",12 Shimshon said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.77",Now let me riddle you a riddle!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.78","If you can tell, yes, tell me its [answer] during the seven days of the drinkfest"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.79","and can find it out,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.80",I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.81","13 but if you are not able to tell me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.82","you will have to give me, yourselves, thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes."

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.91","4 <b>a pretext:</b> Creating the right conditions for an Israelite victory, so to speak. <b>at that time:</b> The text here distances itself from the era of the Judges."

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.93","6 <b>without a thing in his hand:</b> Like two other ancient heroes, Herakles/Hercules fighting the Nemean lion, and the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh (Burney)."

The use of the rare <i>r-d-h</i> here may be for the sake of punning with the theme word <i>y-r-d,</i> “go down” (Boling)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 14.96","10 <b>His father went down:</b> Shimshon appears to have taken the woman as a wife in the meantime; the events are hazy here. <b>drinkfest:</b> By participating, Shimshon would be breaking another one of the Nazirite vows."

Shimshon’s wife is given to another, so he counters with the colorful episode of the fox tails and the fire, in which the Philistine crops are destroyed. This results in another fire, causing the death of Shimshon’s wife and father-in-law, which is followed by Shimshon’s taking revenge by slaughtering more Philistines."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.2","The story in the second half of the chapter (vv.9ff.) witnesses the hero’s first reported contact with other Israelites. It also introduces the symbolically important theme of binding, already implied by the same verb in the Nazirite restrictions. For a third straight chapter, an animal plays a role in the narrative, this time in the form of a donkey’s jawbone. Shimshon’s victims are legion; a fitting illustration of the scene is Gustave Dore’s classic etching, found in many Bibles, which features innumerable tiny figures falling into the gorge. While the text then presents an etiological passage, with two names (Ramat Lehi and En Ha-Korei) receiving folk etymologies, its real significance lies in Shimshon’s calling upon God—something he will not do again until his final moments. The hero, like Eliyyahu (Elijah) in I Kings 17, is nourished by God, but, unlike the prophet, the strong man gives no indication of his true calling. The “great deliverance” for which he pleads is thus only his personal one, and he does not view the slaying of a thousand Philistines as an act undertaken on behalf of an oppressed people. All the more jarring, then, is the editorial note that has been inserted in v.20, characterizing Shimshon as a “judge.”"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.3",They said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.4","Riddle your riddle, and we will hear it!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.5",14 He said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.6","Out of the eater came food-to-eat,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.7",out of the strong one came something sweet.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.8",They could not tell him [the answer to] the riddle for three days;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.9",15 so on the fourth day it was that they said to Shimshon’s wife:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.10","Seduce your husband, that he may tell us [the answer to] the riddle,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.11",lest we burn you and your Father’s House with fire—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.12",is it to dispossess us that you have invited us here?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.13","16 Shimshon’s wife wept on him, she said:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.14","You surely hate me, you do not love me;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.15","should you riddle a riddle to the sons of my people,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.16",and not tell [the answer] to me?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.17",He said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.18","Here, I haven’t told it to my father or to my mother—"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.19",so should I tell it to you?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.20","17 She wept on him for the seven days in which they held the drinkfest,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.21","and then it was, on the seventh day, that he told it to her, for she kept pressing him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.22",and she told the riddle’s [answer] to the sons of her people.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.23","18 So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day, before the daystar set:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.24",What is sweeter than honey?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.25",What is stronger than a lion?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.26",He said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.27","If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.28",you wouldn’t have found out my riddle!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.29",19 And Y<small>HWH</small>’s spirit advanced upon him;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.30",he went down to Ashkelon
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.31","and struck down thirty fighting-men of them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.32",took their sashes
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.33",and gave them as clothing-changes to those who had told the riddle’s [answer].
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.34","His anger flared on,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.35",and he went up to his father’s house.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.36","20 Now Shimshon’s wife was [given] to one of his feasting-companions, who had been his [own] companion."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.37","15:1 Now it was [after] a year, in the days of the wheat cutting,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.38",that Shimshon visited his wife with a goats’ kid;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.39","he said: I will come in to my wife, in the inner-room!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.40",But her father did not give him [leave] to come in.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.41",2 Her father said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.42","I said [to myself], said:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.43","Indeed, you bear hatred, yes, hatred toward her,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.44",so I gave her to your companion.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.45",Isn’t her sister more good-looking than she?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.46",Let her be yours in her place!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.47",3 Shimshon said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.48","This time I will be clear of blame from the Philistines,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.49",if I do evil with them!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.50",4 So Shimshon went
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.51","and captured three hundred foxes,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.52",and took [some] torches
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.53","and faced tail to tail,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.54","and placed each torch between two tails, in the middle,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.55","5 and ignited fire in the torches,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.56",and sent them free in the standing-stalks of the Philistines;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.57","he ignited from sheaf-stacks to standing-stalks, to vineyards [and] olive-trees."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.58",6 The Philistines said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.59",Who has done this?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.60",They said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.61","Shimshon, the Timnite’s son-in-law,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.62",for he took away his wife and gave her to his companion!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.63",So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.64",7 Shimshon said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.65","If you do [things] like this,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.66","surely when I have avenged myself upon you, [only] afterward will I stop!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.67","8 And he struck them down, hip over thigh, a great striking down;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.68",then he went down and stayed in the gorge of Etam’s Crag.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.69",9 The Philistines went up and camped in Yehuda;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.70",they were spread out at Lehi.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.71",10 And the fighting-men of Yehuda said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.72",Why have you come up against us?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.73",They said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.74","To bind Shimshon have we come up,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.75",to do to him as he did to us!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.76",11 Three thousand fighting-men from Yehuda went down to the gorge of Etam’s Crag
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.77",and said to Shimshon:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.78",Don’t you know that the Philistines are ruling us?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.79",Now what have you done to us?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.80",He said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.81","As they did to me, so I did to them!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.82",12 They said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.83","We have come down to bind you, to give you into the hand of the Philistines."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.84",Shimshon said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 15.85","Swear to me, lest you attack me yourselves!"

Jackals, as social animals, would be more catchable in a naturalistic setting, whereas foxes, whose behavior is more solitary, suggest a miraculous, folktale background, perhaps more appropriate here."

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.1","The Gates of Gaza: Here is another tale which may have had a humorous flavor for ancient audiences. God has just slaked Shimshon’s thirst, but the hero’s insatiable desire for women takes him right back to the enemy camp, in this case one of the five major Philistine cities. To all appearances he is about to be trapped, as the natives set an ambush (a motif which will reappear in the next episode). But the contrast between pursuers and pursued takes an unexpected turn: the Philistines’ quiet and patience are overcome by Shimshon’s impulsiveness and overwhelming strength. Like a mythical giant, he uproots the huge doors of the city gate, bolt and all, and carries them off to Hevron, which is not only many miles away from Gaza but also three thousand feet up in the hills. The Philistines’ response is stunned silence, and they simply disappear from the text. One imagines them with mouths agape at the spectacle before them, and the text’s audience shaking their heads with a smile, or more."

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.6",So they bound him with two new ropes

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.11",and the ropes which were on his arms became

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.23",that he threw the jawbone from his hand
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.24",—so they called that place Ramat Lehi/Jawbone Height.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.25","18 He became exceedingly thirsty, so he called out to Y<small>HWH</small> and said:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.26",You yourself have given into your servant’s hand
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.27","this great deliverance,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.28","so-now, shall I die of thirst"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.29",and fall into the hand of the Foreskinned Ones?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.30","19 So God split open the cavity that was at Lehi,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.31","and water came out of it, and he drank;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.32","his spirit returned, and he revived."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.33",__________
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.34","15 <b>fresh:</b> Lit. “moist.” If it had been dry, it would have been brittle and thus might well have cracked (Gray 1986). Shimshon’s touching the remains of an ass here is another example of his violation of Nazirite rules."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.35","16 <b>With the jawbone of a donkey … :</b> Heb. difficult; some have understood <i>h-m-r</i> to mean “heap,” thus: “With the jawbone of an ass, / heaping mass upon mass …” Boling (1975) likens the phrase <i>hamor hamortayim</i> to <i>raham rahamatayim</i> (“a lass, two lasses”) and <i>rikma … rikmatayim</i> (“embroidered cloth … embroidered”) in 5:30."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.36","17 <b>Ramat … Height:</b> Heb. <i>r-m-h</i> may also denote “toss away,” fitting the action in the previous verse."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:1–3.37","19 <b>spirit:</b> Or “life-breath,” although “spirit” has been a force earlier in the story. <b>Ha-Korei:</b> This can also mean “the partridge,” likely the original signification of the name. The whole name is pronounced <i>AYN ha-ko-RAY.</i>"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.1","The Woman of the Night: Although it is not the final story in the cycle, the Delila episode is a climax of sorts. Carefully constructed of repeating phrases (for example, “Now the ambush was sitting [for her] in the inner-room”; “Philistines upon you, Shimshon!”), it reprises most of the words and motifs that have appeared up to this point (see “Appendix: The Sound and Structure of a Biblical Tale”) and welds them into a tight whole. Folk motifs return, in the person of the nagging lover, the new, fresh ropes, and the number of Delila’s attempts to get at the truth—the classic 3+1 pattern of folklore. The tension is palpable, with the ambush lying in wait and Delila inching ever closer to the truth (on the third try, Shimshon brings his “locks” into the picture). The text is punctuated by the repeated “I’d become weak, I’d become like [Heb. ve-hayyiti ve-haliti] any man,” culminating in the slightly altered “all men” in v.17. Shimshon is, of course, the last to know about his newly weakened state, and his lack of knowledge continues the broader theme of secrets withheld (note that the word “tell” occurs seven times in the episode)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.2","Shimshon’s punishment is twofold. First, he temporarily loses his strength, and second, more permanently, he loses his sight."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.3","Therefore they called its name En Ha-Korei/Spring of the Caller,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.4","which is in Lehi,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.5",until this day.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.6","20 He led Israel as judge in the days of the Philistines, for twenty years."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.7",16:1 Shimshon went to Gaza;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.8","he saw there a whore woman, and came in to her."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.9",2 Among the Gazites it was said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.10",Shimshon has come here!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.11","They circled about and set an ambush for him the whole night at the town gate,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.12","and they plotted the whole night, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.13",Until the light of daybreak—then we will kill him!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.14",3 Shimshon lay until the middle of the night;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.15",he arose in the middle of the night
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.16","and seized the doors of the town gate, along with the two posts,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.17","and pulled them up, together with the bolt"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.18",and put them on his shoulders
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.19",and brought them up to the top of the hill that faces Hevron.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.20",4 Now it was [some time] after this
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.21",that he fell in love with a woman in the Wadi of Sorek/Vines;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.22",her name was Delila.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.23",5 The Philistine overlords went up to her and said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.24",Seduce him and see
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.25","whereby his might is so great,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.26","whereby we can overcome him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.27","so that we can bind him, to subdue him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.28","and we ourselves, each one, will give you a thousand and a hundred pieces of silver!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.29",6 Delila said to Shimshon:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.30","Pray tell me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.31","whereby is your might so great,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.32","whereby can you be bound, to subdue you?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.33",7 Shimshon said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.34","If they were to bind me with seven fresh gut-strings, that have not been dried,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.35","I’d become weak, I’d become like"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.36",any man!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.37","8 The Philistine overlords brought up to her seven fresh gut-strings, that had not been dried,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.38",and she bound him with them.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.39",9 Now the ambush was sitting for her in the inner-room.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.40",She said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.41","Philistines upon you, Shimshon!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.42",He snapped the strings
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.43","as hempen cord bursts when it smells fire,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.44",and his might was not made known.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.45",10 Delila said to Shimshon:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.46","Here, you’ve taunted me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.47",you’ve been speaking lies to me—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.48","but now, pray tell me:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.49",whereby can you be bound?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.50",11 He said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.51","If they were to bind, yes, bind me with new ropes,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.52","with which no work has been done,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.53","I’d become weak, I’d become like"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.54",any man!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.55",12 So Delila took new ropes
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.56","and bound him with them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.57",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.58","Philistines upon you, Shimshon!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.59",—Now the ambush was sitting in the inner-room.—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.60",He snapped them from off his arms like a thread.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.61",13 Delila said to Shimshon:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.62","Until now you’ve taunted me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.63",you’ve been speaking lies to me—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.64",tell me:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.65",whereby can you be bound?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.66",He said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.67",If you were to weave the seven locks of my head in a warp …
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.68","14 She drove them tight with the pin,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.69",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.70","Philistines upon you, Shimshon!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.71",He awoke from his sleep
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.72","and pulled out the pin, the weaver’s-bobbin, and the warp."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.73",15 Then she said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.74","How can you say: I love you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.75",when your heart is not with me?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.76","Three times now you’ve taunted me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.77",yet you haven’t told me
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.78",whereby your might is so great!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.79","16 And it was,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.80",when she had pressed him with her words all the time
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.81","and had prodded him, so that he became short-tempered to [the point of] death,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.82",17 that he told her all his heart;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.83",he said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.84","No razor has gone up on my head,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.85",for One Consecrated to God have I been from my mother’s womb on:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.86","if I were to be shaven,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.87",my might would leave me;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.88",__________
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.89",20 <b>He led Israel as judge:</b> See Commentary.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.90","16:1 <b>Gaza:</b> Heb. <i>’Azza,</i> another major Philistine city along the coast."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.91","2 <b>plotted:</b> Often read as “kept silent,” but the verb may be a homonym which is used several times in Proverbs."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.92","3 <b>lay … arose … :</b> Once again, the rush of verbs seems to indicate swift, almost breathless, action. <b>doors:</b> From archaeological indications of Iron Age gates, these must have been quite large. <b>brought them up … Hevron:</b> A distance of some forty miles, with a rise of close to three thousand feet!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.93","4 <b>Sorek:</b> A few miles south of Tzor’a. <b>Delila:</b> Pronounced <i>de-lee-LAH;</i> trad. English “Delilah.” Many meanings have been theorized for the name, including “vine” (alluding to Shimshon’s violation of his vows), “flirt” (Arabic), and “dangling curls” (Niditch 2008; the hair motif again). Most significant, in my view, is the name’s resemblance to Heb. <i>layla,</i> “night,” evocative of seduction and a fitting contrast to Shimshon’s name’s connection to “sun.”"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.94",5 <b>overlords:</b> See note to 3:3 above.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.95",6 <b>whereby:</b> What’s the cause (of your strength)?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.96","7 <b>gut-strings:</b> Bowstrings, which would be well-nigh impossible to break with bare hands. <b>I’d become weak, I’d become like:</b> Heb. <i>ve-haliti ve-hayyiti</i>, which feels like a deliberate rhyme. It recurs twice here, and suggests the rhythm of a folktale. The usual translation is “I will become as weak as any other man,” but that misses the style."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.97","9 <b>inner-room:</b> A place of concealment or intimacy, often descriptive of a bedroom."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.98","11 <b>new ropes:</b> In folklore, unused objects often have pristine, magical powers. Thus, animals described as “having not yet yielded to a yoke” are sometimes used in special rituals (Num. 19:2, I Sam. 6:7)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.99","13 <b>tell me:</b> Some manuscripts add the “pray” of vv.6 and 10. <b>head:</b> The allusion to Shimshon’s hair is a fine narrative strategy for getting us closer to the truth; Shimshon is clearly growing tired of this game and is ready to reveal all. <b>warp … :</b> Of a loom. The text appears to be defective, and is appropriately filled in by LXX, along the pattern of the previous trials. I have left it here as it appears in MT."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.100","14 <b>pulled out the pin … :</b> The same verb (<i>n-s-’</i>) was used to describe Shimshon’s “pulling up” the gates of Gaza in v.3, above."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.101",16 <b>short-tempered to [the point of] death:</b> Again foreshadowing the end. The idiom seems to indicate literal shortness of breath as an indicator of impatience.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:4–22.102",17 <b>all men:</b> Most translations from LXX on have “corrected” “all” to read “any” (<i>kol</i> to <i>ke-ahad</i>) as in the previous occurrences of the phrase. But the slight shift in wording here may give Delila a hint that Shimshon has cracked at last (see the double “<i>all</i> his heart” in the next verse).
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.1","Grand Finale: The stage is set for Shimshon’s last triumph, in a scene that is truly cinematic, with literally a cast of thousands. The sequence of humiliation and over-the-top revenge is an old favorite among audiences in many cultures; a modern example would be the classic cult film Carrie. Here, however, it is not totally unexpected, as we have been slipped a hint at the time of Shimshon’s capture and imprisonment that his hair is growing again (v.22). But he will have to invoke God once more in order to enable the deed to take place."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.2","The image of a man, however strong, pulling down an entire temple with his bare hands has typically been considered the ultimate fairy-tale element. But excavations at Tell Qasile in coastal Israel have unearthed a Philistine structure in which two wooden pillars served as major supports for the building—although not, to be sure, side by side. So we get to enjoy both the miraculous and a sense of the real world simultaneously."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.3","Similar to the end of Chap. 15, Shimshon’s feat at his death, while taking an enormous toll on the enemy and thus fulfilling his destiny, is ambiguously represented as a spectacular deed of personal vengeance. The hero’s plea to God in v.28 shows no recognition of any kind of leadership role, or indeed of any reality much beyond his various body parts. With the collapse of the Philistine temple, the core quest of Judges, Israel’s dreams of competent, covenant-based human leadership, ends up in a heap of ruins as well."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.4","I’d become weak, I’d become like"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.5",all men!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.6","18 Delila saw that he had told her all his heart,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.7","so she sent and called for the Philistine overlords, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.8","Come up this time,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.9",for he has told me all his heart!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.10","The Philistine overlords went up to her,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.11",and they brought up the silver in their hand.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.12","19 She lulled him to sleep upon her knees,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.13",and she called for a man and he shaved off the seven locks of his head;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.14","she began to subdue him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.15",and his might left him.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.16",20 Then she said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.17","Philistines upon you, Shimshon!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.18","He awoke from his sleep,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.19",and he said [to himself]:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.20","I’ll get away as time after time,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.21",I’ll shake myself free!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.22",But he did not know that Y<small>HWH</small> had left him.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.23",21 The Philistines grabbed him and gouged out his eyes;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.24","then they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with doublebronze,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.25",and he had to grind [grain] in the prison house.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.26","22 But the hair of his head began to sprout again, as soon as it had been shaven off."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.27",23 Now the Philistine overlords gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.28",and for [a feast of] rejoicing.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.29",They said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.30",Given has our god
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.31",into our hand
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.32",Shimshon our foe!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.33",24 The people saw him
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.34","and praised their god,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.35","indeed, they said:"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.40",who made many our slain!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.41","25 Now it was, since their heart was in good-humor,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.42",that they said:

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.44","They had Shimshon called out of the prison house,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.45",and he provided-amusement before them.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.46","They stood him between the standing-columns,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.47",26 and Shimshon said to the serving-lad who held him by the hand:

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.49","let me feel the columns on which the house is founded,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.50",so that I may support myself on them!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.51",27 Now the house was full of men and women;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.52","all the Philistine overlords were there,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.53",and upon the roof were about three thousand—man and woman—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.54",who were seeing Shimshon provide-amusement.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.55",28 And Shimshon called out to Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.56",he said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.57","My Lord, Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.58","now be mindful of me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.59","now strengthen me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.60",just this one time;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.61","O God,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.62","I would take revenge, a single revenge for my two eyes"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.63",from the Philistines!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.64",29 Shimshon clasped the two middle columns on which the house was founded;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.65","he put-his-weight on them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.66","one with his right [hand], and one with his left,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.67",30 and Shimshon said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.68",Let me die with the Philistines!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.69","He inclined with might,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.70","and the house fell down on the overlords,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.71",on all the people who were in it.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.72",Now the dead whose death he caused at his death
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.73",were more than those whose death he had caused in his life.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.74","31 His brothers and all his Father’s House went down,"

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.86","30 <b>me:</b> Lit. “my (very) being.” Others, “soul.” In biblical Hebrew, <i>nefesh</i> almost always means “life” or “life force,” or “breathing/swallowing organs,” and not “soul” in the later sense of an entity distinct from the body. <b>with might:</b> Mentioned so often earlier in the chapter, Shimshon’s strength now returns full bore. <b>Now the dead … :</b> The multiple repetition of the root <i>m-w-t</i> (“dead, death”) highlights the importance of this statement, summarizing Shimshon’s militarily effective career."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 16:23–31.87",31 <b>between Tzor’a and Eshtaol:</b> The mention of the place names with which the story began provides a classic aural signal that the story has come to an end.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.1","Mikha and the Levite: The final section of Judges begins with a brand- new story (“There was a man …”). A family crime, a son’s theft of a large sum of money from his mother, leads ultimately to another one, idolatry, with implications for all Israel. The text demonstrates not only the defective leadership we have traced over the past chapters, but a systemic religious decline that will be confirmed in subsequent chapters. Mikha gives living proof of the refrain that will resound so often throughout this final section—“each one would do what was right in his eyes”—by making an idol and appointing a Levite as his own personal priest."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.2","In the absence of any kind of effective leadership, the text presents us with three characters of dubious distinction: a thieving son, a parsimonious and idolatrous mother, and a wandering young Levite who is all too happy to serve as a priest in an idol-worshipping household. The text itself, however, applies no adjectives to them; they are known only through their actions (Schneider)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.3","The story’s vocabulary, especially as the Levite is hired, is consistent: “Levite” six times, “sojourn” twice, and “lad” three times. And, lest it seem jarring after so many stories about military leaders, it contains at least several links to the Shimshon cycle: an active mother, the phrase “right in his/their own eyes,” and a sum of money identical to what was promised to Delila by the Philistines."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.4",17:1 There was a man from the highlands of Efrayim;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.5",his name was Mikhayehu.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.6",2 [Once] he said to his mother:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.7","The thousand and a hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.8","and you yourself put an oath-curse [on it], and even said it in my hearing—"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.9","here, the silver is with me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.10",I myself took it!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.11",His mother said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.12",Blessed is my son of Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.13",3 He has returned the thousand and a hundred pieces of silver to his mother!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.14",And his mother said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.15","I render the silver holy, yes, holy to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.16","from my hand, for my son,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.17",to make a carved and molten [idol].
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.18","So-now, I return it to you."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.19","4 He returned the silver to his mother,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.20",and his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave it to a smelter;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.21","he made it into a carved and molten [idol],"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.22",and it remained in the house of Mikhayehu.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.23",5 Now the man Mikha had a house of God;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.24",he had made an <i>efod</i> and <i>terafim</i>
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.25","and had given-mandate to one of his sons, so that he had become a priest for him."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.26",__________
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.27",17:1 <b>Mikhayehu:</b> Pronounced <i>mee-KHA-y’hu;</i> trad. English “Micaiah.” It means “Who Is Like Y<small>HWH</small>?” (ironic in a story about idolatry) and is sometimes shortened to “Mikha” in the narrative that follows. A more familiar variation of the name is “Mikhael” (Michael).
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.28","2 <b>thousand and a hundred:</b> A sum identical to the reward promised to Delila in the previous chapter, leading some commentators to identify the mother here with that more famous lady. Or it may simply have a connecting function, enabling the editor(s) to juxtapose the two stories (and note too the reappearance in vv.8 and 11 of the place-names cited previously in 13:25 and 16:31). <b>oath-curse:</b> Invoked when human punishment cannot be brought to bear (Gray 1986). In this story it makes Mikhayehu’s nonpayment to his mother an occasion for divine punishment. <b>Blessed is my son:</b> She effectively removes the curse (JPS note)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.29",3 <b>for my son:</b> Heb. <i>li-vni;</i> LXX reads “alone” (<i>levaddi</i>). <b>a carved and molten</b> [<b>idol</b>]: The figure would be made from molten metal poured into a mold carved in the desired shape. This emphatically violates the Israelites’ covenant with Y<small>HWH</small> (see Exod. 20:2). <b>to you:</b> To God.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.30",4 <b>two hundred pieces:</b> What did she do with the other nine hundred? Is this a hint of misappropriation or of stinginess?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 17.31","5 <b>house of God:</b> Some read as “house of gods,” which the Hebrew allows; most translations simply use “shrine.” <b><i>efod:</i></b> See note to 8:27 above. <i>terafim:</i> usually understood as household idols or figurines; see Gen. 31:19ff. <b>given-mandate:</b> Lit. “filled the hand,” installing him as a priest. <b>one of his sons:</b> Since he was not a Levite, this is quite illegal (Amit 2004)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.1","The Danite Migration and Its Consequences: What in several scholars’ estimation is the original end of the book of Judges is a mixture of a small-scale story (continued from the previous chapter) and a larger event rooted in some kind of historical memory, the northward migration of the tribe of Dan. But those elements have been transformed into an ideological text, the main purpose of which seems to be (as Brettler 2001a emphasizes; see above) to condemn the future northern rebellion during the reign of King Rehav’am (Rehoboam) some centuries later. The need to convey such a message is so strong that it does not seem to matter to the editors that the migration, chronologically speaking, should really have appeared much earlier in the book."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.2","The Danites are portrayed here as cruel, thieving, and idolatrous—they destroy a peaceful and “secure” city, echoing the destruction of Shekhem in Gen. 34, they steal Mikha’s personal idols and his priest, and they keep the idols and the priest not just for the moment but permanently (“until the time of the exile of the land,” v.30). Three times, in vv.11, 16, and 17, they are menacingly described as “girded in battle gear.” As the book began with conquest, so this initial transitional section ends as well, along with a ringing condemnation of the north for practices that in II Kings 17 will lead to the permanent end of the kingdom."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.3","This negativity is borne out by vocabulary in the middle of the chapter (vv.14–24) which concentrates on words connected to idolatry: “carved-image,” “gods,” <i>“efod”</i> (see 8:27), “<i>terafim</i>,” and “molten-image.” To top it all off, a scribe has even sneaked into a story about the north the name of the most hated king in southern (Judean) history, by substituting the name “Menashe” (Manasseh; see II Kings 18) for “Moshe” (Moses) in v.30, in what is outwardly an attempt to disassociate the great lawgiver’s family from any connection to later idolatrous events."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.4","6 In those days, there was no king in Israel;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.5",each one would do what was right in his eyes.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.6","7 There was a lad from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda, from a clan of Yehuda"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.7","—now he was a Levite, and he was sojourning there."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.8","8 And the man went from the town, from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda to sojourn wherever he could find,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.9","and he came to the highlands of Efrayim, to the house of Mikha, to make his way."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.10",9 Mikha said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.11",From where have you come?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.12",He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.13","I am a Levite,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.14","from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.15",and I am going to sojourn wherever I can find.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.16",10 Mikha said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.17","Come stay with me, and be for me a “father” and a priest,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.18","and I myself will give you ten pieces of silver a year, an outfit of garments, and your living needs."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.19",So the Levite went;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.20","11 the Levite agreed to settle with the man,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.21",and the lad became for him like one of his sons.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.22","12 Mikha gave-mandate to the Levite,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.23",and the lad became a priest for him
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.24",and remained in Mikha’s house.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.25",13 Mikha said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.26",Now I know
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.27","that Y<small>HWH</small> will do good for me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.28",for a Levite has become a priest for me!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.29","18:1 In those days, there was no king in Israel."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.30","And in those days, the Danite tribe was seeking for itself a hereditary-property to settle in,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.31",for there had not fallen [any land] to it until that day among the tribes of Israel as a hereditary-property.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.32","2 So the Children of Dan sent from their clan five men from [all] their quarters, valiant men from Tzor’a and from Eshtaol,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.33",to spy out the region and to explore it.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.34",They said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.35","Go, explore the region!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.36","So they came to the highlands of Efrayim, to the house of Mikha,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.37",that they might spend the night there.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.38",3 They were near the house of Mikha
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.39","when they recognized the voice of the Levite lad,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.40",so they turned aside there and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.41",Who brought you here?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.42",And what are you doing in this [place]? And what [business] do you have here?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.43",4 He said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.44",Like this and like that has Mikha done for me;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.45","he has hired me, and so I have become a priest for him."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.46",5 They said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.47","Pray inquire of God,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.48","that we may know whether it will succeed, our way on which we are going."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.49",6 The priest said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.50",Go in peace—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.51",straight before Y<small>HWH</small> is your way on which you are going!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.52","7 So the five men went and came to Layish,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.53","and they saw the men who were in its midst, settled in security in the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.54",with no one humiliating anyone in the region [or] barring an heir;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.55","they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.56","8 They came back to their brothers in Tzor’a and Eshtaol,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.57",and their brothers said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.58",What do you [think]?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.59",9 They said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.60","Arise and let us go up against them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.61","for we have seen the region, and here, it is exceedingly good."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.62",But you are silent—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.63","do not be sluggish to go, to enter and take possession of the region!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.64","10 When you come [there], you will be coming to a people feeling-secure,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.65",while the region is as broad as [outstretched] hands;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.66","indeed, God will give it into your hands,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.67",a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the region.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.68","11 So they marched from there, from the Danite clan, from Tzor’a and from Eshtaol,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.69","six hundred men, girded in battle gear,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.70","12 and they went up and encamped at Kiryat-Ye’arim, in Yehuda"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.71","—therefore they called that place Camp of Dan, until this day;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.72","here, it is behind Kiryat-Ye’arim."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.73",13 They crossed through the highlands of Efrayim from there
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.74",and came as far as the house of Mikha;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.75","14 then the five men spoke up, the ones going to spy out the region of Layish,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.76",and said to their brothers:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.77","Do you know that there are in these houses an <i>efod</i> and <i>terafim,</i>"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.78",and a carved and molten [idol]?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.79","Now, know what you must do!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.80","15 So they turned aside there and came to the house of the Levite lad, the house of Mikha,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.81",and inquired after his welfare.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.82","16 Now six hundred men girded in battle gear were standing at the entrance to the gate, the ones from the Children of Dan,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.83",17 while the five men going to spy out the region went up and they came there
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.84","[and] took the carved-image, the <i>efod,</i> the <i>terafim,</i> and the molten-image,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.85","while the priest was standing at the entrance to the gate,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.86",along with the six hundred men girded in battle gear.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.87","18 When these came to the house of Mikha and took the carved <i>efod,</i> the <i>terafim,</i> and the molten-image,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.88",the priest said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.89",What are you doing?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.90",19 They said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.91",Be still!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.92","Put your hand over your mouth, and go with us,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.93",and become a “father” and a priest for us!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.94","Is it better, your being a priest for the house of one man,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.95",or your being a priest for a tribe and a clan in Israel?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.96","20 The heart of the priest was disposed-for-good,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.97","so he took the <i>efod,</i> the <i>terafim,</i> and the carved-image, and came amid the fighting-people;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.98","21 they faced about and went off,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.99",and put the families and the livestock and the weighty-wealth in front of them.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.100",22 They had gone far from the house of Mikha
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.101",when the men who were in the houses that were near Mikha’s house mustered themselves and caught up with the Children of Dan;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.102","23 they called out to the Children of Dan, and they turned their faces and said to Mikha:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.103","What [ails] you, that you have mustered yourself?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.104",24 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.105","My gods that I made, you have taken, along with the priest, and you have gone off!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.106",What do I have anymore?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.107","So why, now, do you say to me: What [ails] you?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.108",25 The Children of Dan said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.109","Don’t make your voice heard among us,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.110",lest men of bitter feelings attack you
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.111",and you have to lose your life-breath and the life-breath of your household!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.112",26 So the Children of Dan went on their way;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.113","and Mikha saw that they were stronger than he,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.114",so he faced about and returned to his house.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.115","27 Now they took what Mikha had made and the priest that he had,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.116","and came against Layish,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.117","against a people quiet and secure,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.118","and struck them with the mouth of the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.119",while the town they burned with fire.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.120","28 Now there was no rescuer, for it was far from Sidon,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.121",and they had no dealings with anyone;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.122",it was in the valley that belongs to Bet-Rehov.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.123","They rebuilt the town and settled in it,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.124","29 and they called the name of the town Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestral-father, who had been born to Yisrael;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.125","however, Layish was the name of the town in former times."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 18.126","30 And the Children of Dan erected the carved-image for themselves,"

But the phrase probably indicates the destruction of the Northern Kingdom, Israel, in 722 <small>B.C.E.</small>, and thus is yet another condemnation of the north in these texts."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.1","The Nightmare at Giv’a: This notorious narrative, surely the most horrific nonmilitary story in the Hebrew Bible, launches the final three-chapter section of Judges. As we indicated above, it appears to be motivated by two factors: a desire to (1) demonstrate the sorry state of Israel’s polity in that era and (2) establish a link with the later House of Sha’ul (Saul), implying its own moral bankruptcy. Several editorial devices are used to connect this section to the previous one: first, the appearance of another Levite, whose character proves to be even worse than that of his predecessor. Yee sees these chapters as a polemic against “country Levites,” continuing the trend begun in Chap. 17. We will shortly encounter more corrupt priests, Eli’s sons, in I Sam. 2. A second possible link lies in the image of the nobles at the door, reminiscent of the six hundred Danites in the previous chapter, whose ominous presence at the town gate led to the appropriation of Mikha’s idols."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.2","In order to portray moral decay, the chapter patterns itself after the Lot story of Gen. 19, but goes well beyond that narrative, which itself had a chilling outcome: the destruction of the cities of Sedom and Amora (Sodom and Gomorrah). Whereas in the earlier story the host also offered to surrender his women, here (v.24) he goes so far as to suggest rape (“force them or do to them whatever is good in your eyes”; the first two words are an addition to what appeared in Genesis), and the Levite actually pushes his concubine out the door. That, and the absence of protecting angels, would be enough to differentiate these two texts, but the telling detail is neither the comportment of the natives nor of the host, but rather the callous and self-centered behavior of the Levite himself. Despite his quest to get his concubine back at the beginning of the chapter, once he arrives at his father-in-law’s house he rarely acknowledges her existence; he is contemptuous of foreigners, and so declines to stay in Yevus for the night; he is complicit in the rape by pushing his concubine outside; and he never bothers to check if the violated body on the threshold is dead or alive. In contrast to the text’s mention of “refresh/humor the heart” multiple times in describing his father-in-law’s and his later host’s hospitality, the Levite is a man virtually without a heart. In the end we are left with a descendant of Aharon (Aaron) who, in a parody of priestly sacrificial behavior, “sections” (see Lev. 1:6) the abused woman whose bed he shared."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.3","Klein notes that the Levite is anonymous and comes from the outlying area of his region. In addition, neither he nor the concubine’s father calls her to task for her sexual straying, unusual behavior for biblical males. And the purported host, who has seemed generous until now, and who is the Levite’s countryman, commits the unforgivable act of offering not only his daughters but also the Levite’s concubine to the mob."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.4","In the end, the deeds done to the concubine are so vile that the writer feels compelled to break into a poetic rhetoric: “Never has there been, / never has been seen [anything]” like this act in all of Israelite history (v.30). It signals the collapse of societal standards, violating at one swoop the rules of hospitality and the proper sexual treatment of both men and women. Such a low point may be subtly hinted at by the description of the hours in vv.9–11: the day is “weakening,” “declining,” and “low,” a fitting characterization of Israel as well. But it is the dismembering of the concubine that ultimately suggests what has happened to Israel. The book of Samuel too will be replete with examples of bodily harm, and its accumulated tally of stricken body parts will also point to an unhealthy society (see the Introduction to Samuel later in this volume)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.5","Perry tellingly notes that the narrative here embodies something further, which continues into the subsequent two chapters: the rejection of male warrior-based ideology. In his words, “God tries to teach the callous male union the hard way, at the expense of forty thousand dead, to hesitate, to be remorseful, to weep and have brotherly feelings toward the ‘enemy,’ to ‘play the woman’ (20:19–28).” The rare unification of the tribes takes place through gang rape and subsequent dismemberment."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.6","Finally, as hinted at previously, attributing such behavior to the tribe of Binyamin, at the town of Giv’a, clearly implicates Sha’ul by association in the future. In addition, Israel’s first king begins his career by cutting up a brace of oxen and sending them all around the tribes, in order to rally them to battle. It is almost as if the subliminal message of the text is “In those days there was no king in Israel (17:6, 18:1, 19:1, 21:25), and Saul wouldn’t be much better either!” (Brettler 2001a)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.7","31 they set up for themselves the carved-image of Mikha which he had made, all the days that the house of God was at Shilo."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.8","19:1 Now it was in those days,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.9",when king there was none in Israel:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.10","there was a Levite man, sojourning on the flanks of the highlands of Efrayim."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.11","He took himself a concubine woman, from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.12",2 But his concubine whored against him;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.13","she went from him to her father’s house, to Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.14",and she remained there for a period of four months.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.15","3 And her husband arose and went after her,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.16","to speak to her heart, to have her return"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.17","—his serving-lad was with him, along with a brace of donkeys."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.18","She brought him into her father’s house,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.19","and when the girl’s father saw him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.20",he rejoiced meeting him;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.21","4 his father-in-law, the girl’s father, prevailed upon him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.22","so that he stayed with him for three days,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.23",and they ate and drank and spent the night there.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.24",5 Now it was on the fourth day
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.25","that they started-early in the morning, and arose to go,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.26",but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.27",Refresh your heart with a bit of bread;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.28",afterward you may go!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.29","6 So they stayed and ate, the two of them together, and they drank."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.30",And the girl’s father said to the man:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.31","Now consent to spend the night, so that your heart may be in good-humor!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.32","7 The man arose to go,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.33","but his father-in-law pressed him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.34",so that [once] again he spent the night there.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.35","8 He started early on the morning of the fifth day to go,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.36",but the girl’s father said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.37",Now refresh your heart
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.38",and tarry until the lengthening of the day!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.39",So the two of them ate.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.40","9 Then the man arose to go, he and his concubine and his serving-lad,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.41","but his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.42","Here now, the day is weakening toward sunset;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.43","now spend the night,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.44","[for] here, the day is declining!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.45","Spend the night here, so that your heart may be in good-humor;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.46","you may start early on the morrow on your way, so that you may go back to your tent."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.47",10 But the man would not spend the night;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.48","he arose and went and arrived at [a place] in front of Yevus—that is Jerusalem—and with him was a brace of loaded donkeys,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.49",and his concubine was with him.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.50","11 They were near Yevus, and the day was exceedingly low,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.51",so the serving-lad said to his lord:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.52","Come now, let us turn aside to this Yevusite town and spend the night in it!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.53",12 But his lord said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.54",We will not turn aside to a foreign town
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.55",in which none of the Children of Israel are here;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.56",we will cross over as far as Giv’a.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.57",13 And he said to his serving-lad:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.58","Come, let us go near one of the places"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.59",and spend the night in Giv’a or in Rama.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.60","14 So they crossed over and went,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.61","and the sun came in on them alongside Giv’a, which belongs to Binyamin."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.62","15 They turned aside there, to come in to spend the night in Giv’a,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.63","and they came and sat in the town square,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.64",but no one was gathering them into the house to spend the night.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.65","16 Now here, an old man came in from his work, from the fields, at sunset"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.66","—the man was from the highlands of Efrayim, and he was sojourning in Giv’a,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.67",while the men of the place were Binyaminites—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.68","17 and he lifted up his eyes and saw the man, the wayfarer, in the town square;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.69",the old man said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.70","Where are you going, and from where do you come?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.71",18 He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.72",We are crossing from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda as far as the flanks of the highlands of Efrayim
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.73",—I am from there;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.74","I went to Bet-Lehem in Yehuda,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.75","and to my house I am going back,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.76",but no one will gather me into the house!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.77","19 Yes, there is straw, yes, fodder for our donkeys, and yes, there are bread and wine for me and for your handmaid and for the serving-lad with your servants;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.78",there is no lack of anything.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.79",20 The old man said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.80",Peace be to you!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.81","Surely whatever you lack shall be on me,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.82",for sure do not spend the night in the square!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.83",21 He brought him into his house
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.84",and provided for the donkeys;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.85",they washed their feet
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.86",and ate and drank.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.87",22 They were putting their hearts in good-humor
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.88","when here, the men of the city, base men, encircled the house;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.89",they kept on beating against the door
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.90","and said to the man, the old house owner, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.91",Bring out the man who came into your house—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.92",we want to know him!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.93","23 But the man, the house owner, went out to them and said to them:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.94","No, my brothers! Do not do evil, now!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.95","Since this man came into my house,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.96",do not do this vile thing!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.97",24 Here are my nubile daughter and his concubine;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.98","now let me bring them out—force them or do to them whatever is good in your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.99","but to this man, do not do this vile thing!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.100","25 But the men would not hearken to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.101","so the man took hold of his concubine and pushed [her] out to them, outside,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.102","and they knew her and abused her all night, until daybreak;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.103",then they sent her away when the dawn came up.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.104",26 The woman came back toward daybreak
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.105","and fell down at the entrance of the house of the man where her lord was,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.106",until [it was] light.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.107",27 Her lord arose at daybreak;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 19.108",he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way—

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.1","Civil War: For once, Israel acts as a body (vv.1 and 11, “as one man”), but it is a unity born out of outrage and results in a near genocide. The narrative gathers steam from the Levite’s speech to the assembled men, and goes on to describe first the Israelites’ mustering and then that of the Binyaminites. The battle sequence is a long one, involving two successive defeats for the Israelites, who twice are also reduced to tears, just as at the beginning of the book (2:4). The third, and finally successful, attempt recalls the conquest of Ai in Josh. 8, both in the ambush tactics and in the initial delay. Since the victory in Joshua follows a major breach of faith (the Akhan story of Chap. 7), our text here might be suggesting that Israel needs to acknowledge God before they can proceed. The vocabulary of the chapter, which uses “turn around” twice and “face about” three times, literally reflects the turnaround in the events. As for the Binyaminites, whose reputation in war is cited a number of times in the Bible (see, for instance, Gen. 49:27), they might be seen as counterbalancing Chap. 3’s Ehud, another and more successful left-handed warrior."

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.103",29 So Israel set ambushes against Giv’a all around.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.104","30 And the Children of Israel went up against the Children of Binyamin on the third day,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.105",and arranged-ranks against Giv’a as time and time [before];
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.106","31 and when the Children of Binyamin went out to meet the fighting-people,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.107",they were torn away from the town
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.108","and began to strike down some of the people, [leaving] slain as time and time [before] on the highways"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.109","—of which one goes up to Bet-El and one to Giv’a, in the open-country—"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.110",about thirty men in Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.111",32 The Children of Binyamin said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.112","They are beaten before us, as at the beginning!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.113",But the Children of Israel said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.114","Let us flee and tear them away from the town, onto the highways!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.115",33 Now when all the fighting-men of Israel had risen from their place
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.116","and had arranged-ranks at Baal Tamar,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.117","the ambush of Israel burst forth from its place, from the Giv’a Cave,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.118","34 while from opposite Giv’a came ten thousand men, chosen ones from all Israel."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.119","Now the battle was heavy,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.120",but they did not know that evil-fortune was [already] reaching them.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.121","35 So Y<small>HWH</small> defeated Binyamin before Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.122",and the Children of Israel brought to ruin among the Children of Binyamin on that day
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.123","twenty-five thousand and a hundred men,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 20.124",all of these drawing the sword.

"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.1","The Replenishing of Binyamin: Using the Wild West analogy I drew in the Introduction to Judges, a possible subtitle to this chapter might be “700 Brides for 700 Brothers.” According to one view, Judges ends, appropriately, in a state of confusion. In short order, the text has moved from the gang rape of one woman to the near extermination of a tribe, and on to the abduction of hundreds of women. The nation, such as it is, has been saved, but at the cost of massive violence of several kinds. Fathers and husbands are unable to give women even the most basic protection (Schneider). Thus the dismembered concubine remains as a symbol of Israel’s body politic, an observation borne out by the final two verses of the chapter, in which we hear the Hebrew word/English phrase “each [one]” (as opposed to the group) three times."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.2","While on the surface Israel is made whole again (see Niditch 2008 for this positive view on the tone of the chapter), we know that this cannot possibly last. The two subsequent books, Samuel and Kings, will portray an Israel that is irrevocably split, with the contentious tribe of Binyamin containing Jerusalem at the center of the land."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.3","The chapter’s links to future texts are major geographical ones. The Yavesh-Gil’ad of v.9 is the town that appeals to Israel for help in I Sam. 11 and is rescued by Sha’ul, while Shilo (v.12) will be the site of events in the very next chapter (I Sam. 1). The appearance of Shilo also functions as a preparation for the “questionable events” that occur with Eli’s sons (Amit 1999a)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.4","Amit also notes the bracketing effect of this chapter: both here and in Chap. 2, Yevus (Jerusalem) is mentioned, along with weeping and sacrifices, and “each [one] to his hereditary-property” (2:6 and 21:25). She attributes this to the final editor’s desire to smooth over the rough edges created by the interpolation of Chaps. 17–21."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.5","36 The Children of Binyamin saw that they were defeated,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.6","and the fighting-men of Israel gave ground to Binyamin,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.7",for they were secure regarding the ambush that they had set at Giv’a.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.8","37 Now the ambush they hurried along and spread out against Giv’a,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.9",and the ambush drew out
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.10",and struck the entire city with the mouth of the sword.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.11",38 Now the arrangement for the men of Israel with the ambush had been
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.12",to send up a rising-mass of smoke from the city;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.13",39 then the men of Israel were to turn around in battle.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.14","And Binyamin had begun to strike, [leaving] slain among Israel about thirty men;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.15","indeed, they said:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.16","Surely, he is defeated, yes, defeated before us, as in the beginning battle!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.17",40 But the rising-mass began to go up from the town—a column of smoke;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.18",Binyamin faced about behind him
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.19","and here, the whole of the town went up [in smoke] to the heavens!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.20","41 The men of Israel turned around,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.21","and the men of Binyamin were terrified,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.22",for they saw that evil-fortune was reaching them.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.23","42 So they faced about before the men of Israel toward the way of the wilderness,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.24",but the battle caught up with them;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.25","whoever was from the town, they brought him to ruin in its midst:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.26",43 they encircled Binyamin and they pursued him
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.27",—to Menuha they forced him along—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.28","up to [a spot] opposite Giv’a, toward the rising of the sun."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.29","44 And there fell of Binyamin eighteen thousand men,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.30","all these, men of valor."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.31","45 They faced about and fled to the wilderness, to the Rimmon Crag,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.32","but they picked them off on the highways,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.33",five thousand men;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.34","they caught up with them as far as Gid’om/Hewing Them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.35",and struck down from them two thousand men.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.36","46 And all those who fell from Binyamin were twenty-five thousand men drawing the sword on that day,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.37","all these, men of valor."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.38","47 They faced about and fled to the wilderness, to the Rimmon Crag: six hundred men,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.39",and they stayed at the Rimmon Crag for four months.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.40","48 Now the men of Israel returned to the Children of Binyamin and struck them with the mouth of the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.41","from the men of the town to the cattle and to all that was found,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.42",and also all the towns that were found they sent up in fire.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.43","21:1 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mitzpa, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.44",Let no man among us give his daughter to Binyamin as a wife!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.45","2 And the fighting-people came to Bet-El,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.46","and sat there until sunset, in the presence of God;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.47","they lifted up their voices and wept, a great weeping,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.48",3 and they said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.49","Why, O Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel, did this happen in Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.50",for one tribe to be accounted [missing] today from Israel?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.51",4 So it was on the morrow that the people started early
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.52","and built a sacrificial-altar there,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.53",and they offered up offerings-up and <i>shalom</i>-offerings.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.54",5 And the Children of Israel said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.55",Who is it that did not go up among the assembly from all the tribes of Israel to Y<small>HWH</small>?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.56","For the great sworn-oath was against anyone who did not go up to Y<small>HWH</small> at Mitzpa, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.57","He shall be put to death, yes, death!"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.58",6 And the Children of Israel felt regret toward Binyamin their brother;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.59",they said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.60",Hewn off today is one tribe from Israel!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.61","7 What can we do for them, for those left, regarding wives?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.62",For we ourselves have sworn by Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.63",not to give them any of our daughters as wives!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.64",8 And they said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.65",Which is the one from the tribes of Israel that did not go up to Y<small>HWH</small> at Mitzpa?
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.66","Now here, not a man had come to the camp from Yavesh-Gil’ad, to the assembly."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.67","9 The people were counted,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.68","and here, there was not a man there from the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.69","10 So the community sent there twelve thousand men of the valiant ones,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.70","and they charged them, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.71","Go and strike down the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad with the mouth of the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.72",along with the women and the little-ones!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.73",11 And this is the thing that you are to do:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.74","every male, and every woman [who] has known lying with a male, you are to devote-to-destruction."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.75",12 They found among the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad four hundred nubile girls
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.76","who had not known a man by lying with a male,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.77","and they brought them to the camp at Shilo, which is in the land of Canaan."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.78",13 And the entire community sent
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.79",and spoke to the Children of Binyamin who were at Rimmon Crag;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.80",they called out to them: Peace!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.81","14 So the Children of Binyamin returned at that time,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.82",and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive among the women of Yavesh-Gil’ad;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.83",but they did not find enough for them thus.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.84","15 Now the people had felt regret toward Binyamin,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.85","since Y<small>HWH</small> had made a breach among the tribes of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.86",16 so the elders of the community said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.87","What are we to do with those left, for wives?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.88",—for [the] women were wiped out from Binyamin!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.89",17 They said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.90","[There must be] a surviving possession for Binyamin,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.91",so that a tribe in Israel not be wiped out!
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.92","18 Now as for us, we are not able to give them wives from our daughters,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.93","—for the Children of Israel had sworn, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.94",Doomed be the one giving a wife to Binyamin!—
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.95",19 so they said:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.96","Here, there is the pilgrimage-festival of Y<small>HWH</small> at Shilo—year after year—"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.97","that is north of Bet-El, toward the rising of the sun from the highway that goes up from Bet-El to Shekhem, and south of Levona."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.98","20 So they charged the Children of Binyamin, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.99","Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.100","21 and see: here, if the daughters of Shilo go out to dance in the dances,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.101",you are to go out from the vineyards
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.102","and are to catch for yourselves, each one, his wife from the daughters of Shilo;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.103",then you may go back to the land of Binyamin.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.104","22 So it will be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.105",that we will say to them:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.106","Be gracious to them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.107","for haven’t we taken, each one, his wife in battle?"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.108","For if you yourselves had given [them] to them,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.109",[then] at that time you would have incurred-guilt.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.110",23 So the Children of Binyamin did thus:
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.111",they took up wives according to their number
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.112",from the dancers whom they kidnapped;
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.113",then they went and returned to their hereditary-property
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.114","and rebuilt the towns, and settled in them."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.115","24 And the Children of Israel went off from there at that time,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.116","each one to his tribe and to his clan,"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.117",and each one went out from there to his hereditary-property.
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.118","25 In those days, there was no king in Israel;"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, 21.119",each one would do what was right in his eyes.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.1","The Birth of Shemuel: “There was a man,” the folktale-type wording with which Samuel opens, immediately establishes continuity with the book of Judges, as it was the same phrase that introduced several stories there (Chaps. 13, 17, and 19). But here it is a woman, Hanna, who will be the central character. As was the case with Sara, Rivka, and Rahel in Genesis, as well as with Shimshon’s mother in Judges, her barrenness is a signal of something momentous to come. Yet the text takes its time, painting an intimate picture of a family and dwelling in detail on personalities in a way that sets the tone for the character-driven book of Samuel. Here are vivid portraits of a tender but clueless husband, an insensitive priest, and, above all, a woman whose desire for a child is so intense that she is willing to surrender him to the service of God well before he has grown up. This pattern of wish, fulfillment, and partial loss is also emblematic of the experience that Israel will have in the coming narratives, beginning with a new monarchy, political splendor, and military victory in Samuel but ending with the near snuffing out of the Davidic dynasty at the end of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.2","It may seem surprising that this book, which is so much about male leadership, begins by focusing on a woman. But as I suggested previously, throughout both Judges and Samuel, the characterization of women often helps to clarify issues of leadership. Additionally, Hanna’s experiences and her voice set the personal tone through which these issues will be subsequently played out. And once again, a classic biblical pattern appears, as a person or type from whom we might not expect success—here a barren wife, elsewhere a younger brother—comes to prevail in the end."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.3","The way in which Eli the priest is portrayed is also worthy of comment. While his heart seems to be in the right place, his failure to distinguish in this opening chapter between the true prayer of the heart and drunken babbling is already a sign of inner shortcomings. As the story progresses, we will note his failure as father and leader (the narrator equates the two), culminating in his literal blindness and his dramatic death."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.4","The key word in this chapter is “request,” which occurs seven times; it will return, doubled, in 2:20, to round out the story. Many scholars have taken this to mean that the book originally began with material about the birth of Sha’ul, the “requested one,” and that something has been confused in the editing process. Others, myself included, note in the final text a deliberate and profound connection between the two men (see the discussion in Garsiel 1985). In addition, Hanna’s request for a son foreshadows Israel’s request for a king seven chapters hence (Polzin 1989)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.5","1:1 Now there was a man from Ramatayim in Tzofim, from the highlands of Efrayim;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.6","his name was Elkana son of Yeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Tzuf, an Efrayimite."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.7",2 He had two wives:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.8","the name of one was Hanna/Grace, while the name of the second was Peninna/Pearl;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.9","now Peninna had children, but Hanna had no children."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.10","3 And that man used to go up from his town, from year to year,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.46","1:1 <b>Ramatayim:</b> Possibly Rama (“Height”), a location frequently associated with Shemuel in the text; it was north of Jerusalem, near the border of what became Israel, the Northern Kingdom. <b>Tzofim:</b> “Watchmen,” but McCarter (1980), following Driver, judges the text corrupt here, and posits “a Tzufite,” after Elkana’s ancestor later in the verse, <b>the highlands of Efrayim:</b> The geographical backbone of what became the Northern Kingdom. <b>Elkana:</b> The name means “God Acquires/Creates.” His son Shemuel will not grow up with his parents, perhaps hinted at here."

Here it is printed according to the way it appears in the Hebrew text, and the reader may choose how to say it (for example, “The Eternal” or <i>“Ado-nai</i>”). Y<small>HWH</small> <b>of the Forces-On-High:</b> In <i>The Early Prophets</i> this title has a military ring; <i>tzeva’ot</i> may also refer to the concept of a heavenly council of gods from earlier mythological traditions. <b>Shilo:</b> Pronounced <i>shee-LO;</i> trad. English “Shiloh,” one of the important pre-Jerusalem shrines, situated in the highlands of Efrayim. <b>Hofni … Pin’has:</b> Pronounced <i>hof-NEE</i> and <i>pin-HASS.</i> Like a number of early Israelite priestly names, these are Egyptian in origin. Pin’has is trad. English “Phineas” and means “dark-skinned.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.49","7 <b>… and she wept … :</b> The narrative picks up from v.4, on a day that Elkana was offering sacrifices; everything in between is the background to Hanna’s weeping."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.50","8 <b>better … than ten sons:</b> As Alter (1999) points out, Elkana’s question is both empathetic and off the mark; how could he understand a barren mother’s feelings?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.51","9 <b>Eli:</b> Pronounced <i>ay-LEE.</i> <b>throne:</b> Unlike in modern usage, Heb. <i>kissei</i> tends to mean more than a simple “chair” in the Bible. <b>great-hall:</b> Used here to denote the sanctuary."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.52","11 <b>see:</b> The preposition used with the Hebrew verb adds an element of feeling, connoting “look sympathetically.” <b>your maidservant:</b> Referring to oneself in the third person is used in the Bible when one addresses a superior. <b>I will give him to Y<small>HWH</small> … no razor:</b> Hanna here alludes to the Nazirite laws of Num. 6, where in fulfillment of a religious vow, a person would not shave (there are additional provisions and prohibitions). Shemuel, like Shimshon (Judg. 13–16) before him, appears to be Nazirite for life, a concept not found in the Numbers text."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.53",12 <b>in the presence of</b> Y<small>HWH</small>: This phrase usually indicates a sacred location or building.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1.54","13 <b>took her for a drunkard:</b> Praying, as well as reading and writing, was not a silent activity in the ancient world, hence Eli’s mistaken assessment of Hanna."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.1","The Song of Hanna; Eli and His Sons: Hanna’s prayer occurs earlier in Samuel than any other poem in a biblical narrative book. As mentioned above, it introduces the idea that God may reverse the expected course of events. It thus carries the repetition of an oft-rehearsed biblical theme which undoubtedly points to the people of Israel itself, in its status as a latecomer and a frequently subordinate group in the ancient Near East."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.2","Not surprisingly, the poem is shot through with vocabulary reflecting both ends of the social spectrum. “Mighty … sated … rich … noble … might” alternate with “those who stumble … those once hungry … the barren one … the needy … the destitute,” and the like. The line “The barren one has given birth to seven” (v.5) is perhaps the immediate reason for its having been chosen for the mouth of the previously childless Hanna; such verbal connections between texts, which often hinge on a single word or phrase, are fairly typical in ancient literature. But above all, it is the triumphant ending on a monarchical note, with the exalting of God’s “anointed,” that not so subtly indicates what we are reading: a book about the choosing of a king."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.3","When the narrative resumes, even before we learn anything about Shemuel as Eli’s successor, the text makes sure that we are aware of the state of deterioration into which the worship of Y<small>HWH</small> has fallen. As a prelude to the actions of Eli’s sons, we are told at some length how even the servants of the priests make a mockery of the sacrifices in their zeal to extract the priests’ due. Only in v.22 do we learn of the exact nature of the sons’ sin, the serious act of sleeping with the serving-women at the very entrance to the shrine. Despite Eli’s entreaties, his sons ignore him because Y<small>HWH</small> has other plans."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.4","The long condemnation of Eli by Y<small>HWH</small> through an anonymous “man of God” that ends the chapter in vv.27–36 leaves no doubt about the fate of the priest and his descendants. It mirrors what will happen to Sha’ul, Israel’s first king, later in the book."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.5",14 Eli said to her:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.6",How long will you be drunk?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.7",Put away your wine from you!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.8",15 But Hanna answered and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.9","No, my lord,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.10",a woman hardened of spirit am I.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.11","Wine and beer I have not drunk,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.12",but I have been pouring out my soul in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.13","16 Do not consider your maidservant a base woman,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.14",for it is out of my great anxiety and my being provoked [that] I have spoken until now.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.15","17 Eli answered and said: Go in peace,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.16",and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have requested of him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.17",18 She said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.18",May your handmaid find favor in your eyes.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.19","The woman went on her way, and she ate,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.20",and her face was no longer [sad] on her.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.21",19 They started-early in the morning:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.22",they bowed down in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.23","then they returned, and came back to their house in Rama."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.24","And Elkana knew Hanna his wife,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.26","20 So it was, at the turning of days,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.27",that Hanna conceived and gave birth to a son;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.28","she called his name: Shemuel/The One From God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.29",meaning: from Y<small>HWH</small> I requested him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.30","21 And the man Elkana went up, along with all his household,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.31","to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> the yearly sacrifice, and his vow-offering,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.32","22 but Hanna did not go up,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.33",for she said to her husband:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.34",… until the lad is weaned—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.35","then I will bring him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.36",that he may be seen in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.37",he is to stay there forever.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.38",23 Elkana her husband said to her:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.39",Do whatever is good in your eyes:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.40",stay until you have weaned him—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.41",only: may Y<small>HWH</small> fulfill his word!

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.47","25 They slaughtered the bull,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.48",and then they brought the lad to Eli.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.49",26 She said:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.94","while the lad began to attend Y<small>HWH</small>, in the presence of Eli the priest."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.95",12 Now the sons of Eli were base fellows;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.96",they did not know Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.97",13 And the norm of the priests with the people [was]:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.98","whoever sacrificed a sacrifice,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.99",the priest’s serving-lad would come while the flesh was boiling
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.100",with a fork of three teeth in his hand
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.101",14 and would strike at the pot or the kettle or the cauldron or the boiling-vat;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.102","everything the fork would bring up, the priest would take for himself."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.104","15 Even before they would turn the fat into smoke,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.105",the serving-lad of the priest would come and say to the person sacrificing:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.106","Give over some flesh for roasting, for the priest,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.107",for he will not take boiled flesh from you—only raw!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.108",16 And if the person said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.109","Let them first turn the fat into smoke, yes, smoke,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.110",then take for yourself whatever your appetite craves—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.111",he would say to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.112","No, but give it over right-now;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.113","if not, I’ll take it by force!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.114","17 Now the sin of the serving-lads was exceedingly great in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.116","18 Shemuel was attending in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.117",as a lad girded with a linen <i>efod.</i>

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.123",in place of the requested-one who was lent-on-request to Y<small>HWH</small>!

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2.131",23 He said to them:

Both he and the aging priest mistake what is happening, but Eli finally realizes that it is God himself speaking, and so he prepares the lad for the inevitable revelation. The divine message confirms what we saw in the previous chapter: Eli, who has failed as a father of priests, is rejected by God, and his sons will not succeed him. No future sacrifices or rituals can change that. Strikingly, nevertheless, his reaction to this news is to humbly accept God’s will."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.2","The reader will note that God’s words to Shemuel do not, as so often in biblical “call” narratives, require answer and dialogue. Young Shemuel appears in this chapter as one through whom God speaks, and is thus a prophet, but there is none of the usual tension between the one called and the burden he is asked to carry—at least for the moment—that we find elsewhere in the Bible."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.3",27 A man of God came to Eli and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.4",Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.5","Did I not reveal, yes, reveal myself to your Father’s House when they were in Egypt, [belonging] to Pharaoh’s house,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.6","28 and choose it from all the tribes of Israel for myself, to act-as- priests—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.7","to ascend upon my sacrificial-altar, to send up smoking-incense, to wear the <i>efod</i> in my presence?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.8",And I gave to your Father’s House all the fire-offerings of the Children of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.9","29 Why have you kicked away my sacrifices and my cereal-gifts that I commanded, with a grudging-eye?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.10","And you have honored your sons more than me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.11","by letting them grow fat from the premier-part of all the gifts of Israel, in my presence!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.12","30 Therefore,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.20","31 Here, the days are coming"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.21","when I will hew off your arm and the arm of your Father’s House,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.28","34 And this is the sign for you that it will come-to-pass for your two sons, for Hofni and Pin’has:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.29",on a single day the two of them will die!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.30",35 But I will establish for myself a trusted priest
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.31",who will do [what is] in my heart and in my being;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.32","I will build him a trustworthy household,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.33",and he will walk in the presence of my anointed one all the days [to come].
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.34",36 And it will be
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.35",that whoever is left in your house—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.36",he will come to bow low to him
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.37",for payment of silver and a round-loaf of bread;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.38",he will say:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.39","Pray appoint me to one of the priestly-offices,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.40",[for me] to eat a bit of bread!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.41",3:1 The lad Shemuel was attending Y<small>HWH</small> in the presence of Eli.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.42",Now the word of Y<small>HWH</small> was precious in those days;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.43",visions were not widespread.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.44",2 It was on that day
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.45",that Eli was lying down in his place
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.46","—his eyes had begun to dim, [so that] he was not able to see—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.47","3 and the lamp of God had not yet gone out,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.48","while Shemuel was lying down in the great-hall of Y<small>HWH</small>, where the Coffer of God was."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.49",4 And Y<small>HWH</small> called to Shemuel.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.50",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.51",Here I am.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.52",5 And he ran to Eli
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.53",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.54","Here I am, for you called me!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.55",But he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.56",I did not call;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.57","return, lie down."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.58",He went and lay down.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.59","6 But Y<small>HWH</small> called yet again: Shemuel!,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.60","and Shemuel arose and went to Eli,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.61",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.62","Here I am, for you called me!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.63",But he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.64","I did not call, my son!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.65","Return, lie down."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.66",7 Now Shemuel did not yet know Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.67",not yet had the word of Y<small>HWH</small> been revealed to him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.68","8 And Y<small>HWH</small> called again: Shemuel! a third time,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.69","and he arose and went to Eli,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.70",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.71","Here I am, for you called me!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.72",Then Eli understood
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.73",that Y<small>HWH</small> was calling the lad.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.74",9 Eli said to Shemuel:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.75","Go, lie down,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.76","and it shall be, if he calls you, you are to say:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.77","Speak, O Y<small>HWH</small>, for your servant hearkens!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.78",So Shemuel went and lay down in his place.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.79",10 And Y<small>HWH</small> came and stood [there]
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.80",and called as time and time [before]: Shemuel! Shemuel!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.81","Shemuel said: Speak, for your servant hearkens!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.82",11 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shemuel:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.83","Here, I am about to do a thing in Israel"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.84",such that everyone who hears of it—their two ears will ring!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.85","12 On that day, I will fulfill upon Eli all that I spoke concerning his house,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.86",from beginning to end!

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1.99",12 <b>all that I spoke:</b> See vv.30–36 above.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.1","Defeat, Disaster, and the Death of Eli: The course of the last two books, Joshua and Judges, made clear that victory in battle would depend solely on Israel’s faithfulness to YHWH. Given that Chaps. 2–3 have convincingly demonstrated that leadership is failing badly, the outcome of the brewing battle in Chap. 4 is a foregone conclusion. The military encounter itself takes only one verse, and the defeat causes the Israelites to believe that they have only one recourse. As Hamilton notes, they do not even think of consulting Shemuel. Instead, as in many cultures, they decide to bring their great national and religious symbol, in this case the Coffer (Ark) of the Covenant, with them into battle, to afford protection and victory. Initially, the Philistines are overcome by fear of YHWH, but they rally themselves to “be men” (v.9) and the Israelites are defeated once again. This time a triple catastrophe occurs: military defeat, the capture of the Coffer, and the death of Eli’s sons."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.2","Beginning in v.12, a classic scene unfolds. Accounts of ancient battles always include the bringing of the news to wives, mothers, and fathers; one need only recall the pathos of the Greek story of Jason’s father, Aegeus, awaiting his son’s return from Colchis. The present text contains interesting variations on the old theme. Eli anxiously awaits word of the fate of the Coffer, having apparently written off his sons, but unexpectedly, the text gives new bits of information about him: he is ninety-eight, blind, and heavy. All these seemingly superfluous details come together in the vivid description of his death that follows, where his life comes crashing down as he sits in his seat of power. It is the literal downfall of an aged leader who lacks vision, whose office weighs him down, and who cannot survive the loss of the cult object whose purpose he has served his whole life."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.3","As if to reinforce the negative message, the chapter ends with an ill-boding birth, that of Eli’s grandson. In the mother’s dying moments, she is compelled to give her child the fateful name of “Where-is-Glory,” which betokens the capture of the Coffer."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.4","Thus in the overall opening section of the book of Samuel the normal course of events is reversed, and a shadow is temporarily cast over the future. But we also know that with Shemuel, future leadership is in place, and it appears to be of a higher quality than what preceded it."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.5","This chapter witnesses the introduction of the Philistines into biblical narrative. In Judges and Samuel, the Philistines are the archenemies of Israel, a powerful people resident mostly on or around the country’s southern coast, and technologically superior through their possession of iron. Their portrayal in the Bible is entirely negative, and almost no useful cultural details are given about them except for their being uncircumcised. Similarly, the archaeological record about the Philistines is spotty, but thanks to the work of the Dothans and others, we can now piece together a tentative picture. This group may well have been one of the “Sea Peoples” who invaded the Middle East in the twelfth century. The Bible gives Crete (or possibly Cyprus) as their point of origin, but they may have come from Asia Minor or the Aegean. Some Canaanite element is also possible. The visual records from Egypt, which successfully repulsed their attack, show warriors with plumed helmets, although they were not the only group to be so attired. In those texts, the Philistines are referred to as Peleshet or Tjekker. Distinctive cultural elements include the coloring and decoration of pottery, which was red and black with birds and other figures, a double ax of bronze, and a floor plan of temples which is closer to that of Aegean models than of Canaanite ones. Nevertheless, the Philistines appear to have been extremely adaptable, quickly absorbing Canaanite language and gods (including the aforementioned Dagon). Sadly, none of their texts has survived."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.6","The Philistines are portrayed as having settled in five coastal or near-coastal cities: Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, Gat, and Gaza. Their reach, however, was greater. There is evidence of Philistine presence in Bet-She’an, just west of the Jordan River, and battles with them as reported in the Bible range throughout the central and northern parts of the land. David is credited with ending their dominance in the area."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.7","It is ironic that Israel’s classic enemy ultimately gave their name to the country itself. The Greeks and Romans dubbed it Palestine, the Land of the Philistines, and the name has been used for centuries as a neutral term by scholars, but the past few decades of Middle Eastern politics have given it a more charged connotation."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.8",3:13 I have told him
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.9","that I am passing judgment on his house, for the ages,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.10","for the iniquity about which he has known,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.11","because his sons were treating God lightly, yet he did not condemn them."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.12",14 Therefore I swear concerning the house of Eli:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.13",Should the iniquity of the house of Eli be purged away
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.14","through sacrifices or grain-gifts, for the ages … !"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.15","15 Shemuel lay down until daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.16","and he opened the doors of the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.17",but Shemuel was afraid of reporting the seen-vision to Eli.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.18",16 Eli called Shemuel;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.19",he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.20","Shemuel, my son!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.21",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.22",Here I am.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.23",17 He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.24",What is the word that he spoke to you?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.25",Now do not conceal it from me …
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.26","Thus may God do to you and thus may he add,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.27",if you conceal from me any word
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.28",from all the word[s] that he spoke to you!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.29","18 So Shemuel reported to him all the words, and he did not conceal [anything] from him."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.30",And he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.31",He is Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.32","whatever is good in his eyes, may he do!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.33","19 Shemuel grew up, and Y<small>HWH</small> was with him;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.34",he did not let any of his words fall to the ground.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.35","20 So all Israel knew, from Dan to Be’er-Sheva,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.36",that Shemuel was trustworthy as a prophet to Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.37","21 And Y<small>HWH</small> was seen again at Shilo,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.38","for Y<small>HWH</small> had revealed himself to Shemuel at Shilo, in accord with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.39",4:1 And the word of Shemuel came-to-pass for all Israel.…
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.40",And all Israel went out to meet the Philistines for battle;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.41","they encamped at Even Ha-Ezer/The Stone of Help,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.42",while the Philistines encamped at Afek.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.43","2 The Philistines arrayed-ranks to meet Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.44","and the battle was spread out, so that Israel was defeated before the Philistines—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.45",they struck them in ranks in the open-field: about four thousand men.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.46","3 The people came back to the camp, and the elders of Israel said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.47",Why has Y<small>HWH</small> defeated us today before the Philistines?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.48","Let us take ourselves, from Shilo, the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.49",that he may come into our midst
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.50",and deliver us from the grasp of our enemies!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.51","4 So the people sent to Shilo,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.52","and carried from there the Coffer of the Covenant of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, [The One] Seated on the Winged-Sphinxes"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.53","—Eli’s two sons were there with the Coffer of the Covenant of God, Hofni and Pin’has."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.54",5 And it was
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.55",when the Coffer of the Covenant of Y<small>HWH</small> came into the camp
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.56","that all Israel shouted with a great shout,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.57",so that the land was in panic.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.58",6 The Philistines heard the sound of the shouting
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.59",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.60",What is this great sound of shouting in the Hebrews’ camp?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.61",Then they knew
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.62",that the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> had come into the camp.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.63","7 And the Philistines were afraid,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.64",for they said [to themselves]:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.65",A god has come into the camp!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.66",And they said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.67","Woe to us,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.68","for it was not like this yesterday [and] the day-before,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.69",8 woe to us—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.70",who will rescue us from the hand of this mighty god?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.71",This is the god who struck down Egypt with every kind of blow in the wilderness!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.72","9 Strengthen yourselves and be men, O Philistines,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.73","lest you have to serve the Hebrews, as they have served you!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.74",Be men and wage battle!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.75","10 So the Philistines waged battle,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.76","and Israel was defeated, so that they fled, each to his tent."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.77",The striking-down was exceedingly great:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.78",there fell from Israel thirty thousand foot-soldiers.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.79","11 Moreover the Coffer of God was taken,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.80","and Eli’s two sons died, Hofni and Pin’has."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.81",12 A Binyaminite man ran from the ranks;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.82",he came to Shilo on that same day
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.83",with his garb torn and earth on his head.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.84","13 He came, and here: Eli was sitting on a throne, beside the road, waiting-anxiously,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.85",for his heart was trembling for the Coffer of God.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.86","And when the man came to tell it in the town,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.87",the whole town cried out;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.88",14 Eli heard the sound of the outcry
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.89",and said:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.94",16 the man said to Eli:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.96",I myself—from the ranks I fled today!

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.98","How did the matter go, my son?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.99",17 The newsbringer answered;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.100",he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.101","Israel has fled before the Philistines,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.102","and also there has been a great defeat of the people,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.103","and also your two sons died, Hofni and Pin’has,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.104",and the Coffer of God has been taken!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.105","18 Now it was,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.106","at his making mention of the Coffer of God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.107","that he fell from on the throne backward, alongside the gate,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.108","and his neck was broken, so that he died,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.109","for he was an old man, and heavy."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.110",He had led Israel as judge for forty years.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.111","19 Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Pin’has, was pregnant, about to give birth,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.112",and when she heard the heard-report of the taking of the Coffer of God
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.113","and of the death of her father-in-law and her husband,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.114","she crouched and gave birth,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.115",for her labor-pains had turned [suddenly] upon her.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.116","20 At the time of her dying, those [women] standing over her spoke:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.117","Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22.118","21 But she did not answer, nor did she pay any mind,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.1","The Philistines and the Coffer: As if to stress that the Philistines’ victory in the previous chapter was the doing of God and not strictly the result of their own military prowess, the text follows the Coffer to the Philistine town of Ashdod, where it becomes clear that possessing it brings danger. In passages that express the Bible’s usual contempt for pagan culture, the very statue of the Philistine god Dagon is mysteriously destroyed by the Coffer’s presence, and the inhabitants, first, of Ashdod, and then of Gat, are stricken with hemorrhoids to the point that their “cry-for-help went up to the heavens” (v.12). Clearly, the Coffer will have to be returned to Israel."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.2",concerning the taking of the Coffer of God
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.3",and concerning her father-in-law and her husband.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.4",22 She said:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.7","5:1 Now when the Philistines took the Coffer of God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.8",they brought it from Even Ha-Ezer to Ashdod.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.9",2 Then the Philistines took the Coffer of God
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.10","and brought it to the House of Dagon,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.11",and set it next to Dagon.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.12","3 The Ashdodites started-early on the morrow,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.13","but here was Dagon, fallen down on his face to the ground before the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.14",So they took Dagon and returned him to his place.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.15","4 They started-early at daybreak, on the morrow,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.16","but here was Dagon, fallen down on his face to the ground before the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.17","with Dagon’s head and the two palms of his hands cut off, on the threshold;"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.19","5 —Therefore the priests of Dagon and all who enter the House of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.20",until this day.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.21","6 And the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was heavy against the Ashdodites, and he devastated them;"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.23",Ashdod and its territories.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.24",__________
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.25","5:1 <b>Ashdod:</b> One of the five chief Philistines cities, the others being Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and Gat. All are on or near the Mediterranean coast."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.26","2 <b>Dagon:</b> Pronounced <i>dah-GOHN,</i> a long-revered fertility god of the ancient Near East, here connected with the Philistines.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5.27","4 <b>fallen down on his face:</b> In an obvious posture of submission, <b>head and … palms … cut off:</b> A known treatment of those defeated in war; see I Sam. 31:9–10, below, and the fate of the notorious Jezebel in II Kings 9:35."

These, and the mice-related plague (see 6:4), are viewed as a further divine curse on the Philistines for their possession of the Coffer. See Alter (1999) for a discussion of the long-standing confusion in the text; he cites an old interpretation that the passage actually refers to the bubonic plague."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.1","Following the Coffer: The theme of the Coffer’s potency continues, with the Philistines making elaborate preparations, including sacrifices and reparations consisting (somewhat humorously, perhaps) of five golden hemorrhoids/tumors and five golden mice. The “priests and diviners” seem not entirely convinced that the disasters that have befallen them are the work of YHWH, and so devise a test: if the cart bearing the Coffer and the payment goes straight into Israelite territory, to Bet-Shemesh, it will confirm the intervention of the divine hand."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.2","That same hand, however, guards the Coffer from being profaned even among the Israelites, and following a peeking incident in v.19, a great plague comes upon them. This theme of what Hamilton calls “the high voltage of the supersancta,” the dangerous parameters of a divine object, will return in II Sam. 6:6–7, where it will lead to a man’s immediate death. Here, the Coffer has to move from Bet-Shemesh to Kiryat-Ye’arim, a border town some miles to the northeast, where it will be guarded by a man “hallowed” for the purpose."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.3","7 The men of Ashdod saw that [it was] thus,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.4",so they said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.5","The Coffer of the God of Israel must not stay with us,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.6",for his hand is hard upon us and upon Dagon our god!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.7",8 So they sent and gathered together all the Philistine overlords to them
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.8",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.9",What shall we do with the Coffer of the God of Israel?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.10",They said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.11",To Gat let the Coffer of the God of Israel be removed!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.12",So they had the Coffer of the God of Israel removed [there].
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.13","9 But it was, after their removing it,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.14","that the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was against the town, [causing] an exceedingly great panic;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.15","he struck the men of the town, from small to great,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.16",and tumors broke out on them.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.17","10 So they sent off the Coffer of God to Ekron,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.18","but when the Coffer of God entered Ekron,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.19","the Ekronites cried out, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.20","They have removed to us the Coffer of the God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.21",to cause our death and our people’s!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.22",11 So they sent and gathered all the Philistine overlords
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.23",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.24","Send away the Coffer of the God of Israel, that it may return to its place,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.25",so that it does not cause our death and our people’s!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.26",For there was a death panic all throughout the town;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.27",exceedingly heavy was the hand of God there.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.28","12 Now the men who did not die were struck with tumors,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.29",and the town’s cry-for-help went up to the heavens.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.30",6:1 Now the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> was in the territory of the Philistines for seven months;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.31","2 then the Philistines called for the priests and for the diviners, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.32",What are we to do with the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.33",Let us know how we can send it back to its place!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.34",3 They said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.35","If you wish to send back the Coffer of the God of Israel, do not send it back empty,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.36","rather, make restitution, yes, restitution to him with a reparation- offering;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.37",then you will be healed
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.38",and it will be made known to you why his hand has not turned aside from you.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.39",4 They said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.40",What is the reparation-offering with which we are to make restitution to him?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.41",They said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.42",[By] the number of Philistine overlords:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.43","five gold tumors and five gold mice,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.44",for one plague was upon all [of you] and upon your overlords.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.45","5 You are to make images of your tumors and images of your mice that are bringing the land to ruin,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.46",and you are to give honor to the God of Israel;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.47","perhaps he will lighten his hand from upon you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.48",from upon your gods and from upon your land.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.49","6 Why do you make your heart heavy-with-stubbornness,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.50",as Egypt and Pharaoh made their heart heavy-with-stubbornness?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.51",Was it not when he dealt wantonly with them that he sent them free and they went away?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.52","7 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.53",fetch and make ready a new wagon and two milch cows that have not yet yielded to a yoke;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.54","you are to bind the cows to the wagon,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.55","but you are to turn back their young behind them, indoors."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.56",8 Then you are to take the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.57","and are to put it on the wagon,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.58",and the gold objects with which you are making restitution to him as a reparation-offering
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.59","you are to place in a pouch, to its side;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.60","then you are to send it off, that it may go."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.61",9 And look [well]:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.62","if it goes up by way of its own territory, to Bet-Shemesh,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.63",then he did us this great evil;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.64","but if not,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.65",we will know that his hand did not touch us—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.66",an accident happened to us.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.67",10 The men did thus:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.68","they got two milk-yielding cows and bound them to the wagon,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.69",but their young they shut up indoors.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.70","11 And they placed the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> on the wagon,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.71",along with the chest and the gold mice and the images of their tumors.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.72","12 And the cows went-straight on the road, on the road to Bet- Shemesh:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.73","on one path they went, going along [and] lowing,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.74","but they did not turn right or left,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.75","while the Philistine overlords were walking behind them, as far as the territory of Bet-Shemesh."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.76","13 Now Bet-Shemesh were harvesting the wheat harvest in the valley,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.77","and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the Coffer,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.78",and they rejoiced seeing it.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6.79","14 When the wagon came to the field of Yehoshua the Bet-Shimshite, and came to a stop there"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.1","Beating Back the Philistine Threat: The Philistine plague is only the beginning of Israel’s restoration. If that is to happen properly, however, two things need to occur: Israel has to “put away the foreign gods” from their midst, and Shemuel has to intercede with God. The order is significant as, once again, military victory depends on the people’s faithfulness to God, and not solely on effective leadership. It is likewise telling that the site of the victory is the same at which defeat had occurred in 4:1 and 5:1 (Willis). So a narrative that began with “sighing” (v.2) ends with a restoration of territory, peace (v.14), and a description of Shemuel’s judgeship. All would seem to be well."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.39","3 So Shemuel said to the whole House of Israel, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.40","If it is with all your heart that you are returning to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.41","put away the foreign gods from your midst, including the Astartes;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.42","direct your hearts toward Y<small>HWH</small>, and serve him alone,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.43",and he will rescue you from the hand of the Philistines!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.44","4 And the Children of Israel put away the Baals and the Astartes,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.45",and served Y<small>HWH</small> alone.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.46",5 And Shemuel said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.47","Gather all Israel to Mitzpa/Lookout, so that I may intercede on your behalf to Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.48",6 They were gathered to Mitzpa;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.49","then they drew water and poured it out in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.50",and fasted on that day.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.51",They declared there:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.52",We have sinned against Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.53",And Shemuel acted-as-judge for the Children of Israel at Mitzpa.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.54","7 The Philistines heard that the Children of Israel were gathered at Mitzpa,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.55",so the Philistine overlords went up against Israel;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.56","and the Children of Israel heard, and they became afraid before the Philistines."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.57",8 The Children of Israel said to Shemuel:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.58","Do not be silent from us, from crying out to Y<small>HWH</small> our God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.59",that he may deliver us from the hand of the Philistines!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.60","9 So Shemuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as an offering-up, a whole-offering, to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.61","and Shemuel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small> on behalf of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.62",and Y<small>HWH</small> answered him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.63","10 Now it was, when Shemuel was offering up the offering-up,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.64",that the Philistines approached for battle against Israel.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.65",And Y<small>HWH</small> thundered with a great sound on that day against the Philistines;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.66","he panicked them, so that they were defeated before Israel."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.67",11 The men of Israel went out from Mitzpa
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.68","and pursued the Philistines,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.69",and they struck them as far as below Bet-Kar.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.70",12 Then Shemuel took a stone and put it between Mitzpa and Shen/ The Tooth-Rock
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.71",and called its name Even Ha-Ezer/The Stone of Help;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.72",he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.73","Near here, Y<small>HWH</small> helped us!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.74",13 So the Philistines were humbled;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.75","they no longer came anymore into the territory of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.76",and the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was against the Philistines all the days of Shemuel.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.77","14 The towns that the Philistines had taken away from Israel returned to Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.78","from Ekron as far as Gat,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.79",while their territory Israel rescued from the hand of the Philistines.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.80",Now there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.81",15 Shemuel led Israel as judge all the days of his life:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.82","16 he would go year after year,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.83","circling about Bet-El, Gilgal, and Mitzpa,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.84",and would act-as-judge over Israel near all these sacred-places;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.85","17 then his return [would be] to Rama, for there was his house,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.86",and there he would act-as-judge over Israel.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17.87",He built there an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.1","“Give Us a King!” : It is a consistent pattern in world literature that when a great leader grows old, he either makes a long final public speech or deals with the appointment of a successor. Sometimes it is both. Like his mentor Eli, however, Shemuel is stymied in his desire for continuity in leadership by the fact that his own sons do not “walk in his ways” (vv.3 and 5). In addition to the sons’ corrupt behavior as judges, violating rules stated already in Exod. 23:8, the real need of the moment is for a strong military leader, as it was earlier in the book of Judges. So the Israelites request a king who will fight their wars (v.20) and thus enable them to be a self-respecting entity (vv.5 and 20, “like all the nations”)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.2","Shemuel takes their plea as a personal rejection, but God has to remind him in v.7 that it is really a rejection of God himself as Israel’s only king. Up to this point in the narratives of the Bible, the concept of divine kingship had been implied, through wilderness wanderings, conquest, and settlement. Now it appears that this cannot continue, at least not without an earthly stand-in. But to make clear the writer’s opinion that monarchy must be controlled, Shemuel delivers a pointed warning to the people (vv.11–18). It unmistakably implies that kings are takers—that verb punctuates the speech four times—who will disrupt the time-honored practices of village life and spend their own time accumulating personal power and wealth. The ominous warning at the end of the speech, that God will not listen to the Israelites’ predictable outcry when they are oppressed by future kings, goes unheeded, as the people refuse (Heb. root <i>m-’-n</i>) to be swayed from their obsession with security, and in essence reject (<i>m-’-s</i>) God."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.3","In many ways this chapter is a transitional one, and could either be grouped with the stories about Shemuel alone, as some scholars have done, or placed as the introduction to what follows, as here. It may be another example of the Bible’s tendency, at least in its final form, to display overlapping structures."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.4","8:1 Now it was, when Shemuel had grown old,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.5",that he made his sons judges for Israel
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.6","2 —the name of his firstborn son was Yoel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.7","and the name of his second, Aviyya—"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.9",3 But his sons did not walk in his ways:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.11",and they took bribes and cast aside cases-for-justice.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.12",4 So all the elders of Israel gathered together
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.13",and came to Shemuel at Rama;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.14",5 they said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.15","Here, you have grown old,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.16",and your sons have not walked in your ways.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.17","So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.18","make us a king to lead us, like all the nations!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.19","6 The matter was evil in the eyes of Shemuel, when they said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.20",Give us a king to lead us!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.21","So Shemuel prayed to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.22",7 and Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shemuel:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.25","rather, it is me they have rejected from being king over them,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.35",10 And Shemuel related all the words of Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.36",to the people who were requesting a king from him;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.37",11 he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.38",This will be the rule of the king who will reign as king over you:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.43","to plow his plowing and harvest his harvest,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.44",and to make his battle weapons and his chariot weapons;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.45",13 your daughters he will take away
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.46","as ointment-mixers, as cooks, and as bakers;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.47","14 your fields, your vineyards, and your olive-groves, the best ones, he will take away"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.48",and give to his servants;

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.50",and give to his officers and to his servants;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.51","16 your servants, your maids, your best young-men, and your donkeys, he will take away,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.52",that they may do his work;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.53","17 your flock he will tithe,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.54",and you yourselves will be slaves for him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.55",18 And you will cry out on that day
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.56","because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.57",but Y<small>HWH</small> will not answer you on that day!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.58",19 But the people refused to hearken to Shemuel’s voice; they said:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8.69","16 <b>young-men:</b> Changing one letter, LXX reads “cattle.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.1","The Choosing of Sha’ul: Israel’s first king stems from the tribe of Binyamin, whose territory straddled the north-south border region of the country but which was understood to be of northern provenance. Barely have we heard of Sha’ul’s qualifications for the job—solid lineage and notable physical stature—when we are introduced to him in person as, of all things, a seeker of lost she-asses. Some, such as Sweeney (2012), would see this as having a “fairy-tale” quality; others, myself included, sense something more negative: a foreshadowing of the later, “lost” Sha’ul. The meandering tale brings the young man unwittingly into the orbit of Shemuel, who, to Sha’ul’s utter surprise, hails him in v.20. Indeed, geographically, Sha’ul’s wanderings form an oval that partly intersects the circle of Shemuel’s activities in the book—another indication of the closeness of the two characters."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.2","The text plays out the selection of the new king, lingering on scenes of searching, asking, and, finally, declaring God’s will through the prophet. Whereas in the first part of the narrative Sha’ul wanders seemingly in vain, his journey ultimately bears out Shemuel’s predictions (10:2–7) of signs from God and the leader-elect’s transformation (note that the key verb “find” occurs some thirteen times in eighteen of the chapter’s verses). Despite all of this, however, Sha’ul does not reveal the earthshaking result of his encounter with Shemuel to his family, much like Shimshon (Judg. 14) before him. That remains, for the moment, both God’s secret and a sign of Sha’ul’s modesty. Likewise, when Israel is summoned to Mitzpa, the new king, who is chosen publicly by lots, is initially nowhere to be found, and is discovered only eventually amid the gear. When he is finally acclaimed by the people in v.24, what follows is a note of doubt on their part (v.27). Sha’ul weathers this little storm, in contrast to his later capitulations, but we are left to wonder why the first Israelite monarch arises under such clouded circumstances and with such hesitation. It feels less like the classic prophetic rejection of God’s mission, where a figure such as Moshe at least argues with God, and more like a hint of flawed character. This may be symbolically indicated by Shemuel’s use of a flask of oil to anoint the new king, as opposed to the more usual horn (Miscall)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.3","Sha’ul’s strange experience of behaving like a prophet, which is predicted in vv.5–6 and recounted in 10–11, is unique in ancient Israel’s description of its kings. The “mantic” form of prophecy referred to here, comprising extreme forms of behavior, is attested throughout the ages (see the cult of Dionysus in ancient Greece, and “speaking in tongues” still today). The experiences of “later prophets” such as Yesha’yahu (Isaiah) and Yirmeyahu (Jeremiah) tend to focus (although not exclusively) on the divine word, which is usually not obscure but, on the contrary, all too intelligible. In our chapter, one may wonder whether Sha’ul’s gift indicates chosenness, as in the earlier cases of judges who are seized by God’s spirit, or the possession of qualities that indicate a kind of instability that may not be appropriate for the sober needs of governing (Brueggemann 1990)."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.38",Now let us go there;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.39",perhaps he can tell us about our way on which we have gone.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.42",what can we bring for the man?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.43","For the food is gone from our vessels,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.44",and there is no present to bring to the man of God.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.71","after that, the invited-guests may eat."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.72","So-now, go up;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.73","as for him, this very day you will find him."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.74",14 So they went up to the town.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.75","They were coming into the midst of the town,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.76","and here, Shemuel was coming out toward them"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.77",to go up to the sanctuary.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.78",15 Now Y<small>HWH</small> had bared Shemuel’s ear
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.79","a day before Sha’ul’s coming, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.80",16 Around this time tomorrow
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.81",I will send to you a man from the region of Binyamin;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.82",you are to anoint him as <i>Nagid</i> over my people Israel.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.83",He will deliver my people from the hand of the Philistines—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.84","for I have seen my people,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.85",for their cry has come to me!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.86","17 Now when Shemuel saw Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.87",Y<small>HWH</small> declared to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.88",Here is the man about whom I said to you:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.89",This one shall keep rein on my people!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.90",18 Sha’ul approached Shemuel amid the gateway
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.91",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.92",Now tell me:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.93",Where is the seer’s house?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.94","19 Shemuel answered Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.95",he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.96",I am the seer.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.97",Go up ahead of me to the sanctuary;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.98",you are to eat with me today.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.99","Then I will send you off at daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.100",and all that is in your heart I will tell you.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.101","20 As for the she-asses that were straying from you three days ago,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.102","do not take them to heart, for they have been found—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.103","and to whom do all the riches of Israel belong,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.104",is it not to you and to all your Father’s House?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.105",21 Sha’ul answered and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.106","Am I not a Binyaminite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.107",and my clan is the least of all the clans of the tribe of Binyamin?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.108",So why do you speak to me according to these words?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.109","22 Shemuel took Sha’ul and his serving-lad, brought them to the dining-hall"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.110",and gave them a place at the head of the invited-guests
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.111",—they were about thirty men.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.112",23 Shemuel said to the cook:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.113","Give over the portion that I gave you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.114",about which I said to you: Set it [aside] with you.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.115",24 So the cook raised the thigh and the fat-tail and offered it up and set it before Sha’ul.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.116",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.117",Here is what-is-reserved;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.118","set it before you, eat,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.119","since for this appointed-time it has been kept for you, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.120",I have invited the people.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.121",So Sha’ul ate with Shemuel on that day.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.122","25 Then they went down from the sanctuary to the town,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.123",and he spoke with Sha’ul on the roof.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.124",26 … they started-early;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.125","so it was, when dawn came up,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.126","that Shemuel called Sha’ul to the roof, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.127","Arise, so that I may send you off."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.128","Sha’ul arose, and the two of them went forth, he and Shemuel, outside."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.129","27 They were going down, at the edge of the town,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.130",when Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.131","Speak to the lad, that he may cross over ahead of us,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.132",—and he crossed over—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.133","but you stop at once,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.134",that I may have you hear the word of God.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.135","10:1 And Shemuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head and kissed him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.136",and he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.137",Is it not [so] that Y<small>HWH</small> has anointed you over his inheritance as <i>Nagid</i>?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.138","2 When you go today from me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.139","you will find two men by Rahel’s burial-place in the territory of Binyamin, at Tzeltzah;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.140",they will say to you:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.141","They are found, the she-asses that you went to look for!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.142","Here, your father has left off the matter of the she-asses,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.143","but he is worried about you, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.144",What should I do about my son?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.145","3 So you are to move on from there, and further,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.146",and you are to come to the Oak of Tavor;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.147","they will find you, three men going up to [worship] God at Bet-El—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.148","one carrying three kids,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.149","one carrying three rounds of bread,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.150",and one carrying a skin of wine.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.151","4 They will ask you after [your] welfare,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.152",and they will give you two bread-loaves;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.153",you are to take them from their hand.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.154","5 After that, you will come to Giv’at Elohim/The Hill of God, where the Philistine garrison is;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.155","and it will be, when you come there, to the town,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.156","that you will encounter a band of prophets coming down from the sanctuary,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.157","and ahead of them, lyre and timbrel, flute and harp,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.158",and they will be ranting-in-prophecy.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.159","6 Now the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> will advance upon you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.160","so that you will rant-like-a-prophet with them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.161",and you will be changed into another man.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.162","7 And it will be,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.163","when these signs come-to-pass for you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.164",do for yourself whatever your hand finds [to do]!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.165",For God is with you.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.166","8 Then you are to go down ahead of me, to Gilgal,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.167","and here, I will be going down to you to offer up offerings-up and to sacrifice sacrifices of <i>shalom.</i>"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.168","For seven days you are to tarry, until I come to you;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.169",then I will make known to you what you are to do.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.170","9 Now it was,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.171","when he faced about to go from Shemuel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.172","that God changed in him another heart,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.173",and all these signs came-to-pass on that day.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.174","10 They came there, to Giv’a,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.175","and here, a band of prophets, [coming] to meet him!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.176","The rushing-spirit of God advanced upon him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.177",and he ranted-like-a-prophet in their midst.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.178",11 It was:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.179","all who knew him from yesterday [and] the day-before,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.180",when they saw
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.181","that here, with the prophets he was ranting-like-a-prophet,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.182","the people said, each one to his neighbor:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.183","What, now, has come over the son of Kish?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.184",Is Sha’ul too among the prophets?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.185",12 And a man from there spoke up and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.186",But who is their father?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.187",Therefore it became a proverb:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.188",Is Sha’ul too among the prophets?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.189","13 He finished ranting-like-a-prophet, and came to the sanctuary."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.190",14 Now Sha’ul’s uncle said to him and to his serving-lad:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.191",Where did you go?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.192",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.193",To look for the she-asses.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.194","And when we saw that [they were] not [there],"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.195",we came to Shemuel.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.196",15 Sha’ul’s uncle said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.197",Pray tell me:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.198",What did Shemuel say to you?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.199",16 Sha’ul said to his uncle:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.200","He told, yes, told us"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.201",that the she-asses had been found.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.202","But as for the matter of the kingship,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.203",he did not tell him what Shemuel had said.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.204","17 Now Shemuel summoned the people to Y<small>HWH</small>, at Mitzpa."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.205",18 He said to the Children of Israel:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.206","Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.207","I myself brought Israel up from Egypt,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.208",I rescued you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.211","9:1 <b>a man:</b> Some ancient versions read “a certain man,” paralleling the opening of the book. <b>Kish son of Aviel … :</b> Hamilton points out some similarities between this genealogy and Shemuel’s, as if Sha’ul’s choosing parallels the earlier one of Shemuel; both are requested of God. The pronunciations of names are: <i>keesh … ah-vee-AYL … tze-ROHR … beh-kho-RAHT … ah-fee-AKH.</i> <b>value:</b> Heb. <i>hayil</i> in these books often means “valor,” as a measure of military excellence, but here, as with some other biblical terms for “strength,” it can refer to high economic status as well."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.212",2 <b>Sha’ul:</b> Pronounced <i>shah-OOL;</i> trad. English “Saul.” <b>goodly:</b> Or “good-looking.”
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.213",3 <b>strayed:</b> Or “were lost.”

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.218",8 <b>a quarter weight of silver:</b> Coins were not yet in use throughout much of the biblical period.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.219",9 <b>prophet … seer:</b> The early audience of the book would presumably already have been puzzled by the use of the old term “seer” here.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.220",15 <b>bared … ear:</b> Probably parallel to the English expression “to bend the ear.”
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.221","16 <b><i>Nagid:</i></b> Pronounced <i>nah-GEED;</i> others, “Prince,” but the term does not mean a king’s son. It probably indicates a military leader specially appointed by God, a “designate.” Because of ongoing debate about the term, I have left it in Hebrew. <b>for I have seen … for their cry:</b> Echoing God’s redemptive speech at the Burning Bush (Exod. 3:7). Some render Heb. <i>ki, “for,”</i> as “indeed.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.222",17 <b>keep rein on:</b> The use of a verb (<i>’-tz-r</i>) that usually means “restrain” is puzzling. Many understand it as something like “govern.”

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.224","24 <b>thigh … fat-tail:</b> Parts of the sacrificial animal that were usually reserved for consumption by the priests.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.225","25–26 <b>roof … :</b> The Hebrew is difficult here; once again, a chunk of text appears to be missing."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.227","2 <b>Rahel’s burial-place … Tzeltzah:</b> The location of the traditional tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem, built in medieval times, has long been felt to be incorrectly identified. It most probably stood near Kiryat-Ye’arim, northwest of Jerusalem. Alternatively, <i>Tzeltzah</i> may be some kind of description—“rushing” or “limping”—and not a place name. The ancient versions are confused."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.228","5 <b>garrison:</b> Others, “prefect.” <b>ranting-in-prophecy:</b> The verb “to prophesy,” conventionally thought of as predicting the future but really encompassing speaking the word of God more generally, can also have the earlier meaning of certain forms of ecstatic religious behavior (see Commentary)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.229","6 <b>rushing-spirit:</b> Heb. <i>ru’ah</i> can mean either “spirit” or “wind,” so the concept might be seen as a spiritual one with physical force."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10.233","12 <b>But who is their father?:</b> A strange question, but in perhaps looking for the prophets’ leader (“father”), the text raises the larger leadership question of the book."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.1","Sha’ul the Victorious: Immediately after Sha’ul’s acclamation, his leadership is put to the test. A fierce Ammonite commander threatens an Israelite town lying to the north of his territory. While in our text his words seem ominous enough, the chapter as it appears in one of the Dead Sea Scroll manuscripts of Samuel—4QSa, probably an earlier and fuller version than MT—shows that he is a man of his word. The restored passage reads,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.2","Now Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the Gadites and the Re’uvenites."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.3","He would gouge out the right eye of each of them, and would not grant Israel a deliverer."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.4","No one was left of the Israelites across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had not gouged out."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.5",But there were seven thousand men who had escaped from the Ammonites and had entered Yavesh-Gil’ad.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.6","In MT that has come down to us, apparently a scribe’s eye wandered from the original first “Yavesh-Gil’ad” to the second, skipping several sentences."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.7","Upon hearing the news of the Ammonite danger, Sha’ul, in contrast to his weeping countrymen, is seized with the spirit of God and, in a reminder of the horrifying concubine story of Judg. 19–20, cuts up his oxen and sends their pieces around the country. The tribes rise up “as one man,” themselves gripped by a “terror of God” (an emotional state which elsewhere is usually viewed as a negative), and vanquish the brutal enemy."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.8","Sha’ul is gracious in victory, refusing to kill those of his countrymen who had earlier doubted his abilities. In a passage that may come from an alternate source, his leadership is celebrated (“renewed”) at Gilgal as the chapter draws to a close. What began with a threat of mutilation ends with “joy” (v.15) over the strength of the newfound leader."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.9","19 But you, today: you have rejected your God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.10",the one delivering you from all your trials and your troubles!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.11",You said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.12","No, rather, a king make over us!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.13","So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.14","station yourselves in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, by your tribes, by your families."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.15","20 So Shemuel brought near each of the tribes of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.16",and the tribe of Binyamin was captured-by-lot.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.17","21 Then he brought near the tribe of Binyamin by its clans,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.18",and the Matrite clan was captured-by-lot;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.19",then Sha’ul son of Kish was captured-by-lot.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.20","But when they looked for him, he was not to be found."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.21",22 So they inquired further of Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.22",Has any other man come here?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.23",Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.24","Here, he has hidden himself among the gear!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.25",23 They ran and fetched him from there
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.26","and he stood amid the people,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.27","and he was taller than all the people, from his shoulders and upward."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.28",24 Then Shemuel said to all the people:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.29",Do you see whom Y<small>HWH</small> has chosen?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.30","Indeed, there is none like him among all the people!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.31",And all the people shouted;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.32",they proclaimed: May the king live!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.33","25 And Shemuel spoke to the people, the rule of kingship,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.34","and wrote it in a record,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.35",and put it in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.36","Then Shemuel sent all the people off, each one to his house."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.37","26 And Sha’ul too went to his house at Giv’a,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.38",and there went with him the valiant ones
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.39",whose heart God had touched.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.40",27 Now some base fellows said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.41",How can this one deliver us?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.42",So they despised him
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.43",and did not bring him a gift.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.44",But he was like one silent.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.45",11:1 Now Nahash / Snake the Ammonite went up
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.46",and encamped against Yavesh-Gil’ad.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.47",All the men of Yavesh said to Nahash:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.48","Cut a covenant with us, and we will serve you!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.49",2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.50",On <i>this</i> [condition] I will cut [a covenant] with you—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.51",on [condition of] gouging out every one of your right eyes!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.52",Thus will I make it a disgrace upon all Israel!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.53",3 The elders of Yavesh said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.54",Leave us be for seven days;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.55",we wish to send messengers throughout all the territory of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.56","And if there is no deliverer for us,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.57",we will go out [to surrender] to you.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.58",4 The messengers came to the Hill of Sha’ul
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.59","and spoke the words in the hearing of the people,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.60",and all the people lifted up their voice and wept.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.61","5 Now here, when Sha’ul came after the cattle, from the open-field,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.62",Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.63","What [ails] the people, that they are weeping?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.64",They related to him the words of the men of Yavesh.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.65","6 And the rushing-spirit of God advanced upon Sha’ul when he heard these words,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.66",and his anger flared up exceedingly;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.67","7 he took a brace of cattle and chopped it up,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.68","and he sent it off throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.69","Whoever does not go out [to war] after Sha’ul and after Shemuel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.70",thus shall be done to his cattle!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.71","And a terror of Y<small>HWH</small> fell upon the people,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.72",so that they went out as one man.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.73",8 He counted them [for war] at Bezek:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.74","the Children of Israel totaled three hundred thousand,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.75",while the men of Judah were thirty thousand.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.76",9 Then he said to the messengers who came:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.77",Thus you are to say to the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.78","Tomorrow there will be victory for you, when the sun is hot!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.79",The messengers came
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.80","and told it to the men of Yavesh,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.81",and they rejoiced.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.82",10 And the men of Yavesh said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.83","Tomorrow we will go out to you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.84",and you may do with us whatever is good in your eyes.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.85",11 Now it was on the morrow
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.86",that Sha’ul put the fighting-people into three companies;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.87",they entered the midst of the camp at the daybreak watch
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.88",and struck Ammon until the hot-part of the day.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.89","And it was that those [who were] left—they were scattered,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.90",so that there were not left among them two together.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.91",12 The people said to Shemuel:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.92",Who was it that said: Shall Sha’ul be king over us?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.93","Give over the men, that we may put them to death!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.94",13 But Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.95","No one is to be put to death on this day,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11.96",for today Y<small>HWH</small> has wrought victory in Israel!

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 12.1","Shemuel’s Summation: In Chap. 8 we observed God, through Shemuel, expressing considerable reservations about the institution of kingship. Here, after the victory against the Ammonites, God reaffirms the monarchy, but in the broader context of Israelite history from Egypt to the present. After Shemuel establishes his own credibility by demonstrating that he, unlike future kings, has “taken” nothing from any Israelite, he launches into a long public oration which sounds rather like one of the farewell speeches we have come to expect at the end of biblical books (see the final chapters of both Deuteronomy and Joshua). The message is a simple one, thematically reminiscent of those earlier texts: if the Israelites will serve YHWH alone, forsaking the local gods, then all will be well; but if they “revolt,” both they and their king will be lost. The speech, despite its length, is able to remain on focus by sprinkling a specific vocabulary throughout. Four words occur in varying repetitions: “sin,” “evil,” and “request,” which denote Israel’s need for a king out of weakness, and “serve,” which comes to indicate their desired loyalty to YHWH. As in Chap. 8, the speech ends with a warning."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 13.1","Sha’ul Rejected I: The narrative has given us almost no time to savor Sha’ul’s victory in Chap. 11. It immediately provides an example of exactly what Shemuel had just warned against. In the midst of a back-and-forth struggle, with the Israelites attacking the Philistines in vv.2–4 and the Philistines retaliating from v.5 on, Sha’ul seeks to rally the troops again, with help anticipated from Shemuel. When the prophet is late in arriving, the king jumps the gun and offers the requisite sacrifices himself. He apparently is worried that he cannot win the battle without placating God, and he is additionally concerned about the bleeding away of the soldiers. When Shemuel finally shows up, his response to Sha’ul’s behavior is to in essence fire the king and indicate that another will take his place. Curiously, we get no reaction from Sha’ul, who goes back to mustering the troops, and the text sees fit to concentrate on details regarding the Philistines’ technological superiority."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 13.79","15 Shemuel arose and went up from Gilgal toward the Hill of Binyamin,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.1","Yonatan the Hero; Sha’ul Errs Again: In strange contrast to the rejection of Sha’ul and his dynasty that has just occurred, Yonatan (full name: Yehonatan), the heir to the throne, proves his mettle by single-handedly killing twenty Philistines. This leads to what looks to be a general rout of the Philistines by his father. In the heat of battle, Sha’ul prohibits any eating until sunset, an oath which, however, is not heard by Yonatan, who unwittingly violates it. To this is added the Israelites’ own breaking of rules, as they eat the animals they have slain along with the blood (a universal, not only Israelite, prohibition according to Gen. 9:4). All is forgiven with the subsequent sacrifice, but Yonatan has to be rescued from his father’s wrath by the Israelites. Once again, Sha’ul has somehow misfired as king, this time within his own family."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.2","The chapter ends with two summaries of Sha’ul’s reign. Vv.47–48 describe him as the great warrior who rescued Israel from six different enemies. Vv.49–52 contain a typical summary list, in this case of Sha’ul’s immediate family members and the name of his commanding general (Avner), along with a note of the ongoing struggle against the Philistines."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.9","for each one to have his plowshare, his mattock, his ax, and his sickle forged."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.36",7 His weapons bearer said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.37",Do whatever your heart inclines to—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.38","here, I am with you, according to your heart!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.39",8 Yehonatan said:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.51",and the Philistines said:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.53","12 And the men of the garrison yelled out to Yonatan and to his weapons bearer,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.56",and we will show you something!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.57",Yonatan said to his weapons bearer:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.59",for Y<small>HWH</small> has given them into the hand of Israel!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.60","13 So Yonatan climbed up by his hands and by his feet, with his weapons bearer behind him."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.61","And they fell before Yonatan, while his weapons bearer dispatched them behind him."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.62","14 Now the first striking-down that Yonatan and his weapons bearer struck was some twenty men,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.63",over about half a furrow for a brace [of oxen plowing] in a field.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.64","15 And there was trembling in the camp, out in the open-field, and among all the fighting-people"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.75","19 And it was,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.76","as Sha’ul was speaking to the priest,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.77",that the panic that was in the Philistines’ camp went on and on [becoming] greater;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.78",Sha’ul said to the priest:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.79",Withdraw your hand!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.80","20 And Sha’ul cried out, and all the people that were with him;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.81","they came out to the battle,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.82","and here: each one’s sword was against his neighbor,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.83",an exceedingly great panic.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.84","21 Now the Hebrews [that] had been with the Philistines yesterday [and] the day-before,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.85","in that they had gone up with them to the camp all around,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.86","they too [turned] to be with Israel, who were with Sha’ul and Yonatan,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.87","22 while all the [other] men of Israel, the ones hiding themselves in the highlands of Efrayim,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.88","heard that the Philistines had fled,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.89",and they too caught up with them in battle.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.90","23 So Y<small>HWH</small> delivered Israel on that day,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.91",and the battle crossed by Bet-Aven.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.92","24 But the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.93","for Sha’ul had put an oath-curse on the fighting-people, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.95",that I may be avenged on my enemies!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.96",So all the people did not taste food.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.97","25 Now when all the people came into the forest,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.98",there was honey on the surface of the open-field.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.99","26 And when the people came into the forest,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.100","here: honey was running free,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.101","but no one reached his hand to his mouth,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.102",for the people were afraid of the sworn-oath.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.103","27 Now Yonatan had not heard when his father had made the people swear,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.104",so he stretched out the edge of the staff that was in his hand
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.105",and dipped it into the honeycomb;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.106","then he returned his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.107",28 A man from [among] the fighting-people spoke up and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.108","Your father had the people swear, yes, swear, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.109",Doomed be the man who eats food today!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.110",And the people grew weary.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.111",29 Yonatan said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.112",My father has stirred-up-disaster for the land!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.113","Pray see: indeed, my eyes are brightened,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.114",for I tasted this little [bit of] honey;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.115","30 if the people had eaten, yes, eaten today from their enemies’ spoils that they found,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.116","indeed now, wouldn’t the strike against the Philistines have been greater?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.117","31 They struck down the Philistines on that day from Mikhmas to Ayalon,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.118",and the people grew exceedingly weary.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.119",32 So the people swooped down on the spoil
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.120","and took sheep and cattle and young-cattle, slaughtering them to the ground,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.121",and the people ate [them] with the blood.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.122","33 Someone told Sha’ul, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.123","Here, the people are sinning against Y<small>HWH</small>, in eating with the blood!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.124",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.125",You have [all] broken faith!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.126",Roll me a great stone here.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.127",34 And Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.128",Scatter among the fighting-people;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.129",you are to say to them:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.130","Each one bring close to me his ox, each one his lamb;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.131","you are to slaughter them here and are to eat,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.132",and you are not to sin against Y<small>HWH</small> by eating with the blood!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.133","So all the people brought close each one his ox in his hand that night, and they slaughtered them there."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.134",35 And Sha’ul built a sacrificial-altar to Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.135",it was the first [that he] built as an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.136",36 Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.137","Let us go down after the Philistines at night, and plunder among them until the light of daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.138",and let us not leave a man of them!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.139",They said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.140","Whatever is good in your eyes, do!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.141",But the priest said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.142",Let us draw near here to God.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.143",37 So Sha’ul inquired of God:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.144",Shall I go down after the Philistines?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.145",Will you give them into the hand of Israel?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.146",But he did not answer him on that day.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.147",38 Then Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.148","Come close to here, all the “cornerstones” of the people;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.149",know and take note
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.150",wherein this sin occurred today.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.151","39 For by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, who delivers Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.152","for even if it be Yonatan my son,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.153","indeed, he will die, yes, die!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.154",But no one answered him from all the people.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.155",40 He said to all Israel:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.156","You be on one side,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.157",and I and Yonatan my son will be on one side.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.158",The people said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.159","What is good in your eyes, do!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.160","41 Sha’ul said to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.162","Yonatan and Sha’ul were captured-by-lot,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.163",and the people escaped.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.164",42 Then Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.165",Cast [lots] between me and Yonatan my son!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.166",And Yonatan was captured-by-lot.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.167",43 Sha’ul said to Yonatan:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.168",Tell me what you have done!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.169",So Yonatan told him;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.170",he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.171","I tasted, yes, tasted with the edge of the staff that was in my hand, a little honey."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.172",Here I am; I will die.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.173",44 Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.174","Thus may God do, and thus may he add,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.175","for you shall die, yes, die, Yonatan!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.176",45 But the people said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.177","Shall Yonatan die, who has wrought this great victory in Israel?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.178","[Heaven] forbid, by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.179",if a [single] hair of his head should fall to the ground … !
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.180",For with God he has acted this day!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.181","Thus the people redeemed Yonatan, so that he did not die."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.182","46 And Sha’ul went up from [pursuing] after the Philistines,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.183",while the Philistines went back to their place.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.184","47 Now when Sha’ul had captured the kingship over Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.185",he waged battle all around against all his enemies:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.186","against Moav, against the Children of Ammon, against Edom, against the king of Tzova, and against the Philistines;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.187","and wherever he faced, he was victorious."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.188",48 He did valiantly: he struck down Amalek
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14.189",and rescued Israel from the hand of its pillager.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.1","Sha’ul Rejected II: Chap. 13 and the present one appear to be separate accounts of Sha’ul’s rejection. This is buttressed by the opening of Chap. 15, which seems oblivious to the previous events. God commands the king to utterly wipe out the Amalekites, in revenge for their treacherous actions against the Israelite ancestors at the time of the Exodus (see Exod. 17:8–16). Sha’ul is scrupulous here in one regard, making sure that the Israel-friendly Kenites who live among the enemy are not caught up in the destruction, but in the end he chooses to preserve both the best of the spoils and Agag, the Amalekite king, thus violating God’s instructions."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.2","When confronted by Shemuel, Sha’ul claims to have done God’s will, and to have saved the best animals for sacrifice to him. Further rebuke from the prophet reveals the truth: Sha’ul was afraid of his own soldiers, fearing that they, following usual practice, would not fight without promise of a reward in the form of spoils. Such a disregard of God’s honor in favor of human considerations means that Sha’ul must now forfeit his role as the founder of a dynasty, expressed through the fourfold use of “reject” in vv.23 and 26."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.3","Despite the condemnation directed at Sha’ul, the text strikingly portrays Shemuel as feeling for the king; when God first expresses regret over having made Sha’ul king, Shemuel “cried out … all night” (v.11), while at the end of the chapter (vv.30–31) he accedes to Sha’ul’s request to at least accompany him as he worships in the people’s presence. Shemuel, of course, does not extend this kind of humanity to Agag and, as far as we can tell, executes him with his own hands. But the close association between king and prophet, which had begun in the long-ago days of running after lost donkeys, would seem to have come to an end."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.4",49 Now the sons of Sha’ul were:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.5","Yonatan, Yishvi, and Malki-Shua."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.6",And the name of his two daughters:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.7","the name of the firstborn was Merav,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.8",and the name of the younger-one was Mikhal.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.9",50 And the name of Sha’ul’s wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaatz.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.10","And the name of the commander of his armed-forces was Aviner, son of Ner, Sha’ul’s uncle."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.11","51 Now Kish was the father of Sha’ul, and Ner was the father of Avner, the son of Aviel."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.12",52 And the war was strong against the Philistines all the days of Sha’ul;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.13","whenever Sha’ul would see any mighty man, or any valiant one,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.14",he would gather him to him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.15",15:1 Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.16","It is I [whom] Y<small>HWH</small> sent to anoint you as king over his people, over Israel;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.17","so-now, hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>’s words:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.18",2 Thus says Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.19","I have taken account of what Amalek did to Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.20","how he set upon him on the journey, on his going up from Egypt."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.21","3 Now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.22",go and strike down Amalek;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.23",you are to devote-to-destruction all that is his
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.24","—you are not to spare him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.25",but are to put to death [everyone]
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.26","from man to woman,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.27","from child to suckling,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.28","from ox to sheep,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.29",from camel to donkey!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.30",4 So Sha’ul summoned the fighting-people
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.31",and counted them [for war] in Tela’im:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.32",two hundred thousand foot-soldiers
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.33","along with ten thousand, the men of Judah."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.34","5 And Sha’ul came to the city of Amalek,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.35",and lay-in-ambush in the wadi.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.36",6 Now Sha’ul said to the Kenites:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.37","Come, turn aside, go down from amid the Amalekites,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.38",lest I sweep you away with them!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.39",For you—you acted with loyalty with all the Children of Israel on their going up from Egypt.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.40",So the Kenites turned aside from amid Amalek.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.41","7 And Sha’ul struck down Amalek, from Havila as far as where-you- come to Shur, which is facing Egypt."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.42","8 He seized Agag king of Amalek alive,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.43",while all the people he devoted-to-destruction with the mouth of the sword.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.44",9 But Sha’ul and the people spared Agag
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.45","and the best of the sheep and the cattle, the fat ones, the lambs and all that was goodly;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.46",they would not devote them to destruction—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.47","[only] all the property despised and rejected,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.48",<i>that</i> they devoted-to-destruction.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.49","10 Now the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Shemuel, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.50",11 I repent
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.51","that I kinged Sha’ul as king,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.52",for he has turned from [following] after me;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.53",my word he has not fulfilled!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.54","Shemuel was agitated,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.55",and he cried out to Y<small>HWH</small> all night.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.56","12 Shemuel started-early to meet Sha’ul at daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.57","and it was told to Shemuel, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.59","—here, he is setting up a monument for himself—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.60","so he turned about, crossed over, and went down to Gilgal."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.61","13 Shemuel came to Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.62",and Sha’ul said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.63",Blessed are you of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.64",I have fulfilled the word of Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.65",14 But Shemuel said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.66","Then what is this sound of sheep in my ears,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.67",and the sound of oxen that I hear?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.68",15 Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.69","From the Amalekites they have brought them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.70","and what the people spared as the best of the sheep and the oxen,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.71",in order to sacrifice them to Y<small>HWH</small> your God;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.72",what was left we devoted-to-destruction.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.73",16 Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.74","Leave off, and I will tell you what Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to me during the night."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.75",He said to him: Speak!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.76",17 Shemuel said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.77","Though you may be too small in your own eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.78","you are head of the tribes of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.79",for Y<small>HWH</small> has anointed you as king over Israel!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.80",18 Now Y<small>HWH</small> sent you on a journey;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.81",he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.82","Go, devote-to-destruction the sinners, Amalek!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.83","You are to wage battle against them, until you have finished them off."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.84",19 So why did you not hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.85",You swooped down on the spoils
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.86",and did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.87",20 Sha’ul said to Shemuel:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.88",I did hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.89",I went on the journey on which Y<small>HWH</small> sent me:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.90","I brought back Agag king of Amalek,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.91",while Amalek I devoted-to-destruction;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.92",21 but the people took from the spoils
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.93","sheep and oxen, the premier-part of what was devoted,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.94",to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> your God at Gilgal!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.95",22 Shemuel said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.96",Is there pleasure for Y<small>HWH</small> in offerings and sacrifices
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.97",more than in hearkening to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.98","Here, hearkening is better than sacrifice,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.99",attention than the fat of rams.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.100","23 Indeed, [like] the sin of diviners is revolt,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.101",[like] the iniquity of <i>terafim</i> is arrogance.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.102","Because you have rejected the word of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.103",he has rejected you as king!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.104",24 Sha’ul said to Shemuel:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.105",I have sinned;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.106","indeed, I have crossed the order of Y<small>HWH</small> and your words,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.107","for I was afraid of the people,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.108",and so I hearkened to their voice!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.109","25 But-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.110",pray bear away my sin
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.111","and return with me, so that I may bow down to Y<small>HWH</small>!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.112",26 Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.113","I will not return with you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.114","for you have rejected the word of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.115",so Y<small>HWH</small> has rejected you from being king over Israel!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.116","27 And Shemuel turned about to go,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.117","but he held on to the corner of his cloak, so that it tore."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.118",28 Shemuel said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.119",Y<small>HWH</small> has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.120","and will give it to your fellow, the one better than you!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.121",29 And also: the Eternal One of Israel does not speak-falsely and does not repent—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.122","for he is not a human-being, to repent!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.123",30 He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.124",I have sinned—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.125","now, pray honor me in front of the elders of my people, in front of Israel:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.126","return with me, so that I may bow down to Y<small>HWH</small> your God!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.127","31 So Shemuel returned after Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.128",and Sha’ul bowed down to Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.129",32 Then Shemuel said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.130",Bring close to me Agag king of Amalek!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.131",Agag went to him with faltering-steps;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.132",Agag said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.133","Indeed, the distress of death is near!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.134",33 Shemuel said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.135","Since bereaved were women by your sword,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.136",may the most bereaved of women be your mother!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.137",And Shemuel slashed Agag [to pieces] in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> at Gilgal.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.138","34 Then Shemuel went back to Rama,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.139",while Sha’ul went up to his house at the Hill of Sha’ul.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.140","35 And Shemuel did not see Sha’ul again until the day of his death,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.141","for Shemuel was mourning over Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15.142",while Y<small>HWH</small> had repented that he had made Sha’ul king over Israel.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.1","David Chosen and at Court: With Sha’ul now rejected and destined to be the last of his own dynasty to rule, the text turns to the anointing of his successor, the Judean David. Compared to the convoluted accounts of Sha’ul’s accession to the throne in Chaps. 9–10, the story in which David makes his first appearance is almost an idyll. It also fits a classic folklore pattern which we first encountered in multiple manifestations in Genesis: the choosing or triumph of the younger brother. Here, as in many fairy tales, the youngest appears last, and, like Sha’ul, he is initially hidden."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.2","The text makes the event a journey of discovery for Shemuel. God does not reveal the new king’s name to the prophet in advance, nor is it mentioned until the very end of the chapter, after the anointing. Shemuel, like us, will have to learn the criteria for divine choice. Perhaps he is blinded by Sha’ul’s failures, which he himself has taken to heart (note God’s question in v.1: “Until when will you keep on mourning for Sha’ul?”). In any event, God’s speech in v.7 centers around the idea of “seeing,” a verb and an activity that are typically associated with prophecy in the Bible (as in 9:9, above). It is used ten times in eighteen verses of the text. So the little tale incorporates both physical and figurative aspects of seeing: appearance, foresight, and insight."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.3","The fact that David is a shepherd resonates strongly in ancient culture. Moshe, of course, had followed the same vocation as an adult. The poetry of the Bible frequently contains shepherd imagery, most famously in Ps. 23 and the Song of Songs, and the figure of the Shepherd King, so beloved in the ancient Near East, easily survived to become a central motif in early Christianity."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.4","David starts on his biblical path with formidable tools. He is physically attractive and possessed of the “spirit of Y<small>HWH</small>,” like some of the leaders before him in the book of Judges. In addition, the end of our chapter reveals him as a string musician, a skill sometimes also associated with prophecy in the Bible (see II Kings 3:15). At the same time that this talent of David is described, we also learn of his reputation as a warrior. Clearly this is no ordinary shepherd boy."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.5","The section already begins what will develop into an epic struggle, not only between the two men, but between two dynastic houses. Its echo was to endure long after their own deaths."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.29",it is to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> [that] I have come!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.30","Hallow yourselves,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.31",so that you may come with me to the sacrificial-meal.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.32",So he hallowed Yishai and his sons
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.33",and invited them to the sacrificial-meal.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.34","6 Now it was, when they came,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.35",that he saw Eli’av;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.36",he said [to himself]:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.37",Surely before Y<small>HWH</small> is his anointed one!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.38",7 But Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shemuel:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.39","Do not look at what you see of him, or at the tallness of his stature,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.40",for I have rejected him!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.41",For [God sees] not as a human being sees—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.42","for a human being sees the [outer] aspect, but Y<small>HWH</small> sees the heart."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.43","8 Then Yishai called Avinadav, and had him pass before Shemuel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.44",but he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.45","Also this one, Y<small>HWH</small> has not chosen."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.46","9 And Yishai had Shamma pass by,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.47",but he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.48","Also this one, Y<small>HWH</small> has not chosen."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.49","10 Yishai had his seven sons pass before Shemuel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.50",but Shemuel said to Yishai:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.51",Y<small>HWH</small> has not chosen these!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.52",11 Then Shemuel said to Yishai:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.53",Are the lads at-an-end?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.54",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.55",There still remains the youngest—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.56","here, he is shepherding the flock."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.57",Shemuel said to Yishai:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.58","Send and fetch him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.59",for we will not sit around [the table] until his coming here.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.60",12 He sent and had him come
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.61","—now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes, and goodly in appearance."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.62",Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.63","Arise, anoint him, for this is he!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.64",13 So Shemuel took the horn of oil and anointed him amid his brothers.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.65",And the spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> advanced upon David from that day and onward.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16.66",Then Shemuel arose and went [back] to Rama.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.1","David and Golyat: Perhaps the most famous story about David, this narrative appears to have its own independent history, which, however, is difficult to untangle. Unlike most other instances, here MT is much longer than LXX. Sections exclusive to the Hebrew version are vv.12–31 (the introduction of David and his reaction to Golyat’s taunting), 41 and 48b (minor variations), 50, and 55–58 (Sha’ul inexplicably asking about David’s identity as if he had never met him previously, Chap. 16 notwithstanding). Most scholars have concluded from this that there are two traditions at work in some form, or that an “original” has given birth to one or two later versions through expansion or contraction. Given that the LXX version reads coherently on its own, many infer that MT here is in fact an expansion. Following the model of the Sinai account in Exod. 19 (see Greenberg), our present text might be viewed as a composite, a gathering of different traditions in a manner that makes for richness and completeness, despite our Western need for total coherence (Alter 1998). In a wider sense, it reflects the Bible’s general aspect of textual inclusiveness—what I would call multivocality, in which competing and even contradictory accounts are allowed to coexist for the sake of fullness."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.2","In addition to the textual issues, a battle account near the end of the book, in II Sam. 21:19, mentions how “Elhanan son of Yaarei-Oregim the Bet-Lehemite struck down Golyat the Gittite / —now the shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam,” and the same hero is identified as having killed Golyat’s brother in I Chron. 20:5. This suggests that we are dealing with an independent story which has been placed on David’s shoulders, for obvious reasons."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.3","Regardless of its various permutations, the long, leisurely David/Golyat narrative reads much like a fairy tale, and is in many respects quite accessible to many cultures. It has never lost its popularity, and the phrase “David and Goliath,” used to describe everything from business competition to sporting events, is still very much in common use. The setup is classic: a huge warrior with a reputation as a champion—“the Man of the Space-Between [the armies]” (v.4)—strides forth, mocking his enemies and challenging them to a one-on-one duel. The detailed description of Golyat’s armor is a departure from the usually sparse biblical landscape, but it is certainly psychologically appropriate here, as are the other rare biblical descriptions of a person’s attire (Hamilton)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.4","Of course, neither Sha’ul nor any of his soldiers dares fight the Philistine. It is left to a teenager untried in standard weaponry to face him. The text is clear about David’s inexperience in formal battle, but it needs to be pointed out that, although he is not a professional warrior, he is also no slouch. His description of fighting off lions and bears in his shepherd days (vv.34–36) is not a vain or irrelevant boast; in addition, v.51 describes him deftly unsheathing Golyat’s sword and finishing off the Philistine with it. Further, David’s wielding of a sling to defeat Golyat should not be trivialized. In ancient warfare, a division of slingers could be quite lethal (see the Greek account in Xenophon’s <i>Anabasis,</i> or, previously in the Bible, Judg. 20:16)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.5","In addition to the detailed military descriptions, which sound more like Homer than the Bible, the story focuses on memorable confrontations between pairs of characters: Golyat and the Israelites (vv.8–11); David and his brother Eli’av (28–29); David and Sha’ul (32–39); and, finally, David and Golyat (42–47). The last and most significant one will vault David’s prowess and fame beyond that of regular warriors, his family, and Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.6","The most surprising aspect of this tale is that it is not only, as popularly understood, a case of the weak against the strong, the small against the large. Its vocabulary in fact leads in a different direction. Only here, of all the biblical texts concerning war, does the word “ranks” occur repeatedly (twelve times); the other recurring word is the verb “mock.” This leads naturally to the conclusion that what is really at stake is the fact that “this foreskinned Philistine” has “mock[ed] the ranks of the Living God” (v.26). In other words, the story, splendidly illustrating the rise of David, centers around the perceived insult to Y<small>HWH</small> and his earthly armies, which must be properly avenged. Golyat’s literal downfall accomplishes this; his posture of falling “on his face to the ground” (v.49) is more reminiscent of proper respect and worship than the simple act of keeling over."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.7","There is one other biblical text that takes up the issue of “mocking” God using this language: II Kings 18, where the Assyrian king’s representatives taunt King Hezekiah and Y<small>HWH</small> in full hearing of the Judean troops. It is thus quite plausible that an old story has here been retold in terms and vocabulary that address the needs of a later audience."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.8","14 Now the spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> departed from Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.9",and an evil spirit from Y<small>HWH</small> began to torment him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.10",15 Sha’ul’s servants said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.11","Now here, an evil spirit of God is tormenting you;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.12",16 pray let our lord speak—your servants [stand ready] before you:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.13","let them look for a man,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.14","one who knows how to strum the lyre,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.15","so that it may be, whenever there is upon you an evil spirit of God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.16","he may strum with his hand, and it will be well with you."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.17",17 Sha’ul said to his servants:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.18","Pray select for me a man who strums well,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.19",and have him come to me!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.20",18 One of the serving-lads spoke up and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.21","Here, I have seen a son of Yishai the Bet-Lehemite, [one] who knows how to strum;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.22","a mighty-man of valor,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.23","a man of battle,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.24","skilled in words,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.25","a man of [pleasing] form,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.26",and Y<small>HWH</small> is with him!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.27","19 So Sha’ul sent messengers to Yishai, he said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.28","Send me David your son, who is with the flock!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.29","20 Yishai took a donkey [laden with] bread and a skin of wine, and one goat kid,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.30","and sent them by the hand of David his son, to Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.31","21 David came to Sha’ul, and stood before him;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.32","he grew to love him exceedingly,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.33",and he became his weapons bearer.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.34","22 And Sha’ul sent to Yishai, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.35","Now let David stand [in attendance] before me, for he has found favor in my eyes."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.36",23 And so it would be:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.37","whenever the spirit of God was upon Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.38",that David would take up the lyre and strum [it] with his hand;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.39","Sha’ul would have respite, and it would be well with him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.40",and the evil spirit would depart from him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.41",17:1 Now the Philistines gathered their encampments for battle;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.42","they gathered themselves at Sokho, which is in Yehuda,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.43","and encamped between Sokho and Azeka, at Efes-Dammim,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.44","2 while Sha’ul and the men of Israel gathered and encamped in the Valley of the Oak,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.45",and arranged-ranks for battle to meet the Philistines.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.46","3 Now the Philistines were stationed on a hill, on this-side,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.47","while Israel was stationed on a hill, on that-side,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.48",with the ravine between them.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.49","4 And the Man of the Space-Between came out, from the Philistine camps—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.50","Golyat his name, from Gat:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.51",his height was six cubits and a span;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.52","5 a helmet of bronze was on his head,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.53",with armor of scales he was clothed
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.54",—the weight of the armor was five thousand <i>shekel</i>-weights of bronze;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.55","6 greaves of bronze were on his legs,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.56",and a scimitar of bronze was between his shoulders;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.57","7 the shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.58","while the flashing-point of his spear was six hundred <i>shekel</i>-weights of iron,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.59",and the shield bearer was walking before him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.60",8 He stood and called out to the ranks of Israel;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.61",he said to them:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.62",Why do you come out and arrange-ranks in battle?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.63","Am I not a Philistine, and you the servants of Sha’ul?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.64","Pick yourselves a man, that he may come down to me!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.65","9 If he prevails in doing battle with me and strikes me down,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.66","then we will become your servants,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.67","but if I prevail against him and strike him down,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.68","then you will become our servants, and will have to serve us!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.69",10 And the Philistine said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.70","As for me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.71",I mock the ranks of Israel this day—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.72","give me a man, and let us do battle together!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.73","11 Sha’ul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.74",and they were dismayed and exceedingly frightened.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.75","12 Now David was the son of this Efratite man, from Bet-Lehem in Judah"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.76",whose name was Yishai—he had eight sons.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.77","And the man, in the days of Sha’ul, was old, advanced [in age] among men."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.78","13 Now they had gone, the three oldest sons of Yishai,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.79","gone after Sha’ul, into battle"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.80",—the name[s] of his three sons who had gone to battle were:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.81","Eli’av, the firstborn,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.82","and his second, Avinadav,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.83","and the third one, Shamma."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.84","14 As for David, he was the youngest,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.85",while the three oldest ones had gone [to follow] after Sha’ul.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.86","15 Now David would go and return from [attending] upon Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.87",to shepherd the flock of his father in Bet-Lehem.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.88","16 And the Philistine came close, early and late, and presented himself for forty days."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.89",17 Yishai said to David his son:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.90","Now take your brothers this <i>efa</i> of parched-grain, and these ten bread-loaves,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.91","and run them out to the camp to your brothers,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.92","18 and these ten cuts of milk-cheese, bring to the Commander of a Thousand."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.93","As for your brothers, take account of [their] welfare,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.94",and bring back assurance from them—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.95",19 for Sha’ul and they and all the fighting-men of Israel in the Valley of the Oak are doing battle with the Philistines.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.96",20 So David started-early in the morning;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.97","he left the flock with a watchman,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.98","lifted up [the food] and went, as Yishai had charged him, and came to the circular-camp,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.99",as the army was going out to the ranks and was shouting in battle.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.100","21 And Israel and the Philistines were arranged-in-ranks, rank opposite rank."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.101","22 David let down the gear from him, in the hand of a watchman of gear,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.102",and ran to the ranks.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.103","When he arrived, he asked about his brothers, about [their] welfare."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.104","23 While he was speaking with them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.105","here, the Man of the Space-Between was coming up, Golyat the Philistine his name, from Gat, from the ranks of the Philistines."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.106","He spoke according to those words, and David heard."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.107","24 Now all the fighting-men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled before him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.108",for they were exceedingly afraid.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.109",25 A man of Israel said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.110",Do you see this man who comes up?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.111","Indeed, it is to mock Israel that he comes up!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.112","Now it will be: the man who strikes him down, the king will enrich him with great riches,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.113","and his daughter he will give him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.114",and his Father’s House he will make free in Israel!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.115","26 David said to the men who were standing with him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.116",What shall be done for the man who strikes down this Philistine and removes the mocking from upon Israel?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.117",For who is this foreskinned Philistine
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.118",that he should mock the ranks of the Living God?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.119","27 The people told him according to those words, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.120",Thus shall be done for the man who strikes him down.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.121","28 Now Eli’av his oldest brother heard as he was speaking to the men,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.122",and Eli’av’s anger flared up against David;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.123",he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.124","Why now have you come down, and with whom have you left that little flock in the wilderness?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.125",I know your presumption and the evil-intentions of your heart—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.126","indeed, it is in order to see the battle that you have come down here!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.127",29 David said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.128",What have I done now? It was only words!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.129","30 He went around him, facing another,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.130","and spoke to him according to those words,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.131",and the people answered him with words according to the former words.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.132",31 Now the words that David had spoken were heard;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.133","they told them in the presence of Sha’ul, and he had him fetched."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.134",32 David said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.135",Do not let anyone’s heart fail him;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.136",your servant will go and do battle with this Philistine!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.137",33 But Sha’ul said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.138","You cannot prevail in going against this Philistine, to do battle with him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.139","for you are a lad,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.140",while he has been a man of battle since his youth!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.141",34 David said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.142","Your servant was a shepherd of the flock for his father,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.143","and whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.144","35 I would go out after it and strike it down, and rescue it from its mouth;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.145","if it rose against me, I would take hold of it by its beard, strike it down, and put it to death."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.146","36 Even the lion, even the bear did your servant strike down—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.147","so this foreskinned Philistine will be like one of them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.148",for he has mocked the ranks of the Living God!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.149",37 And David said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.150","Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.151","who rescued me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.152",he will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.153",Sha’ul said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.154","Go, and may Y<small>HWH</small> be with you!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.155",38 And Sha’ul clothed David in his military-garb:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.156",he placed a helmet of bronze on his head
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.157",and clothed him in armor.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.158","39 David strapped on his sword over his garb,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.159","but he was unable to walk, since he was not used [to them]."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.160",David said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.161","I cannot walk with these, since I am not used [to them]."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.162",So David removed them from himself.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.163",40 He took his stick in his hand
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.164",and chose himself five smooth stones from the wadi
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.165","and put them in the shepherd’s bag that he had, namely, in the pouch, with his sling in his hand,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.166",and approached the Philistine.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.167","41 The Philistine went, going along and coming nearer to David, with the man, the shield bearer, before him."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.168","42 And the Philistine looked out and saw David, and taunted him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.169","for he was a lad,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.170","and ruddy, beautiful of appearance."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.171",43 The Philistine said to David:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.174",And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.175",44 And the Philistine said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.176","Come to me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.177",that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.178",45 But David said to the Philistine:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.179",You come at me
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.180","with sword and spear and scimitar,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.181",but I come at you

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.186",and will remove your head from you;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.187",I will give your carcass and the carcass of the Philistine camp this day
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.188","to the birds of the heavens and to the wildlife of the earth,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.189","so that all the earth may know that Israel has a God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.190",47 and that all this assembly may know
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.191",that it is not with a sword or with a spear that Y<small>HWH</small> delivers—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.192","for the battle is Y<small>HWH</small>’s,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.193",and he will give [all of] you into our hand!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.194","48 And it was, when the Philistine arose and came near to meet David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.195",that David quickly ran toward the ranks to meet the Philistine.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.196",49 David stretched out his hand to the bag
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.197","and took from there a stone, and slung it,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.198",and struck the Philistine on his forehead:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.199",the stone sank into his forehead
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.200",and he fell on his face to the ground.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.201",50 So David overpowered the Philistine with a sling and a stone;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.202","he struck down the Philistine and put him to death,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.203",yet no sword was in David’s hand.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.204",51 And David ran and stood over the Philistine
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.205",and took his sword and drew it from its sheath
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.206",and dispatched him;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.207",he cut off his head with it.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.208","The Philistines saw that their mighty-man was dead, so they fled,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.209",52 and the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.210","they pursued after the Philistines as far as where you come to the ravine, as far as the gates of Ekron,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.211","and the Philistine slain fell in the road to Shaarayim/Double-Gate, as far as Gat, as far as Ekron."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.212","53 The Children of Israel returned from dashing-hotly after the Philistines, and they pillaged their camp."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.213","54 And David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem, while his gear he put in his tent."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.214","55 Now when Sha’ul saw David going out to meet the Philistine,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.215","he said to Avner, commander of the armed-forces:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.216","Whose son is this lad, Avner?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.217",Avner said:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.221",Whose son is this youth?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.222","57 So when David returned from striking down the Philistine,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.223","Avner took him and brought him before Sha’ul,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17.251","55 <b>Whose son:</b> Since in the ancient Near East, kings were sometimes referred to as “sons of the gods,” Sha’ul’s question is not as innocent as it seems, at least to the audience. See II Sam. 7:14."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.1","The Rise of David in Sha’ul’s House I: As if the Golyat story were not dramatic enough, the artistry of the text continues unabated in the chapters that follow. The present one highlights “love,” its chief theme word: the love borne David by Yehonatan, Sha’ul’s heir; by the Israelites, who are dazzled by David’s military exploits; and by Sha’ul’s daughter Mikhal, who not surprisingly falls for the young hero. Contrasted to this and to David’s “prospering” (vv.5, 14, 15, 30) is the jealous rage into which Sha’ul’s emotions propel him. Whether the “evil spirit from YHWH” (v.10, and see 16:14) is related to Sha’ul’s depression over having been rejected by God, or is due to a previously existing psychological state, the rise of his young rival only magnifies it. Whereas in Chap. 16 David’s lyre playing had been able to soothe the ailing king, it now spawns elaborate scheming and an outbreak of personal violence."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.2","The precise nature of the love between David and Yehonatan has been a prime subject of speculation in recent interpretations of this text. In today’s terms, the language appears strongly suggestive of a sexual relationship, although the text does not elaborate on this. Alternatively, if one reads the story in a nonsexual way, it may be reflecting a warrior society, in which male bonding has always been central. A further possibility is that the relationship is playing an ironic role in the text: the person about whom each cares the most is the one with whom he has the greatest potential political conflict."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.3","The David-Yehonatan relationship has been explicated by Ackerman in a book-length study (2005). She notes that the text, while not explicit, does utilize vocabulary that elsewhere in the Bible is clearly sexual, and that in general Yehonatan occupies a role that is emotionally and politically subordinate to David (see I Sam. 18:4, 28:13–15, and 23:17). If one accepts these arguments, the text may be putting forward a striking, if symbolic, example of how David will triumph over the House of Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.4","In any event, as with all biblical texts, readers will find multiple ways to read the same passage."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.5",58 Sha’ul said to him:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.32",but to me they give-credit for thousands!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.33",There yet [remains] for him only the kingdom!

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.38","Now there was a spear in Sha’ul’s hand,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.39",11 and Sha’ul hurled the spear; he said [to himself]:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.40",I will strike David and the wall [together]!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.41",But David evaded him twice.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.42","12 And Sha’ul was afraid before David,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.44",while from Sha’ul he had turned away.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.45",13 So Sha’ul kept him away from [being] beside him;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.46","he made him commander of a thousand,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.47",and he went out and came back before the people.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.52",for he was going out and coming back before them.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.53",17 Sha’ul said to David:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.57",and fight the battles of Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.58",—For Sha’ul said [to himself]:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.59","Let not my own hand be against him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.60",but let the Philistines’ hand be against him!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.61",18 David said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.62","Who am I and who are my living-relatives, my father’s clan in Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.63",that I should become son-in-law to the king?

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.65","at the time for giving Merav daughter of Sha’ul to David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.66",that she was given to Adriel the Maholatite as a wife.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.67","20 Now Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul had fallen in love with David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.68","and when it was told to Sha’ul, the matter was right in his eyes."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.69",21 Sha’ul said [to himself]:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.70","I will give her to him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.71","that she may become a snare to him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.72",and that the Philistines’ hand may be against him!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.73",So Sha’ul said to David a second-time:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.74",You are to become-a-son-in-law to me today!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.75",22 And Sha’ul charged his servants:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.76","Speak to David secretly, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.80",23 Sha’ul’s servants spoke these words in David’s ears.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.86",25 Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.87",Say thus to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.88","The king takes no pleasure in any bride-price except for a hundred Philistine foreskins,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.89",to be avenged on the king’s enemies
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.90",—for Sha’ul planned to cause David’s fall by the Philistines’ hand.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18.91","26 His servants told David all these words,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.1","The Rise of David in Sha’ul’s House II: Having been entranced by David in the previous chapter, Sha’ul’s children now actively take his side against their father. At first, Yehonatan’s intercession works, and his friend is restored to his position at the king’s side. But the “evil spirit” in Sha’ul cannot be denied, especially after another report of David’s successes in battle (v.8), and he once again hurls his spear at the young musician. David’s subsequent flight is the beginning of a long period of running which will end only with Sha’ul’s death. He is aided in his escape by his wife, Mikhal, who, in a scene of deception that vaguely recalls Rahel’s tricking of her father in Gen. 31:34–35, makes use of what are apparently household idols to fool the king’s messengers."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.2","But such help is not sufficient. David needs divine protection from Sha’ul, and the king’s messengers are disoriented by “ranting-in-prophecy,” followed by Sha’ul himself. While in Chap. 10 above, such behavior might have suggested the king’s special gifts and hence leadership capabilities, here, in what is perhaps originally an alternate tradition, it reduces him to a helpless babbler, and David goes unharmed. Curiously, Shemuel never feels Sha’ul’s wrath for accompanying David here."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.27","Let not the king sin against his servant, against David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.28","for he has not sinned against you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.29",for his deeds have been exceedingly to your good!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.30","5 He took his life in his hands and struck down the Philistine,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.31",and Y<small>HWH</small> wrought a great victory for all Israel
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.32",—you saw it and rejoiced.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.33",So why would you sin against innocent blood
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.34",by causing David’s death for nothing?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.35","6 Sha’ul hearkened to Yehonatan’s voice,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.36",and Sha’ul swore:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.37","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, if he should be put to death … !"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.38","7 So Yehonatan called David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.39",and Yehonatan told him all these words.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.40","Yehonatan brought David to Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.41",and he was in his presence as yesterday [and] the day-before.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.42",8 The battles continued to take place;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.43","David went out to wage battle against the Philistines,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.44","and he struck them down, a great striking-down,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.45",so that they fled before them.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.46",9 But an evil spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] upon Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.47","he was sitting in his palace-house, his spear in his hand,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.48",while David was strumming with his hand.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.49","10 And Sha’ul sought to strike, with the spear, David and the wall [together],"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.50","but he slipped away from Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.51","so that he struck [only] the wall with his spear,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.52","and David fled, and escaped on that night."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.53","11 Sha’ul sent messengers to David’s house, to watch out for him and to put him to death at daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.54","but Mikhal, David’s wife, reported to him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.55","If you don’t escape with your life tonight,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.56",tomorrow you will be put to death!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.57",12 So Mikhal let David down through the window;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.58","he went off, got away, and escaped."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.59","13 Then Mikhal took the <i>terafim</i> and put it in the bed,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.60","and a tangle of goats’-hair she put at its head,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.61",and covered it with a garment.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.62","14 And when Sha’ul sent messengers to take David, she said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.63",He is sick.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.64","15 Then Sha’ul sent the messengers to see David, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.65","Bring him up in the bed to me, to put him to death!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.66","16 But when the mesengers arrived,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.67","here, the <i>terafim</i> were in the bed, with a tangle of goats’-hair at its head!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.68",17 Sha’ul said to Mikhal:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.69",Why have you deceived me thus?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.70","You have sent my enemy free, so that he has escaped!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.71",Mikhal said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.72",He said to me: Send me free—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.73",why should I cause your death?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.74","18 Now David had gotten away and escaped, coming to Shemuel at Rama,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.75",and had told him all that Sha’ul had done to him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.76","He went, he and Shemuel, and they stayed at Nayot."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.77","19 Now it was told to Sha’ul, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.78","Here, David is at Nayot in Rama!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.79","20 So Sha’ul sent messengers to fetch David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.80","and they saw a group of prophets ranting-in-prophecy,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.81","with Shemuel standing [there], stationed over them."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.82","And there [came] upon Sha’ul’s messengers the spirit of God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.83","so that they ranted-like-prophets, they too."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.84","21 They told Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.85","and he sent other messengers,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.86","but they ranted-like-prophets, they too."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.87","And Sha’ul again sent, a third [group of] messengers,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.88","but they ranted-like-prophets, they too."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.89","22 So he went, he too, to Rama;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.90","he arrived at the great cistern that is in Sekhu,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.91","and made inquiry, and said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.92",Where are Shemuel and David?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.93",They said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.94","Here, in Nayot in Rama."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.95","23 So he went there, to Nayot in Rama,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.96","and there [came] upon him, him too, the spirit of God;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19.97","he went, going along and ranting-like-a-prophet, until he arrived at the shepherds’-camps in Rama."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.1","Final Break; The Covenant of the Friends: In a last-ditch attempt to save his friend’s life, Yehonatan offers to intercede with Sha’ul. David proposes a simple test: if Sha’ul can accept David’s absence on a family matter, it will be a sign that he is once again in the king’s good graces, but if Sha’ul is unconvinced and agitated by the explanation given to him, the two friends will have to concede that there is no chance to mend the rift. The story makes use of an additional character through whom David and Yehonatan can communicate, an unsuspecting young servant who is sent to fetch arrows that Yehonatan shoots. Depending on the instructions given him, he is to (unwittingly) signal to David that all is either well or ill. Appropriately, the narrative echoes with repetitions of “good” and “evil,” referring to David’s fate."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.2","The scene in which the prince sets out to determine his father’s attitude toward David (vv.27–33) is nicely constructed around the word “son.” David is referred to derisively (by omitting his given name), as the “son of Yishai”; Sha’ul insults Yehonatan by calling him the “son of a twisted rebellion”; and then Sha’ul pronounces the death sentence on his young rival by literally terming him a “son of death.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.3","The most significant repeating word in the story, however, is “know,” occurring nine times, which highlights a central concern in the text: David wishes to convince Yehonatan that there is no hope for any kind of reconciliation. That is, through the scenes of confrontation with Sha’ul, Yehonatan finally becomes convinced of what the audience “knew” all along. The story ends with a heartfelt covenant between the two young men, which is all the more ironic given that later events in the book will witness tension and death as the chief currencies between the House of David and the House of Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.4","24 And he stripped off, he too, his garments,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.5","and ranted-like-a-prophet, he too, before Shemuel;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.6",he fell down naked all that day and all night.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.7",Therefore they say:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.8",Is Sha’ul too among the prophets?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.9",20:1 Now David had gotten away from Nayot in Rama;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.10",he came and said before Yehonatan:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.11",What have I done?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.12","What is my iniquity, what is my sin before your father,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.13",that he seeks my life?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.14",2 He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.15",[Heaven] forbid!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.16",You will not die—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.17","here, my father does not do anything great or anything small without baring my ear."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.18",So for-what-reason should my father hide this matter from me?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.19",This cannot [be]!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.20",3 David swore again and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.21","Your father knows, yes, knows"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.22","that I have found favor in your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.23",so he has said [to himself]:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.24","Yehonatan is not to know about this, lest he be pained;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.25","but: by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, and by your life,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.26","indeed, there is only something like a step between me and death!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.27",4 Yehonatan said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.28","Whatever you yourself say, I will do for you."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.29",5 David said to Yehonatan:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.30","Here, the New-Moon is tomorrow,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.31","when I must sit, yes, sit beside the king to eat;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.32","send me away, and I will hide in the open-field, until the third sunset."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.33","6 Now if your father takes account, yes, account of my [absence]"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.34","and you say: David requested, yes, requested-leave for himself from me to run back to Bet-Lehem his town,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.35","for the yearly sacrificial-meal is there, for the entire clan—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.36",7 if he says thus: Good!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.37",it is well for your servant.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.38","But if he is agitated, yes, agitated,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.39",know that evil has been determined by him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.40","8 So act with loyalty toward your servant,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.41",for you brought your servant into Y<small>HWH</small>’s covenant with you.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.42","Now if there be any iniquity in me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.43","put me to death yourself,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.44","so to your father, why then should you bring me?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.45",9 Yehonatan said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.46",[Heaven] forbid for you!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.47","If I were to know, yes, know that evil is determined by my father to come against you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.48",would I not tell that to you?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.49",10 David said to Yehonatan:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.50",Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.51",11 Yehonatan said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.52","Come, let us go out to the field."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.53",The two of them went out to the field.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.54",12 And Yehonatan said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.55","By Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.56","when I have sounded out my father at this time tomorrow [or] the third [day],"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.57","and here: good is [determined] toward David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.58",shall I not then send to you and bare your ear?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.59","13 Thus may Y<small>HWH</small> do to Yehonatan, and thus may he add:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.60","if it seems good to my father, the evil [determined] against you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.61",I will bare your ear
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.62","and will send you away, that you may go in peace."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.63","And may Y<small>HWH</small> be with you, as he was with my father!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.64","14 Will you not, while I am still alive,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.65","will you not deal with me in the loyalty of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.66",so that I do not die?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.67","15 You must not cut off your loyalty from my house, for the ages,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.68","not even when Y<small>HWH</small> cuts off David’s enemies, each one from the face of the ground!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.69",16 Yehonatan has cut [a covenant] with the House of David;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.70",may Y<small>HWH</small> seek it from the hand of “David’s enemies”!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.71","17 And Yehonatan swore to David again, by his love for him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.72",for he loved him with the love [he had] for his own self.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.73",Then Yehonatan said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.74",18 Tomorrow is the New-Moon;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.75","you will be counted-missing, for your seat will be counted-empty."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.76","19 When you are three-days-gone, go down exceedingly [quickly],"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.77","and when you come to the place where you were hiding at the time of the incident,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.78",you are to sit near that stone.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.79","20 As for me, I will shoot three arrows to the side, to send them flying from me at a target."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.80","21 And here, I will send the serving-lad toward you, [saying]:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.81","Go, find the arrows!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.82","If I say, yes, say to the lad:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.83","Here, the arrows are [to the side] of you, over there—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.84","take them and come back, for it is well for you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.85","there is no problem, by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.86",22 But if I say thus to the boy:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.87","Here, the arrows are [to the side] of you, farther onward—go,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.88",for Y<small>HWH</small> will have sent you away.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.89","23 And as for the promise that we have spoken, I and you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.90","here, Y<small>HWH</small> will be between me and you, for the ages!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.91",24 So David hid in the open-field.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.92","Now it was at the New-Moon, that the king sat by the food, to eat,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.93","25 and the king sat in his seat as time and time [before],"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.94",in the seat by the wall.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.95","Yehonatan was at-the-ffont, and Avner sat at the side of Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.96",while David’s place was counted-empty.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.97","26 Now Sha’ul did not say anything on that day,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.98",for he said [to himself]:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.99",It is an accident;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.100","he is not ritually-pure, for he has not been purified."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.101","27 But it was on the morrow of the New-Moon, on the second [day],"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.102",that David’s place was counted-empty.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.103",So Sha’ul said to Yehonatan his son:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.104","For-what-reason has the son of Yishai not come, even yesterday, even today, to the food?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.105",28 Yehonatan answered Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.106","David requested, yes, requested-leave for himself from me, to Bet- Lehem;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.107","29 he said: Pray send me off,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.108","for it is the sacrificial-meal of the clan for us in the town,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.109",and my brother charged me.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.110","So-now, if I have found favor in your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.111","pray let me get away, that I may see my brothers."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.112",Therefore he has not come to the king’s table.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.113",30 Sha’ul’s anger flared up against Yehonatan;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.114",he said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.115",[You] son of a twisted rebellion!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.116","Don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Yishai,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.117",to your shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.118","31 For all the days that the son of Yishai is alive on the earth,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.119","you will not be firmly-established, you or your kingdom!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.120","So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.121","send and fetch him to me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.122",for he is a son of death!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.123",32 Yehonatan answered Sha’ul his father;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.124",he said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.125",Why should he be put to death? What has he done?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.126","33 But Sha’ul hurled the spear at him, to strike him down,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.127",and so Yehonatan knew
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.128",that his father had determined to put David to death.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.129",34 Yehonatan arose from the table in blazing anger;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.130","he did not eat food on the second day of the New-Moon,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.131","since he was pained about David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.132",since his father had humiliated him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.133","35 So it was at daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.134","that Yehonatan went out to the open-field to the appointment with David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.135",a young serving-lad with him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.136","36 He said to his lad: Run, now find the arrows that I shoot!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.137","As the lad ran, he shot an arrow past him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.138","37 and when the lad came to the place of the arrow that Yehonatan had shot,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.139","Yehonatan called after the lad, he said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.140","Isn’t the arrow [to the side] of you, and farther onward?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.141",38 And Yehonatan called after the lad:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.142",Quick! Hurry! Don’t stand still!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.143",So Yehonatan’s serving-lad collected the arrows and brought them to his lord.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.144",39 Now the lad knew nothing;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.145",only Yehonatan and David knew about the matter.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.146",40 And Yehonatan gave his weapons to the lad that he had;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.147",he said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.148","Go, bring [these back] to the town."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.159","26 <b>an accident … not ritually-pure:</b> The New Moon festival required ritual purity of its participants; if one had a bodily discharge of the “polluting” kind, for instance (see Lev. 12–15), one was temporarily excluded."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.160","27 <b>the morrow of the New-Moon:</b> See Fishbane for a discussion of this difficult phrase, which historically has raised ritual calendar questions among Jews in its appearance in Lev. 23:15’s “the morrow of the Sabbath.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.161","29 <b>get away:</b> Or “free to go” (McCarter 1980); the word, though, is most often found in contexts of survival, and so its use may be a bit ironic here. Fokkelman (1981) understands it as a Freudian slip which enrages Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.162","30 <b>[You] son of a twisted rebellion!:</b> Ehrlich points out that Sha’ul would not insult his lone wife as the “perverse, rebellious woman” found in most translations. Instead, he proposes that Yehonatan, in the eyes of Sha’ul, is advocating overthrowing his own father by allowing David to live—a “twisted” act. <b>the son of Yishai:</b> Once again, omitting a person’s given name is usually understood in the Bible as an insult."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20.163",31 <b>firmly-established:</b> Or “secure.” <b>a son of death:</b> Or “a dead man.”
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.1","David at Nov and Gat: David the fugitive has two pressing needs, food and weapons, as he flees from Sha’ul. Arriving at Nov, his solitary presence arouses suspicions, but he is able to allay these through his cunning (note the recurrence of the related word “know” in v.3). We, of course, know that the “matter of the king” is no secret message, but rather refers to the fact that David is on the lam from Sha’ul. In any event, he is able to obtain bread and a sword—not just any weapon, but precisely the great sword of Golyat, which symbolically suggests David’s ability to prevail in the most difficult of circumstances."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.2","Thus armed, David meets his third challenge of the chapter. He flees to the heart of enemy country, one of the Philistine towns, and is apparently recognized, exposing himself to immediate danger. In a final example of quick thinking, and perhaps an ironic reference to Sha’ul’s erstwhile ranting, he pretends to be crazy, dispelling the fears of the Philistines as to his identity."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.3","41 When the lad went off,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.4","David arose from beside the mound,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.5","flung himself on his nostrils to the ground, and bowed low three times,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.6","and each one kissed his fellow,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.7","each one wept with his fellow, until David [had wept] a great deal."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.8",42 Yehonatan said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.9","Go in peace,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.17","For-what-reason are you alone, and no one with you?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.18",3 David said to Ahimelekh the priest:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.19","The king has charged me with a matter,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.20",he said to me:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.21","No one is to know anything of the matter on which I am sending you, with which I have charged you!"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.25","Give five [rounds of] bread into my hand, or whatever is found."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.26",5 The priest answered David and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.27","There is no ordinary bread on hand,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.28",only hallowed bread is there—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21.29","provided that the lads have kept themselves away, of course, from women."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.1","David in Flight; Sha’ul’s Revenge: From Gat, David moves southeast into the Judean hill-country. Here he becomes a kind of Robin Hood figure, attracting the disenfranchised (who are described as a class in other ancient Near Eastern texts) and serving as their chief. Sha’ul, meanwhile, vents his frustration on the priests of Nov, who are aghast to learn that the David to whom they gave food and weaponry in the previous chapter, and who had hitherto been a trusted key member of the royal household, is now accounted the king’s “ambusher” (v.13). Sha’ul’s command to kill the priests is resisted by his servants, but as so often in literature and in life, a volunteer comes forward, in this case Do’eg the Edomite. And, true to type, there is a survivor, Evyatar, who finds secure refuge with David. Together with his son, he will later become one of David’s priests (II Sam. 8:17, 20:25)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.2",6 David answered the priest;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.3",he said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.4","Certainly women have been held back from us, so yesterday [and] the day-before;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.5","whenever I went out, the lads’ gear was hallowed, even [if it was] an ordinary journey—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.6",how much more so today the gear should be hallowed!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.7","7 So the priest gave him hallowed [bread],"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.8","for there was no bread there except for the Bread of the Presence that was removed from the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.9",for [them] to put warm bread [there] at the time of its being taken away.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.10","8 Now a man was there from the servants of Sha’ul that day,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.11",held-in-custody in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.13",chief of the shepherds that belonged to Sha’ul.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.14",9 David said to Ahimelekh:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.15",Don’t you have on hand here a spear or a sword?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.16","For neither my sword nor my weapons did I take along in my hand,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.17",for the matter of the king was urgent!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.18",10 The priest said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.19","The sword of Golyat the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of the Oak—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.20","here it is, wrapped up in a cloth, behind the <i>efod.</i>"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.21","If it is what you wish to take for yourself, take it,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.22",for there is no other one besides it in this [place].
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.23",David said: There is none like it—give it to me!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.24",11 And David arose
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.25","and got away on that day from before Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.26",and came to Akhish king of Gat.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.27",12 Now the servants of Akhish said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.28","Isn’t this David, the king of the land?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.29","Isn’t it about this one that they chant in [their] dances, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.30","Sha’ul has struck down his thousands,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.31",but David—his myriads!?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.32","13 David took these words to heart, and was exceedingly afraid in the presence of Akhish king of Gat,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.33",14 so he altered his demeanor in their eyes
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.34",and acted deranged [while] in their hands:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.35",he drummed on the doors of the gate
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.36",and let his spittle run down his beard.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.37",15 And Akhish said to his servants:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.38","Here, look at this one acting-like-a-madman!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.39",Why do you bring him to me?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.40",16 Do I lack madmen
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.41",that you have brought this one to act-like-a-madman around me?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.42",Should this one come into my house?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.43",22:1 David went from there and escaped to the Cave of Adullam.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.44","His brothers and his whole Father’s House heard,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.45",and they went down to him there.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.46","2 And there gathered to him every man in straits, every man who had a creditor, and every man of bitter feelings,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.47",and he became commander over them.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.48",And there were with him about four hundred men.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.49",3 David went from there to Mitzpe / Lookout of Moav;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.50",he said to the king of Moav:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.51",Pray let my father and my mother stay with you
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.52",until I know what God [intends to] do with me.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.53","4 So he led them into the presence of the king of Moav, and they stayed with him, all the days of David’s being at the stronghold."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.54",5 But the prophet Gad said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.55",You are not to stay at the stronghold;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.56","go, come on your [way] to the land of Judah."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.57",So David went and came to the Forest of Heret.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.58","6 And Sha’ul heard that [the whereabouts of] David were known, and of the men that were with him."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.59","Now Sha’ul was staying at Giv’a, under a tamarisk at Rama, with his spear in his hand,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.60",and all his servants were standing-in-attendance around him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.61",7 Sha’ul said to his servants who were standing around him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.62","Now hearken, O Binyaminites:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.63",Is it really to all of you that the son of Yishai will give fields and vineyards?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.64","Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.65",8 that all of you have banded together against me?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.66",No one bares my ear when my son cuts [a covenant] with the son of Yishai;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.67",none of you is concerned about me or bares my ear
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.68","[to reveal] that my son has raised up my servant against me as an ambusher, as is this day!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.69",9 Then Do’eg the Edomite spoke up
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.70",—he was standing around the servants of Sha’ul—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.71",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.72","I saw the son of Yishai come to Nov, to Ahimelekh son of Ahituv;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.73","10 he inquired for him of Y<small>HWH</small>, and provisions he gave him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.74",and the sword of Golyat the Philistine he gave him!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.75",11 So the king sent to call Ahimelekh son of Ahituv the priest
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.76","along with all his Father’s House, the priests who were at Nov,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22.77",and all of them came to the king.

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.70",so he said to Evyatar the priest: Bring the <i>efod</i> close!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.71",10 Then David said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.72","O Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.73","your servant has heard, yes, heard"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.74","that Sha’ul is seeking to enter Ke’ila, to bring-ruin to the town on my account."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.75",11 Will the inhabitants of Ke’ila turn me over to his hand?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.76","Will Sha’ul come down, as your servant has heard?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.77","O Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.78",now tell your servant.…
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.79",Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.80",He will come down.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.81",12 David said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.82","Will the inhabitants of Ke’ila turn me over, along with my men, into the hand of Sha’ul?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.83",Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.84",They will turn [you] over.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.85","13 So David and his men arose, some six hundred men;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.86","they moved out from Ke’ila, and went about wherever they could go about."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.87","Now when it was told to Sha’ul that David had escaped from Ke’ila,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.88",he held back from moving out.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.89","14 And David stayed in the wilderness, in the strongholds;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.90","he stayed in the highlands, in the Wilderness of Zif,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.91","and Sha’ul sought him all the days,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.92",but God did not give him into his hand.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.93",15 And David saw that Sha’ul was going forth to seek his life
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.94","—David was in the Wilderness of Zif, in the woods."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.95",16 But Yehonatan son of Sha’ul arose and went to David in the woods;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.96",he strengthened his hand in God
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.97",17 and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.98","Do not be afraid,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.99",for the hand of Sha’ul my father will not find you;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.100","you yourself will reign as king over Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.101",and I myself will be second-in-command to you.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.102",Even Sha’ul my father knows this!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.103",18 So the two of them cut a covenant in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.104","And David stayed in the woods, while Yehonatan went back to his house."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.105","19 Some Zifites went up to Sha’ul at Giv’a, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.106","Is not David hiding himself among us in the strongholds in the woods,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.107",at the Hill of Hakhila which is to the right/south of the wasteland?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.108","20 So-now, according to all your craving, O king, to come down— come down,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.109","and [it will be] our [task], turning him over to the king’s hand."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.110",21 Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.111","Blessed are you of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.112",that you have taken pity on me!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.113","22 Now go, be determined once-again,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.114","know and take-note of his place where his foot is [now and] who has seen him there,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.115","for they have said to me that he acts-shrewdly, yes, shrewdly."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.116",23 So take-note and know
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.117","in which of all the hiding-places he hides himself,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.118",and return to me when it is determined;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.119","then I will go with you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.120","and it will be: if he is in the region,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.121",I will search for him among all the thousands of Judah.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.122","24 They arose and went to Zif, ahead of Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.123","while David and his men were in the Wilderness of Ma’on/Abode, in the plain to the right of the wasteland."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.124","25 And Sha’ul and his men went to seek [him],"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.125","and it was told to David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.126",so he went down to a certain crag and stayed in the Wilderness of Ma’on.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.127","Sha’ul heard, and pursued after David, in the Wilderness of Ma’on:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.128","26 Sha’ul went on [one] side of a hill, over-here,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.129","with David and his men on the [other] side of the hill, over-there."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.130","Now David was hastening to get away from Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.131","while Sha’ul and his men were closing in on David and his men, to seize them."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.132","27 But a messenger came to Sha’ul, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.133","Come quickly,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.134",for Philistines are sweeping down on the region!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.135",28 So Sha’ul had to turn back from pursuing after David;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.136",he went to meet the Philistines.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.137",Therefore that place was called: Crag of the Parting.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.138",24:1 And David went up from there
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1.139",and stayed in the strongholds of En-Gedi.

By good fortune, the king is literally exposed, vulnerable in a private moment. David’s response, though short of assassination, is the still significant act of cutting off the corner of Sha’ul’s cloak, equivalent in the ancient Near East to the filching of a person’s wallet or passport. After the fact, David is portrayed in the text as remorseful, feeling that he has tarnished the office of the monarchy."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.2","For the first time since Chap. 18, the two men meet and exchange words. But what a conversation it is! From a distance, David admits his originally murderous intent, but then focuses on his compassion and his innocence (vv.11–12). He does this in a speech which seven times (vv.11–16) features “hand,” a word that usually denotes power and personal responsibility in the Bible. Sha’ul is forced to acknowledge his own culpability, and can only confirm David’s future ascension to the throne. His one request of his successor is full of pathos and reflects good Israelite ideology: he asks that in the inevitable struggle for power, his children and grandchildren may be spared, so that his name will survive. The verb utilized, “[not] to cut off,” nicely dovetails with its earlier use in the chapter, describing David’s actions (Hamilton)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.3","A final section (25:1) seals Sha’ul’s fate. Shemuel, who had anointed him in the first place, finally dies. Now the king, who had already felt deserted by both his courtiers and his children, is truly alone, although he will turn to his old friend again in Chap. 28, despite the fact that at that point they occupy the separate worlds of the living and the dead."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.4","2 Now it was, when Sha’ul returned from [chasing] after the Philistines,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.5","that it was told to him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.6","Here, David is in the Wilderness of En-Gedi!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.7","3 So Sha’ul took three thousand men, hand-picked from all Israel,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.9","4 He came to some sheep pens along the way, and there was a cave there,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.10","and Sha’ul went in to “cover his feet,”"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.11",while David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.12",5 And David’s men said to him:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.19",because he had cut off the corner that belonged to Sha’ul.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.20",7 He said to his men:

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.28",9 But David arose after that
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.29","and came out of the cave, and he called out after Sha’ul, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1.30",My lord king!

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.1","David Held Back from Killing Naval: The reader, like David, could use a break from Sha’ul’s relentless manhunt, but instead of some sort of humorous diversion such as we might expect in Shakespeare, we are presented with a story relating to David’s wilderness years that makes some important points about his personality, romantic aspects aside. With its fairy-tale beginning (again, “[there was] a man …”), it features a hero with a problem, a bad-tempered villain, and a beautiful and wise problem-solver who, of course, marries the hero at the end of the story."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.2","As he had done in Chap. 20, David requests food on his arrival in a new place, going to great lengths to demonstrate his worthiness by pointing out the exemplary behavior of his whole band. The churlish Naval’s answer (vv.10–11) is not only negative but deeply offensive, with the tone equivalent to “Who do these runaway slaves think they are?!” For David the warrior and man of action there can be only one possible response: to strap on his sword and have his followers do the same. By v.22 he is vowing to wipe out Naval and his household like dogs, using a particularly colorful biblical expression."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.3","Violence is averted only by the wisdom and timely intervention of the fair Avigayil. In a long and masterful speech (vv.24–31), she stresses how David must not act alone in this matter, “shed[ding] blood for nothing” (v.31), for that would taint his future status as the founder of a dynasty. Instead, she suggests, God will take care of the matter. Her plea and David’s response bespeak prevention and restraint, and suffice to preserve his integrity and public innocence. The text draws a nice contrast between the threefold “peace” and the threefold “sword” (Hamilton). It also has Avigayil use “my lord” no less than fourteen times, a repetition that may seem overly groveling to modern ears but which serves to accomplish her purpose."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.4","Naval’s fate is sealed, and is played out in a striking way. It requires only the words of his wife, reporting her conversation with David, to induce something like a stroke in the drunken husband; he is thus killed not by the hotheaded David but by the proper judgment of God."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.5","Only at the very end of the tale (vv.43–44) are we informed that part of its raison d’être, David’s need for women, is that Sha’ul had taken away David’s wife (and the king’s daughter) Mikhal and given her to another."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.6","The placement of this story precisely at this point in the larger narrative warrants some thought, bracketed as it is by the two accounts of David’s opportunity to kill Sha’ul. From one point of view, the text goes out of its way to declare David’s innocence in both of those chapters:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.7",[Heaven] forbid for me from Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.8","if I should do this thing to my lord, to Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.13",from stretching out my hand against Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one! (26:11)
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.14","But Chap. 25 strongly suggests that David is not as pure-hearted and in control of himself as one might think, as he comes within a hair of taking a brutal revenge upon Naval. The bracketing chapters, in other words, may be protesting too much. These kinds of doubts will accompany many of the narratives about David and Sha’ul, extending to the untimely ends of Sha’ul’s descendants and generals subsequent to the death of the king himself."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.15","Sha’ul looked behind him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.16","and David prostrated himself, nostrils to the earth, and bowed low,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.57",does he send him off on the way in good-condition?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.58","May Y<small>HWH</small> pay you back in-good-measure for this day,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.59",for what you have done with me!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.60","21 So-now, here: I know"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.61","that you will reign as king, yes, king,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.62",and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.63","22 so-now, swear to me by Y<small>HWH</small>:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.64","if you should cut off my seed after me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.65",if you should wipe out my name from my Father’s House … !
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.66",23 And David swore to Sha’ul.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.67","Then Sha’ul went back to his house,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.68",while David and his men went up to the stronghold.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.69",25:1 Shemuel died;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.70","all Israel gathered and beat [the breast] for him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.71",and they buried him at his house in Rama.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.72",Then David arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ma’on.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.73","2 Now [there was] a man in Ma’on, with his business in Carmel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.74",and the man was exceedingly great [in wealth]:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.75","he had sheep, three thousand, and a thousand goats,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.76",and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.77","3 The man’s name was Naval,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.78",and his wife’s name was Avigayil.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.79","Now the woman was of good sense, and beautiful of form,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.80",but the man was rough and evil in deeds;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.81",he was a Calevite.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.82","4 And David heard in the wilderness that Naval was shearing his sheep,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.83","5 so David sent ten serving-lads,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.84",and David said to the lads:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.85",Go up to Carmel
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.86","and come to Naval, and inquire of him in my name for peace,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.87",6 and say thus: To Life!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.88","[May] you [be in] peace, your house [be in] peace, and all that belongs to you [be in] peace!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.89","7 So-now, I have heard that you have shearers;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.90",now: the shepherds that belong to you were with us—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.91","we did not hurt them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.92","and nothing has been unaccounted for by them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.93",all the time of our being in Carmel.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.94","8 Inquire of your lads, and they will tell you."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.95","So may [my] lads find favor in your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.96",for upon a good day we have come—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.97","now give whatever you can find in your hand to your servant, to your son David!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.98",9 So David’s lads came
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.99","and spoke to Naval according to all these words, in David’s name,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.100",and then they stood-at-ease.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.101",10 Naval answered David’s servants; he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.102",Who is David? Who is the son of Yishai?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.103","Nowadays there are many servants who break away, each one from his lord!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.104","11 So should I take away my bread, my water and my butchered-meat that I butchered for my shearers,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.105",and give it to men who are from I don’t know where?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.106","12 David’s lads turned about, [back] on their way;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.107",they returned and came and told him in accordance with all these words.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.108",13 Then David said to his men:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.109",Each one gird on his sword!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.110","Each one girded on his sword,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.111",and also David girded on his sword;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.112","they went up behind David, about four hundred men,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.113",while two hundred stayed with the gear.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.114",14 Now Avigayil wife of Naval
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.115","was told by a lad from among the serving-lads, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.116","Here, David sent messengers from the wilderness to give blessing- of-greeting to our lord,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.117",but he shrieked at them.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.118",15 Now the men were exceedingly good to us;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.119","we were not hurt, we did not [find] anything unaccounted for"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.120","all the days we went about with them, during our being in the open-field;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.121","16 they were a wall about us,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.122","even by day, even by night,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.123",all the days we were beside them herding the sheep.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.124","17 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.125","know and take-note what you should do,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.126",for evil is concluded against our lord and against his entire house!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.127",But he is [too] base a fellow for speaking to!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.128","18 Avigayil quickly took two hundred loaves-of-bread and two skins of wine,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.129",five sheep made ready and five <i>sei’as</i> of parched-grain
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.130","and a hundred raisin-cakes and two hundred pressed-figs,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.131",and she put them on some donkeys.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.132",19 Then she said to her lads:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.133","Cross on ahead of me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.134","here, I will be coming behind you—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.135",but her husband Naval she did not tell.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.136","20 Now she was riding on the donkey, going down a covert in a hill:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.137","but here were David and his men, going down toward her,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.138",and she encountered them.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.139",21 Now David had said [to himself]:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.140","Surely in vain did I keep-safe all that belongs to this one in the wilderness,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.141","though from all that belongs to him, nothing was unaccounted for—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.142",he has returned to me evil in place of good!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.143","22 Thus may God do to “the enemies of” David, and thus may he add,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.144","if I leave from all that belongs to him, by daybreak, [even] one pissing against the wall!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.145","23 When Avigayil saw David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.146",she quickly got down from the donkey
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.147","flung herself before David, on her face,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.148",and bowed low to the ground.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.149",24 She flung herself at his feet and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.150","On <i>me,</i> my lord, be the iniquity!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.151","Now let your maidservant speak in your ear,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.152",and hearken to the words of your maidservant:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.153","25 now let not my lord pay any mind to this base man, to Naval,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.154","for as his name is, so is he:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.155","Naval/Vile-One is his name, and vileness is with him!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.156","But as for me, your maidservant,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.157",I did not see my lord’s lads whom you sent.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.158","26 So-now, my lord,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.159","by the life of Y<small>HWH</small> and by your life,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.160","[given] that Y<small>HWH</small> has prevented you from coming into blood-guilt,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.161","namely, delivering yourself by your hand [alone]—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.162","so-now,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.164","yes, those who seek evil against my lord!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.165","27 And now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.166","this token-of-blessing that your handmaid has brought to my lord,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.167",let it be given to the lads who go about in my lord’s footsteps.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.168","28 O bear-in-forgiveness the transgression of your maidservant,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.169","for when Y<small>HWH</small> makes, yes, makes for my lord a secure house"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.171",and no evil may be found in you [all] your days—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.172","29 should anyone arise to pursue you, to seek your life,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.173","may my lord’s life be bound up in the bundle of life with Y<small>HWH</small> your God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.174",but may the life of your enemies be slung away in the hollow of a sling!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.175","30 And may it be,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.176","when Y<small>HWH</small> does for my lord in accordance with all that he promised, the good things for you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.177",and he commissions you as <i>Nagid</i> over Israel:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.178","31 then do not let this be for you an obstacle, or a stumbling-block of heart for my lord,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.179","to shed blood for nothing,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.180",for my lord to find deliverance by himself [alone]!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.181","And when Y<small>HWH</small> does-good to my lord,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.182",then call-to-mind your maidservant!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.183",32 David said to Avigayil:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.184","Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.185",who has sent you this day to meet me!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.186","33 And blessed is your discernment, and blessed are you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.187","who has prevented me this day from coming into blood-guilt, delivering myself by my hand [alone]."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.188","34 For: by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, who has held me back from doing-evil to you—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.189","indeed, had you not quickly come to meet me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44.190","there would not have been left to Naval, by the light of daybreak, [even] one pissing against the wall!"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.1","David Holds Back from Killing Sha’ul II: An alternative tradition to the one in Chap. 24 is more expansive. It is marked by multiple conversations (between David and Avishai, David and Avner, and Sha’ul and David) and more psychological detail. David’s actions here are also more risk-filled than they were in Chap. 24, with Sha’ul’s generals and soldiers immediately present, yet he is also clearly protected by YHWH (see v.12). The motif word “hand” returns (vv.8, 9, 11, 18, 23) to link the two accounts. Of greatest interest is the verbal connection with the Naval story of the previous chapter: David has learned his lesson—YHWH will “smite” Sha’ul, either naturally or in battle (v.10), just as he “smote” Naval in 25:38, and David will not have to bear either the guilt or the political consequences."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.2","The abiding question is whether David acts here out of true piety and regard for the “divine right of kings” or whether he is simply politically astute. The text leaves it for the reader to decide (for a strong vote for the former, see Borgman; most recent commentators are highly skeptical of David’s motives)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.3","35 David took from her hand what she had brought him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.4",and to her he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.5",Go up in peace to your house;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.6","see,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.7","I have hearkened to your voice, and have lifted up your face!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.8","36 Avigayil went back to Naval,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.9","and here, he was having a drinkfest in his house, like a king’s drinkfest."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.10",Now Naval’s heart was in good-humor upon him—he was drunk to excess—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.11","so she did not tell him a thing, small or great, until the light of daybreak."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.12","37 But it was at daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.13","when the wine was going out of Naval,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.14","that his wife told those things to him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.15","and his heart died within him, and he himself became [like] a stone."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.16",38 It was about ten days [later]
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.17","that Y<small>HWH</small> attacked Naval, so that he died."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.18","39 David heard that Naval was dead,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.19",and he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.20","Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.21","who has upheld my cause at having been mocked at the hand of Naval,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.23","And as for the evildoing of Naval, Y<small>HWH</small> has returned it on his head."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.24","David sent and spoke for Avigayil, to take her as a wife for him;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.25","40 David’s servants came to Avigayil, to Carmel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.26","and spoke to her, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.27","David has sent us to you, to take you as a wife for him."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.28","41 She proceeded to bow down, nostrils to the ground,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.29",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.30","Here, your maidservant is a handmaid to wash the feet of my lord’s servants!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.31","42 Avigayil quickly arose and mounted a donkey, with five of her girls who went behind her;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.32","she went after David’s messengers,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.33",and she became a wife for him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.34","43 Now Ahinoam [too] David had taken, from Yizre’el,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.35",and the two of them alike became wives for him;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.36","44 for Sha’ul had given Mikhal his daughter, David’s wife,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.37","to Palti son of Layish, who was from Gallim."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.38","26:1 Some Zifites came to Sha’ul at Giv’a, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.39","Is not David hiding himself at the Hill of Hakhila, facing the wasteland?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.40","2 So Sha’ul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Zif,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.41","and with him were three thousand men, hand-picked ones of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.42",to seek out David in the Wilderness of Zif.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.43","3 Sha’ul encamped at the Hill of Hakhila, which faces the wasteland, along the road,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.44",while David was staying in the wilderness;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.45","and he saw that Sha’ul had come after him into the wilderness,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.46","4 so David sent spies, that he might know that Sha’ul had come for certain."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.47",5 Then David arose and came to the place where Sha’ul was encamped;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.48","David saw the place where Sha’ul was lying, along with Avner son of Ner, the commander of his forces,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.49","with Sha’ul lying in the wagon-ring, and all the fighting-people encamped around him."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.50","6 And David spoke up, he said to Ahimelekh the Hittite and to Avishai son of Tzeruya, Yoav’s brother, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.51","Who will go down with me to Sha’ul, to the camp?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.52",Avishai said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.53",I will go down with you!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.54","7 So David and Avishai went to the fighting-people at nighttime,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.55","and here, Sha’ul was lying asleep in the wagon-ring,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.56",with his spear stuck into the ground at his head
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.57",and Avner and the fighting-people lying around him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.58",8 Avishai said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.59",God has turned over your enemy today into your hand!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.60","So-now, just let me strike him with the spear into the ground one time;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.61",I will not [have to do it] twice to him!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.62",9 But David said to Avishai:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.63",You are not to bring him to ruin!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.64",For who could stretch out his hand against Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one and be cleared?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.65",10 And David said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.66","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.67","rather, Y<small>HWH</small> will attack him:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.68","either his day will come, and he will die,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.69",or into battle he will go down and be swept away!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.70","11 [Heaven] forbid for me, by Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.71",from stretching out my hand against Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.72","So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.73","just take the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.74",and let us go on our [way].
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.75","12 So David took the spear and the cruse of water at Sha’ul’s head, and they went on their [way];"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.76","no one saw, no one knew, and no one awoke,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.77","for all of them were sleeping,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.78",for a deep-slumber of Y<small>HWH</small> had fallen upon them.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.79",13 Then David crossed over the side-across
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.80","and stopped at the summit of the hill, afar off,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.81",—great was the space between them—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.82","14 and David called out to the fighting-people and to Avner son of Ner, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.83","Won’t you answer, Avner?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.84",Avner answered and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.85","Who are you, [that] you call to the king?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.86",15 David said to Avner:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.87",Aren’t you a man?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.88",And who is like you in Israel?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.89",So why haven’t you kept watch over your lord king?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.90",For one of the fighting-people came to bring ruin to the king your lord!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.91",16 No good is this thing that you have done!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.92","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.93","indeed, you are sons of death,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.94","[seeing] that you did not keep watch over your lord, over Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.95","For-now, see:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.96",where are the king’s spear and the cruse of water that were at his head?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.97",17 Sha’ul recognized David’s voice;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.98",he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.99","Is that your voice, my son David?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.100",David said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.101","It is my voice, my lord king!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.102",18 And he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.103",Why now does my lord pursue after his servant?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.104","Indeed, what have I done?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.105",And what evil is there in my hand?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.106","19 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.107",pray let my lord king hearken to the words of his servant:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.108","if it is Y<small>HWH</small> [who] incited you against me, let him savor a gift- offering;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.109","but if it was by humans,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.110","then let them be doomed before Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.111","for they have driven me away today from being attached to Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.112",saying:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.113","Go, serve other gods!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.114","20 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.115","let not my blood fall to the earth, away from the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.116","For the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.117",as one pursues a partridge in the hills!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.118",21 Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.119","I have sinned; return, my son David!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.120","For I will do evil to you no more,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.121",since my life was precious in your eyes this day.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.122","Here, I have acted-foolishly and have been in exceedingly great error!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.123",22 David answered and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.124",Here is the king’s spear;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.125","let one of the serving-lads cross over and fetch it,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.126","23 and may Y<small>HWH</small> return upon each one his righteousness and his trustworthiness,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.127",[seeing] that Y<small>HWH</small> gave you into my hand
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.128",but I would not stretch out my hand against Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.129","24 Here, as your life has been deemed-great this day in my eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.130","so may my life grow-great in Y<small>HWH</small>’s eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.131",and may he rescue me from every distress!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.132",25 Sha’ul said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.133","Blessed are you, my son David;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.134","you will do, yes, do [well],"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26.135","and you will prevail, yes, prevail!"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.1","David as Mercenary: In what feels like an unlikely turn, David, at last freed from pursuit by Sha’ul (v.4), distances himself from his Israelite compatriots by becoming a vassal of the enemy (Philistine) king, Akhish of Gat. In his desire to secure the king’s trust, he exercises ruthlessness toward captured populations, cleverly intimating that these include his fellow Judeans. The scenario is reminiscent of typical undercover stories."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.2",27:1 David said in his heart:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.3",Now
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.4",I will be swept away one day by the hand of Sha’ul;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.5","there is nothing better for me than that I should escape, yes, escape to the land of the Philistines—"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.6","then Sha’ul will despair of me, of seeking me again throughout all the territory of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.7",and I will escape from his hand.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.8","2 So David arose and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Akhish son of Maokh, king of Gat."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.9","3 And David stayed with Akhish in Gat, he and his men, each one and his household,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.10","and David and his two wives,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.11","Ahinoam, the Yizre’elite, and Avigayil wife of Naval, the Carmelite."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.12","4 It was told to Sha’ul that David had gotten away to Gat,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.13",and he did not continue to seek him anymore.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.14",5 David said to Akhish:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.15","Now if I have found favor in your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.16","let there be given to me a place in one of the country towns, and let me settle there;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.17",why should your servant settle in the royal city with you?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.18",6 So Akhish gave him Tziklag on that day;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.19","therefore Tziklag came-to-belong to the kings of Judah, until this day."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.20",7 Now the number of days that David stayed in Philistine country was a year and four months.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.21","8 And David would go up, along with his men;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.22","they would sweep down on the Geshurites, the Gizrites, and the Amalekites"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.23",—for they were the settled-folk of the land who were [there] from ages [past]—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27.24","as you come to Shur, as far as the land of Egypt."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.1","Sha’ul and Shemuel at En Dor: Of all the dramatic moments in Sha’ul’s life—and there are many—nothing quite matches the eerie mood of this brief story, which takes place at night and involves the spirit of a dead man. It feels as if it might have been the inspiration for moments in Hamlet or Macbeth. In its devastating finality, it comprises the emotional end of the Sha’ul narratives. The account of the king’s actual death, which is reported in Chap. 31, only reports the inevitable."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.2","The story expands on the theme of God’s abandonment of Sha’ul, opening with a reminder that Shemuel is gone (see 25:1) and the observation that all of the conventional means by which a king might divine God’s will have proved futile (v.6). Sha’ul, who for once had followed God’s law in v.2, now must break it in secret, out of desperation. In order to do so, he must circumvent the Philistine lines, disguised in “other garments” (ironically echoing his transformation into “another man” with “another heart” when he was anointed as king in 10:6 and 9), thus concealing his identity from the medium."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.3","The consulting of spirits to learn the future was a well-known practice in the premodern world, but its appearance here is unique in the Hebrew Bible. While raising the dead and other aspects of sorcery were banned in the Bible, they were not viewed as ineffective; nevertheless, the text passes over any description of exactly how the woman works her magic and goes right to the unorthodox meeting between the two old friends. As usual, it is the face-to-face confrontation that interests the Bible rather than the background details, and so we must do without the dramatic lighting, special effects, and sinister music that would mark the presentation of such a scene in today’s media."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.4","A number of enigmatic points emerge in this narrative. First, how does Sha’ul know from the woman’s laconic description of the ghost that it is indeed that of the old prophet? “An old man … wrapped in a cloak” would seem to reveal little in the way of identity. But we may recall that it was Shemuel’s cloak that was the physical focal point of Sha’ul’s rejection as king (15:27), as the ghost implies with its reuse of “torn” in v.17. Second, there is Shemuel’s tantalizing suggestion about the nature of the Underworld in v.15, “Why have you disturbed me?” This tells us only that, in the biblical view, our state after death is akin to rest or sleep, and does not involve the elaborate construction of Heaven and Hell with which we are so familiar in the Western world. Finally, Shemuel’s reply to the “distressed” king does not address the question asked of him until he has rehashed God’s rejection of Sha’ul. His answer, in v.19, contains one of the most chilling lines in the Bible. The text could simply have said, “Tomorrow, you and your sons will die,” but instead intones the memorable “tomorrow, you and your sons are with me.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.5","What could have been the story’s ending is striking enough: Sha’ul does not merely collapse, an understandable reaction to the bad news he has just received; he falls “his full stature to the ground” (v.20), providing a purposeful contrast to one of the reasons Sha’ul had been chosen king in the first place. We recall that initially he had been described as “taller than all the people” (9:2), and had been rejected with the words “Do not look at … the tallness of his stature” (16:7). Sha’ul has farther to fall than most."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.6","It is at this point in the story, in a narrative that has already provided some surprises, that the unexpected happens again. If the Bible’s purpose had been solely to portray Sha’ul as a villain, he might simply have slunk back to the Israelite camp and wept, or experienced a night of uneasy dreams in the manner of Shakespeare’s Richard III. Instead, both king and reader are given a compassionate moment of respite. Literature abounds in less than reputable characters who demonstrate their humanity (see, for instance, Rahav, the classic “good-hearted prostitute” of Josh. 2). In this case, it is the medium who acts as a kind of stand-in for God, offering the stricken king nourishment and thus confirming his humanity. Moving from ground to bed (v.23), Sha’ul for the moment staves off his death and, instead of receiving the promised “bit of bread” (v.22), is given a more substantial meal, as befits a king. Thus the Sha’ul who exits his shattering meeting with the dead Shemuel is fortified for his heroic ordeal of the next day, when he will die leading the troops one last time against Israel’s enemies. From the beginning of the story, where the king had denied both his identity and his values as upholder of divine law, he emerges at the end, thanks to the medium’s act, as ruler and commander in chief, prepared to die if necessary at the head of “Y<small>HWH</small>’s armies” (see Simon 1997)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.7",9 And David would strike the land;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.8","he would leave alive no man or woman,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.9","but he would take sheep and oxen, donkeys and camels and garments,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.10",and then he would return and come back to Akhish.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.11",10 And Akhish would say:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.12",On [whom] did you sweep down today?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.13",And David would say:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.14","Against the Negev of Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.15","or: against the Negev of the Yerahme’elites,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.16",or: against the Negev of the Kenites.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.17","11 But no man or woman would David leave alive to bring to Gat, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.18","Lest they report concerning us, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.19",Thus did David do
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.20","and thus was his practice,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.21",all the days that he stayed in Philistine country.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.22","12 So Akhish came-to-trust David, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.23","He has made himself reek, yes, reek so to his own people, to Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.24",so he will be servant to me for a lifetime!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.25",28:1 It was in those days
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.26","that the Philistines gathered their camps into an armed-force, to wage battle against Israel."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.27",Akhish said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.28","You know, yes, know that you must go out with me in the camp, you and your men."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.29",2 David said to Akhish:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.30",Then you yourself will know what your servant can do!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.31",So Akhish said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.32",Then I will make you my chief bodyguard for all the days [to come]!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.33","3 Now Shemuel had died,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.34","and all Israel had beaten [the breast] for him and had buried him in Rama, in his town."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.35",Now Sha’ul had removed [those inquiring of] ghosts and all- knowing ones from the land.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.36","4 And the Philistines gathered and came, encamping at Shunem,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.37","while Sha’ul gathered all Israel, encamping at Gilboa."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.38",5 Sha’ul saw the Philistines’ camp
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.39","and he became afraid, and his heart trembled exceedingly."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.40","6 So Sha’ul made request of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.41","but Y<small>HWH</small> did not answer him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.42","either through dreams, or through <i>Urim,</i> or through prophets."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.43",7 So Sha’ul said to his servants:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.44","Seek for me a woman, a possessor of ghosts,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.45","that I may go to her, that I may inquire of [the dead] through her."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.46",His servants said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.47","There is a woman, a possessor of ghosts at En Dor."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.48","8 Sha’ul disguised himself and clothed himself in other garments,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.49","and he went, he and two men with him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.50",and came to the woman at night.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.51",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.52",Now divine for me by a ghost;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.53",bring up for me the one whom I will designate to you.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.54",9 The woman said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.55","Here, <i>you</i> know what Sha’ul has done,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.56",how he has cut off [those inquiring of] ghosts and all-knowing ones from the land.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.57","So why would you ensnare my life, to cause my death?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.58","10 Sha’ul swore to her by Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.59","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, should any guilt befall you through this matter … !"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.60",11 The woman said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.61",Whom shall I bring up for you?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.62",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.63",Bring up Shemuel for me.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.64","12 The woman saw Shemuel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.65",and she cried out in a loud voice;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.66","the woman said to Sha’ul, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.67",Why have you deceived me? For you are Sha’ul!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.68",13 The king said to her:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.69",Do not be afraid;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.70","rather, what do you see?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.71",The woman said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.72",I see a godlike-being coming up from the ground.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.73",14 He said to her:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.74",What is its form?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.75",She said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.76","An old man is coming up,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.77",and he is wrapped in a cloak.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.78","Then Sha’ul knew that it was Shemuel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.79","and he prostrated himself, nostrils to the earth, and bowed low."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.80",15 Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.81","Why have you disturbed me, by bringing me up?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.82",Sha’ul said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.83",I am exceedingly distressed—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.84",the Philistines are waging battle against me
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.85",and God has turned away from me:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.86","he no longer answers me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.87",either through the hand of the prophets or through dreams.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.88",So I have called you to make known to me what I should do!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.89",16 Shemuel said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.90",But why do you make request of me?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.91",For Y<small>HWH</small> has turned away from you and has become your foe!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.92",17 Y<small>HWH</small> has done to you as he promised through my hand:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.93",Y<small>HWH</small> has torn away the kingdom from your hand
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.94","and has given it to your fellow, to David"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.95","18 —as you did not hearken to Y<small>HWH</small>’s voice,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.96",and did not carry out his blazing anger against Amalek.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.97",Therefore this thing has Y<small>HWH</small> done to you this day!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.98",19 And Y<small>HWH</small> will also give Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.99","tomorrow, you and your sons are with me;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.100",also the camp of Israel Y<small>HWH</small> will give into the hand of the Philistines!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.101",20 Sha’ul quickly fell his full stature to the ground;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.102","he was exceedingly afraid at Shemuel’s words,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.103","also there was no strength in him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.104",for he had not eaten food all day and all night.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.105","21 The woman came to Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.106","and she saw that he was exceedingly terrified,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.107",so she said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.108","Here, your handmaid hearkened to your voice,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.109",and I put my life in my hand—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.110",I hearkened to your words which you spoke to me.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.111","22 So-then,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.112","now hearken, you also, to your handmaid’s voice:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.113","I will put before you a bit of bread—eat,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.114",so that there may be strength in you when you go on your way.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.115","23 He refused, and said: I will not eat!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.116","But his servants pressed him, and also the woman,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.117",so he hearkened to their voice;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.118",he arose from the ground and sat down on the couch.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.119",24 Now the woman had a stall-fed calf in the house;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.120","she hurried and slew it,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.121","took meal and kneaded it, and baked it into unleavened-cakes."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.122","25 Then she brought it close before Sha’ul and before his servants, and they ate,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28.123","and they arose and went away, that [very] night."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.1","Philistine Suspicions About David: As the Philistines prepare for battle against the Israelites, David accompanies them, but his loyalty is immediately questioned, despite all his efforts to prove himself in Chap. 27. The Philistine overlords are rightly concerned about the possibility that David, their former tormentor, will return to his roots and go over to the Israelite side. King Akhish is forced to reluctantly order David to head back to Philistia, forbidding him to participate in the coming battle against Sha’ul. Once again, as so often, David will be absent when his enemies are done away with."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.2","29:1 The Philistines gathered all their encampments at Afek,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.3",while Israel was encamped at the spring that is in Yizre’el.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.4","2 Now the Philistine overlords were crossing over by [divisions of] hundreds and by [divisions of] thousands,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.5","with David and his men crossing over in the rear, beside Akhish."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.6",3 The Philistine commanders said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.7",What [about] these Hebrews?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.8",Akhish said to the Philistine commanders:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.9","Is this not David, servant of Sha’ul king of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.10","who has been with me for these days and these years,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.11","yet I have found nothing [amiss] in him, from the day of his falling in [with us] until this day?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.12","4 The Philistine commanders became furious with him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.13",and the Philistine commanders said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.14","Return the man, and let him return to his place which you assigned him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.15","but do not let him go down with us into battle,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.16",so that he will not be an adversary to us in battle!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.17",For whereby will this one make himself acceptable [again] to his lord—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.18",is it not with the heads of those men?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.19","5 Is this not David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.20","about whom they chanted with dancing, saying: Sha’ul has struck down his thousands, but David—his myriads?"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.21",6 So Akhish had David called
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.22",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.23","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.24","indeed, you are upright,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.25","and good in my eyes is your going out and your coming in with me in the camp,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.26",for I have not found any evil in you from the day of your coming to me until this day—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.27",but in the eyes of the Philistine overlords you are not good!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.28",_____________
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.29",29:1 <b>Afek:</b> See note to 4:1 above. <b>Yizre’el:</b> The fertile Jezreel Valley of northern Israel.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.30","4 <b>the heads of those men:</b> A JPS note understands this expression as euphemistic for “our heads,” with “those men” indicating the Philistines."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29.31","6 <b>By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The Philistines, of course, were not worshippers of Y<small>HWH</small>, but the expression here is a standard biblical one—or else Akhish is showing special sensitivity to David."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.1","David as Rescuer: In the course of his journey away from direct confrontation in battle with Sha’ul, David discovers that the Philistine-occupied town of Tziklag has been devastated, and all its women, including his own wives Ahinoam and Avigayil, have been taken captive. A chance encounter with an Egyptian man reveals that the raiders were Amalekites, and David is subsequently able to crush them as they revel among the spoils."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.2","The story appears to have several functions. It puts David in a similar light to the patriarch Avraham, who had rescued his nephew and family from wartime captivity (see Gen. 14); it provides a contrast to Sha’ul, who had previously failed in his battle dealings with the Amalekites (Chap. 15); it links David to a current (in the writer’s time) practice of parceling out spoils even to parts of the army that have not participated in the battle proper; and, in the final verses, it gives David a means through which to eventually win back the good graces of his fellow Judeans."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.3","As Fokkelman (1993) has carefully worked out, timewise the action of this chapter is simultaneous to Sha’ul’s defeat in the next one. Thus, David’s victory fittingly coincides with Sha’ul’s end."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.4","7 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.5","turn back, and go in peace,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.6",so that you do not do evil in the eyes of the Philistine overlords.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.7",8 David said to Akhish:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.8","Indeed, what have I done;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.9",what have you found in your servant
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.10","from the day that I was [first] before you, until this day,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.11",that I may not come and wage battle against the enemies of my lord king?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.12",9 Akhish answered and said to David:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.13",I acknowledge that you are as good in my eyes as a messenger of a god;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.14","however, the Philistine commanders say:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.15",He must not go up with us into battle!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.16","10 So-now, start-early at daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.17","and as for your lord’s servants who came with you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.18",you are [all] to start-early at daybreak;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.19","when it is light for you, go!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.20","11 So David started-early, he and his men, to go at daybreak, to return to the land of the Philistines,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.21",while the Philistines went up to Yizre’el.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.22","30:1 It was, when David came and his men to Tziklag, on the third day"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.23","—now Amalekites had swept down on the Negev, on Tziklag;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.24","they had struck Tziklag, and burned it with fire,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.25","2 and they had taken captive the women that were in it, from young to old."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.26","They had not put any [of them] to death,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.27",but had led them away and gone on their way—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.28","3 David and his men came to the town,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.29","and here, it was burned down with fire,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.30",with their wives and their sons and their daughters taken captive!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.31",4 And David and the fighting-people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.32",until there was no strength in them to weep.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.33","5 Now David’s two wives had been taken captive,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.34",Ahinoam the Yizre’elite and Avigayil wife of Naval the Carmelite.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.35","6 And David was exceedingly distressed,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.36","for the people intended to stone him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.37","for bitter were all the people’s feelings,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.38",each one over his sons and over his daughters—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.39",but David found strength in Y<small>HWH</small> his God.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.40","7 David said to Evyatar the priest, son of Ahimelekh:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.41",Now bring the <i>efod</i> close to me!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.42",Evyatar brought the <i>efod</i> close to David.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.43","8 And David inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.44",Shall I pursue after this raiding-band?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.45",Will I overtake them?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.46",He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.47","Pursue,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.48","for you will overtake, yes, overtake, and will rescue, yes, rescue [them]!"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.49","9 So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.50","and they came to Wadi Besor, while those left stayed behind."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.51","10 And David gave pursuit, he and four hundred men,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.52","while two hundred men stayed behind, who were [too] exhausted to cross Wadi Besor."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.53","11 They found an Egyptian man in the open-field, and took him to David;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.54","they gave him bread and he ate, and they had him drink water,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.55","12 and they gave him a slice of pressed-figs and two raisin-bunches, and he ate."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.56",Then his spirit returned to him
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.57",—for he had not eaten bread and had not drunk water for three days and three nights.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.58",13 And David said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.59",To whom do you [belong]? And where are you from?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.60",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.61","I am an Egyptian serving-lad, the servant of an Amalekite man;"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.62","my lord abandoned me, since I became sick three days ago."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.63","14 We were sweeping down on the Negev of the Kereitites,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.64","against what belongs to Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.65","and against the Negev of Calev,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.66",and Tziklag we burned with fire.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.67",15 David said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.68",Will you bring me down to this band?
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.69",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.70",Swear to me by God
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.71","if you should put me to death, if you should turn me over to the hand of my [former] lord … !"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.72",Then I will bring you down to this band.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.73","16 He brought him down,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.74","and here, they were stretched out all over the surface of the ground,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.75",eating and drinking and celebrating
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.76",among all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.77",17 And David struck them from the [dawn] breeze until the morrow’s sunset;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.78",not one of them escaped except for four hundred serving-lads who mounted camels and fled.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.79","18 So David rescued everything that Amalek had taken,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.80",and his two wives David rescued [as well];
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.81","19 nothing was missing of theirs, from small to great, to sons and daughters,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.82",or from the spoils to anything that they took for themselves—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.83",everything David restored.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.84",20 David took all the flocks and all the herds;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.85",they drove them before that livestock and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.86",These are David’s spoils!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.87",21 And David came back to the two hundred men that had been too exhausted to go after David
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.88",—they had had them stay at Wadi Besor—
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.89",and they went out to meet David and to meet the fighting-people who were with him.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.90","And David came close to the people, and he inquired of them for peace,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30.91",_____________

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.1","The Death of Sha’ul: The final episode in Sha’ul’s tragedy, stunningly portrayed in Pieter Brueghel’s famous large painting, is reported in a chapter of great compactness. The battle scene itself is typically brief; what interests the writer is only the outcome—the death of the king and his sons."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.2","Sha’ul dies heroically. His decision to commit suicide stems not from depression or despair but from the desire to die with dignity and escape the humiliation which he fears would be his lot if the Philistines were to find him alive. As it is, his corpse is mutilated, with armor and torso taken as trophies for Philistine sites. In the end, however, the body and those of his sons are rescued by the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad, the very ones whom Sha’ul had saved from the Ammonites at the beginning of his career, and given proper burial."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.3","At the same time as Sha’ul dies heroically, there is a sobering note. His suicide in battle recalls the death of a previous king, actually a usurper, Avimelekh, in Judg. 9. As with other foreshadowings of the reign of Sha’ul (see Judg. 19), the parallel does not do him honor."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.4",22 but every evil and base man of the men who had gone with David spoke up
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.5",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.6","Because they did not go with me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.7",we will not give them any of the spoils that we rescued
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.8",except to each one his wife and his children;
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.9",let them drive [these] away and go!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.10",23 David said:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.11","You must not do thus, my brothers,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.12",with what Y<small>HWH</small> has given us!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.13","—he watched over us and gave the band that came against us, into our hand."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.18","that they made it a prescribed-law and a rule in Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.19",until this day.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.20","26 David came back to Tziklag, and he sent off [some] of the spoils to the elders of Judah, to his fellows, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.28","31:1 Now the Philistines were waging battle against Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.29",and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines;

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.31","2 And the Philistines caught up with Sha’ul and with his sons,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.32","and the Philistines struck down Yehonatan and Avinadav and Malki-Shua, Sha’ul’s sons."

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.34","the shooters, the men of the bow, found him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.35",and he was seriously wounded by the shooters.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.36",4 So Sha’ul said to his weapons bearer:
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.37","Draw your sword and run me through with it,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.38",lest these Foreskinned Ones come and run me through and deal wantonly with me!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.39","But the weapons bearer would not, because he was exceedingly afraid,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.40",so Sha’ul took the sword and fell on it.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.41","5 And his weapons bearer saw that Sha’ul was dead,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.42","so he too fell on his sword, and died with him."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.43","6 Thus died Sha’ul, and his three sons and his weapons bearer,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.44","indeed, all his men, on that day, together."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.45","7 The men of Israel saw, those across the Valley and those across the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.46","that the [other] men of Israel had fled,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.47","and that Sha’ul and his sons had died,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.48","so they abandoned the towns and fled,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.49",and Philistines came and settled in them.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.50","8 Now it was on the morrow,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.51","that the Philistines came to strip the slain,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.52","and they found Sha’ul and his three sons, fallen on Mount Gilboa."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.53","9 They cut off his head and stripped off his armor,"

"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.55",to bring-the-news into the house of their carved-idols and among the people.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.56","10 They placed his armor in the Temple-House of Ashtarot,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.57",and his corpse they thrust into the wall of Bet-She’an.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.58",11 But the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad heard
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.59","about what the Philistines had done to Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.60",12 so all the men of valor arose and went all night
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.61","and took down Sha’ul’s corpse and the corpses of his sons from the wall of Bet-Shan,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31.62","and brought them to Yavesh, and burned them there;"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.1","David’s Reaction to Sha’ul’s Death: The news from the battle reaches David, though we wait to see how he will react. An Amalekite messenger, bringing some of Sha’ul’s royal ornaments with him, reports a version of Sha’ul’s death which some interpreters take at face value but which may well be a fabrication. In the latter case, his motive is likely greed or some other form of self-interest; as an Amalekite, he belongs to the group that David had defeated in the town of Tziklag where the present conversation takes place, and he may be seeking mercy. In any event, the ruse does not work, and the messenger is put to death. David’s condemnation and execution of the man may serve to further support David’s claim that he had no evil designs against Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.2","What follows (vv.17–27) is one of the most famous poems in the Bible, whose key line, “How have (or: how are [KJV]) the mighty fallen,” occurring three times in the poem, is still quoted when public figures fall from grace. It is the first example of David as poet in the Bible. At the end of his life, he will recite two longer ones (II Sam. 22 and 23), and many of the Psalms will be attributed to him, either by the Bible itself (if indeed that is what “a Psalm of David” means) or by later tradition. This poem is also at the center of Samuel, usually an indication of an important moment in a chapter or a book."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.3","Notably, Yehonatan’s name appears here as much as does Sha’ul’s. Much has been made of the words “… my brother Yehonatan, / you were very delightful to me; / more wonderful was your love to me / than the love of women” (v.26). Once again, is this deep friendship or something more? In any case, the bond with Yehonatan seems to be the most deeply felt of all of David’s human relationships, a phenomenon which, as we noted earlier, is not unusual in a warrior culture."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.4",1:1 It was after the death of Sha’ul
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.5",—David had returned from striking the Amalek[ites]—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.6",that David stayed in Tziklag for two days.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.39",since I knew that he could not live after his having fallen;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.40",then I took the diadem that was on his head
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.41","and the bracelet that was on his arm,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.42",and have brought them to my lord here.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.43","11 David took hold of his clothes and tore them,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.47","over the fighting-people of Y<small>HWH</small> and over the House of Israel,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.53",14 David said to him:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.55",to stretch out your hand to bring Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one to ruin?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.56",15 And David called to one of the serving-lads
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1.57",and said:

In the process, the conflict gets personal, as Yoav’s brother is unavoidably slain by Avner, who then manages to obtain a cease-fire in the interests of preventing further bloodshed and civil war. But in a world often marked by blood vengeance, it is most unlikely that matters will stand the way they are."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.34","The narrative is marked by an unusual echoing word: “after.” It resounds with both spatial and abstract meanings, fourteen times in twelve verses (19–30), and expresses well the concept of pursuit that is so central to the story. In the end, Avner’s “Do you not know that it will be bitter <i>afterward</i>?” (v.26; italics mine) summarizes the need to resolve the civil war."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.35","8 But Avner son of Ner, commander of the armed-forces that belonged to Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.36","had taken Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul, and had had him cross over to Mahanayim;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.37","9 he had made him king over Gil’ad, over the Geshurites, and over Yizre’el,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.42","11 And the number of days that David was king in Hevron, over the House of Judah,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.44","12 Now Avner son of Ner went out, along with the servants of Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul, from Mahanayim to Giv’on,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.45",13 while Yoav son of Tzeruya and David’s servants went out [as well].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.46","They met them by the Pool of Giv’on together,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.47","and they sat down, these by the pool on this-side,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.48",and those by the pool on that-side.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.49",14 Avner said to Yoav:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.50",Let the fighting-lads arise and hold-a-contest before us!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.51",Yoav said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.52",Let them arise!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.53",15 So they arose and crossed over by number:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.54","twelve for Binyamin and for Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.55",and twelve of David’s servants.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.56","16 And each one took hold of his neighbor’s head,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.57","with his sword [thrust] into his neighbor’s side,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.58",and they fell together.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.59","So that place was called: Helkat Ha-Tzurim/Field of the Sword-Edges, which is in Giv’on."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.60","17 Now the battle was rough—exceedingly so—on that day,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.61",and Avner and the men of Israel were defeated before David’s servants.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.62","18 Now three of the sons of Tzeruya were there: Yoav, Avishai, and Asa’el;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.63","and Asa’el was swift of feet, like one of the gazelles that is in the open-field."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.64",19 Asa’el pursued after Avner;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.65",he did not swerve to go to the right or to the left from after Avner.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.66",20 But Avner faced about after him
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.67",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.68","Is this you, Asa’el?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.69",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.70",[It is] I.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.71",21 Avner said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.72","Swerve you to your right or to your left,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.73","and seize for yourself one of our fighting-lads [instead], and take yourself his armor!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.74",But Asa’el would not turn aside from [going] after him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.75",22 Once again Avner said to Asa’el:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.76",Turn you aside from [going] after me;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.77",why should I strike you to the ground—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.78",for how could I lift my face to Yoav your brother?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.79","23 But he refused to turn aside,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.80","so Avner struck him with the afterpart of the spear, in the abdomen,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.81",so that the spear came out after him;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.82",he fell there and died on the spot.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.83","And it was: all who came to the place where Asa’el had fallen and died, stopped,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.84",24 but Yoav and Avishai pursued after Avner.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.85","Now when the sun had come in,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.86","they came to the Hill of Amma, that faces Gi’ah,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.87",on the way to the Wilderness of Giv’on.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.88",25 And the Children of Binyamin gathered themselves [to follow] after Avner;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.89",they became a single group
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.90",and stopped at the top of a hill.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.91",26 And Avner called out to Yoav;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.92",he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.93",Is it forever that the sword must devour?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.94",Do you not know
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.95",that it will be bitter afterward?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.96",Until when will you not bid the fighting-people to turn back from [going] after their brothers?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.97",27 Yoav said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.98","By the life of God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.99","indeed, had you only spoken,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.100","indeed, already in the morning the people would have gone up, each one from [going] after his brother!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.101","28 Then Yoav gave-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i>, and all the people stopped;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.102","they no longer pursued after Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.103",and no longer continued to do battle.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.104",29 Now Avner and his men went through the Plain all that night;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.105",they crossed the Jordan
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.106","and went through the whole canyon, and came to Mahanayim."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2.107","30 Now when Yoav returned from [going] after Avner,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.1","Civil War; the Death of Avner: The report on the ongoing civil war is interrupted by the birth notice of David’s sons, six by six different wives. Indeed, sexual politics begins the chapter, with Avner sleeping with Sha’ul’s concubine Ritzpa, to the chagrin of Sha’ul’s son Ish-Boshet. This classic demonstration of political power enables Avner to negotiate with David, which obviously needs to be done, but the king will agree to a treaty only if his own former wife Mikhal, Sha’ul’s daughter, is returned to him. So, sandwiched in between the violence of the last chapter and the violence that is to come, the first half of this chapter is punctuated by strong words and strong emotions, from Ish-Boshet’s complaints, Avner’s retort and negotiating statements, to the weeping of Paltiel, Mikhal’s second husband, who helplessly walks behind her as she is returned to David. The result of the negotiations is a carefully wrought agreement that the northern region, Israel, will acknowledge David as king, and that Ish-Boshet’s life will not be threatened."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.2","The “peace” described in v.21 cannot last, however, because Yoav, as we will continuously encounter him in these stories, is a “rough” man (v.39) who does not forgive and who constantly looks out for and unhesitatingly acts on David’s interests. He cannot permit the man who killed his brother to live, even though we saw in the previous chapter that Avner tried his best to avoid killing Asa’el. And it does not seem coincidental that Avner’s death would obviously have the effect of quashing David’s northern opposition."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.3","At this point, from v.28 on, the text goes to great lengths to clear David of Avner’s brutal murder. Not only does he put a curse on the house of Yoav, but he gets the entire people to mourn over Avner, composing a brief dirge for the occasion (vv.33–34)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.4","32 And they carried Asa’el away and buried him in the burial-place of his father, which is in Bet-Lehem."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.5","Then they went all night, Yoav and his men,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.6",with light breaking upon them in Hevron.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.7",3:1 And the war was long-lasting between the House of Sha’ul and the House of David;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.8","David went on becoming stronger, while the House of Sha’ul went on becoming weaker."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.9",2 Now sons were born to David in Hevron:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.10","his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Yezre’elite,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.11","3 and his second was Kil’av, by Avigayil wife of Naval, the Carmelite,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.12","and the third was Avshalom son of Maakha, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.13","4 and the fourth was Adoniyya son of Haggit,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.14","and the fifth was Shefatya son of Avital,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.15","5 and the sixth was Yitre’am, by Egla wife of David."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.16",These were born to David in Hevron.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.17","6 And it was,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.18","when there was war between the House of Sha’ul and the House of David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.19",that Avner was gaining strength in the House of Sha’ul.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.20","7 Now Sha’ul had a concubine, her name was Ritzpa daughter of Aya."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.21",And [Ish-Boshet] said to Avner:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.22",For-what-reason did you come in to my father’s concubine?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.23",8 Avner became exceedingly agitated over the words of Ish-Boshet;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.24",he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.25",Am I the head of a dog belonging to Judah?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.26","Today I do an act-of-loyalty to the House of Sha’ul your father,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.27","for his brothers and for his friends,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.28",and have not let you come into David’s hand—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.29",yet you account me with a fault concerning a woman today!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.30","9 Thus may God do to Avner, and thus may he add to him;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.31","indeed, [just] as Y<small>HWH</small> swore to David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.32","indeed, thus I will do to him—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.33","10 to have the kingship cross over from the House of Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.34","to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.35",from Dan to Be’er-Sheva!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.36","11 He was not able to answer Avner another word, out of his fear of him."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.37","12 And Avner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.38",Whose is [the] land?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.39","Cut your covenant with me,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.40","Here, my hand is with you, to bring all Israel around to you!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.41",13 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.42","Good,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.43",I myself will cut a covenant with you;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.44","but one thing I will require of you, namely:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.45",you are not to see my face
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.46","unless you first bring Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul, when you come to see my face."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.47","14 So David sent messengers to Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.48","Give over my wife, Mikhal,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.49",whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred Philistine foreskins!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.50","15 Ish-Boshet sent and took her from [her] husband, from Paltiel son of Layish."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.51","16 And her husband went with her, going along and weeping behind her, as far as Bahurim."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.52",Then Avner said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.53","Go, turn back! And he turned back."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.54","17 Now the word of Avner was with the elders of Israel, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.55","Even yesterday, even [the] day-before, you have been seeking [to set] David as king over you."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.56","18 So-now, do it!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.57","For Y<small>HWH</small> has said of David, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.58",By the hand of David my servant
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.59",I will deliver my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.60","19 Avner spoke likewise in the hearing of Binyamin,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.61",and Avner went likewise to speak in the hearing of David in Hevron
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.62",all that was good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all the House of Binyamin.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.63","20 And Avner came to David in Hevron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.64",—with him were twenty men—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.65",and David made a drinkfest for Avner and for the men who were with him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.66",21 Then Avner said to David:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.67","Let me arise, let me go,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.68","and let me gather all Israel to my lord king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.69",that they may cut a covenant with you
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.70",and that you may become king according to all that your appetite craves.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.71","So David sent Avner away,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.72",and he went off in peace.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.73","22 Now here, David’s servants and Yoav came back from raiding, and abundant spoils they brought with them—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.74","but Avner was not with David in Hevron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.75","for he had sent him off, and he had gone away in peace."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.76","23 When Yoav and all the forces that were with him came, [someone] told Yoav, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.77","Avner the son of Ner came to the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.78",but he sent him off and he went away in peace!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.79",24 So Yoav came to the king and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.80",What have you done?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.81","Here, Avner came to you—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3.82","why now did you send him off,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.1","The Death of Ish-Boshet: In the course of the ongoing civil war, another assassination is committed. This time the victim is Sha’ul’s son Ish-Boshet (or, in uncensored form, Ish-Baal). The chapter begins with several brief notes: Sha’ul’s son is terrified to hear about Avner’s recent death; we are introduced to two of his chieftains; and we are informed that a grandson scion of Sha’ul is alive, albeit a lame young man. The story proper starts in v.5, where Ish-Boshet is killed, Mafia-style, in his bed. Initially, no motive is given, especially as the assassins are from Ish-Boshet’s own circle, but it soon becomes clear that the two men are seeking compensation from David. He, however, reacts the same way he had to the Amalekite messenger in Chap. 1, even referring back to that incident himself, and the culprits are executed. In addition, they are mutilated, with their bodies put on public display. Much as in the classic period of sixteenth-century England, “treason” gets its very public reward. And once again, David is portrayed as indignant at the commission of violent deeds from which, however, he ultimately profits."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.2",25 You know Avner the son of Ner:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.3","indeed, to dupe you he came,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.4","to gain knowledge of your going out and your coming in,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.5",and to gain knowledge of all that you are doing!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.6","26 So Yoav went out from David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.7",and he sent messengers after Avner;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.8","they returned him from the cistern of Sira,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.9",but David did not know [about it].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.10","27 Avner returned to Hevron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.11","and Yoav took him to the inner-part of the gate, to speak with him quietly,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.12","but he struck him in the abdomen, so that he died,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.13",[in exchange] for the blood of Asa’el his brother.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.14","28 David heard [of it], after this,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.15",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.16","Clear-of-blame am I and my kingdom by Y<small>HWH</small>, for the ages,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.17",from the blood of Avner son of Ner—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.18",29 may it alight on the head of Yoav and on all his Father’s House;

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.23","on account that he had caused the death of Asa’el their brother at Giv’on, in battle."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.24",31 And David said to Yoav and to all the people that were with him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.25","Tear your garments and gird yourselves with sackcloth,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.26",and beat [the breast] before Avner!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.27",Now King David [himself] walked after the bier.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.28","32 They buried Avner in Hevron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.29","and the king lifted up his voice and wept upon the burial-place of Avner,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.30",and all the people wept.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.31",33 And the king intoned-a-dirge over Avner; he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.32","Like the death of a vile one, should Avner have died?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.33","34 Your hands were not bound,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.34",your feet were not put in double-bronze;

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.43",37 So all the people and all Israel knew on that day
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.44",that it had not been from the king to cause the death of Avner son of Ner.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.45",38 The king said to his servants:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.46",Do you not know
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.47",that a commander and a great [man] has fallen in Israel this day?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.48","39 As for me, today I am softhearted, though anointed as king,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.52","and his hands grew slack,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.53",while all Israel were terrified.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4.54","2 Now two men, commanders of raiding-bands, belonged to the son of Sha’ul;"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.1","Major Victories for David: A number of episodes are strung together here, all demonstrating David’s ascendancy as king and as military leader. First (vv.1–5) he receives the throne of all Israel, at the request of the northern tribes. Following on the heels of Ish-Boshet’s assassination, this seems both surprising and logical."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.2","In vv.6–9, David conquers Jerusalem, which had thus far resisted takeover by the Israelites (despite Judg. 1:8). The text is incredibly brief, despite the great importance of the deed. We are not initially told why David decides to attack the Jebusite enclave, but the subsequent chapters make clear that he desires to make it the new capital of a united Israel, a politically ingenious move, since the city was quite defensible and situated close to the border between the northern and southern sections of the country."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.3","The text continues at v.10, with several passages befitting a king: vv.10–11 trace the beginnings of an important alliance, with King Hiram of Tyre in Phoenicia, resulting in the building of a palace for David—a step beyond Sha’ul’s chieftain-style rule. This seems to produce proof of divine favor (v.12), a theme which will be at the forefront of Chap. 7. Then (vv.13–16) we are given a list of children born to David in Jerusalem. In summary, we now have a king over all Israel, with a major alliance, a palace, and numerous heirs—a good recipe for political stability."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.4","The chapter concludes with a larger story (vv.17–25) in which it is clear that having become king has not softened David the warrior. He is able to decisively defeat the Philistines, with the assistance of God. The victory cements his military accomplishments, as it was the long-lasting superiority of the Philistines that had led to the people’s request for a king in I Sam. 8 in the first place."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.5","9 David answered Rekhav and Baana his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Be’erotite;"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.22",5:1 All the staff-bearers of Israel came to David in Hevron;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.23","they said, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.31","and King David cut a covenant with them at Hevron, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.32",and they anointed David as king over Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.33",4 Thirty years old was David when he became king;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.34",for forty years he reigned as king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.35","5 in Hevron he reigned as king over Judah for seven years and six months,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.36","and in Jerusalem he reigned as king for thirty-three years, over all Israel and Judah."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.37","6 Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Yevusites, the settled-folk of the region,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.38","but they said to David, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.39",You are not to enter here!

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.41",David is not to enter here!—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.42",7 But David captured the Fortress of Zion—that is the city of David.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.43",8 And David said on that day:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.44",Whoever strikes down a Yevusite
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.45","and reaches the water-shaft … ,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.46",since the lame and the blind are hated by David’s very self;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.47",therefore they say:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.48",The blind and the lame are not to enter the Temple-House!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.49","9 David settled in the fortress,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.50",and he called it the City of David;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.51","and David built all around, from the Earthfill and inward."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.52",10 And David went on and on becoming great;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.53","Y<small>HWH</small>, God of the Forces-On-High, was with him."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.54","11 Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.55",along with cedar wood and wood carvers and stone wall carvers;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.56",they built a palace-house for David.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.57","12 And David knew that Y<small>HWH</small> had established him as king over Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.58",and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.59","13 David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, after his coming back from Hevron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.60","and more [children] were born to David, sons and daughters."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.61",14 And these are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.66","17 The Philistines heard that they had anointed David as king over Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.67",so all the Philistines went up to seek out David.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.68","David heard, and he went down to the fortress."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.69",18 Now the Philistines had come
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.70",and had spread out in the Valley of the Shades.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.71","19 So David inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.74",Y<small>HWH</small> said to David:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5.77","20 David came to Baal-Peratzim/Master of Bursting Forth,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.1","Jerusalem Taken; the Coffer’s Journey: The account of how Jerusalem is consecrated, and its preeminent political status assured, by the bringing of the Coffer (others, “Ark”) to reside there, has some unexpected twists. From David’s point of view, this momentous religious and political act should be filled with joy, and the text (vv.5 and 13–14) indeed stresses the unfettered jubilation of the occasion through music and David’s leaping and dancing. But the positive emotions of the moment are marred by two incidents, one public and one private. As the Coffer initially travels by wagon, it begins to slip, and the Israelite who tries to steady it is struck dead by God. This “carelessness” of physical contact, which might baffle modern readers since its intention is pure, nevertheless violates the sanctity of the object, and we are reminded that the Coffer represents God and is thus separated from normal human contact. It is a boundary that, in ancient cultures, must not be breached. At the same time, Uzza’s death leads David to despair of ever attaining his royal goals."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.2","The second incident in the chapter is colorful and very telling. Mikhal, the nouveau princess, is unable to stomach the mundane and, to her, undignified sight of her husband jumping and dancing for joy at the Coffer’s entry to the city. She seems not to understand his strong emotions—or, possibly, his near nakedness reminds her of her father’s prophetic moments, which had caused people to whisper (see I Sam. 19:24). At any rate, David counters her accusation that he is acting lewdly with a sexual threat of his own (v.22, “with the serving-maids of whom you spoke … I’ll get honor!”). After several chapters that have contained two long lists of David’s progeny, this one ends with the sober notice that Mikhal remained childless to the end of her days. So for multiple reasons, there will ultimately be no merging of the houses of Sha’ul and David. Biologically as well as militarily and politically, David’s victory is now complete. We can now proceed to God’s long and firm promises to the new king."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.3","22 But the Philistines went up again,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.4",and spread out in the Valley of the Shades.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.15","6:1 David continued [gathering] every hand-picked [man] in Israel, thirty thousand."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.17","to bring up from there the Coffer of God, over which was called the name of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, [The One] Seated on the Winged-Sphinxes."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.18",3 They mounted the Coffer of God on a new wagon

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.39","10 And David would not remove the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> from him to the City of David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.40",so David turned it aside to the house of Oved-Edom the Gittite.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.41","11 The Coffer stayed at the house of Oved-Edom the Gittite for three months,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.45","so David went and brought up the Coffer of God from the house of Oved-Edom to the City of David, with rejoicing."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.52","16 and as the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> was coming into the City of David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.53",Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul was looking out through the window:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.54","she saw King David leaping and whirling in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.55",and she despised him in her heart.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.56",17 They brought the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6.57","and set it in its place, in the middle of the tent that David had spread out for it."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.1","The Davidic Covenant: Now that David’s throne is secure (God has “given-him-rest,” v.1), he logically seeks to build the one thing that his kingdom lacks: a temple. In the ancient Near East, such a desire would have been prompted not merely by piety; temples were political statements as well, symbolizing a god’s approval and protection of the regime. The king’s plea prompts a new character, Natan the court prophet, to encourage him, only to be overruled by YHWH: his son Shelomo (Solomon), not David, will get to build it. In the process, the text switches to a Deuteronomistic style, and we encounter what many would characterize as a masterpiece of royal propaganda. It is distinguished by, among other traits, wordiness, both in YHWH’s promises and in David’s grateful response."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.2","The basic message of the chapter is that Y<small>HWH</small> will be with David, and that he will establish both “my people” and the Davidic throne in perpetuity. The speeches are punctuated by several key words, first of all “name,” here referring most often to God, whose fame will be augmented by what he does with Israel and by the future temple. “House,” in the multiple senses of Temple and dynasty, appears fifteen times, and the encouraging “for the ages” eight times. Not surprisingly, the verb meaning “to make firm” appears five times, to stress God’s commitment. And David’s response to divine generosity contains the formal marker of submission: ten times in vv.19–29 he uses the expression “your servant” in speaking to God."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.3",21 David said to Mikhal:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.4","In the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, who chose me over your father and over all his house, to commission me as <i>Nagid</i> over the people of Y<small>HWH</small>, over Israel:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.5","I’ll dance in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.6",22 and will hold-myself-lightly more than this;

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.9",with <i>them</i> I’ll get honor!

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.36","I myself took you from the pasture, from [following] after the flock,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.37","to be <i>Nagid</i> over my people, over Israel."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.38","9 I have been with you wherever you have gone,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.39",and have cut off all your enemies from before you.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.40","And I will make you a great name,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.41","like the name of the great-ones who are on the earth,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.42","10 and I will make a place for my people, for Israel:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.43","I will plant them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.44","and they will dwell beneath it,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.45","so that they will shudder no more,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.46","so that malicious ones will not continue to afflict them, as in former-times,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.47",11 from the day that I commisioned judges over my people Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.48",And I will give-you-rest from all your enemies.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.49",Y<small>HWH</small> has told you that Y<small>HWH</small> will make you a house:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.50",12 when your days are fulfilled
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.51","and you lie beside your fathers,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.52","I will raise up your seed after you,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.53","one who comes out from your body,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.54",and I will make his kingdom firm.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.55","13 <i>He</i> will build a house to my name,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.56",and I will make his kingly throne firm for the ages;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.57","14 I will be to him as a father,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.58",and he will be to me as a son.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.59","When he commits-iniquity,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.60","I will rebuke him with the staff of men, and with the blows of humans;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.61","15 but my loyal-love I will not turn aside from him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.62","as I turned aside from Sha’ul, from whom I turned aside before you."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.63",16 Secure will be your house and your kingdom for the ages before me;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.64",your throne will be firm for the ages!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.65","17 According to all these words and according to all this vision,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.66",thus did Natan speak to David.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.67",18 King David came and sat in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.68",he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.69","Who am I, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.70","and who is my household,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.71",that you have brought me this far?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.72","19 And still this was too small in your eyes, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.73",you have also spoken of your servant’s house in a distant-time!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.74","This is the rule for a man-of-status, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.75","20 And what more can David speak further to you,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.76","since you yourself know your servant, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.77",21 For the sake of your word and in accordance with your heart
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.78","you have done all this greatness,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.79",to make it known to your servant.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.80","22 Therefore you are great, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.81","indeed, there is none like you"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.82",and no God beside you
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.83",according to all that we have heard with our ears.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.84","23 And who is like your people, like Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.85","a singular nation on earth,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.86","whom God went forth to redeem for himself as a people,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.87",to make for himself a name
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.88","and to do for you great things, and awe-inspiring [acts] for your land,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.89","before your people whom you redeemed for yourself from Egypt,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.90",[driving out] nations and their gods?

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.92","and you, O Y<small>HWH</small>, you have become God for them."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.93",_____________

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7.105",23 <b>[driving out]:</b> As per I Chron. 17:21. This is likewise a verse with odd wording.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.1","Warrior King; Bureaucracy: Resuming the activities reported at the end of Chap. 5, David makes short order of Philistines, Moabites, and Arameans, with the result that he acquires a large amount of gold, silver, and bronze. These are “hallowed to YHWH” (v.11), in line with the portrayal of the king as faithful servant in the mode of Deuteronomy. And the text emphasizes how David’s victories are attributable to YHWH’s presence “wherever he went” (vv.6 and 14). This theological thrust, however, is accompanied by a more secular note about political strategy: Israelite garrisons are established throughout conquered Aramean territory."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.2","The chapter ends with the initial part of a textual bracket (as noted by Brettler 1995), a list of David’s officials, which will recur at the end of Chap. 20. Their functions include such royal, military, and religious duties as would have been found in many ancient Near Eastern states—proof either of David’s historical power or of a later generation’s desire to see him in their own terms."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.3","25 So-now, O Y<small>HWH</small> God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.4",as for the word that you have spoken about your servant and about his house—

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.10","27 For you, O Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.11","have bared your servant’s ear, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.12",A house will I build for you;

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.22",8:1 It was [some time] after this
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.23","that David struck the Philistines and humbled them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.24",and David took Meteg Amma from the hand of the Philistines.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.26","and he measured them with a rope, making them lie down on the ground—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.27",he measured two rope-lengths for putting to death
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.28",and a full rope-length for letting [them] live.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.29","And Moav became servants to David, bearers of tribute."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.30","3 Then David struck Hadad’ezer/Hadad is Help, son of Rehov, king of Tzova,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.31",as he was going to restore his monument at the River;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.32","4 David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand men, foot-soldiers,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.33","and David maimed all the chariot-horses, and left of them [only] a hundred chariot-horses."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.34","5 And Arameans from Damascus came, to help Hadad’ezer king of Tzova,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.35",and David struck down from Aram twenty thousand men.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.36","6 David put standing-garrisons at Aram of Damascus,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.37","and Aram became servants to David, bearers of tribute."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.38",Thus Y<small>HWH</small> delivered David wherever he went.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.39",7 And David took the gold bow cases that were upon Hadad’ezer’s servants
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.40","and brought them to Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.41","8 while from Betah and from Berotai, Hadad’ezer’s towns,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.43","9 And To’i king of Hamat heard that David had struck down Hadad’ezer’s entire army,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.44","10 so To’i sent Yoram his son to King David,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.46","on account of his waging battle against Hadad’ezer, and [that] he had struck him down,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.47",—for a man waging battle with To’i was Hadad’ezer—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.48",and in his hand were objects of silver and objects of gold and objects of bronze.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.49","11 These too David hallowed to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.50",with the silver and the gold that he had hallowed from all the nations that he had subdued:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.52","from the Philistines and from Amalek,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.53","and from the spoil of Hadad’ezer son of Rehov, king of Tzova."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.54","13 And David made a name [for himself] on his return from striking Edom in the Valley of Salt, eighteen thousand [dead]."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.55",14 He put garrisons in Edom—throughout all Edom he put garrisons—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.56",and all Edom became servants to David.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.57",Thus Y<small>HWH</small> delivered David wherever he went.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.58","15 David reigned as king over all Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.59",and David instituted justice and equity for all his people.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.60","16 Now Yoav son of Tzeruya was [The One] Over the Armed-Forces,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.61","and Yehoshafat son of Ahilud was Herald,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.62","17 and Tzadok son of Ahituv and Avimelekh son of Evyatar were priests,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.68",28 <b>spoken this good [thing]:</b> Not merely “good words”; this is covenant language in Israel and elsewhere in the ancient Near East (McCarter 1984 and others).
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8.69",8:1 <b>Meteg Amma:</b> Following recent translations. The Hebrew is obscure; reading it as <i>mgt h’amh</i> would yield “from Gat to Amma.”

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.1","Mefiboshet: David’s consolidation of power now makes it feasible for him to be magnanimous. As was noted previously in II 4, a descendant of Sha’ul has survived the civil war. As a man who is lame, Mefiboshet poses no threat to David, since such a condition would naturally have made it impossible for him to lead troops against the king, and so David allows him to both maintain a large laboring household and have a regular seat at the royal table. This arrangement recurs at the end of Kings, and hence at the end of the entire four-book sequence of the Early Prophets, where the surviving Davidic king, Yehoiakhin, is released from captivity in Babylon and boarded at state expense. His status as a favored but impotent royal figure is as telling there as Mefiboshet’s is here."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.2","The House of Sha’ul seems to have survived for centuries, at least in memory; inclusion of passages sympathetic to Sha’ul indicate a later desire to be sensitive to ongoing northern traditions. This kind of attachment to past loyalties can still be seen in many countries and cultures, as witnessed in the ethnic and religious conflicts of recent times."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.3",9:1 David said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.4",Is there yet anyone that remains from the House of Sha’ul?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.5",—so that I may show him loyalty for the sake of Yehonatan.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.6","2 Now the House of Sha’ul had a servant, his name was Tziva,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.7",and they called him to David.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.8",The king said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.9",Are you Tziva?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.10",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.11",Your servant.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.12",3 The king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.13","Is there no one still [alive] from the House of Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.14",that I may show him the loyalty of God?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.15",Tziva said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.16","There is still a son of Yehonatan, stricken in the feet."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.17",4 The king said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.18",Where is he?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.19",Tziva said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.20","Here, he is at the house of Makhir son of Ammiel, in Lo-Devar."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.21","5 So King David sent and had him taken from the house of Makhir son of Ammiel, from Lo-Devar."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.22","6 And Mefiboshet son of Yehonatan son of Sha’ul came to David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.23",and he flung himself on his face and bowed low.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.24",David said: Mefiboshet!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.25",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.26",Here is your servant.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.27",7 David said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.28","Do not be afraid,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.29","for I will show, yes, show you loyalty for the sake of Yehonatan your father;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.30","I will return to you all the lands of Sha’ul your [grand]father,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.31","and you, you will eat bread at my table regularly."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.32",8 He bowed low and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.33","What is your servant,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.34",that you have turned your face toward a dead dog like me?

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9.39",8 <b>a dead dog:</b> Once again we encounter the canine imagery that is so pervasive in the book.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.1","War with Ammonites and Arameans: At the start of Sha’ul’s reign, he had rescued a town from the Ammonite king Nahash (I Sam. 11). Seeking now to cement ties with the Ammonites, David is met with suspicion and bad behavior—the humiliation of his emissaries—by the son of this same Nahash. David’s subsequent attack overcomes mainly Arameans who had been hired as mercenaries by the Ammonites. The latter now realize their mistake. By the end of the chapter it is clear that the Ammonites’ days as an effective enemy of Israel are numbered. Before their defeat at the hands of the Israelites can occur, however, the text turns to a contemporary incident which will reverberate far beyond the context of a local war."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.2","9 The king called Tziva, Sha’ul’s serving-lad, and said to him:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.3","All that belonged to Sha’ul and to all his household, I give to your lord’s [grand]son;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.4","10 you are to work the ground for him, you and your children and your servants,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.6","while Mefiboshet, your lord’s grandson, shall eat bread regularly at my table."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.7",—Now Tziva had fifteen sons and twenty servants.—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.8",11 Tziva said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.9","According to all that my lord king commands his servant,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.10",thus will your servant do.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.11","So Mefiboshet was eating at David’s table, like one of the king’s sons."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.12","12 Now Mefiboshet had a young son, his name was Mikha,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.13",while all those dwelling in Tziva’s house were servants to Mefiboshet.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.14","13 And Mefiboshet stayed in Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.15",for at the king’s table he ate regularly.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.16",Now he was lame in his two feet.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.17",10:1 It was [some time] after this
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.18","that the king of the Children of Ammon died,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.19",and Hanun his son became king in his stead.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.21","I will show loyalty to Hanun son of Nahash,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.22",as his father showed loyalty to me.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.23","So David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants, for his father,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.24",and David’s servants came to the land of the Children of Ammon.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.25",3 But the officials of the Children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.26","Is David [really] honoring your father in your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.27",when he sends you comforters?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.28","Isn’t it for the sake of spying out the town, to explore it and to overthrow it"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.29",that David has sent his servants to you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.30","4 So Hanun took David’s servants,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.31",he shaved off half their beards
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.32","and cut their clothes in half, as far as their buttocks,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.33",and then he sent them off.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.42","the king of Maakha, [with] a thousand men,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.43","and men of Tov, twelve thousand men."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.44","7 David heard,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.45","and he sent Yoav and all the armed-forces, the mighty-men."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.46","8 And the Children of Ammon went out and arranged-ranks for battle, at the entrance to the gate,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.47",while the Arameans from Tzova and Rehov and the men of Tov and Maakha were alone in the open-field.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.48","9 And Yoav saw that the face of battle was upon him, in front and in back,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.49",so he chose from all the choice-warriors in Israel
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.50","and arranged-ranks to meet the Arameans,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.51","10 while the rest of the fighting-people he placed in the hand of Avishai his brother,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.52",and arranged-ranks to meet the Children of Ammon.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.53",11 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.54","If Aram is too strong for me,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.55","you will be deliverance for me,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.56","and if the Children of Ammon are too strong for you,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.57",I will go to deliver you!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.58","12 Be strong and let us be strengthened, on behalf of our people and on behalf of the towns of our God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.59",while Y<small>HWH</small>—may he do what is good in his eyes!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.60","13 And Yoav approached, and the fighting-people who were with him, for battle against Aram,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.61",and they fled before him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.62","14 Now when the Children of Ammon saw that Aram had fled,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.63",they fled before Avishai and came back to the town.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.64","Then Yoav turned from [attacking] the Children of Ammon, and came back to Jerusalem."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.65","15 And Aram saw that they were defeated before Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.66","so they gathered together,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.67","16 and Hadad’ezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were across the River, so that they came to Helam,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.68",with Shovakh commander of Hadad’ezer’s forces in front of them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.69","17 It was told to David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.70","so he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.71","and the Arameans arrayed-ranks to meet David, and waged battle with him."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.72",18 And the Arameans fled before Israel;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.73","David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand horsemen from Aram,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.74","while Shovakh, the commander of Hadad’ezer’s forces, he struck down, so that he died there."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10.75",_____________

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.1","David’s Double Crime and God’s Response: After a slew of political successes—eliminating his rivals, unifying the country, establishing a new centralized capital and bringing the Coffer there, and subduing foreign enemies—David makes a fateful and fatal error. He behaves as kings throughout the ages have done, taking what is not his and overstepping the bounds of both private morality and Israel’s covenant with God. That later generations were uncomfortable with this story is clear already in the Bible: the book of Chronicles, wishing to focus on David as the ideal king (out of hope, perhaps, for restoration of the monarchy in the Persian period), simply omitted it and the troubling Avshalom episodes that follow. Equally, later Jewish tradition as represented in the Talmud (Ketubot 9b) sought to exonerate David at least from adultery, on the grounds that warriors of the time were required to give their wives conditional divorces."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.2","The book of Samuel, however, will have none of such whitewashing, and features this tale as the root of subsequent events in David’s life, lavishing a considerable amount of artistic skill upon it. Like so many central biblical tales, it is constructed on a foundation of leading words—in this case, “lie” and “send.” Rather than functioning as mere signposts, however, these words undergo what Trible suggestively calls a “pilgrimage”; they are transformed within the story, and bring us along on the journey. From the initially neutral “lying-place,” David’s rooftop couch, we are taken to the crime itself, where he “lies” with Bat-Sheva (11:4). The verb next appears in Uriyya’s righteous refusal to go back home in the midst of the war: “and I, I should come into my house / to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife?” (11:11). It subsequently becomes part of David’s punishment: “I will take away your women … your fellow … will lie with your women” (12:11). The concluding scenes of the story trace David’s movement back into the realm of forgiveness and resolution, with his “lying on the ground” (12:16), pleading for his newborn son’s life, and then his final, legitimate “lying” with Bat-Sheva, which results in the conception of the promised heir, Shelomo. Thus an initially neutral term becomes the vehicle for a well-trodden biblical journey of sin and repentance."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.3","The other key word, “send,” has a parallel function. Eleven times in twenty-six verses, messages and people are sent, almost always by David, the master manipulator. The long arm of royal power reaches into the home of a private citizen and abroad to the public arena of the battlefield, with the king seemingly able to move his subjects around like chess pieces. Much of his sending is successful, but it is dramatically countered by the divine hand in 12:1 (“and Y<small>HWH</small> sent Natan to David”). Despite David’s well-thought-out plans, in the end he cannot stand up to God’s sending—a verb that in the Bible is almost always used in connection with prophets. And the prophet Natan’s mission is a classic one, with the man of God pitted against the king. It will be structurally repeated, along with parallel circumstances, in the great encounter between Eliyyahu (Elijah) and Ah’av (Ahab) in I Kings 21. In the present story, it is only when David’s repentance is accepted, and his punishment doled out, that we encounter the last “sending” of the sequence, in which God approves of the new son (12:25)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.4","19 And all the kings, Hadad’ezer’s servants, saw that they had been defeated before Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.5","so they made-peace with Israel and served them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.6",for the Arameans were afraid to deliver the Children of Ammon any longer.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.7","11:1 Now it was at the turning of the year, at the time of kings’ going forth,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.8","that David sent Yoav and his servants with him, and all Israel:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.9","they wrought-ruin to the Children of Ammon and besieged Rabba,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.10",while David stayed in Jerusalem.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.11",2 Now it was around the time of sunset
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.12","that David arose from his lying-place and went-for-a-walk on the roof of the king’s house,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.13","and he saw a woman washing herself, from on the roof—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.14",the woman was exceedingly fair of appearance.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.15","3 David sent and inquired after the woman,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.16","and they said: Is this not Bat-Sheva daughter of Eliam, wife of Uriyya the Hittite?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.17","4 David sent messengers, and he had her taken:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.18",she came to him and he lay with her
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.19",—now she had just purified herself from her state-of-<i>tum’a</i>—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.20",and then she returned to her house.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.21",5 The woman became pregnant;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.22","she sent [word] and had it told to David, she said:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.23",I am pregnant!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.24","One might also note the text’s repetition of “eat,” a possible sexual metaphor, and “dead,” with the illegitimate child’s demise echoing Uriyya’s as a kind of payback. Additionally, the story uses various meanings of the term “house,” in an even broader spread than what we observed in Chap. 7. Indeed, the whole narrative here seems to be structured upon the movement of various characters from house to house—the palace, Uriyya’s home, the sanctuary (“Y<small>HWH</small>’s House”), and the domicile of the prophet Natan. Looming over all the physical movement is the eventual fate of David’s household and his dynastic house."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.25","The story finds additional uses for the sound of words. Natan’s little parable in Chap. 12, which some scholars feel does not fit the situation very well, is profoundly connected to its referent by the prophet’s description of the poor man’s lamb in 12:3: “from his morsel it would eat, from his cup it would drink, in his bosom it would lie— / it became to him like a daughter/<i>bat</i>.” As literary critics have long pointed out (see, for instance, Simon 1967), the “eat/drink/lie” sequence echoes Uriyya’s earlier refusal of 11:11, quoted above, and the coincidence of <i>Bat</i>-Sheva’s name is surely nothing of the kind. So when the unwitting king angrily condemns the rich man of the parable, the audience, its ears tuned aright, can sense the springing of the trap."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.26","Also significant, and almost unprecedented in biblical poetry, is God’s message in 12:11. It is noteworthy in its rhetoric and unprecedented in its use of rhyme, here represented in English by six consecutive lines that echo “your …” It is as if God’s words, thus delivered, cannot be ignored, if only because the rhyme makes them reverberate throughout the throne room."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.27","A final stylistic point has been noted by Brueggemann (1990). There are three dramatic two-word phrases in Hebrew, impossible, at least for me, to reproduce in English: “I am pregnant” (11:5), “You are the man!” (12:7), and “I have sinned against Y<small>HWH</small>!” (12:13). The brevity of biblical language, here as elsewhere, makes for heightened emotional impact."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.28","The David and Bat-Sheva story is an intimate look at David’s many moods, and shows what he is capable of, for good and for ill, in a variety of situations. As presented in II Samuel, it is a moment from which David, despite the relatively happy endings of this chapter (Shelomo’s birth and David’s capture of Rabba), can never fully recover. From this point forward in his life, the misfortunes of Israel will be identical with those of the House of David."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.29",6 So David sent [word] to Yoav:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.30",Send me Uriyya the Hittite.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.31",And Yoav sent Uriyya to David.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.32","7 Uriyya came to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.33","and David asked after the welfare of Yoav, the welfare of the fighting-people, and the welfare of the battle;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.34",8 then David said to Uriyya:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.35",Go down to your house and wash your feet!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.36","Uriyya went out of the king’s house,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.37","and after him went out a portion from the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.38","9 but Uriyya lay down at the entrance to the king’s house, with all his lord’s servants;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.39",he did not go down to his house.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.40","10 They told David, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.41",Uriyya has not gone down to his house.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.42",David said to Uriyya:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.43",Isn’t it from a [long] journey that you have come?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.44",For-what-reason have you not gone down to your house?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.45",11 Uriyya said to David:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.46","The Coffer and Israel and Judah are staying at Sukkot,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.47",my lord Yoav and my lord’s servants are camping on the surface of the open-field—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.48","and I, I should come into my house"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.49",to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.50",By your life and by your [very] self: If I were to do this thing … !
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.51",12 David said to Uriyya:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.52",Stay here today as well; tomorrow I will send you off.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.53",So Uriyya stayed in Jerusalem on that day.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.54","13 Now on the morrow David had him called, and he ate and drank in his presence,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.55",and he made him drunk.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.56","He went out in the evening to lie down in his lying-place with his lord’s servants,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.57",but to his house he did not go down.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.58",14 So it was in the morning
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.59","that David wrote a letter to Yoav and sent it by the hand of Uriyya,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.60","15 and he wrote in the letter, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.61","Put Uriyya facing the strongest [point of] battle,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.62","and turn back behind him, so that he is struck down and dies."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.63",16 So it was
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.64","when Yoav had observed the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.65",that he placed Uriyya at the place where he knew that there were men of valor;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.66","17 the men of the city went out and did battle with Yoav,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.67","and there fell some of the fighting-people, of David’s servants,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.68",and there died also Uriyya the Hittite.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.69",18 Yoav sent and had David told all the details about the battle;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.70","19 he charged the messenger, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.71","When you have finished reporting everything about the battle to the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.72",20 it will be:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.73",if the king’s anger starts up and he says to you:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.74",For-what-reason did you draw near the city to do battle?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.75",Did you not know that they would shoot down from on the wall?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.76",21 Who struck down Avimelekh son of Yerubboshet—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.77","did not a woman throw down on him a riding millstone from on the wall,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.78",so that he died at Tevetz?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.79",Why did you approach the wall?—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.80",Then you are to say:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.81",Also your servant Uriyya the Hittite is dead.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.82","22 The messenger went off, he came and told David all that Yoav had sent him [to say];"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.83",23 the messenger said to David:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.84","Indeed, the men were mightier than we, they went out at us in the open-field;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.85","we were upon them, up to the entrance to the gate,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.86","24 but the shooters shot down at your servants from on the wall,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.87","so that there died some of the king’s servants,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.88",and also your servant Uriyya the Hittite is dead.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.89",25 David said to the messenger:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.90",Say thus to Yoav:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.91","Do not let this thing be evil in your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.92",for like this and like that the sword devours!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.93",Strengthen your battle against the city and destroy it!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.94",And [you] strengthen him!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.95","26 Uriyya’s wife heard that her husband was dead,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.96",so she beat [the breast] for her lord.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.97","27 But when the mourning-period was past, David sent and had her brought to his house;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.98","she became his wife, and she bore him a son."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.99","But the thing that David had done was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.100",12:1 and Y<small>HWH</small> sent Natan to David;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.101",he came to him and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.102","There were two men in a certain town,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.103",one rich and one poor.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.104","2 The rich one had flocks and herds, exceedingly many,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.105",3 while the poor one had nothing at all except for one little lamb which he had bought;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.106","he kept-it-alive, and it grew up with him, together with his children:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.107","from his morsel it would eat, from his cup it would drink, in his bosom it would lie—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.108",it became to him like a daughter/<i>bat</i>.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.109","4 A journey-walker came to the rich man,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.110","but he thought-it-a-pity to take from his flocks or from his herds, to make ready for the wayfarer who had come to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.111",so he took the poor man’s lamb and made it ready for the man who had come to him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.112","5 David’s anger flared up exceedingly against the man,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.113",and he said to Natan:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.114","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.115","indeed, a son of death is the man who does this!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.116","6 And for the lamb he shall pay fourfold,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.117","because he did this thing, and since he had no pity!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.118",7 Natan said to David:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.119",You are the man!

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.127","Uriyya the Hittite you have struck down by the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.128",and his wife you have taken for yourself as a wife—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.129",while him you have killed by means of the sword of the Children of Ammon!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.130",10 So-now—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.131","the sword shall not depart from your house for the ages,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.132",because you despised me and took the wife of Uriyya the Hittite to be a wife for you!

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.134","Here, I will raise up against your [person]"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.135",evil from your house;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.136",I will take away your women
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.137","from before your eyes,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.143",13 David said to Natan:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.144",I have sinned against Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.145",Natan said to David:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.146","As for Y<small>HWH</small>, he has transferred your sin—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.147",you will not die;

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.150",15 Natan went back to his house.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.151","And Y<small>HWH</small> attacked the child that Uriyya’s wife had borne to David, so that he became sick."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.152","16 David besought God on behalf of the boy,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.153",and David fasted a fast;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.154",he would come and spend-the-night lying on the ground.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.155","17 And the elders of his house arose about him to raise him up from the ground,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.156",but he was unwilling and would not be nourished with food with them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.157",18 Now it was on the seventh day that the child died.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.158","David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.159","Here, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, but he did not hearken to our voice;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.160",so how can we say to him: The child is dead? He might do evil!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.161",19 David saw that his servants were whispering [among themselves];
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.162",and David understood that the child was dead.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.163",David said to his servants:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.164",Is the child dead?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.165",They said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.166",[He is] dead.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.167",20 Then David arose from the ground;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.168","he washed, and poured [oil on himself], and changed his clothes,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.169",and he came into the house of Y<small>HWH</small> and bowed down;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.170","then he came back to his house, requested that they put food before him, and ate."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.171",21 His servants said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.172",What [kind of] thing is this that you have done?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.173","For the sake of the living child, you fasted and wept,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.174","but now that the child is dead, you arise and eat food!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.175",22 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.176","As long as the child was still alive, I fasted and wept,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.177","for I said [to myself]: Who knows, perhaps Y<small>HWH</small> will be gracious to me, and the child will live!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.178","23 But now he is dead—why, then, should I fast?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.179",Can I make him return again?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.180","I may go to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.181",but he will not return to me.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.182",24 David comforted Bat-Sheva his wife;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.183","he came to her and lay with her,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.184",and she bore a son and called his name Shelomo/Peace.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.185","25 Now Y<small>HWH</small> loved him, and he sent by the hand of Natan the Prophet;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.186","he called his name Yedidya, by the grace of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.187",26 Yoav waged battle against Rabba of the Children of Ammon and captured the royal city;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.188",27 then Yoav sent mesengers to David
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.189",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.190",I have waged battle against Rabba;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.191",I have also captured the water city.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.192","28 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.193","gather the rest of the fighting-people and encamp against the city, and capture it,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.194","lest I myself take the city, and my own name be called over it!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.195",29 So David gathered all the fighting-people and went to Rabba;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.196",he waged battle against it and captured it.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.197",30 Then he took their king’s crown from off his head
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.198","—its weight was a talent of gold, with a precious stone—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.199","and it was [put] on David’s head,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.200","while the spoils of the city he brought out, exceedingly much."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.201","31 As for the people who were in it, he brought them out and set [them to work] with the saw, and with picks of bronze, and with axes of bronze,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.202",and had them pass through the brick-kiln.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.203",Thus he would do with all the towns of the Children of Ammon.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.204",Then David and all the fighting-people returned to Jerusalem.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.207","2 <b>his lying-place:</b> More simply, “his bed,” but I have sought to retain the key verb “lie” in the translation. Evidently David has been sleeping, or resting, from the time of the early afternoon nap on. <b>fair:</b> Lit., “good/goodly.” The other biblical characters who are described as “fair to look at” are Rivka (Rebecca) and Ester (Esther)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.208","3 <b>David … inquired:</b> Previously, he had inquired of God in different situations (2:1, 5:19, 23), but not, of course, here (Hamilton). <b>Bat-Sheva:</b> pronounced <i>bot-SHEH-vah;</i> trad. English “Bathsheba.” <b>Uriyya the Hittite:</b> Pronounced <i>oo-ree-YAH;</i> trad. English “Uriah.” He was a high-ranking soldier in David’s army. The name is ironically a pious Israelite one, meaning “Y<small>HWH</small> Is My Light.” The Hittites mentioned here are not to be confused with the earlier great empire in Anatolia (modern Turkey); as in Gen. 23, the term probably refers to a local Canaanite group."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.209","4 <b>purified herself:</b> The verb <i>kiddeish</i> in other contexts denotes “hallowing”; here it is simply the non-priestly word for purification. <b>her state-of-<i>tum’a:</i></b> Bat-Sheva’s washing occurs at the end of her menstrual period, during which intercourse would have been forbidden because of ritual pollution (<i>tum’a;</i> see Lev. 18:19). It means that the forthcoming child could not be Uriyya’s. Bat-Sheva is here also at her most fertile, twelve days or so after the onset of menstruation."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.210",8 <b>wash your feet:</b> Possibly a euphemism for intercourse; “feet” sometimes signifies “genitals” in the Bible. <b>portion:</b> Of food.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.229","24 <b>comforted:</b> The same verb applied to David (unknowingly, by himself) in v.6, meaning “pitied.” <b>Peace:</b> Perhaps short for “Y<small>HWH</small>’s Peace.” Alternatively, it may signify “Replacement” (for the dead child)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.230","25 <b>Yedidya:</b> The name signifies “Beloved of Y<small>HWH</small>,” rather like the meaning of “David,” and thus hints at a resolution to the story."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.231",27 <b>water city:</b> Heb. unclear; a JPS note conjectures “perhaps the source of the water supply.”

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12.233","31 <b>pass through:</b> Or, with a slight letter change, “put to work at.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.1","Amnon and Tamar: If the previous story constituted the great divide in David’s life as king, the next one immediately launches into its consequences. David’s desire for a woman, culminating in a tale of adultery and murder, is followed by his son Amnon’s obsession with his own half sister, which leads him to rape and then spurn Tamar. He is subsequently cut down in an act of revenge by her full brother Avshalom. The fact that Amnon is the heir to the throne well illustrates the fateful mixing of private and public spheres that is characteristic of many narratives on biblical leadership."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.2","In further emphasizing the connection between the two texts, several words recur here. The story picks up on the “nourishment” that David had refused in Chap. 12 and makes it into a major motif, resounding six times in six verses. “Lying/lying down” also returns, understandably. What is new, though, is the intensity of speech between the central characters. Not only do terrible things occur, but they are haggled over, and we are brought into the realm of extreme emotions: obsession, desperation, shame, rejection, and vengefulness."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.3","Amid the personal details, this narrative also opens the Avshalom cycle, as noted in the Introduction to Samuel above, with the repetition of the theme word “heart.” In addition to its use as a descriptor of Tamar’s prepared food, it appears in Avshalom’s ironic statement to his sister in v.20, “Don’t take this thing to heart!”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.4","The sequence of events leading to the murder of Amnon is telling. In a move that suggests elements of the opening of the Yosef story in Genesis, a father sends his son into a situation of certain conflict (note too Amnon’s “Have everyone go out from me” in v.9, recalling the moment before Yosef reveals himself to his brothers in Gen. 45:1, and the mention of Tamar’s “ornamented tunic,” a phrase used to describe Yosef’s famous article of clothing in Gen. 37:3). The fact that the king at first believes the rumor that all of his sons have been murdered (vv.30–31) is perhaps indicative of a suddenly fragile state of mind. The first part of God’s recent statement of punishment for David’s crimes, “So-now— / the sword shall not depart from your house for the ages” (12:10), has received its first fulfillment."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.5","This part of the chapter structurally balances the earlier rape scene, encompassing refusal, the appearance of Yonadav, eating, and grief marked by the usual tearing of clothing (Polzin 1989). It also suggests what will be more fully developed subsequently, namely, Avshalom’s reprising of some of his father’s traits and experiences. Here, he flees for a time, as David had fled from Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.6",13:1 It was [some time] after this:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.7","now Avshalom son of David had a beautiful sister—her name was Tamar,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.8",and Amnon son of David fell in love with her.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.9",2 And Amnon was distressed to [the point of] being sick because of Tamar his sister
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.10","—indeed, she was a nubile-girl—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.11",and it seemed impossible in Amnon’s eyes to do anything to her.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.12","3 Now Amnon had a friend—his name was Yonadav son of Shim’a, David’s brother,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.13",and Yonadav was an exceedingly worldly-wise man.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.14",4 He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.15","For-what-reason are you so haggard, O son of the king, morning after morning?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.16",Won’t you tell me?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.17",Amnon said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.18",Tamar—the sister—of Avshalom—my brother—I love!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.19",5 Yehonadav said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.20","Lie down on your lying-place and feign-sickness,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.21","and when your father comes to see you, say to him:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.22",Now let Tamar my sister come
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.23",and nourish me with some food;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.24","let her make the nourishment ready before my eyes, in order that I may see it,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.25",and I will eat from her hand.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.26","6 So Amnon lay down and feigned-sickness,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.27","and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.28",Now let Tamar my sister come
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.29","and heat two heartcakes before my eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.30",that I may be nourished from her hand.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.31","7 David sent [word] to Tamar, in the palace-house, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.32",Pray go to the house of Amnon your brother
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.33",and make him some nourishment.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.34","8 So Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother, while he was lying down."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.35","She took some dough, kneaded it, heated it before his eyes, and boiled the heartcakes;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.36","9 then she took the pot and placed it before him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.37",but he refused to eat.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.38",Amnon said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.39",Have everyone go out from me!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.40",And everyone went out from him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.41",10 Amnon said to Tamar:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.42","Bring the nourishment into the inner-room, so that I may be nourished from your hand!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.43","So Tamar took the heartcakes that she had made, and brought them to Amnon her brother into the inner-room."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.44","11 She brought them close to him to eat,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.45",but he overpowered her and said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.46","Come, lie with me, sister!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.47",12 She said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.48","No, brother, don’t force me,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.49",for such is not to be done in Israel—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.50",don’t do this vile thing!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.51","13 As for me, where would I take my disgrace?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.52","And as for you, you would be like one of the vile ones in Israel!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.53","So-now, just speak to the king—indeed, he will not withhold me from you!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.54",14 But he would not hearken to her voice;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.55","he overpowered her and forced her, and lay with her."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.56",15 Then Amnon hated her with an exceedingly great hatred—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.57","indeed, greater was the hatred with which he hated her than the love with which he had loved her."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.58",Amnon said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.59",Get up! Go!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.60",16 She said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.61",About this great evil—more than the other thing that you did to me—sending me away … !
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.62",But he would not hearken to her;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.63",17 he called to his attending lad
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.64",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.65","Just send this one away from me, outside,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.66",and lock the door behind her!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.67","18 —Now on her was an ornamented tunic,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.68",for thus were the king’s nubile daughters clothed in robes.—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.69","So his attendant brought her outside, and locked the door behind her."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.70","19 And Tamar put ashes on her head,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.71",while the ornamented tunic that was on her she tore;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.72",she put her hands on her head
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.73","and went along, going along and crying out."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.74",20 Avshalom her brother said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.75",Has Amnon your brother been with you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.76","For now, sister, be silent—he is your brother;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.77",do not take this thing to heart!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.78","So Tamar stayed, desolate, in the house of Avshalom her brother."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.79","21 Now when King David heard about all these things,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.80",he was exceedingly agitated.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.81","22 And Avshalom would not speak with Amnon, [anything] from evil to good,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.82",for Avshalom hated Amnon over the fact that he had forced Tamar his sister.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.83",23 Now it was at two-years’ time
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.84","that they were shearing [sheep] for Avshalom in Baal Hatzor that is near Efrayim,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.85",and Avshalom invited all the king’s sons.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.86",24 Avshalom came to the king
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.87",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.88","Now here, your servant is having shearing [done];"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.89",now let the king and his servants go with your servant.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.90",25 The king said to Avshalom:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.91","No, my son, now we cannot go, all of us;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.92",let us not weigh-heavily on you!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.93","He pressed him, but he would not go,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.94",and he gave him farewell-blessing.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.95",26 Avshalom said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.96","If not, now let Amnon my brother go with us."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.97",The king said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.98",Why should he go with you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.99","27 But Avshalom pressed him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.100","so he sent Amnon with him, along with all the king’s sons."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.101","28 And Avshalom charged his serving-lads, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.102","Now take note: when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.103","and I say to you: Strike down Amnon!,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.104",then put him to death—do not be afraid!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.105",Have not I myself charged you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.106","Be strong, be valiant ones!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.107","29 So Avshalom’s lads did to Amnon as Avshalom had charged,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.108","and all the king’s sons arose and mounted each on his mule, and they fled."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.109","30 It was, when they were on the way,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.110","that the rumor came to David, namely:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.111",Avshalom has struck down all the king’s sons;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.112",not one of them is left!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.113","31 The king arose and tore his garments, and lay down on the ground,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.114",while all his servants stood [over him] with torn garments.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.115","32 But Yonadav son of Shim’a, David’s brother, spoke up and said:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.116","Let not my lord think that all the lads, the king’s sons,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.117","have been put-to-death,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.118",for Amnon alone has died;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.119",for by Avshalom’s mouth it has been determined since the time of his forcing Tamar his sister.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.120","33 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.121","do not let the king take the matter to heart, saying: All the king’s sons have died,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.122","for Amnon alone has died,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.123",34 and Avshalom has gotten away.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.124",And the serving-lad standing watch lifted up his eyes and saw:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.125","now here, many people were going away on the road behind him, from the side of the hill."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.126",35 Yonadav said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.127","Here, the king’s sons have come;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.128","exactly as your servant’s word, so it was!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.129","36 And it was, when he finished speaking,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.130","that here, the king’s sons came;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.131","they lifted up their voices and wept,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.132","and also the king and all his servants wept, an exceedingly great weeping."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.133",37 —Now Avshalom had gotten away;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.134","he had gone to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur.—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.135",And he mourned for his son all the days.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.136","38 Now Avshalom had gotten away and gone to Geshur,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.137",and he was there for three years.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.138","39 Then the king’s spirit was spent for going out against Avshalom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.139","for he was consoled concerning Amnon, for he was dead."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.140",_____________
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.141","13:1 <b>Avshalom:</b> Pronounced <i>ahv-shah-LOM</i>. The name combines “Father” (figuratively God, or actually David) and “Peace/Well-being.” <b>Tamar:</b> Pronounced <i>tah-MAHR</i>. Her name means “date-palm.” <b>Amnon:</b> Pronounced <i>ahm-NOHN</i>. Tamar and Avshalom’s half brother and heir to the throne. His name ironically connotes “faithful.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.142","2 <b>nubile-girl:</b> As with Jephthah’s daughter in Judg. 12, the word <i>betula</i> here probably refers to a young woman of marriageable age rather than to a virgin per se; the reason for Tamar’s being forbidden to Amnon appears to lie elsewhere (Wenham). <b>to do anything:</b> To have sexual contact."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.143",3 <b>Yonadav:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-nah-DAHV;</i> trad. English “Jonadab.” In v.5 the name has the alternate “Yehonadav.” <b>worldly-wise:</b> Heb. <i>h-k-m</i> connotes not only intellectual but also practical wisdom. See also 14:2ff. and 20:16 below.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.144","4 <b>Tamar—the sister …:</b> McCarter (1984) notes how each word in this verse begins with the same letter (<i>alef</i>), producing “a series of gasping sighs,” and Rendsburg (1998–99) includes it as an example of (emotionally) “confused language.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.145","6 <b>heat … heartcakes:</b> Heb. <i>u-tlabbev levivot</i>. The verb appears also in the Song of Songs (4:9), to indicate sexual arousal. <b>heartcakes:</b> Heb. <i>levivot;</i> others, simply “cakes,” but the “heart” (Heb. <i>leiv, leivav</i>) motif is central to the Avshalom stories, as I have argued in the Introduction to this section. Shaped foods were known in the ancient Near East (Prof. Chaim Cohen, personal communication)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.146",9 <b>Have everyone go out:</b> The equivalent of “Clear the room!”
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.147",11 <b>overpowered:</b> Or “took hold of.”
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.148","12–13 <b>such is not to be done … disgrace:</b> The same language is used in Gen. 34, the rape of Dina narrative. <b>vile thing … vile ones:</b> As in I Sam. 25; others understand as “foolishness … fools.” <b>he will not withhold me:</b> In order for her plea to have any force, such a thing must have been possible in royal society. Yet, as Sasson shows, it does not appear much outside of Egypt. He makes the intriguing conjecture that Tamar may have in fact been Avshalom’s daughter (see 14:27) and therefore Amnon’s niece, which would solve a number of the story’s problems."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.149",15 <b>Get up! Go!:</b> With the force of “Get lost!” The wording is close to the horrifying “Get up! Let’s go!” that the Levite of Judg. 19:28 barks at his gang-raped and unconscious (if not dead) concubine.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.150","16 <b>About this great evil …:</b> The halting syntax here may be less a function of a defective text, as some have maintained, and more of Tamar’s emotional state (Kwitkin-Close, written communication, and Rendsburg 1998–99)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.151",17 <b>this one:</b> Note how the phrasing suggests contempt.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.152",18 <b>ornamented tunic:</b> Like Joseph’s famous one in Gen. 37:3.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.154",21 <b>agitated:</b> Yet he apparently does not act further.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.155",23 <b>Baal Hatzor:</b> Well north of Jerusalem. <b>Efrayim:</b> Presumably the name of another town; McCarter (1984) suggests an original name of “Ofra.”
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.156",28 <b>merry:</b> Elsewhere I use “in good-humor.”
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.157","32 <b>mouth:</b> Or, as elsewhere, “order.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.158",37 <b>Talmai:</b> His maternal grandfather.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13.159","39 <b>the king’s spirit was spent for going out against:</b> MT has “David the King longed for,” but the verb is feminine, like “spirit” (<i>ru’ah</i>) in Hebrew, and “David” (Heb. <i>d-w-d</i>) could easily be an orthographic error for “spirit” (<i>r-w-h</i>). Some interpreters feel that David really is pining for Avshalom, but, as Alter (1999) points out, in the next chapter the king refuses to see him. <b>for he was dead:</b> Perhaps another indication of David’s ability to “move on” (see his reaction to his illegitimate son’s death in Chap. 12)—not necessarily an admirable trait, in this case."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.1","The Wise Woman of Tekoa; Avshalom Returns: After some time passes, David’s commander Yoav, who throughout II Samuel acts in what he believes are the king’s best interests, now perceives that David is ripe for Avshalom to return to Jerusalem. But knowing David as he does, he apparently feels that the reconciliation cannot occur without some kind of subterfuge, or at least teaching the king a lesson. So, like Natan had done in Chap. 12, he concocts a story to draw David into the emotional heart of the situation. Enlisting a “worldly-wise woman,” Yoav lays out the fictional case of a sole surviving son, who, should he die at the hand of an angry family member, will by his death eradicate his father’s name and line from the world. David of course promises to protect the helpless woman and her son, but eventually comes to realize that the story is really about himself—as he had not perceived in the case of Natan’s little parable in Chap. 12."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.2","The ultimate irony of the narrative is that father and son are brought together by the hardened warrior Yoav, yet it is he who will ultimately separate them forever, four chapters hence."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.3",14:1 And Yoav son of Tzeruya knew
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.4","that the king’s heart was toward Avshalom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.5",2 so Yoav sent to Tekoa;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.6",he fetched from there a worldly-wise woman
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.7",and said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.8","Pray feign-mourning, pray clothe yourself in garments of mourning;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.9","do not pour oil [on yourself],"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.10",but be like a woman [who] these many days has been mourning over the dead.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.11",3 You are to come to the king
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.12",and are to speak to him according to these words …
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.13",And Yoav put the words in her mouth.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.14",4 So the Tekoite woman talked to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.15","she flung herself on her nostrils to the earth and bowed low,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.16",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.17","Deliver [me], O king!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.18",5 The king said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.19",What [ails] you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.20",She said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.21","Alas, I am a widow woman—my husband died."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.22","6 Now your handmaid had two sons,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.23","but the two of them scuffled in the open-field, with no rescuer between them;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.24",the one struck down the other-one and caused his death.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.25","7 And here, the whole clan has arisen against your handmaid and has said:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.26","Give over the one who struck down his brother,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.27","that we may put him to death for the life of his brother, whom he killed;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.28",we want to destroy [him]! Even the heir!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.29","So they will extinguish my ember that remains,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.30",providing no name or survivor for my husband on the face of the earth.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.31",8 The king said to the woman:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.32","Go back to your house,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.33",and I myself will issue-a-command regarding you.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.34",9 The Tekoite woman said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.35","On me, my lord king, be the iniquity, and on my Father’s House,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.36",but the king and his throne are clear [of blame].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.37",10 The king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.38","The one who speaks [amiss] to you, have him brought to me—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.39",he will not continue to harm you!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.40",11 She said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.41",Pray let the king be mindful of Y<small>HWH</small> your God
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.42",—too much might the blood redeemer bring-ruin—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.43",so that they do not destroy my son!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.44",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.45","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.46",if a hair of your son should fall to the ground … !
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.47",12 Then the woman said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.48",Pray let your handmaid speak a word to my lord king.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.49",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.50",Speak.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.51",13 The woman said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.52",Now why have you planned in this way against God’s people?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.53","By the king speaking this word, [he is] as one guilty,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.54",by not letting his banished one return.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.55","14 For we will die, yes, die,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.56","like water running on the ground, which cannot be gathered up."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.57",But God will not carry a life away;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.58","he will plan plans, to not keep the banished one banished from him."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.59","15 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.60","[the reason] that I have come to speak this word to the king, my lord,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.61",is that the people made me afraid.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.62",Your handmaid said [to herself]: Let me now speak to the king;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.63",perhaps the king will act on his maidservant’s word.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.64","16 Indeed, the king will hearken"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.65","to rescue his maidservant from the grasp of the [avenging] man,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.66","from destroying me and my son together, away from God’s inheritance."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.67",17 And your handmaid said [to herself]:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.68","Now may the word of my lord king be for [my] rest,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.69","for like a messenger of God, so is my lord king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.70",to hear out the good and the evil—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.71",may Y<small>HWH</small> your God be with you!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.72","18 The king answered, he said to the woman:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.73",Do not conceal from me a thing that I ask of you!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.74",The woman said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.75",Pray let my lord king speak.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.76",19 The king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.77",Is the hand of Yoav with you in all this?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.78",The woman answered and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.79","By your life, my lord king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.80",there is no turning-right or turning-left from all that my lord king has spoken;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.81","indeed, your servant Yoav himself commanded me—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.82",he himself put in the mouth of your handmaid all these words.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.83",20 In order to reverse the face of the matter
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.84",did your servant Yoav do this thing;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.85","but my lord is wise,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.86","like the wisdom of a messenger of God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.87",to know all that is on earth!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.88",21 Then the king said to Yoav:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.89","Here now, I have done this thing."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.90","So go, return the lad Avshalom!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.91",_____________
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.92","14:2 <b>Tekoa:</b> South of Bet-Lehem, or about ten miles south of Jerusalem, on the border between farmland and the desert. <b>a worldly-wise woman:</b> Another one appears at the end of the stories concerning Avshalom, Chap. 20. The Bible uses this kind of bracketing structure fairly often. <b>pour oil:</b> The application of oil was considered a part of personal hygiene in the ancient world. See note on 12:20, above."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.93","6 <b>your handmaid:</b> Showing suitable deference, by the speaker’s referring to herself in the third person."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.94","7 <b>Even the heir!:</b> Implying either that they don’t care that he <i>is</i> his father’s heir, or that they want to kill him for the property as well (Alter 1999). <b>my ember that remains:</b> In a memorable image, the last one left to carry on the family name. <b>survivor:</b> Or “remnant.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.95",11 <b>too much:</b> The Hebrew is difficult here. <b>blood redeemer:</b> A member of a family or clan whose duty it was to avenge the death of a kinsman. <b>a hair of your son:</b> Avshalom’s own abundant hair will ultimately prove his undoing.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.96","14 <b>he will plan plans:</b> JPS understands the phrase to mean that God will not punish David, the one who “plans plans.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.97","16 <b>God’s inheritance:</b> Unlike the “Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance” in I Sam. 26:19 and II Sam. 20:19 and 21:3, this expression appears to refer to the ancestral estate (Lewis), or “the hereditary-property” from God."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14.98",20 <b>my lord is wise:</b> Yet David’s ambiguous actions vis-à-vis Avshalom indicate that royal wisdom and control are in the process of unraveling.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.1","David Driven from the Throne: With Chap. 13, the narrative came full circle from the violence of Judges, as that book’s chaos in a sense reappeared in the family sphere of David’s house (Fishbane). Yet now it will expand again to the nation as a whole, with Avshalom’s revolt against his father."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.2","As frequently occurs in biblical narrative, this chapter is connected to the previous one by means of reprised words: “call,” “come,” “bow down,” and “kiss,” all in the first five verses (Bar-Efrat). More important, from the outset of the chapter it becomes clear that at this point Avshalom is seeking the throne itself. His strategy is the personal touch: he intercepts those people who come to Jerusalem for justice, assuring them of his personal concern, which he contrasts to David’s supposed disinterest. Thus he begins the process of “[stealing] away the heart of the men of Israel” (v.6). He does this cleverly, without vocally laying claim to the throne (see Ehrlich)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.3","A second stage in Avshalom’s plan is to go, on a pretext, to Hevron, the original stronghold of David’s political power. Here he is able to marshal his public relations machine by sending “spy-runners” throughout the land to proclaim his accession to the throne, by successfully recruiting David’s adviser Ahitofel, and by increasing the number of his followers."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.4","From here the chapter switches its focus to David. He is shown leading the flight from Jerusalem, and, rather pathetically, leaving ten of his concubines to symbolically guard the palace. Moreover, throughout this part of the story, David expresses an unusual tone of resignation. To his friend Ittai he describes his fate as “I am going wherever I am going” (v.20), and he has the precious Coffer returned to Jerusalem, not knowing whether he will ever see it and the city again."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.5","Yet amid all the weeping for the king’s fate (vv.23 and 30), David the crafty politician reemerges, plotting to win back his throne. He prays to Y<small>HWH</small> to bring Ahitofel’s advice to naught, and instructs Hushai how to frustrate the evil designs of Ahitofel and his master."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.6","22 Yoav flung himself on his face to the ground and bowed low, and he blessed the king;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.7",Yoav said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.8","Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.9",[given] that the king has acted upon your servant’s word!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.10","23 And Yoav arose and went to Geshur,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.11",and he brought Avshalom to Jerusalem.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.12",24 The king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.13","Let him turn round to his house,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.14",but my face he is not to see!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.15","So Avshalom turned to his house,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.16",but the king’s face he did not see.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.17","25 Now like Avshalom there was no man as beautiful throughout all Israel, so exceedingly to be praised;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.18","from the sole of his foot to his crown,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.19",there was no defect in him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.20",26 When he shaved his head
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.21","—it used to be that at the end of the year, [every] year,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.22","he would shave it, for it was heavy upon him and [he had] to shave it—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.23","he would weigh the hair of his head: two hundred <i>shekel</i>-weights, by the king’s [weighing-]stone."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.24","27 And there were born to Avshalom three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.25",she was a woman beautiful of appearance.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.26","28 And Avshalom stayed in Jerusalem for two-years’ time,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.27",but the king’s face he did not see.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.28","29 So Avshalom sent to Yoav, to send him to the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.29",but he would not come to him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.30","He sent again, a second-time,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.31",but he would not come.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.32",30 So he said to his servants:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.33","See, Yoav’s plot is near me, and he has barley there;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.34","go, kindle it with fire!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.35",And Avshalom’s servants kindled the plot with fire.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.36",31 And Yoav arose and came to Avshalom at the house;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.37",he said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.38",Why did your servants kindle the plot that belongs to me with fire?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.39",32 Avshalom said to Yoav:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.40","Here, I had sent [word] to you, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.41","Come here, I wish to send you to the king, to say:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.42",Why did I come back from Geshur?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.43",It would have been better for me [if] I were still there!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.44","So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.45","let me see the king’s face,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.46","and if there be any iniquity in me, let him put me to death!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.47","33 So Yoav came to the king and told him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.48",and he called for Avshalom;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.49","he came to the king and bowed low to him, on his nostrils to the earth, before the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.50",and the king kissed Avshalom.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.51","15:1 It was, [some time] after this,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.52","that Avshalom prepared himself a chariot and horses,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.53",with fifty men running before him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.54",2 And Avshalom would start-early;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.55","he would stand by the road of the main-gate,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.56","and it was that everyone who had a case-for-quarrel coming before the king, for judgment,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.57","Avshalom would call to him, and would say:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.58",From what town are you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.59",And he would say:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.60",From a certain one of the tribes of Israel is your servant.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.61",3 Then Avshalom would say to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.62","See, your words are good and correct,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.63",but you have no one to hear on the part of the king!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.64",4 And Avshalom said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.65","O who would make me judge in the land,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.66",[that] every man might come to me who had a case-for-quarrel or a matter-for-judgment
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.67",—I would declare him in the right!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.68","5 So it would be, when a man would come near, to bow low to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.69","that he would stretch out his hand and take hold of him, and kiss him."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.70",6 And Avshalom did according to this matter for all Israel who would come for adjudication to the king;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.71",thus Avshalom stole away the heart of the men of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.72","7 It was at the end of four years, that Avshalom said to the king:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.73","Now let me go, that I may pay my vow that I vowed to Y<small>HWH</small> in Hevron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.74","8 for your servant vowed a vow when I stayed at Geshur in Aram, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.75","If Y<small>HWH</small> will let me return, yes, return to Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.76",I will serve Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.77",9 The king said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.78",Go in peace.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.79",So he arose and went to Hevron.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.80","10 And Avshalom sent spy-runners throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.81","When you hear the sound of the <i>shofar</i>, you are to say:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.82",Avshalom reigns as king in Hevron!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.83","11 Now with Avshalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.84","invited-guests, going in their innocence—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.85",they did not know anything.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.86","12 And Avshalom sent for Ahitofel the Gilonite, David’s adviser, from his town, from Gilo,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.87",when he was sacrificing sacrifices.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.88","Now the banding-in-conspiracy was powerful,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.89",and the people with Avshalom went on [and on] becoming many.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.90","13 And a message-teller came to David, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.91",The heart of the men of Israel [inclines] after Avshalom!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.92",14 So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.93","Arise, let us get away,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.94",for we will have no remnant [left] before Avshalom!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.95","Hurry and go,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.96",lest he hurry and overtake us and push evil upon us
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.97",and strike the city with the mouth of the sword!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.98",15 The king’s servants said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.99","Just as my lord king chooses, here are your servants!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.100","16 So the king and all his household went off on foot,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.101",and the king left ten concubine women to guard the palace-house.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.102","17 And when the king and all the fighting-people went off on foot,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.103",they stopped at the Far House.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.104","18 Now all his servants were crossing over next to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.105","while all the Kereitites and all the Peleitites and all the Gittites,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.106","six hundred men who came on foot from Gat,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.107",were crossing over in front of the king.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.108",19 The king said to Ittai the Gittite:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.109","Why will you go, even you, with us?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.110","Return and stay with the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.111","for you are a foreigner, and also you are an exile from your [own] place."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.112","20 [Just] yesterday was your coming,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.113","so today, should I make you wander with us, in [our] going-forth?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.114",I am going wherever I am going;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.115","return, and have your brothers return with you,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.116",in loyalty and faithfulness!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.117","21 Ittai answered the king, he said:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.118","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> lives and by the life of my lord king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.119","only in the place where my lord king is, whether for death or for life—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.120","indeed, there your servant will be!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.121",22 David said to Ittai:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.122","Go, cross over!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.123",So Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the families who were with him crossed over.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.124","23 Now the entire region was weeping in a great voice while all the fighting-people were crossing over,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.125","while the king was crossing Wadi Kidron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.126","and while all the fighting-people were crossing over, facing the road to the wilderness."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.127",24 And here: also Tzadok and all the Levites with him were carrying the Coffer of the Covenant of God;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.128","they set down the Coffer of God, and Evyatar also went up,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.129",until all the people had completed crossing away from the city.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.130",25 The king said to Tzadok:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.131",Return the Coffer of God to the city;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.132","if I find favor in Y<small>HWH</small>’s eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.133","he will let me return and let me see it, along with his abode."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.134","26 If thus he says: I am not pleased with you,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.135",here I am—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.136",let him do with me as is good in his eyes.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.137",27 And the king said [further] to Tzadok the priest:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.138",Are you a seer?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.139","Return to the city in peace,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.140",along with Ahimaatz your son and Yehonatan son of Evyatar
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.141",—your two sons with you [both].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.142","28 See, I myself will tarry at the plains in the wilderness"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.143","until word comes from you, telling me [something]."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.144","29 So Tzadok and Evyatar returned the Coffer of God to Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15.145",and they stayed there.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.1","David in Exile; Avshalom and the Concubines: As David crosses a natural border, reaching the far side of the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem, he is met by two men whose behavior demonstrates the king’s vulnerability. The first, Mefiboshet’s servant Tziva, uses a lie—that his master is supporting the rebellion out of the hopes of regaining the throne for his family—to try to obtain wealth for himself. The second, another relative of Sha’ul, Shim’i son of Gera, both curses and throws stones at David, yet the king’s response is to accept the abuse, as if to suggest that he has reached a nadir of power and self-respect."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.2","At the same time, David’s plans for a return to power are bearing fruit, with the acceptance of his counselor Hushai by Avshalom toward the end of the chapter. This occurs amid Avshalom’s symbolic act of sleeping with his father’s concubines, always a sign of attempted or actual succession in biblical Israel (see Re’uven’s actions in Gen. 35:22 and Avner’s in II Sam. 3:7). But as Clines has noted, Avshalom’s move, given that it involves multiple women, may additionally be an exaggerated act of masculine bravado, beyond the merely symbolic political aspect."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.3","30 But David was going up the Ascent of Olives, going up and weeping;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.4","his head was covered and he was walking barefoot,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.5","while all the people who were with him covered each one his head,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.6","and were going up, going up and weeping."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.7","31 Now David was told, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.8",Ahitofel is among those banding together with Avshalom!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.9",David said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.10","Pray make-foolish Ahitofel’s advice, O Y<small>HWH</small>!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.11","32 Now it was, when David was coming to the summit, where [they] would bow down to God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.12","that here, [coming] to meet him was Hushai the Arkite, his tunic torn and earth on his head."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.13",33 David said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.14","If you cross over with me,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.15","you will be a burden to me,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.16",34 but if you return to the city
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.17","and say to Avshalom: Your servant O king, will I be—"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.29","when here: Tziva, Mefiboshet’s retainer, [was coming] to meet him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.30","along with a brace of saddled donkeys,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.34",Tziva said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.35","The donkeys are for the king’s household, for riding,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.36","the bread and the figs are for eating by the lads,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.37",and the wine is for drinking by those weary in the wilderness.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.38",3 The king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.39",And where is your lord’s son?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.40",Tziva said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.41","Here, he is sitting in Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.42",for he says [to himself]: Today the House of Israel will return my father’s kingdom to me!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.43",4 The king said to Tziva:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.44","Here, yours is all that was Mefiboshet’s."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.45",Tziva said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.46",I bow down!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.47","May I find favor in your eyes, O my lord king!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.48","5 Now when King David came to Bahurim,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.49","here, a man was going out from there, from the clan of the House of Sha’ul;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.50",his name was Shim’i son of Gera.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.51","He was going out, going out and cursing—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.52","6 and he pelted David with stones, and all of King David’s court-servants,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.53",along with all the fighting-people and all the mighty-men to his right and to his left.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.54",7 And thus did Shim’i say when he cursed him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.55","Get out, get out, [you] bloodguilty man, [you] base man!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.56","8 Y<small>HWH</small> has returned upon you all the bloodguilt of the House of Sha’ul, in whose place you reign as king,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.58","for here, you are in your evil-fate,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.59",for you are a bloodguilty man!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.60",9 Avishai son of Tzeruya said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.61",Why should this dead dog curse my lord king?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.62",Now let me cross over and take off his head!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.63",10 But the king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.64","What is there [in common] between me and you, O sons of Tzeruya?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.65","Let him curse, for if Y<small>HWH</small> says to him: Curse David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.66",who is to say: For-what-reason do you do thus?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.67",11 And David said to Avishai and to all his servants:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.68","Here, my [own] son, who came out of my body, is seeking my life;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.69","how much more, then, the Binyaminite!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.70","Let him be, that he may curse,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.71",for Y<small>HWH</small> told him to.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.72",12 Perhaps Y<small>HWH</small> will look on my affliction
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.73",and Y<small>HWH</small> will return me good in place of his curses on this day!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.74",13 David and his men went on the way;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.75","but Shim’i was going along the side of the hill, next to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.76",going along and cursing and pelting [him] with stones next to him
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.77",and dumping dust [on him].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16.78","14 And the king and all the people that were with him came back weary,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.1","Hushai’s Advice; the Worm Turns: Avshalom now seeks counsel as to the right move in the burgeoning rebellion. The first opinion he solicits is that of Ahitofel, of whose reputation for solid advice in the past we have just learned (16:23). The plan is a sound one: to isolate and kill David, thus avoiding mass bloodshed and providing for a quick restoration of the peace. Inexplicably, however, the usurper instead accepts the advice of Hushai, which is to be wary of the experienced and tough old king and to amass an army and attack the town where he is to be found. Only at the end of Hushai’s proposal do we learn that Avshalom’s acceptance of the old man’s advice is actually YHWH’s doing (v.14). In practical terms, it gives David time to solidify his own plans and marshal his forces (Sweeney 2007)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.2","David must be informed of the possibilities, and this is accomplished by means of two messengers, whose escape from Avshalom’s men in vv.18–21 is reminiscent of the story of Yehoshua’s spies slipping away in Josh. 2. The king subsequently decides to cross to the east bank of the Jordan to assure his safety."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.3","The upshot of this episode is that Ahitofel kills himself, a rather rare event for the Bible, at least in a nonmilitary setting, and David begins to prepare for the coming battle by feeding his troops."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.4","16 And it was, when Hushai the Arkite, David’s Friend, came to Avshalom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.5",that Hushai said to Avshalom:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.6",May the king live! May the king live!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.7",17 Avshalom said to Hushai:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.8",Is this your loyalty to your friend?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.9",Why didn’t you go with your friend?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.10",18 Hushai said to Avshalom:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.11",No—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.12","rather, the one whom Y<small>HWH</small> and his people, all the men of Israel, have chosen,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.13","for him I will be, and with him I will stay!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.14","19 And second, whom should I serve, if not in the presence of his son?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.15","As I served in the presence of your father,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.16",so I will serve in your presence.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.17",20 Avshalom said to Ahitofel:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.19",what should we do?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.20",21 Ahitofel said to Avshalom:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.21","Come in to your father’s concubines, whom he left to guard the palace-house;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.22","when all Israel hears that you have made yourself reek to your father,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.25","and Avshalom came in to his father’s concubines, before the eyes of all Israel."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.26",23 Now the advice of Ahitofel which he advised
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.27",was in those days like inquiring of the word of God;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.28","thus was all of Ahitofel’s advice, so for David, so for Avshalom."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.29",17:1 Ahitofel said to Avshalom:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.32",2 When I come upon him
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.33","and he is weary and slack of hands,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.34","I will alarm him,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.36","Then I will strike down the king alone,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.37","3 and I will return all the people to you,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.38",[so that] when all are returned
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.39",—the man whom you seek and all the fighting-people—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.40",there will be peace.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.41",4 The word was right in Avshalom’s eyes
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.42",and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.43",5 But Avshalom said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.44",Pray call as well Hushai the Arkite;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.45","we will hear what is in his mouth, his as well."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.46","6 And Hushai came to Avshalom, and Avshalom said to him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.47",In accordance with this word did Ahitofel speak;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.48",shall we act on his word?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.49",Or not? <i>You</i> speak!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.50",7 Hushai said to Avshalom:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.51",Not good is the advice that Ahitofel has advised this time.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.52",8 And Hushai said [further]:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.53","You yourself know your father and his men,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.54","that they are mighty ones,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.55","and that they are bitter of feelings,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.56","like a bear bereaved in the open-field,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.57",and your father is a man of battle—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.58",he will not spend-the-night with the people.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.59","9 Here now,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.60",he is hiding in one of the pits or in one of the halting-places;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.61",and it will be
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.62","when fighting-people fall at the start [of battle],"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.63",and a hearer hears and says:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.64",There has been a defeat for the people who [follow] after Avshalom—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.65","10 that even if he be a valiant one,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.66","whose heart is like the heart of a lion,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.67","he will melt, melt away [in fear]."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.68","For all Israel knows that your father is a mighty-man,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.69",and valiant ones are with him!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.70",11 So I advise:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.71","let all Israel be gathered, yes, gathered to you, from Dan to Be’er-Sheva,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.72","like the sand that is by the sea in abundance,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.73",with your presence walking among them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.74",12 We will come upon him
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.75","in one of the places where he can be found,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.76",and light upon him as dew falls upon the ground;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.77","there will not be left to him, or to all the men that are with him, even one."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.78","13 Now if he gathers himself into a town,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.79",then let all Israel bring ropes into that town
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.80","and let us drag it, as far as the wadi, until even a pebble cannot be found there!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.81",14 Avshalom and all Israel said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.82",Better is the advice of Hushai the Arkite than the advice of Ahitofel!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.83","—Now Y<small>HWH</small> had ordained to nullify the good advice of Ahitofel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.84",in order that Y<small>HWH</small> might bring an evil-fate upon Avshalom.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.85","15 And Hushai said to Tzadok and to Evyatar, the priests:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.86","Like this and like that, Ahitofel advised Avshalom and the elders of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.87","and like this and like that, I myself advised."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.88","16 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.89","send quickly and tell David, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.90","Do not lodge tonight at the wilderness crossings,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.91","by-all-means cross over, yes, cross over,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.92","lest they be swallowed up, the king and all the people who are with him!"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.102","11 <b>among them:</b> So ancient versions; MT reads “in battle,” i.e., leading the troops."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17.103",12 <b>light … as dew:</b> This is usually an image of peace; here it smells of death (Alter 1999).
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.1","Avshalom’s Death: As the rebellion narrative moves toward its inevitable conclusion, David will not be present at the climactic moment, just as he was not present at the moment of Sha’ul’s death. His exclusion from the battle by his own soldiers, while couched in concern for his welfare, also suggests that he is no longer perceived as an effective military leader. It has the added effect of setting up the dramatic scene in which David learns the news about his son’s death, which in fact comprises the bulk of this chapter."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.2","The battle scene itself, as usual, is brief, with the striking note that the forest swallowed up the rebels (v.8). More significant is the mode of Avshalom’s death, with its unforgettable image of the prince accidentally hanging from a tree. The two great theme words of the whole cycle, “head” and “heart,” come into play once again: he who had sought to become head of Israel, during his royal father’s lifetime, winds up hanging from his head, totally vulnerable to attack; and from having initially swayed the hearts of the people, he is struck “in the heart” as he hangs “in the heart” of a tree. Once again it is a son of Tzeruya, Yoav, who acts decisively and violently, to resecure the throne for David."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.3","V.18 stands alone, perhaps as a postscript to Avshalom’s death, to at least provide a tangible memory of the charismatic prince. The monument mentioned here, known to the writer or final editor of Samuel, should not be confused with the “Absalom’s Tomb” that still stands in Jerusalem, in the valley east of the Old City. That structure dates from the much later Hellenistic period (second to first century <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>.)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.4","For the narrator, the portrayal of how the bad news is brought to David is almost of equal weight to the relating of Avshalom’s actual death. In the Bible we have previously encountered a number of imagined and real battle messenger scenes, most notably with Sisera’s mother (Judg. 5) and Eli (I Sam. 4). Here, however, the drama is even more extreme. The king has repeatedly ordered his commanders and soldiers not to harm Avshalom, but we know that “the lad” is already dead. After some jockeying for the privilege of delivering the news—Ahimaatz, the usual messenger, is rejected by Yoav—the narrative speaks through the king’s perspective. Three pieces of information are passed by the watchman to David, who sits anxiously awaiting news of his son: the existence of one runner, then two, and then the identification of Ahimaatz. We know, but the king initially does not, that this time Ahimaatz will pass, and the fateful message will be delivered by the unnamed Cushite (foreigners have previously delivered bad news to David in I Sam. 30:1ff. and II Sam. 1:2ff.). Note that David’s only concern is for his son, not for his troops or the disposition of the rebellion. The actual news is delivered elliptically; unlike the earlier “also your servant Uriyya the Hittite is dead” (II 11:24), the messenger sees fit to say what he needs to by a circumlocution, although an obvious one: “May they be like that lad, my lord king’s enemies …” (v.32)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.5","17 Now Yehonatan and Ahimaatz were staying at En-Rogel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.6","and a handmaid would go and tell them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.7","and they would go and tell King David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.8",for they could not be seen coming to the town.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.9","18 But a serving-lad saw them and told Avshalom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.10",so the two of them went quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.11","he had a well in his courtyard,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.12",and they went down there.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.13","19 And the woman fetched and spread a screen over the mouth of the well,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.14","and she scattered some groats over it,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.15",so that nothing was noticeable.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.16","20 So when Avshalom’s servants came to the woman in the house,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.17",and they said: Where are Ahimaatz and Yehonatan?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.18",the woman said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.19",They have [already] crossed the pond of water.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.20","They sought but did not find [them],"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.21",so they returned to Jerusalem.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.22","21 Now it was, after their going away,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.23","that they came up out of the well, and went and told King David;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.24",they said to David:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.25","Arise and quickly cross the water,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.26",for thus-and-so has Ahitofel advised concerning you.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.27","22 So David arose, and all the people who were with him;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.28","they crossed the Jordan, till the light of daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.29",until there was no one left behind who had not crossed the Jordan.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.30","23 Now when Ahitofel saw that his advice had not been acted upon,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.31","he saddled a donkey, and arose and went to his house, to his town;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.32","and he gave charge regarding his household, and then he strangled himself, so that he died."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.33",He was buried in the burial-place of his father.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.34","24 When David had come to Mahanayim, Avshalom crossed the"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.35","Jordan, he and all the fighting-men of Israel with him."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.36","25 As for Amasa, Avshalom put him in place of Yoav, [The One] Over the Armed-Forces"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.37","—Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Yitra the Yizre’elite,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.38","who had come in to Avigayil daughter of Nahash, sister of Tzeruya, Yoav’s mother."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.39",26 Now Israel and Avshalom encamped in the region of Gil’ad.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.40","27 And it was, when David came to Mahanayim,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.41",that Shovi son of Nahash from Rabba of the Children of Ammon
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.42",and Makhir son of Ammiel from Lo-Devar and Barzillai the Gil’adite from Rogelim
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.43","28 brought forward couches and basins and potter’s vessels,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.44","and wheat and barley and meal and parched-grain,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.45","and beans and lentils,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.46",29 and honey and curds and sheep and cheese from cattle for David
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.47","and for the people that were with him, to eat,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.48",for they had said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.49",The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.50",18:1 And David counted [for battle] the fighting-people who were with him;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.51",he put over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.52",2 And David sent out the fighting-people:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.53","a third in the hand of Yoav,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.54","a third in the hand of Avishai son of Tzeruya, Yoav’s brother,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.55",and a third in the hand of Ittai the Gittite.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.56",The king said to the fighting-people:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.57","I will go out, yes, go out, even I myself, with you!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.58",3 But the people said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.59","You are not to go out,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.60","for if we have to flee, yes, flee,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.61","they will not take us to heart,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.62","and [even] if half of us die,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.63",they will not take us to heart;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.64",but <i>you</i> are like us ten thousandfold!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.65","So-now, it is better if you are [there] for us in the town, to provide-help."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.66",4 The king said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.67","Whatever is good in your eyes, I will do."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.68","So the king stood by the gate,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.69",while all the fighting-people went out by the hundreds and by the thousands.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.70","5 And the king charged Yoav and Avishai and Ittai, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.71","Go-gently for me on the lad, on Avshalom!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.72",And all the people heard the charge of the king to all the commanders on the matter of Avshalom.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.73",6 The fighting-people went out into the open-country to meet Israel;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.74",the battle occurred in the forest of Efrayim.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.75","7 And the fighting-people of Israel were defeated there, before David’s servants;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.76",there occurred there a great defeat on that day—twenty thousand [dead].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.77",8 And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the ground;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.78",more did the forest devour among the fighting-people than the sword devoured on that day.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.79",9 And Avshalom chanced upon David’s servants:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.80","Avshalom was riding on a mule,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.81","and the mule came under the thick-boughs of a great oak,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.82","and his head became held fast in the oak,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.83","so that he was left hanging between heaven and earth,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.84",while the mule that was under him crossed on.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.85",10 A man saw it and told Yoav;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.86",he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.87","Here, I saw Avshalom hanging from an oak!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.88","11 Yoav said to the man, the one telling him:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.89","Now here, you saw [him]—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.90",so for-what-reason didn’t you strike him down there to the ground?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.91",I would have to have given you ten pieces-of-silver and a belt!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.92",12 The man said to Yoav:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.93","Even if I were feeling-the-weight in my palms of a thousand pieces-of-silver,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.94","I would not stretch out my hand against the king’s son,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.95","for it was in our ears that the king charged you and Avishai and Ittai, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.96","Guard the lad, Avshalom, for me!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.97","13 Else I would have been dealing falsely with my own life,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.98",for nothing is hidden from the king—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.99","yet you, you were standing aloof!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.100",14 Yoav said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.101",I will not wait around like this before you!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.102",So he took three rods in his palm
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.103",and thrust them into Avshalom’s heart
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.104",—he was still alive in the heart of the oak.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.105","15 And ten fighting-lads, Yoav’s weapons bearers, surrounded him;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.106",they struck Avshalom and put him to death.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.107","16 Then Yoav sounded a thrusting-blast on the <i>shofar</i>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.108","so that the fighting-people turned back from pursuing after Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.109",for Yoav held back the people.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.110",17 They took Avshalom
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.111","and threw him in the forest, into a great pit,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.112","and set up over him a heap of stones, exceedingly large,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.113","while all Israel fled, each to his tent."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.114","18 Now Avshalom had undertaken to set up for himself, during"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.115","his lifetime, the standing-stone that is in the King’s Valley,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.116",for he had said [to himself]: I have no son through whom to have my name recalled.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.117",So he called the standing-stone by his name—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.118",it is called Avshalom’s Monument until this day.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.119",19 Now Ahimaatz son of Tzadok said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.120",Pray let me run and bring-the-news to the king
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.121",that Y<small>HWH</small> has wrought justice for him from the hand of his enemies!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.122",20 Yoav said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.123",You are not to be a man of news on this day;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.124","you may bring-news on another day,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.125","but on this day, you are not to bring-news,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.126",since the king’s son is dead.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.127",21 Yoav said to a Cushite:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.128","Go, tell the king what you have seen."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.129",The Cushite bowed low to Yoav and ran off.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.130",22 But once again Ahimaatz son of Tzadok said to Yoav:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.131","Come what may, pray let me run, me too, after the Cushite."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.132",Yoav said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.133","Why should you run, my son,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18.134",when you have no news [that] will find [you favor]?

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.1","David Shaken and Restored to Power: Few scenes of grief in literature are as affecting as the one with which this chapter opens. The king’s emotions are conveyed largely through the use of sound (see note to v.1); the multiple repetitions of “my son” ring true, since grieving is by nature an obsessive process. While the reader’s sympathy is with the king, Yoav brings us back to brutal reality by emphasizing that this is no time for David to appear weak. With stinging words he reprimands the king for putting his own emotions above those of political necessity; in Yoav’s view, by excessively mourning his (unworthy) son, David is compromising his leadership and indeed ignoring his subjects’ own needs."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.2","After finally composing himself, David attempts to repair the fractures in his kingdom. In order to placate the northerners, he appoints Avshalom’s erstwhile commander Amasa to replace Yoav. There may well be other motives at play here, given the troubled history between king and general; David must be aware that Yoav had dealt the initial blows to Avshalom as he hung from the tree. He assures Shim’i ben Gera, who had cursed him as a “bloodguilty man” in Chap. 16, that he will not be executed. Sha’ul’s grandson Mefiboshet appears, unkempt, and excuses his absence during the rebellion by pointing to his servant Tziva’s deception (see 16:1–4); subsequently, David reverses his earlier decision and restores to Mefiboshet at least some of his property. And a last piece of resolution takes place when Barzillai, the king’s faithful friend who had supported him materially during his flight, elects to remain at home rather than come to Jerusalem, citing his advanced age. His fatigue perhaps reflects the king’s own."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.3","Yet the chapter still ends with conflict, at least of a verbal kind. The northerners are miffed at not being the ones to conduct David back across the Jordan. As the majority of Israel’s population, they feel entitled, but in the end, the Judahites’ “rougher” words prevail."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.4","23 … Come what may, I want to run!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.5",So he said to him: Run!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.6","And Ahimaatz ran by way of the Oval, and passed the Cushite."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.7","24 Now David was sitting between the two gateways,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.8",and the watchman on the roof of the gate went over to the [city] wall;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.9","he lifted up his eyes and saw: here, a man was running alone."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.10","25 The watchman called out and told the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.11",and the king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.12","If he is alone, [there is] news in his mouth."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.13","And he went, going along and coming nearer,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.14",26 but the watchman saw another man running;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.15",the watchman called out to the gatekeeper
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.16",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.17","Here, [another] man is running alone!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.18",The king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.19",This one too is bringing-news.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.20",27 The watchman said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.21",I see [that] the running of the first-one is like the running of Ahimaatz son of Tzadok.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.22",The king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.23","He is a good man, and with good news he comes!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.24",28 Ahimaatz called out and said to the king: Peace!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.25","And he bowed low to the king, his nostrils to the ground,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.26",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.27","Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small> your God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.28",who has turned over the men who lifted their hand against my lord king!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.29",29 The king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.30","Is there peace with the lad, with Avshalom?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.31",Ahimaatz said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.32","I saw a great commotion when Yoav sent off the king’s servant and your servant,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.33",but I do not know what [it was].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.34",30 The king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.35","Turn around, station yourself here."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.36",He turned around and stopped.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.37","31 And here, the Cushite came,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.38",and the Cushite said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.39",Let my lord king receive-the-news
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.40",that Y<small>HWH</small> has wrought justice for you today from the hand of all those rising against you!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.41",32 The king said to the Cushite:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.42","Is there peace with the lad, with Avshalom?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.43",The Cushite said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.44","May they be like that lad, my lord king’s enemies and all those who have risen against you for evil!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.45",19:1 The king was shaken;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.46","he went up to the upper-part of the gate and wept,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.47",and thus he said as he went:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.48","My son Avshalom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.49","my son, my son Avshalom!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.50","Who will grant my dying, myself, in your place?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.51","Avshalom, my son, my son!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.52",2 And it was told to Yoav:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.53","Here, the king is weeping and mourning over Avshalom."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.54","3 Now the victory became mourning on that day for all the people,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.55","for the people heard on that day, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.56",The king is in pain over his son.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.57","4 So the people stole away on that day, while coming into the city"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.58",as humiliated fighting-people steal away when they flee in battle.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.59","5 Now the king wrapped his face,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.60",and the king cried out in a loud voice:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.61","My son Avshalom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.62","Avshalom, my son, my son!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.63","6 Yoav came to the king in the palace-house,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.64",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.65",Today you have shamed the face of all your servants
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.66",who helped you escape with your life today
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.67","and the life of your sons and your daughters, and the life of your wives, and the life of your concubines—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.68","7 by loving those-who-hate-you, and by hating those-who-love-you!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.69",For you have declared today that you have no commanders or servants;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.70","for today I know that if Avshalom were alive, and all of us today were dead,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.71","indeed, then it would be right in your eyes!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.72","8 So-now, get up, go out"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.73","and speak to the heart of your servants,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.74","for by Y<small>HWH</small> I swear, that [if] you do not go out,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.75","no man will lodge with you tonight,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.76",and this will be more evil for you
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.77",than all the evils that have come upon you from your youth until now!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.78","9 So the king got up and sat at the gate,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.79","while to all the people they declared, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.80","Here, the king is sitting at the gate!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.81",And all the people came before the king.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.82","Now Israel had fled, each one to his tent;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.83","10 and it was that all the people were in strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.84","The king rescued us from the hand of our enemies,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.85",and he himself helped us escape from the hand of the Philistines;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.86","but now he had to run away from the land, from Avshalom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.87","11 while Avshalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.88","So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.89",why are you keeping silent about having the king return?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.90","12 Now King David sent to Tzadok and Evyatar the priests, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.91","Speak to the elders of Judah, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.92",Why should you be the last to return the king to his house?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.93","—For the words of all Israel had come to the king, to his house.—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.94","13 You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.95",so why should you be the last to return the king?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.96","14 And to Amasa, say:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.97",Are you not my bone and my flesh?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.98","Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.99","if you do not become commander of the armed-forces before me all the days [to come], in place of Yoav."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.100","15 Thus he inclined the heart of all the men of Judah, as one man;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.101",they sent [word] to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.102","Return, you and all your servants!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.103","16 So the king returned and came to the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.104","while Judah came to Gilgal to go and meet the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.105",to conduct the king across the Jordan.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.106","17 And Shim’i son of Gera, the Binyaminite who was from Bahurim, hurried out;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.107","he went down with the men of Judah to meet King David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.108","18 and a thousand men were with him from Binyamin,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.109","along with Tziva, the retainer from the House of Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.110",and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.111","they advanced to the Jordan ahead of the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.112","19 while the river-crossing was being crossed, in order to conduct the king’s household across,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.113",to do what was good in his eyes.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.114","Now Shim’i son of Gera flung himself down before the king, as he was crossing the Jordan;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.115",20 he said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.116","Do not impute iniquity to me, my lord,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.117","do not call-to-mind what your servant iniquitously-did on the day that my lord king went out from Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.118",that the king should take it to heart!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.119","21 For your servant knows that I myself sinned,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.120","but here: I have come today, as the first of the entire House of Yosef,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.121",going down to meet my lord king!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.122",22 Avishai son of Tzeruya spoke up and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.123","For that, should not Shim’i be put to death?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.124","Indeed, he cursed Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.125",23 David said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.126","What is there between me and you, O sons of Tzeruya,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.127",that you have become an adversary to me?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.128",Today should a man be put to death in Israel?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.129","Indeed, do I not know that today I am king over Israel?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.130",24 The king said to Shim’i:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.131",You will not die!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.132",And the king swore-an-oath to him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.133",25 Now Mefiboshet [grand]son of Sha’ul went down to meet the king
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.134","—he had not done his toenails, he had not done his mustache,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.135","and his garments he had not scrubbed,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.136",from the day of the king’s going away until the day that he came back in peace—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.137","26 and it was, when he came from Jerusalem to meet the king"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.138",that the king said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.139","Why did you not go with me, Mefiboshet?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.140",27 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.141","My lord king, my servant deceived me;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.142",for your servant said [to himself]:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.143","I will have my donkey saddled and ride it, and I will go to the king—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.144",though your servant is lame.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.145",28 But he slandered your servant to my lord king;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.146",yet my lord king is like a messenger of God—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.147",so do as is good in your eyes.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.148",29 For all my father’s household were nothing but men [deserving] death from my lord king;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.149",yet you have set your servant among those eating at your table!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.150",So what right do I still have to cry out to the king?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.151",30 The king said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.152",Why are you still speaking your words?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.153",I have decided:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.154",you and Tziva are to divide the fielded-property.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.157","24 <b>between the two gateways:</b> Fokkelman (1981) takes this as a symbol of David’s ambivalence regarding Avshalom. It also recalls, as many have noted, one of the early scenes in Samuel, Eli awaiting news of the Coffer (I 4:13ff.)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.158","29 <b>Is there peace …?:</b> Or “Is he well? Is it well with him?,” but, as the reader recalls, “peace” is part of the young man’s name. <b>when Yoav sent off the king’s servant …:</b> The Hebrew appears garbled here; it could be “to send off the king’s servant Yoav and your servant.” Alter (1999) suggests that it reflects emotional confusion in the messenger."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19.159","19:1 <b>My son Avshalom, / my son, my son, Avshalom!:</b> The sound of the phrase is more memorable in Hebrew than in the usual English: Hebrew uses long vowels (<i>benEE avshaLOM / benEE benEE avshaLOM</i>), with last syllables accented, to echo the grief. <b>Who will grant my dying:</b> I.e., “if only I had died.”"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.1","Second Rebellion: Avshalom’s revolt has once again exposed the historic rift between north and south, a divide which does not end with his death. A Binyaminite named Sheva starts another rebellion; when David asks his new commander Amasa to call the Judahites together to respond, he acts slowly, which is enough to convince his predecessor Yoav that he is betraying the king. Yoav’s brutal murder of Amasa dominates this chapter: the picture of the general wallowing in his blood by the side of the road is the first of two graphic images here strongly making the point that rebellion against David will not be countenanced, at least not by Yoav. The second example made of a rebel begins in v.14, and finds Sheva taking refuge up north in the town of Avel of Bet-Maakha. As Avshalom’s return to Jerusalem, and hence the seeds of the revolt, had begun with a story about a “wise woman” (Chap. 14), so the cycle of rebellion ends with one. Here the woman is able to fend off Yoav’s destructive urges and save her town by killing the rebel. What originated as an assault on the head of Israel draws to a close with the sight of a head flying off the ramparts of an Israelite town."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.2","As the chapter ends, there is a second list of David’s officials (the first had capped Chap. 8). This time, in addition to a new Herald, we have a brand-new office: “[The One] Over the Labor-Gangs.” With the introduction of large-scale planning, Israel is moving from a fledgling state to something closer to the real thing, with institutions of centralized control. And with this “bureaucratic bookend” (Hamilton), we come to the end of the central account of David’s tenure as king."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.3",31 Mefiboshet said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.4","Let him just take all of it,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.5",seeing that my lord has come back in peace to his house!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.6",32 Now Barzillai the Gil’adite had come down from Rogelim
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.7","and had crossed the Jordan with the king, to send him off at the Jordan."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.8","33 And Barzillai was exceedingly old, at eighty years;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.9","he had provided for the king when he had stayed at Mahanayim,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.10",for he was a man of exceedingly great-wealth.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.11",34 The king said to Barzillai:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.12","You, cross over with me, and I will provide for you beside me in Jerusalem."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.13",35 But Barzillai said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.14","How many [more] are the days and years of my life,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.15",that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.16",36 I am eighty years old today;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.17",do I know between good and evil?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.18",Or does your servant taste what I eat or what I drink?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.19",Or do I still hearken to the voice of male-singers or female-singers?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.20",So why should your servant still be a burden to my lord king?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.21","37 Scarcely could your servant cross the Jordan with the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.22",so why does the king reward me with this reward?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.23","38 Now let your servant return, that I may die in my town,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.24",beside the burial-place of my father and my mother.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.26","let him cross over with my lord king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.27",and then do for him that which is good in your eyes.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.28",39 The king said:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.30",and I myself will do for him what is good in your eyes;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.31","whatever you choose for me, I will do for you!"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.37","Now all the fighting-people of Judah had conducted the king across,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.38",and also half the fighting-people of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.39","42 And here, all the men of Israel were coming to the king;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.40",they said to the king:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.42","and conducted the king and his household across the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.43",and all of David’s men with him?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.44",43 All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.45",Because the king is closely-related to me!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.46",Why are you so agitated about this matter?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.47","Have we eaten, yes, eaten any of the king[’s food]?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.48","Or has any been carried, yes, carried off to us?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.49","44 The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, they said:"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.51","yes, in David, I more than you;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.52",so why do you insult me?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.53","Was not my word, mine, the first for having my king return?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.54",But the words of Judah’s men were rougher than the words of Israel’s men.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.55","20:1 Now there chanced to be a base man there—his name was Sheva son of Bikhri, a Binyaminite man;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.56",he gave-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i> and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.57","We have no portion in David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.58",nor inheritance for us in the son of Yishai;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.59","everyone to his tents, O Israel!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.60","2 So all the men of Israel went up from [following] after David, [to following] after Sheva son of Bikhri,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.61","while the men of Judah clung to their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.62",3 And David came to his palace-house in Jerusalem.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.63",The king took the ten concubine women whom he had left to guard the house
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.64","and put them in a house under guard and provided for them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.65","but he did not come in to them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.66",for they were tied off until the day of their death in living widowhood.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.67",4 Then the king said to Amasa:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.68","Summon to me the men of Judah, in three days,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.69",then you—stop here.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.70","5 Amasa went to summon Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.71",but he delayed from the appointed-time that he had appointed.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.72",6 And David said to Avishai:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.73","Now,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.74",Sheva son of Bikhri will be more evil for us than Avshalom!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.75","So you, take your lord’s servants and pursue after him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.76","lest he find himself fortified towns, and cast-shadows over our eye!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.77","7 So Yoav’s men went out after him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.78",with the Kereitites and the Peleitites and all the mighty-men;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.79",they went out of Jerusalem to pursue after Sheva son of Bikhri.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.80","8 When they were beside the great rock that is in Giv’on,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.81",Amasa came up in front of them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.82","Now Yoav was girded in his garb, his [military] dress,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.83","and on him was a girded sword bound on his loins, in its sheath;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.84","when he went out, it fell down."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.85",9 And Yoav said to Amasa:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.86","Are you in peace, my brother?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.87","And Yoav’s right hand took hold of Amasa’s beard, to kiss him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.88","10 but Amasa did not guard himself from the sword that was in Yoav’s [other] hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.89","and he struck him with it in the abdomen, so that his innards poured out on the ground;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.90",—he did not [have to] do it to him a second-time—and so he died.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.91","Now Yoav and Avishai his brother pursued after Sheva son of Bikhri,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.92",11 while a man was standing by him from the serving-lads of Yoav;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.93",he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.94","Whoever desires Yoav, and whoever is for David—[follow] after Yoav!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.95",12 Now Amasa was rolling in blood in the middle of the road;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.96","and the man saw that all the people were stopping,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.97","so he turned Amasa over from the road into the open-field, and threw a garment over him"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.98","—when anyone who came by saw him, he would stop."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.99","13 When he had pushed him out of the road,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.100",all the men who were [following] after Yoav crossed over to pursue after Sheva son of Bikhri.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.101","14 They crossed throughout all the tribes of Israel to Avel of Bet-Maakha, to all the Bikhrites,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.102",and assembled and came just after him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.103","15 They came and besieged him, in Avel of Bet-Maakha:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.104","they cast up a mound against the town, and stopped at the rampart,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.105","while all the fighting-people who were with Yoav were bringing-ruin, to cause the wall to fall."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.106",16 But a wise woman called out from the town:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.107",Hearken! Hearken!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.108",Now say to Yoav:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.109",Come near to here—I would speak with you!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.110",17 He came near to her.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.111",The woman said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.112",Are you Yoav?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.113",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.114",I am.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.115",She said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.116",Hearken to the words of your maidservant.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.117",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.118",I am hearkening.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.119","18 She said, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.120","They used to speak, yes, speak formerly, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.121","When they inquired, yes, inquired in Avel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.122",thus they ended [the matter]!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.123","19 <i>I</i> [am of] those most at peace, most trustworthy in Israel;"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.125",Why would you swallow up Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.126",20 Yoav answered and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.127","[Heaven] forbid, forbid for me, if I cause it to be swallowed up, if I bring-ruin!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.128","21 Not so is the matter,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.129","but a man from the highlands of Efrayim, Sheva son of Bikhri his name,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.130","has lifted his hand against the king, against David."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.131","Give up him alone, and I will go from the town!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.132",The woman said to Yoav:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.133","Here, his head will be thrown to you by way of the wall."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.134","22 And the woman came to all the people with her wisdom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.135",and they cut off the head of Sheva son of Bikhri and threw it to Yoav;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.136","then he sounded-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.137","and they scattered from the town, each one to his tents,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.138","while Yoav returned to Jerusalem, to the king."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.139","23 Now Yoav was [The One] Over All the Armed-Forces of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.140","while Benaya son of Yehoyada was [The One] Over the Kereitites and Over the Peleitites,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20.141","24 and Adoram was [The One] Over the Labor-Gangs,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.1","Revenge on the House of Sha’ul; Battles with the Philistines: After all the bloodshed that has occurred in Samuel, one piece of unfinished business remains. The text chooses this point to recount a symbolic execution—that of seven sons of Sha’ul—and uses the men of Giv’on (Gibeon) as the means to that end. In a story that does not appear elsewhere in the Bible, we are informed that Sha’ul, in contravention of the treaty with the Giv’onites that had been concluded in Josh. 9:15, had sought to destroy them. Now they demand a kind of blood vengeance, which David permits in order to stay the famine that is ravaging the land. One must again wonder at bloody deeds which benefit David but in which he does not wield the sword, and at the fact that he uses an oracle to shift the responsibility."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.2","In an opposite vein, a final demonstration of David’s magnanimity concerns the bodies of the executed men. The action of Sha’ul’s concubine Ritzpa, who protects the corpses of both her own two sons and those of Sha’ul’s daughter Merav, is a deed of compassion and heroism, stretching as it does from spring to fall in the heart of the hot, dry season, and is met by David’s realization that all of Sha’ul’s family should be interred together in the family plot. This provides a closure which had been lacking since Sha’ul’s death, since he and the sons who had fallen in battle with him had remained buried under a tree in Yavesh-Gil’ad since I Sam. 31. But in truth, the burial is the final nail in the Saulide coffin."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.3","The chapter concludes with four brief accounts of battle with the Philistines which appear to look back chronologically. In the first, David is actually taken captive, only to be rescued by Yoav’s brother Avishai. This episode is followed by Israelite victories over various foes—huge warriors with sometimes unusual physical characteristics (see v.20). Golyat is mentioned again; in this version he is slain not by the youthful David but by a certain Elhanan (see the Comments to I Sam. 17, above)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.4","21:1 Now there was a famine in David’s days, for three years, year after year,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.5",and David besought the face of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.6",Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.7","Because of Sha’ul and because of the House of Bloodguilt,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.8",because he caused the death of the Giv’onites … !
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.9",2 So the king called for the Giv’onites and said to them
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.10","—now the Giv’onites were not from the Children of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.11","but rather from the remnant of the Amorites,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.12",yet the Children of Israel had sworn [an oath] to them;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.13","but Sha’ul had sought to strike them down, in his zeal for the Children of Israel and Judah—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.14",3 David said to the Giv’onites:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.15",What shall I do for you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.16","In what [way] may I effect-atonement,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.17",so that they may bless Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.18",4 The Giv’onites said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.19","We have no [wish for] silver or gold with Sha’ul or with his house,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.20",and we have no [wish to] put any man to death in Israel!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.21",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.22","Whatever you say, I will do for you."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.23",5 They said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.24","The man who [wanted to] destroy us,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.25",who intended for us [that] we should be wiped out from remaining in all the territory of Israel:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.26","6 let there be given to us seven men of his descendants,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.27","and we will impale them to Y<small>HWH</small> at Giv’a of Sha’ul, the chosen one of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.28",The king said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.29",I myself will give [them over].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.30","7 But the king spared Mefiboshet son of Yehonatan son of Sha’ul,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.31","because of the sworn-oath of Y<small>HWH</small> that was between them, between David and Yehonatan son of Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.32","8 So the king took the two sons of Ritzpa daughter of Aya, whom she had borne to Sha’ul, Armoni and Mefiboshet,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.33","and the five sons of Merav daughter of Sha’ul, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholatite,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.34",9 and gave them into the hand of the Giv’onites;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.35","they impaled them on the hill, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.36",and the seven of them fell together.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.37","—Now they were put to death at the time of the harvest, the first"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.38","days, at the start of the barley harvest.—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.39",10 And Ritzpa daughter of Aya took sackcloth
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.40",and spread it out for herself on a rock
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.41",from the start of the harvest until water poured out on them from the heavens;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.42",she did not allow the birds of the heavens to alight on them by day
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.43",or the wildlife of the open-field by night.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.44","11 And David was told what Ritzpa daughter of Aya, Sha’ul’s concubine, had done,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.45",12 so David went
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.46","and took the bones of Sha’ul and the bones of Yehonatan his son from the inhabitants of Yavesh-Gil’ad,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.47","who had stealthily-taken them from the square of Bet-Shan,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.48",where the Philistines had hung them up at the time that the Philistines struck down Sha’ul at Gilboa;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.49","13 he brought up from there the bones of Sha’ul and the bones of Yehonatan his son,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.50",and they gathered the bones of the impaled ones.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.51",14 Then they buried the bones of Sha’ul and of Yehonatan his son
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.52","in the land of Binyamin, in the side-chamber of the burial-place of Kish his father."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.53","And when they had done all that the king had commanded them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.54",God let-himself-be-entreated for the land after that.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.55",15 Now there were battles again by the Philistines with Israel;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.56","David went down, his servants with him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.57",and they did battle with the Philistines.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.58","But David was weary,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.59","16 and he was taken captive by Benov, who was of the descendants of the Shades"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.60","—the weight of his lance was three hundred <i>shekel</i>-weights of bronze,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.61",while he was girded in new [armor]—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.62","he intended to strike David down,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.63",17 but Avishai son of Tzeruya came to his help:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.64",he struck down the Philistine and put him to death.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.65","Then David’s men swore [an oath] to him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.66",You must not go out with us again into battle;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.67",you must not extinguish the lamp of Israel!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.68",18 It was [some time] after this
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.69","that there was battle again, in Gov, with the Philistines."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.70","And Sibbekhai the Hushatite struck down Saf, who was of the descendants of the Shades."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.71","19 And there was battle again in Gov, with the Philistines,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.72",and Elhanan son of Yaarei-Oregim the Bet-Lehemite struck down Golyat the Gittite
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.73",—now the shaft of his spear was like a weavers’ beam.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.74",20 And there was battle again in Gat:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.75",and there was an immense man—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21.76","the fingers of his hands and the toes of his feet were six and six [apiece], twenty-four in number,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 22.1","David’s Song of Deliverance: The placement of poetry toward the end of a long section or book occurs a number of times in the Bible (see, for instance, Gen. 49 and Exod. 15). This chapter also serves as a bracket for the entire book, as noted in the Comments to II 1, above. In fact, it echoes both vocabulary and themes from the earlier Song of Hanna (Fokkelman 1999), down to the detail that both conclude with mention of “his anointed one” (v.51 and 2:10) (Fishbane)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 22.2","Additionally, this “song” is a virtual compendium of Israelite poetic ideas. The writer takes the time to build up the impressive manifestation of God in a manner that would have been familiar to many groups in the region; David’s God thunders in much the same manner as the Canaanite/Phoenician Baal. The divine appearance is in response to a beleaguered and despairing protagonist, who is so often the focus of biblical poetry from Jeremiah, Psalms, Lamentations, and Job, to cite just a few outstanding examples. Whether David was the writer or not, the poem’s imagery seems to fit him and his struggles nicely: from a state of being surrounded by enemies, he is able to triumph, especially militarily; he keeps faith with God in wholeness of heart (conveniently, the Bat-Sheva incident is ignored); and he is assured of God’s perpetual favor in the end."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 22.3","Fishbane rightly stresses the “rock” imagery used here for God, and notes that, while it is used frequently in the Psalms, its appearance in this chapter focuses on hope rather than on a desperate plea for rescue."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 23.1","David’s “Last Words”; His Warriors: A much briefer poem opens this chapter (vv.1–7). Strikingly, its initial words recall the prophet Bil’am’s inspired vision of a peaceful, secure Israel in Num. 22–24. The poem touts the theme of God’s reassurance, presenting mainly the natural imagery of light and growth for David himself, and concluding with a fiery portrayal of his enemies’ demise. The latter is a frequent theme in the book of Psalms."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 23.2","The rest of the chapter concentrates on the names and exploits of David’s choice warriors, returning as it were to the end of Chap. 21. Some of the passages are difficult to interpret, but the intent is apparently to celebrate David as warrior king. The whole section would logically fit much earlier in the book, but it has probably been placed here because these final chapters of Samuel function to collect various traditions about David which are best served in isolation from the main narrative flow. They also have the effect of recovering some of David’s earlier heroic stature: he is a selfless military leader who refuses to profit from his soldiers’ fanatical loyalty (vv.13–17), and he heads a formidable group of warriors (vv.18–38) who are, significantly, remembered by name."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.1","Plague and Purchase: The final chapter of Samuel begins on a puzzling note. We are not told why YHWH is angry at Israel, but David becomes an unwitting accomplice in a new sin, that of taking a census. What precisely is wrong with this act is not made explicit. Guesses range from some kind of ancient reluctance to count, at least outside of a religious context (see Exod. 30, where the counted Israelites must be monetarily “redeemed”), to a feeling that taking a military census shows a lack of trust in God. Already in ancient times interpreters were uncomfortable with the passage, and in the later book of Chronicles (I 21), the idea of the census is portrayed as stemming not from God but from a shadowy figure called “the satan,” whose literal meaning is “adversary” (and not the Devil figure of later times)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.2","Be that as it may, by the midpoint of the chapter, it appears that the whole episode is functioning as an opportunity for David to exercise renewed leadership. First he gets to choose the form of punishment that Israel must undergo, and then he alone accepts blame for the plague, imploring God to have compassion on Israel. In that sense, both David and the very concept of kingship are at least partially redeemed as the book of Samuel draws to a close."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.3","There is, however, a further reason for the existence of this narrative. In order to properly atone for the taking of a census, David is to purchase some property up the hill from his palace, so that he may build an altar. The location is none other than the future site of the Temple, which David had been desperate to build in Chap. 7 and which will be erected by his son Shelomo. The book of Samuel thus concludes on a note that looks forward to the establishing of a permanent dynasty, with its presence firmly anchored in the royal complex of Jerusalem, and draws attention away from David’s decline, which had been the narrative focus since Chap. 13. The indignities of his old age are left for the next two chapters, at the beginning of the book of Kings."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.43","and he incited David against them, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.44","Go, take-a-census of Israel and Judah."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.45","2 So the king said to Yoav, commander of the army that was with him:"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.50","May Y<small>HWH</small> your God add to the people, as [many as] they are, as [many as] they are, a hundredfold!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.51",My lord king’s eyes can see it;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.52",so my lord king—why does he desire this thing?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.53","4 But the king’s word overpowered Yoav and the commanders of the fighting-forces,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.54","so Yoav and the commanders of the forces went out from the king’s presence to count the people, Israel;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.55","5 they crossed the Jordan and encamped in Aro’er, to the right/south of the town that is in the midst of the Wadi of Gad, toward Ya’zer,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.56","6 then they came to Gil’ad and to the region of Tahtim-Hodshi,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.57","then they came to Dan-Yaan and around to Sidon,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.58","7 then they came to the fortress of Tyre and all the Hivvite and Canaanite towns,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.59","and [finally] went out into the Negev of Judah, [toward] Be’er-Sheva."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.60",8 They roamed throughout the entire land
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.61",and came back at the end of nine months and twenty days to Jerusalem.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.62","9 Yoav gave the number of the people thus-accounted to the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.63","and Israel was: eight hundred thousand mighty-men of valor, drawing the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.64",and the men of Judah: five hundred thousand men.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.65","10 But David’s heart struck him after he had numbered the people,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.66",and David said to Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.67",I have sinned exceedingly in what I have done!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.68","So-now, O Y<small>HWH</small>, pray transfer the iniquity of your servant,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.69",for I have been exceedingly foolish!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.70","11 David arose at daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.71","and the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Gad the prophet, David’s visionary, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.72","12 Go, you are to speak to David:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.73",Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.74",I will hold three [things] over you;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.75","choose yourself one of them, and I will do it to you."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.76",13 Gad came to David and told him;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.77",he said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.78","Shall there come upon you seven years of famine in your land,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.79","or three months of your fleeing before your foe, while he pursues you,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.80",or shall there be three days of plague in your land?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.81","So-now, know and take-note: what kind of word shall I answer to the one sending me?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.82",14 David said to Gad:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.83",I am in exceedingly great distress;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.84","now let us fall into Y<small>HWH</small>’s hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.85",for great is his compassion;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.86",but into human hands may I never fall!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.87","15 So Y<small>HWH</small> gave forth a plague among Israel, from morning until the appointed-time,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.88","and there died of the people, from Dan to Be’er-Sheva,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.89",seventy thousand men.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.90","16 But when the [divine] messenger stretched forth his hand against Jerusalem, to bring-it-to-ruin,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.91","Y<small>HWH</small> relented concerning the evil,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.92","and he said to the messenger, the one bringing-ruin among the people:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.93","Enough now, slacken your hand!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.94",Now Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger was beside the threshing-floor of Aravna the Yevusite.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.95","17 And David said to Y<small>HWH</small>, when he saw the messenger, the one striking down the people,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.96",he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.97","Here, it is I who have sinned,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.98","it is I who have done-iniquity,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.99","but these sheep, what have they done?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.100",Pray let your hand be against me and against my Father’s House!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.101",18 Gad came to David on that day
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.102",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.103","Go up, erect an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.104",at the threshing-floor of Aravna the Yevusite.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.105","19 So David went up, according to the word of Gad, as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.106",20 And Aravna looked out
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.107",and saw the king and his servants crossing over to him;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.108","Aravna went out and bowed low to the king, his nostrils to the ground,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.109",21 and Aravna said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.110",For-what-reason does my lord come to his servant?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.111",David said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.112","To acquire the threshing-floor from you, to build an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.113",so that the plague may be restrained from upon the people!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.114",22 Aravna said to David:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.115",May my lord king take and offer up whatever is good in his eyes!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.116","See, an ox is for the offering-up"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.117",and the sledges and the gear of the oxen are for wood;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.118","23 all [this] does Aravna give, O king, to the king!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.119",And Aravna said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.120",May Y<small>HWH</small> your God show-you-good-will!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.121",24 The king said to Aravna:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.122","No,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.123","rather I will acquire, acquire it from you at fair-price;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.124",I will not offer up to Y<small>HWH</small> my God offerings-up [obtained] for nothing!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.125","So David acquired the threshing-floor and the ox for silver, fifty weights,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.126",25 and David built there an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.127",he offered up offerings-up and <i>shalom</i>-offerings.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.128","And Y<small>HWH</small> let-himself-be-entreated for the land,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.129",so that the plague was restrained from upon Israel.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.132","24:5 <b>Aro’er:</b> A town east of the Jordan, that sits on the border of the territory of Heshbon."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.133",11 <b>visionary:</b> Another word for seer or prophet.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.135","14 <b>never fall:</b> LXX continues, “So David chose the plague …” The use of “falling” contrasts with the “fall” of Sha’ul at the end of I Samuel."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.136","16 <b>threshing-floor:</b> A common feature of biblical life, a threshing floor was used to process grain. It would typically be located on a flat, hard outdoor surface, where the grain would be broken down by heavy weights such as stone rollers or even oxen. The site in the present story lay higher than David’s palace at the top of Mount Zion, and eventually became the location of Solomon’s Temple. It appears to be identical to the site of the Dome of the Rock, the Muslim monument that has stood atop the Temple Mount for more than thirteen centuries. <b>Aravna:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-RAHV-nah;</i> trad. English “Araunah.” The name is spelled several ways in biblical passages; the confusion stems, according to some, from the fact that it may not be a name at all but a title, meaning “lord” in Hurrian, an ancient Near Eastern language. Aravna has also been thought to have been a priest, further indicating that the Temple Mount may have been a long-standing holy site."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24.137","23 <b>all [this] does Aravna give, O king:</b> The phrase could also be read as “all [this] does Aravna the king give to the king,” identifying the former as a person of royal blood."

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.1","Shelomo as Heir to the Throne: Although many commentators such as Alter (1999) see Chaps. 1 and 2 as a continuation of the “Succession Narrative” that began in II Sam. 11, and thus as the natural conclusion to the David story, one could equally argue that these chapters have a life of their own. As the book of Kings opens, they form the beginning of the account of Shelomo’s accession to the throne. Their link to what has gone before fits the pattern of “overlapping structures” that I noted in the General Introduction, but these chapters also have their own vocabulary and point of view."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.2","In Chap. 1, several repeating phrases point the reader/hearer toward the central themes: “sit/seated on the/my throne” and “after” (denoting succeeding one’s father as king, used similarly in Samuel). “Bowed low” graphically highlights both court etiquette and the desperate situation of Natan and Bat-Sheva advocating for Shelomo, who is not the firstborn, and also, at chapter’s end, for reducing the status of the ambitious heir to the throne, Adoniyyahu. Above all, the repetition of the word “know,” beginning with David’s impotence in v.2, suggests that, while David may not be fully aware of what is going on around him, <i>we</i> surely are: Shelomo, and no other, will be the next king."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.3","The older principals in the chapter are especially fascinating to watch. David is obviously a shadow of his former self, unable to navigate very well either sexually or politically; Walsh points out that there are no active verbs that accompany his name in this chapter. But when the time comes, he is able to summon some strength of will, and at least nominally ensure that Shelomo will be “firmly-established.” We have not encountered either the prophet Natan or David’s great love Bat-Sheva since the moral catastrophe of II Sam. 11–12, but both play key roles here in engineering Shelomo’s ascent to power. Their interplay around persuading the king is a kind of strategic dance."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.4","In general, the story laid out in Chap. 1 is a replaying of the national split that was in evidence already during Sha’ul’s (Saul’s) succession, as well as later in Avshalom’s (Absalom’s) revolt. These conflicts are a constant reminder of what will become an essential fact of life in the book of Kings, the great schism between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.5","1:1 Now King David was old, advanced in days,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.6","and they covered him with garments, but he could not get warm."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.7",2 So his servants said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.8","Let them seek for my lord king a nubile girl,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.9",that she may stand [in waiting] before the king
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.10",and be a caregiver for him;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.11","she will lie in your bosom, and my lord king will be warm."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.12","3 So they sought out a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.13",and they found Avishag the Shunammite
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.14",and brought her to the king.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.15","4 Now the girl was beautiful, exceedingly so;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.16","she became a caregiver for the king, and attended him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.17",but the king did not know her.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.18","5 Meanwhile, Adoniyya son of Haggit was exalting himself, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.19",<i>I</i> will be king!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.20","And he provided himself with chariotry and steeds,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.21",with fifty men running ahead of him.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.22","6 Now his father had never scolded him in [all] his days, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.23",For-what-reason did you do thus?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.24",And he was also exceedingly goodly in form;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.25",it was he to whom she gave birth after Avshalom.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.26","7 Now his [private] words were with Yoav son of Tzeruya, and with Evyatar the priest;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.27","they provided help [to follow] after Adoniyya,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.28",8 while Tzadok the priest and Benayahu son of Yehoyada and Natan
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.29",the prophet and Shim’i and Re’i and the mighty-men who
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.30",belonged to David
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.31",were not with Adoniyyahu.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.32",9 And Adoniyyahu sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.33","beside Even Ha-Zohelet/The Serpent Stone that is near En-Rogel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.34","and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.35","and all the men of Judah, the king’s court-servants,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.36",10 but Natan the prophet and Benayahu and the mighty-men and Shelomo his brother he did not invite.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.37","11 So Natan said to Bat-Sheva mother of Shelomo, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.38","Have you not heard that Adoniyyahu son of Haggit has become king,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.39",while our lord David does not know?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.40","12 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.41","go, pray let me advise you with some advice:"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.50",I myself will come in after you

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.117",36 And Benayahu son of Yehoyada answered the king and said: Amen!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.118","So may Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of my lord king, declare!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.119","37 As Y<small>HWH</small> has been with my lord king,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.120","so may he be with Shelomo,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.121",and he may make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.122","38 So he went down, Tzadok the priest, with Natan the prophet and Benayahu son of Yehoyada,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.123",and the Kereitites and the Peleitites;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.124",they had Shelomo mount the mule of King David
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.125",and brought him to the Gihon.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.126",39 Then Tzadok the priest took a horn of oil from the Tent
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.127","and anointed Shelomo,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.128",and they sounded-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i>;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.129",and all the people said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.130",May King Shelomo live!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.131",40 And all the people went up after him;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.132","the people were piping on pipes and rejoicing with great joy,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.133",so that the earth split at their sound.

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.135",1:1 <b>David:</b> Pronounced <i>dah-VEED.</i> <b>advanced in days:</b> A usual biblical expression for old age. Heb. <i>yamim</i> can sometimes mean “years.”
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.136","2 <b>nubile:</b> Heb. <i>betula</i>, usually translated “virgin,” means mainly one who has passed puberty, a marriageable young woman. <b>caregiver:</b> Heb. <i>sokhenet;</i> the masculine version appears in Isa. 22:15, as an old term for “steward of the household.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.137","3 <b>Avishag:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-vee-SHAHG;</i> trad. English ‘Abishag.” <b>Shunammite:</b> From the town of Shunem, near the Jezreel Valley in the north. It resonates with the beginning of David’s rule, since the Philistines pitched camp there before the battle of Mount Gilboa, where Sha’ul was killed."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.138","4 <b>know her:</b> The Hebrew verb <i>y-d-’</i> most often indicates awareness or knowledge, but can also, as here, be extended to include intimate, “biblical” knowledge: sexual relations."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.139","5 <b>Adoniyya:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-do-nee-YAH;</i> trad. English ‘Adonijah.” “Y<small>HWH</small> Is My Lord” is an ironically pious name for David’s son who will not get to rule. The name sometimes appears in fuller form, “Adoniyyahu.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.140","6 <b>And he was also:</b> He is spoiled and handsome like Avshalom (Absalom) his older brother. <b>goodly:</b> The good looks apparently run in the family, but are no guarantee against disaster. <b>it was he to whom … :</b> The Hebrew is a bit strange here. <b>Avshalom:</b> Pronounced <i>ahv-shah-LOHM;</i> trad. English ‘Absalom.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.141",7 <b>Yoav:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-AHV;</i> trad. English “Joab.” He is David’s fanatically loyal general. <b>Tzeruya:</b> Trad. English “Zeruiah.” <b>Evyatar:</b> Trad. English ‘Abiathar.” <b>provided help:</b> Supported his claim to the throne.

English “Benaiah.” <b>Yehoyada:</b> Pronounced <i>ye-hoyah-DAH</i>, with the meaning, central to the story, of “Y<small>HWH</small> Knows.” Trad. English “Jehoiada.” <b>Natan:</b> Pronounced <i>nah-TAHN;</i> trad. English “Nathan.” He is David’s influential court prophet (see II Sam. 7,12). <b>Shim’i:</b> Pronounced <i>shim-EE;</i> trad. English “Shimei.” He had cursed David in the Avshalom narrative (II Sam. 16), but thus far, David has spared him. <b>Re’i:</b> LXX reads <i>“re’av,”</i> “his friends.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.143","9 <b>Serpent Stone:</b> Others, “the stone of Zoheleth,” “the sliding stone.” <b>En-Rogel:</b> Pronounced <i>ayn ro-GAYL.</i> The “Washer’s [or Fuller’s] Spring” in the Kidron Valley near Jerusalem, marking the boundary line between the territories of Benjamin and Judah. It figured previously in the spy story of II Sam. 17. <b>invited:</b> Literally, “called.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.144",10 <b>Shelomo:</b> Trad. English “Solomon.” The accent is on the last syllable.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.145","11 <b>Bat-Sheva:</b> Pronounced <i>baht-SHEH-vah;</i> trad. English “Bathsheba.” David’s beloved wife. The <i>Sheva</i> part of her name puns with the Hebrew word for “swear [an oath],” a theme in this chapter (Walsh)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.146","13 <b>my lord king … Adoniyyahu become king:</b> Heb. <i>adoni ha-melekh … malakh adoniyyahu</i>, a wordplay that is another indication of the narrator’s “mastery of intonation” (Fishbane). <b>your handmaid:</b> An appropriate way for Bat-Sheva to refer to herself in court etiquette."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.147",14 <b>confirm:</b> Or literally “fill in” (Alter 1999).
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.148","16 <b>What is your [business]?:</b> The Heb. <i>ma-lakh</i> may be a pun on <i>malokh</i>, “reign as king” (Walsh)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.149","17 <b>Y<small>HWH</small></b>: As explained above in “On Using This Book,” the name of God in the Hebrew Bible, whose pronunciation is not precisely known, is traditionally transcribed as “the Lord” and the like. Here it is printed according to the way it appears in the Hebrew text, and the reader may choose how to say it (for example, “The Eternal,” <i>“Adonai”</i>)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.150","21 <b>lies beside his fathers:</b> Indicating a peaceful death. <b>guilty ones:</b> Others, “offenders,” “criminals.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.151","30 <b>after me … in my place:</b> Heb. <i>aharai … tahtai.</i> The two parallel words provide a poetic rhythm, hinting at the importance of the thought (Walsh)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.152","33 <b>mule:</b> The animal of choice for royal riders. <b>the Gihon:</b> Pronounced <i>gee-HOHN</i>, “The Gusher,” the important spring just outside of Jerusalem, not far from En-Rogel. Friedman (1999) notes that a similarly named river is found in the Garden of Eden story (Gen. 2:13), and thus posits that an “original core” of the first half of the Bible was bracketed by occurrences of this name."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.153","34 <b><i>shofar:</i></b> The ram’s horn, sounded to summon people for military, official, or religious occasions. May <b>King Shelomo live!:</b> The Hebrew idiom for “Long live King Shelomo!”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.154","35 <b><i>Nagid:</i></b> Pronounced <i>nah-GEED</i>, this is a term possibly indicating dynastic choice, but not identical with “king.” Others, “prince, designate.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.155","36 <b>Amen!:</b> From a verb meaning “to trust, to be certain,” it is pronounced <i>ah-MAYN</i> in Hebrew. Later, of course, it enters prayer texts, even in English. <b>declare:</b> Or “say.” Some ancient manuscripts have “do.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.156","38 <b>the Kereitites and the Peleitites:</b> David’s personal bodyguard, made up, it appears, of mercenaries from Crete and Philistia, although the latter identification is not certain."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.157","39 <b>Tent:</b> Probably the “Tent of Appointment,” the pre-Temple shrine, described in detail in the book of Exodus."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1.158","40 <b>pipes:</b> Or “flutes.” The Hebrew word (sing. <i>halil</i>) is onomatopoetic, and comes from a root meaning “hollow.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.1","Settling Scores, Securing the Throne: For a brief moment—the first part of this chapter—the old David returns, although he is not the hero and Psalmist beloved by tradition or the chastened monarch with which the book of Samuel ended. It is the canny and ruthless politician who makes his appearance here. His opening words to his son (vv.2–4) use classic Deuteronomistic language (“be strong,” “keep the keeping of YHWH,” “the teaching,” “prosper,” “with all their heart/being”), and are seen by many as a passage inserted later to soften what follows. For David proceeds to use the word “know,” which appeared in Chap. 1, as a prelude to political assassination. Even Yoav, David’s trusted but violent commander in chief, is not to be spared, for the new king must settle scores and begin afresh. That this advice and behavior sound like those of a Mafia don should not surprise us, given the violent period in which they are set and the literature, succeeding the books of Judges and Samuel, in which they appear. In the end, in contrast to his victims, David simply “lay beside his fathers” (v.10)—but this description is rather pale compared to the deaths of patriarchs (Avraham) and prophets (Moshe), figures with whom one might expect David to be grouped. There is, notably, no public mourning mentioned; thus ends the life of Israel’s greatest king and the measuring rod for all the Judean kings to come. In essence, the cheering we witnessed in I Sam. 18:7 has stopped. The only truly positive note in this chapter is that the dynasty will continue."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.2","David’s successor Shelomo now sheds his passive image from Chap. 1 and emerges as a powerful force on his own. His brother Adoniyyahu, who had expected to be king and had been acting accordingly, finds himself at a disadvantage, but instead of cleverly countering the palace intrigue, he walks into a trap of his own making. In a move reminiscent of a previous usurper, Avshalom, he seeks to sleep with a royal concubine, a move which in the Bible is less of purely sexual import and more an indication that a son seeks to replace his father in power."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.3","In the subsequent action, Bat-Sheva once again appears, and, as Walsh notes, we may wonder about her motivations in interceding for Adoniyyahu. Is she trying to bring about reconciliation between the brothers, or is she, like the audience, fully aware of how Shelomo will react to his brother’s request?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.4","Shelomo’s rule is “firmly-established” at both the beginning (v.12) and end (v.46) of this sequence, but it is disturbing that in the middle, such extreme violence has to take place. Like the stereotyped violence of assassination in Samuel (four uses of the rare word “abdomen” to specify where the victims are stabbed), the murders here are described by means of a single verb, “attack.” Another key word provides one answer to the troubling question of whether the killing is justified: the bloodguilt and other crimes of Yoav and Shim’i “<i>return</i> [on their heads]” (vv.33 and 44; italics mine). And Adoniyyahu’s death as well is a kind of payback for his acts of usurpation. So by the end of the chapter all the loose ends have been tied up, albeit that the new king, whose name suggests “peace,” has achieved it through the usual and not very peaceful methods practiced by kings."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.5","A nonviolent resolution of conflicts does occur in vv.26–27, where the last of the line of Eli the priest (see the opening chapters of Samuel) is relieved of a future priestly role. Thus the text has God’s word in history fulfilled, beginning a major pattern in the book of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.6","41 Adoniyyahu heard it, and all those invited who were with him"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.7",—now they had just finished eating—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.8","and [when] Yoav heard the sound of the <i>shofar</i>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.9",he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.10",For-what-reason is the sound of the city [one of] panic?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.11","42 He was still speaking,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.12",when here: Yonatan son of Evyatar the priest came.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.13",Adoniyyahu said: Come in!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.14","For you are a man of valor,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.15",and you bring good news.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.16",43 Yonatan spoke up and said to Adoniyyahu:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.17",But—our lord King David has made Shelomo king!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.18","44 The king sent with him Tzadok the priest and Natan the prophet and Benayahu son of Yehoyada,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.19","and the Kereitites and the Peleitites,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.20","and they had him mount the king’s mule,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.21",45 and Tzadok the priest and Natan the prophet anointed him as king at the Gihon;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.22","they went up from there rejoicing,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.23",and the city was [as in a] panic!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.24",That is the sound that you heard.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.25","46 And even more, Shelomo is seated on the throne of the kingdom,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.26","47 and even more, the king’s servants have come to bless our lord King David, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.27","May your God make Shelomo’s name better than your name,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.28",may he make his throne greater than your throne!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.29",And the king bowed low on the couch.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.30","48 And even more, thus did the king say:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.31","Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.32","who has given [one] today to sit on my throne, and my eyes see it!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.33","49 Then they trembled and arose, all those invited who were for Adoniyyahu,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.34",and each one went on his way.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.35","50 And Adoniyyahu was in fear before Shelomo,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.36",so he arose and went and took hold of the horns of the sacrificialaltar.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.37","51 And it was told to Shelomo, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.38","Here, Adoniyyahu is in fear of King Shelomo,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.39","and here, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.40",Let King Shelomo swear to me this [very] day that he will not put his servant to death by the sword!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.41",52 So Shelomo said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.42","If he behaves like a valiant one,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.43",not a hair of his will fall to the ground;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.44","but if any evil be found in him, then he shall die!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.45","53 King Shelomo sent, and they brought him down from the altar;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.46","he came and bowed low to King Shelomo,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.47",and Shelomo said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.48",Go back to your house!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.49","2:1 Now David’s days drew near to die,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.50","so he charged Shelomo his son, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.51",2 I am about to go the way of all the earth.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.52","You are to be strong, and be a man!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.53","3 You are to keep the keeping of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.54","walking in his ways, keeping his laws, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.55","as it is written in the Instruction of Moshe,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.56",in order that you may cause to prosper all that you do
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.57","and wherever you face,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.58","4 in order that Y<small>HWH</small> may fulfill his word that he spoke to me, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.59","If your sons will guard their way,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.60","walking in my presence in truth,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.61","with all their heart and with all their being,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.62",no one will [ever] be cut off from you from the throne of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.63","5 Now even more, you yourself know what Yoav son of Tzeruya did to me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.64","what he did to the two commanders of the armed-forces of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.65","to Avner son of Ner and to Amasa son of Yeter—he killed them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.66",and he brought the blood of war into peacetime:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.67",he put the blood of war on his belt that is on his loins and on his sandal that is on his feet.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.68",6 So you are to act according to your worldly-wisdom:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.69",you must not let his gray-hair go down in peace to Sheol!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.70",7 But to the sons of Barzillai the Gil’adite you are to show loyalty;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.71","they should be among those eating at your table,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.72",for thus they came near to me [in friendship] when I ran away from Avshalom your brother.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.73","8 And here, with you is Shim’i son of Gera, the Binyaminite from Bahurim:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.74",<i>he</i> cursed me with a grievous curse on the day of my going to Mahanayim.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.75","But when <i>he</i> went down to meet me at the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.76","I swore to him by Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.77",If I should put you to death by the sword … !
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.78","9 But now, do not hold him clear,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.79",for you are a worldly-wise man:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.80","you know what you must do to him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.81",so that you bring down his gray-hair in blood to Sheol!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.82","10 And David lay beside his fathers,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.83",and was buried in the City of David.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.84",11 Now the days that David reigned as king over Israel were forty years:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.85","in Hevron he reigned as king for seven years, while in Jerusalem he reigned as king for thirty-three years."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.86","12 And Shelomo sat on the throne of David his father,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.87",and his kingdom was exceedingly firmly-established.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.88",13 Adoniyyahu son of Haggit came to Bat-Sheva mother of Shelomo.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.89",She said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.90",Is your coming in peace?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.91",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.92",In peace.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.93",14 And he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.94",I have a word for you.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.95",She said: Speak!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.96",15 He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.97","You yourself know that mine was the kingdom,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.98",and that toward me all Israel had set their faces to be king.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.99","But the kingdom has been reversed and has become my brother’s,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.100",since it was from Y<small>HWH</small> that it became his.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.101","16 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.102",there is one request that I request of you—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.103",do not turn away my face!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.104",She said to him: Speak!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.105",17 He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.106",Pray talk to Shelomo the king
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.107",—for he will not turn away your face—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.108",that he may give me Avishag the Shunammite as a wife.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.109","18 Bat-Sheva said: Very well,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.110",I myself will speak regarding you to the king.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.111","19 So Bat-Sheva came to King Shelomo, to speak to him regarding Adoniyyahu."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.112","And the king arose to meet her, and bowed low to her;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.113","then he sat down on his throne,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.114","and he prepared a throne for the king’s mother, and she sat down at his right."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.115",20 She said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.116",There is one small request that I request of you;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.117",do not turn away my face.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.118",The king said to her:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.119","Make request, mother,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.120",for I will not turn away your face.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.121",21 She said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.122",Let Avishag the Shunammite be given to Adoniyyahu your brother as a wife.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.123",22 King Shelomo answered and said to his mother:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.124",Now why are you requesting Avishag the Shunammite for Adoniyyahu?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.125","Request the kingdom [itself] for him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.126","for he is my brother, the one older than I!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.127",—for him and for Evyatar the priest and for Yoav son of Tzeruya!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.128","23 And King Shelomo swore by Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.129","Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.130","indeed, at [the cost of] his life has Adoniyyahu spoken this word!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.131","24 So-now, Y<small>HWH</small>, who has established-me-firmly and seated me on the throne of David my father,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.132","and who has made me a [dynastic] house, as he promised:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.133","indeed, today Adoniyyahu will be put to death!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.134",25 So King Shelomo sent by the hand of Benayahu son of Yehoyada;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.135","he attacked him, so that he died."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.136","26 Now to Evyatar the priest, the king said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.137","To Anatot, go to your fields!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.138","For you are a man [deserving] of death,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.139","but on this day I will not put you to death,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.140","since you carried the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> before my father David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.141",and since you suffered all that my father suffered.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.142","27 So Shelomo drove out Evyatar from being priest to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.143",so as to fulfill the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had spoken regarding the House of Eli at Shilo.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.144",28 Now the report came to Yoav
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.145","—since Yoav had inclined after Adoniyya, though after Avshalom he had not inclined—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.146",and Yoav fled to the Tent of Y<small>HWH</small> and took hold of the horns of the altar.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.147","29 King Shelomo was told that Yoav had fled to the Tent of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.148","and here: he was next to the altar,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.149","so Shelomo sent Benayahu son of Yehoyada, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.150","Go, attack him!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.151",30 Benayahu came to the Tent of Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.152",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.153",Thus says the king:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.154",Come out!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.155",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.156","No, for here I will die!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.157","Benayahu returned word to the king, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.158","Thus spoke Yoav, and thus he answered me."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.159",31 The king said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.160",Do as he spoke—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.161","attack him and then bury him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.162",so that you may remove the causeless blood that Yoav shed
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.163",from me and from my Father’s House.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.164",32 May Y<small>HWH</small> return his blood on his head—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.165","[seeing] that he attacked two men more righteous and noble than he, and killed them with the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.166",while my father David did not know:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.167","Avner son of Ner, Commander of the Armed-Forces of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.168","and Amasa son of Yeter, Commander of the Armed-Forces of Judah."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.169","33 Their bloodguilt will return on the head of Yoav and on the head of his seed, into the ages,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.170","while for David, and for his seed, and for his house, and for his throne, there will be peace for the ages from Y<small>HWH</small>!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.171","34 So Benayahu son of Yehoyada went up and attacked him, and put him to death;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.172",he was buried in his house in the wilderness.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.173","35 And the king put Benayahu son of Yehoyada in his place as [The One] Over the Armed-Forces,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.174","while Tzadok the priest, the king put in place of Evyatar."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.175",36 Then the king sent and summoned Shim’i
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.176",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.177",Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and stay there;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.178","you are not to go out of there, [either] here or there."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.179","37 For it will be, on the day of your going out and crossing Wadi Kidron:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.180","know, yes, know that you will die, yes, die—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.181",your blood will be on your [own] head!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.182",38 Shim’i said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.183",The word is good;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.184","as my lord king has spoken, thus will your servant do."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.185",And Shim’i stayed in Jerusalem for many days.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.186",39 But it was at the end of three years
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.187","that two of Shim’i’s servants ran off to Akhish son of Maakha, king of Gat,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.188","and they told Shim’i, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.189","Here, your servants are at Gat!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.190","40 So Shim’i arose and saddled his donkey and went to Gat, to Akhish,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.191",to seek his servants.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.192",And Shim’i went and brought back his servants from Gat.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.193","41 Shelomo was told that Shim’i had gone from Jerusalem to Gat, and had returned,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.194",42 so the king sent and called for Shim’i;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.195",he said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.196",Did I not have you swear by Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.197",—and I warned you—saying:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.198","On the day of your going out, if you should go [either] here or there,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.199","know, yes, know that you will die, yes, die!?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.200",And you said to me:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.201",The word is good—I hearken.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.202","43 So why did you not keep the sworn-oath of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.203",and the command that I commanded you?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.204",44 And the king said to Shim’i:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.205","<i>You</i> know all the evildoing that your heart knew,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.206",that you did to David my father.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.207",So Y<small>HWH</small> will return your evildoing on your head!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.208","45 But King Shelomo is blessed,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.209",and the throne of King David will be firmly-established before Y<small>HWH</small> for the ages!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.210","46 So the king commanded Benayahu son of Yehoyada,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.211","and he went out and attacked him, so that he died."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.212",And the kingdom was firmly-established in Shelomo’s hand.

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2.235","25 <b>attacked:</b> The verb (Heb. <i>p-g-’</i>) is used four times in this chapter (parallel perhaps to the four occasions in Samuel when David’s enemies are stabbed in the abdomen).

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.1","Shelomo the Wise: The bulk of this chapter deals with Shelomo’s acquisition of wisdom—the practical wisdom needed to govern—and a memorable demonstration of this quality (vv. 16–28). Yet these accounts are preceded by three verses of a Deuteronomistic kind, in which two discordant themes are introduced: marriage to a foreigner (in this case, the Egyptian king’s daughter) and Israel’s continuing use of local sanctuaries. Since at the end of Shelomo’s reign the worship of foreign gods and use of these local holy places are held to be responsible for the kingdom’s permanent split, this chapter, which also introduces some of the glories of the king’s rule, could be understood as yet another example of the Bible’s complex feelings about kingship."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.2","Similarly, the site of the story produces complex reactions. Giv’on, according to I Chron. 16:39 and 21:29, housed the altar and Tent used in Israelite worship, and so is appropriate for a scene of sacrifice. But it is also associated with two tales of violence in Samuel: the military contest between Yoav’s and Avner’s troops in II 2 and the killing of Sha’ul’s remaining descendants in II 21 as revenge for his massacre of the Giv’onites. So it may reflect the dual image of Shelomo and his kingship that is presented in the book."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.3","The dream sequence in vv.5–14 draws on well-established traditions in ancient lore: dreams as revelations of the divine and the folklore motif of the supernatural offering to grant a mortal’s wish. As usual, the offer functions as a kind of test, and in this case the hero passes it with flying colors. Seven times we hear the word “request,” which not only makes sense in context, but also harks back to the story of Israel’s clamoring for a king in I Sam. 8. The general vocabulary of the dialogue between God and Shelomo lays out the idealized role of the monarch: he should be a man of “understanding,” “wisdom,” and “discernment,” with “justice” as the ultimate goal."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.4","The story of the two prostitutes and the contested baby follows immediately, a deeply human tale set amid a celebratory feast. It has become famous in Western art; the combination of a presumably opulent setting, the contrasting emotions of the two women, a baby (typically portrayed by artists as naked), and a fearsome sword have proven irresistible. That the women are prostitutes should not be surprising. In the ancient Near East, it was understood that ordinary folk should have access to the throne to air their grievances, and so the tale is the perfeet test case for Shelomo’s ability to govern his entire people wisely. He emerges as an astute assessor of human behavior, a ruler with “an understanding heart” (v.9) who, despite his inexperience, is now able “to discern between good and evil” (v.9) in people’s actions and motivations. The story is also our first encounter in Kings with anonymous women, who will play a major role in the book by throwing issues of power and character into sharp relief."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.5",3:1 Shelomo became the son-in-law of Pharaoh of Egypt:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.6","he took Pharaoh’s daughter [in marriage], and brought her to the City of David,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.7","until he had finished building his house, and the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, and the wall of Jerusalem, all around."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.8","2 However, the people were sacrificing at the sanctuaries,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.9",since no house had been built for the name of Y<small>HWH</small> up until those days.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.10","3 And Shelomo loved Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.11",walking in the practices of David his father;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.12","however, at the sanctuaries he was offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.13","4 And the king went to Giv’on, to sacrifice there,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.14",for it was the great sanctuary;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.15",a thousand offerings-up would Shelomo offer up on that altar.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.16","5 At Giv’on, Y<small>HWH</small> appeared to Shelomo in a dream of the night."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.17",God said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.18",Make request: What shall I give you?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.19",6 Shelomo said:

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.21","as he walked before you in truth and in equity and in rightness of heart beside you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.22","and you have kept this great loyalty toward him, by giving him a son to sit on his throne, as is this day."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.23","7 So-now, Y<small>HWH</small> my God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.24","you yourself have made your servant king in place of David my father,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.27","8 And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.28",a people so many that it cannot be measured and cannot be numbered in abundance.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.29",9 So give your servant an understanding heart
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.30","to judge your people, to discern between good and evil."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.31",For who is able to judge this your weighty people?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.32","10 The word was good in the eyes of the Lord,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.33",that Shelomo had requested this thing;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.34",11 God said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.35",Because you requested this thing
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.36",and did not request for yourself many days
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.37",and did not request for yourself riches
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.38","and did not request the life of your enemies,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.39","but requested for yourself discernment to understand justice,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.40","12 here, I have done according to your words—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.41","here, I am giving you a wise and discerning heart,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.46","such as none has been like you, as a man among kings, for all your days."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.47","14 And if you walk in my ways, keeping my laws and my commandments,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.48","as David your father walked,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.49",I will prolong your days.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.50","15 Shelomo awoke, and here: [It was] a dream!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.51",He came to Jerusalem and stood before the Coffer of the Lord’s Covenant
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.52","and offered up offerings-up, and performed shalom-offerings,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.53",and made a drinkfest for all his servants.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.54",16 Then two whore women came to the king
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.55",and stood before him.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.56",17 The one woman said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.57","Please, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.58",and I gave birth alongside her in the house.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.59","18 And it was, on the third day after my giving birth,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.60",that also this woman gave birth
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.61","—now we were together, there was no outsider with us in the house,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.62",only the two of us in the house.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.63","19 And this woman’s son died at night,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.64","[seeing] that she had lain upon him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.65",20 so she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from next to me
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.66","while your handmaid was sleeping,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.67","and laid him in her bosom,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.68","while her son, the dead one, she laid in my bosom."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.69","21 I arose at daybreak to nurse my son,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.70",and here: he was dead!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.71","But when I examined him at daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.72","now here, he was not my son whom I had borne!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.73",22 The other woman said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.74","No—indeed,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.75","my son is the living one, and your son is the dead one!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.76",And this one was saying:

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.79",Thus they spoke before the king.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.80",_____________
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.81","3:1 <b>Pharaoh:</b> As usual, we are not told which king of Egypt is meant here. <b>the City of David:</b> Referring to the area south of the present Old City; Shelomo expanded the royal precinct northward, with the Temple atop what the ancients called Mount Zion (today’s Temple Mount). <b>his house:</b> The Hebrew word used for both “palace” and “Temple” are the same (<i>bayit</i>) in these texts. Note which of the two is mentioned first here—a possible suggestion as to their relative importance in Shelomo’s eyes."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.82","2 <b>the sanctuaries:</b> Traditionally rendered “high places,” this is a technical term for shrines outside of Jerusalem (a more focused translation might be “platform shrines” or, according to some, “open-air sanctuaries”). Given the strong slant of the book toward centralized worship in Jerusalem, every king who tolerates or sacrifices at them is to some extent condemned. <b>for the name of</b> Y<small>HWH</small>: In Deut. 12 and I Kings 8, in contrast to earlier literature, the Temple becomes the residence of God’s “name” rather than of the deity himself."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.83","3 <b>sending-up-smoke:</b> The Hebrew verb, <i>k-t-r</i>, usually denotes incense (<i>ketoret</i>) offerings."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.84","4 <b>Giv’on:</b> Trad. English “Gibeon,” located about five miles northwest of Jerusalem. See Commentary for some of its resonances."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.85","5 <b>dream:</b> A common form of revelation in the Bible, as attested many times in Genesis."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.86",7 <b>to go out and to come in:</b> Meaning “to lead the people in battle.”
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.87","9 <b>an understanding heart:</b> Lit., “a listening heart.” As with the term “wisdom,” here the point is not merely intellectual capacity but the practical ability to make wise decisions and administer justice."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.88","10 <b>requested:</b> The verb pointed to a major theme in the Sha’ul (“The Requested One”) story; here, it comes from the king himself and is obviously viewed favorably, since it occurs five times in v.11 alone."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3.89",15 <b><i>shalom</i>-offerings:</b> A type of sacrifice that creates reconciliation and solidarity within the community. JPS and others use “offerings of well-being.”
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 4.1","Shelomo’s Bureaucracy: This short chapter mirrors II Sam. 8:15–18, which enumerated the officials of King David’s court. While it is impossible to verify the names historically (and, as Walsh says, they may be here simply to give the narrative a plausible flavor), the text does present both rulers as presiding over a developed bureaucracy, and thus suggests at least the beginnings of a centralized state. As we have noted above, the tensions that normally grow out of such a transition from a tribal to a cosmopolitan society are reflected throughout Samuel and Kings. In both this and the Samuel passage, “all Israel” is stressed, although the mention of “Judah and Israel” at the end here (v.20) does not allow us to forget that the strong identity of the two separate regions was the prevailing reality throughout most of Israelite history."

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.1","Shelomo’s Wealth, Wisdom, and Fame; Preparations for Building the Temple: The splendor of Shelomo’s court now unfolds. The chapter is awash with details about the extent of the king’s territory, his provisions for a single day, and his horses, interspersed with a note of peace and security such as we rarely hear in this part of the Bible. Vv.9–14 describe Shelomo’s wisdom in glowing terms, so that in this account he surpasses other ancient sages and is universally admired."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.2","From the sevenfold sounding of the root “wise/wisdom,” which in its appearance above meant the ability to govern well, the text moves toward the central aspect of Shelomo’s reign, the building of the Temple, which must also be done with wisdom of the practical kind—that is, with skill and craftsmanship. For the initial stages, the king contacts his father’s old northern ally, Hiram of Tyre, from whom he will procure the needed building materials. But the on-site work will be done by Israelites, who are now impressed into labor gangs. This massive organization of men, which would have been the only possible way to accomplish such a project, well symbolizes the concept of a burgeoning state, with all its attendant disruption, for thousands of men must be drawn from the fields where they normally toil. The text makes no direct complaints here, however. Its primary goal is no doubt to impress the audience."

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.84","that he was not able to build a House for the name of Y<small>HWH</small> his God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.85","because of the wars that surrounded him,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.103",who has given David a wise son over this numerous people!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.104","22 And Hiram sent to Shelomo, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.111","As for you, you will do my desire, to give food for my household."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.112","24 So Hiram would give Shelomo cedar trees and juniper trees, whatever he desired,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.117","there was <i>shalom</i>/peace between Hiram and Shelomo,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.119","27 King Shelomo raised up labor-gangs from all Israel,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.123","one month they would be in the Levanon, [and] two months at home."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.124",And Adoniram was [The One] Over the Labor-force.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.125",29 Now Shelomo had seventy thousand burden carriers
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.126","and eighty thousand stone-cutters in the hill-quarry,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.127","30 aside from the prefect commanders of Shelomo who were Over the Work,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.129","31 The king commanded that they transport [from the quarry] large stones, costly stones for setting-the-foundation of the House [with] hewn stones."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5.130",32 And Shelomo’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Giblites carved them.

In between (vv.11–13) has been inserted a Deuteronomistic pledge by God that, contingent on Israel keeping the stipulations of the covenant, he will maintain his presence among the Israelites and not abandon them. The Bible understands this as a key goal of the Temple, which mimics the role of the Tabernacle (“Dwelling”) in the presettlement period, as described especially in Exodus."

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6.6",2 And the House that King Shelomo built for Y<small>HWH</small> was:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6.7","sixty cubits its length, twenty its width, and thirty cubits its height."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6.8",3 As for the portico at the front of the Great-Hall of the House:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6.9","twenty cubits was its length, along the width of the House,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6.10","and ten by the cubit its depth, in front of the House."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6.11","4 And he made windows for the House, framed [and] latticed,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6.12","5 and he built an extension against the wall of the House, all around,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6.14","round about the Great-Hall and the Rear-Chamber,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6.28","he covered the House with hollow-squares and beam-projections, of cedar."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6.29","10 He built the extension along the entire House, five cubits its height,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.1","Shelomo’s Prayer of Dedication: This long speech, beginning with a statement about Shelomo’s intent to build a Temple and culminating in a remarkable series of prayers, appears to have a complicated textual history. Some of it presupposes exile, while other parts hint at a later return; however, the bulk seems to belong to a time after the destruction of the Northern Kingdom in 722 (Sweeney 2007). Its wordiness is almost ceremonial, reminiscent of II Sam. 7, where God had made dramatic promises to David about his dynasty. And the opening fits well into an ancient Near Eastern pattern: a king solidifies his rule by dedicating or rededicating a temple in the name of the god who put him on the throne."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.2","Beginning with v.31, the chapter enumerates seven cases in which people may petition God in the Temple. They involve mainly internal crises, but also shift, after v.44, to situations outside the land of Israel, such as war and captivity. These do not necessarily put this part of the chapter in a Babylonian Exile setting, although they undoubtedly came to be read that way. All square nicely with the Deuteronomistic view that Israel’s security and prosperity come from keeping the covenant with Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.3","As Sweeney (2007) points out, the blessing uttered by Shelomo (vv.54–60) likewise encapsulates Deuteronomistic ideas, including divine promises to the ancestors and emphasis on the covenant, encompassing both Y<small>HWH</small>’s faithfulness and Israel’s need to obey. Indeed, the verb “promise” (literally, “speak”) occurs eight times in the chapter, six in vv. 15–26 and then twice at the end (v.56)."

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.28","43 and the stands, ten,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.29","and the basins, ten, on the stands,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.30","44 and the one Sea,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.31","with the oxen, twelve, beneath the Sea;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.32","45 and the pots, and the shovels, and the sprinkling-bowls—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.33","all these vessels that Hiram made for King Shelomo, for the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.34",were of polished bronze.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.35","46 In the round-plain of the Jordan the king had cast them, in thick soil,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.36",between Sukkot and Tzaretan.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.37","47 And Shelomo left all the vessels [unweighed], out of their exceeding, exceeding abundance;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.38",the weight of the bronze could not be ascertained.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.39",48 And Shelomo made all the vessels that were for the House of Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.40","the golden sacrificial-altar,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.41","and the table on which was the Bread of the Presence, of gold,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.42","49 and the lampstands, with five to the right and five to the left,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.43","in front of the Rear-Chamber, of refined gold,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.44","and the flowerwork, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.45","50 and the bowls, the snuffers, the sprinkling-bowls, the ladles, and the incense-pans, of refined gold,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.46","and the hinge-pieces for the doors to the inner house, the Holiest Holy-Place,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.47","[and] for the doors of the House, for the Great-Hall, of gold."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.48",51 And all the work that King Shelomo had made on the House of Y<small>HWH</small> was completed;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.49",Shelomo brought the holy-objects of David his father:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.50","the silver, the gold, and all the [other] vessels,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.51",and he put them in the treasuries of the House of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.52","8:1 Then Shelomo assembled the elders of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.53","all the heads of the tribes, the ancestral leaders of the Children of Israel, to King Shelomo in Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.54",to bring up the Coffer of Y<small>HWH’s</small> Covenant from the City of David—that is Zion.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.55","2 And every man of Israel assembled to King Shelomo, in the month of Etanim/Ever-Flowing, at the Festival—that is the seventh month."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.56","3 And all the elders of Israel came,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.57",and the priests carried the Coffer;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.58",4 they brought up the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> along with the Tent of Appointment and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.59",the priests and the Levites brought them up.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.60","5 Meanwhile, King Shelomo and the entire community of Israel who were present with him before the Coffer"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.61",were offering-sacrifices of sheep and oxen
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.62",which could not be numbered or measured in abundance.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.63","6 And the priests brought the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant to its place, to the Rear-Chamber of the House, to the Holiest Holy-Place,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.64",beneath the wings of the sphinxes.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.65","7 For the sphinxes were spreading [their] wings to the place of the Coffer,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.66",so that the sphinxes were sheltering the Coffer and its poles from above.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.67","8 And the poles were so long that the heads of the poles could be seen from the Holy-Place in front of the Rear-Chamber, but could not be seen outside;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.68",they have been there until this day.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.69",9 There is nothing in the Coffer
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.70","save the two stone tablets that Moshe had put there at Horev,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.71","when Y<small>HWH</small> had cut [a covenant] with the Children of Israel, at their going out from the land of Egypt."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.72","10 And it was, at the priests’ going out from the Holy-Place,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.73","that the cloud filled the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.74","11 and the priests were not able to stand to attend because of the cloud,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.75",for the Glory of Y<small>HWH</small> had filled the House of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.76",12 Then Shelomo said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.77",Y<small>HWH</small> has determined to dwell in thick darkness.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.78","13 I have built, yes, built a lofty House for you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.79","a fixed-place for your [royal] seat, for the ages."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.80",14 And the king turned his face and blessed the entire assembly of Israel
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.81",while the entire assembly of Israel was standing;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.82",15 he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.83","Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.84","who promised David my father with his own mouth,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.85","and with his own hand confirmed, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.86","16 From the day that I brought out my people Israel from Egypt,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.87",I have not chosen a city from all the tribes of Israel
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.88","[in which] to build a House, to have my name be there."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.89","But I chose David to be over my people Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.90","17 and it was in the heart of David my father to build a House for the name of Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.91",18 so Y<small>HWH</small> said to David my father:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.92","Because it was in your heart to build a House for my name,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.93","you have done well, for it was in your heart."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.94","19 However: <i>you</i> shall not build the House,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.95","rather, your son, the one going out of your loins,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.96",<i>he</i> shall build the House for my name.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.97",20 And Y<small>HWH</small> has fulfilled his word which he promised:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.98","I have arisen in the place of David my father,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.99","and have taken seat on the throne of Israel, as Y<small>HWH</small> promised;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.100","I have built the House for the name of Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.101","21 and I have put there a place for the Coffer, in which is Y<small>HWH</small>’s covenant"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.102","that he cut with our fathers, when he brought them out from the land of Egypt."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.103","22 Then Shelomo stood in front of the altar of Y<small>HWH</small>, opposite the entire assembly of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.104",and he spread his palms heavenward
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.105",23 and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.106","O Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.107",there is none like you as a god
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.108","in the heavens above or on the earth beneath,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.109","keeping the covenant, loyalty with your servants, those who walk in your presence with all their heart,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.110",24 who has kept regarding your servant David my father what you promised him;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.111","you promised with your own mouth and with your own hand confirmed, as is this day."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.112","25 So-now, Y<small>HWH</small> God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.113","keep for your servant David my father what you promised him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.114","There will never be a man cut off from you in my presence,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.115",sitting on the throne of Israel—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.116","if only your sons keep their way, walking in my presence"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.117",as you have walked in my presence!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.118","26 So-now, O God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.119",pray let your word be confirmed that you promised to your servant David my father.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.120",27 But will God really reside on earth?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.121","Here, the heavens and the heavenmost heavens cannot contain you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.122",how much less this House that I have built!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.123","28 Yet turn your face to the prayer of your servant, and to his plea, O Y<small>HWH</small> my God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.124","to hearken to the cry-of-praise and to the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence today,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.125","29 that your eyes may be open toward this House, night and day,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.126","toward the place about which you said: My name will be there,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.127",to hearken to the prayer that your servant will pray toward this place.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.128",30 And when you hear the plea of your servant and of your people Israel
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.129",that they will pray toward this place—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.130",then may <i>you</i> hearken at the place of your [royal] seat in the heavens;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.131",may you hearken and may you forgive!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.132",31 Should a person sin against his neighbor
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.133","and he lifts up an oath-curse upon him, to put him under a curse,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.134","and he comes with the oath-curse before your altar, in this House—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.135",32 then may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.137","to bring punishment on the guilty, by putting his way on his head,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.142","and they pray and plead to you in this House,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.143",34 then may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.149","and from their sin they turn, since you afflicted them—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8.150","36 then may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 9.1","The Warning; Labor; Shelomo’s Accomplishments: Just as the building of the Temple was preceded by a description of forced labor and accompanying dealings with Hiram king of Tyre, these return in Chap. 9, with some subtle variations. Hiram is not fully content with his payment of twenty Galilee towns in vv.11–14, though in vv.26–28 he does give Shelomo gold from Ofir. In between we are told how Shelomo impressed into service remnants of the Canaanites, whom the Israelites had not been able to totally drive out (see both Joshua and Judges); this, combined with mention of his wife, Pharaoh’s daughter, imparts to the chapter a slightly ominous tone, given that in the Bible Canaanite presence and intermarriage most often bring with them the danger of idolatry."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 9.2","This feeling is further amplified by the opening section of the chapter (vv.2–9), in which the king, in a second dream at Giv’on, is given a classic Deuteronomistic warning: following in the faithful ways of David will lead to a permanent dynasty, but failing to do so will lead to destruction and exile, with the Temple, so central over the previous four chapters, in ruins. After the glorious description and prayer of Chaps. 6–8, it is a sobering ending—written, perhaps, from the perspective of Israel in exile."

It is often identified with the “Stepped Stone Structure” unearthed just south of the present Old City of Jerusalem. <b>Hatzor:</b> Pronounced <i>hah-TZOR;</i> trad. English “Hazor,” a city north of the Sea of Galilee, on two major trade routes. Its ruins have recently been the site of considerable archaeological activity. <b>Megiddo:</b> Pronounced <i>meh-gee-DOE.</i> Situated at a pass which gives access to major movements of traders and troops from eastern empires down through the Coastal Plain, this was the site of crucial battles throughout antiquity. Its name of the “Hill of Megiddo,” <i>Har Megiddo</i>, has entered the English language as ‘Armageddon”—the Final Battle mentioned in the New Testament (Rev. 16:16) and a general catchword for the end of the world. <b>Gezer:</b> Pronounced <i>GEH-zer.</i> In the foothills west of Jerusalem, not far from modern Ramleh, it controlled yet another route of access: to the Coastal Plain from Jerusalem and the highlands. Thus the three cities mentioned in this verse were of signal strategic importance, and all three have left evidence of almost identical massive buildings, containing chambered gates with casemate walls. Many archaeologists connect these with the period of Shelomo (tenth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), although some date them later."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 10.1","The Queen’s Visit; Shelomo’s Opulence: In an encounter made famous through legend and art, Shelomo is now visited by the exotic Queen of Sheba. Interpreters have spent centuries speculating on the nature of their relationship, and the last emperor of Ethiopia, the colorful Haile Selassie (ruled 1930–1974), claimed descent from their union. But the text gives no hint of a romantic relationship, and focuses instead on how overwhelmed the queen is by the magnificence of Shelomo and his court. While the meeting (vv.4–9) cites “wisdom” as the thing that makes the greatest impression upon her, it is in fact “gold,” mentioned ten times in vv. 14–25, which dominates the chapter once she has departed. Thus material splendor threatens to overcome the wisdom motif. And the chapter ends with a description of Shelomo’s holdings in horses, exactly the item whose acquisition was warned against in Deut. 17:16, along with a prohibition against amassing too much gold in the very next verse. What we may well have here, then, is a good example of how a tradition originally intended to be a positive one (Shelomo’s splendor) comes, in the context of the next chapter and Deuteronomistic History (DH) overall, to take on a negative tone. The text has its own life, as it were."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 10.2","The chapter abounds in numbers—not surprising, given that it seeks to impress both the royal visitor and the reader—and makes use mostly of multiples of three and six, beginning with 666 in v.14. Such patterned numbers in many ancient cultures point to the ideas of abundance and perfection. Also notable throughout the chapter is the repetition, from the very first verse, of the Hebrew letter <i>shin</i>; the <i>sh</i>-sounds punctuate the text, as if to echo the queen’s feeling of being overwhelmed by King <i>Sh</i>elomo and his accomplishments."

As is usual in Deuteronomistic texts, the eventual collapse of Shelomo’s unified kingdom is attributed to idolatry, brought on by his marriage to foreign women. This is in keeping with the warnings registered in Deut. 7 and 17."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.2","Several motifs which will recur in Kings appear for the first time in this chapter. One is the postponement of punishment until the next generation (v.12), while another is the prophet’s reporting of God’s word to a king (although in this case it is a king-to-be, Yorov’am). That speech, in vv.31–39, is typical of the Deuteronomistic passages in Kings, concentrating as it does on the reason for specific future events."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.3","So Shelomo dies, with his great accomplishments overshadowed for the moment by the imminent dissolution of his kingdom. The rebel Yorov’am waits in the wings, and Shelomo is powerless to eliminate him before his death, unlike the ruthless successes against potential rivals that had marked the beginning of his reign."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.4","11:1 Now King Shelomo loved many foreign women, along with Pharaoh’s daughter:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.5","Moavites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.6",2 from the nations of which Y<small>HWH</small> had said to the Children of Israel:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.7",You are not to come among them and <i>they</i> are not to come among you—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.8","surely, they will incline away your heart after their gods."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.9",To them Shelomo clung in love.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.10","3 He had princess wives, seven hundred,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.11","and concubines, three hundred,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.12",and his wives inclined away his heart.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.13",4 So it was at the time of Shelomo’s old age:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.14","his wives inclined away his heart after other gods,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.15","and his heart was not complete with Y<small>HWH</small> his God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.16",like the heart of David his father.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.17",5 Shelomo went [following] after Astarte godhead of the Sidonians
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.18",and after Milkom the Detestable One of the Ammonites.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.19",6 So Shelomo did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH;</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.20","he did not fully-follow after Y<small>HWH</small>, like David his father."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.21","7 And Shelomo built a sanctuary to Kemosh the Detestable-One of Moav,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.22","on the hill that faces Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.23","and to Molekh, the Detestable One of the Children of Ammon."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.24","8 Thus did he do for all his foreign wives,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.25",those sending up smoke and offering-sacrifices to their gods.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.26","9 So Y<small>HWH</small> was enraged at Shelomo,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.27","for he had inclined his heart away from Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.28","who had appeared to him twice,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.29","10 and had commanded him about this matter, not to walk after other gods,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.30",but he had not kept what Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.31",11 And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shelomo:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.32","Because this was your [intention],"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.33","namely, you have not kept my covenant and my laws which I commanded you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.34","I will tear, yes, tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.35","12 However, in your own days I will not do it,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.36",for the sake of David your father;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.37",from the hand of your son I will tear it away.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.38",13 Yet I will not tear away the entire kingdom:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.39","one tribe I will give to your son, for the sake of David my servant,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.40","and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.41","14 So Y<small>HWH</small> raised up an adversary to Shelomo,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.42","Hadad the Edomite, who was from the royal seed in Edom."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.43","15 Now it was, when David struck Edom, when Yoav Commander of the Armed-Forces had gone up to bury [all] the slain—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.44","he struck down all the males in Edom,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.45","16 since for six months Yoav and all Israel stayed there, until he had cut off all the males in Edom—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.46","17 that Hadad ran away, he and his fighting-men, Edomites from among his father’s servants with him, to come to Egypt,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.47",and Hadad was [then] a young lad.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.48","18 They proceeded from Midyan and came to Pa’ran,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.49",and took fighting-men with them from Pa’ran
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.50","and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.51","he gave him a house, and food he assigned for him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.52",and land he gave him.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.53","19 And Hadad found exceeding favor in the eyes of Pharaoh,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.54","so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of the <i>Tah’penes</i>, the queen-mother."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.55","20 The sister of the <i>Tah’penes</i> bore him Genuvat his son, and the <i>Tah’penes</i> weaned him amid the house of Pharaoh."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.56","And Genuvat remained in the house of Pharaoh, amid Pharaoh’s sons."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.57","21 Now when Hadad heard in Egypt that David lay beside his fathers,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.58","and that Yoav Commander of the Armed-Forces was dead,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.59",Hadad said to Pharaoh:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.60","Send me off, that I may go back to my land."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.61",22 Pharaoh said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.62",What do you lack with me
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.63","that here, you seek to go back to your land?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.64",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.65","No[thing], but send, send me off!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.66","23 And God raised up against him an[other] adversary,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.67","Rezon son of Elyada,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.68","who had run away from Hadad’ezer king of Tzova, his lord."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.69",24 He gathered fighting-men to himself
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.70","and became commander of a raiding-band,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.71","when David was killing them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.72","and he went to Damascus and settled in it, and he became king in Damascus."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.73","25 He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Shelomo, along with the evil that Hadad … ;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.74","he felt loathing at Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.75",and he reigned as king over Aram.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.76","26 Now Yorov’am son of Nevat the Efratite, from Tzereda,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.77","—his mother’s name was Tzerua, a widow woman—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.78","was a servant of Shelomo,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.79",but he raised a hand against the king.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.80",27 And this is the matter in which he raised a hand against the king:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.81","when Shelomo built the Earthfill,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.82",he closed up the breach of the City of David his father.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.83",28 Now the man Yorov’am was a mighty-man of valor;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.84","Shelomo saw the lad,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.85","that he was a [skilled] doer of work,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.86",so he appointed him over all the burden-force of the House of Yosef.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.87","29 It was at [about] that time,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.88","when Yorov’am went out of Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.89","that Ahiyya the Shilonite, the prophet, encountered him on the road"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.90",—he had covered himself with a new cloak—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.91",and the two of them were alone in the open-field.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.92",30 And Ahiyya seized the new cloak that was on him
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.93",and tore it into twelve torn-pieces;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.94",31 he said to Yorov’am:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.95","Take yourself ten torn-pieces,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.96","for thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.107","to do what is right in my eyes—my laws and my judgments,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.108",like David his father.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.109",34 But I will not take away the entire kingdom from his hand;

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.112",who kept my commandments and my laws.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.113",35 But I will take away the kingdom from the hand of his son
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.114","and will give it to you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.115",the ten tribes.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.116","36 Yet to his son I will give one tribe,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.117","in order that there may be a lamp for David my servant all the days [to come] in my presence in Jerusalem,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.124","and walk in my ways,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.125","and do what is right in my eyes,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.131","39 And I will afflict the seed of David on account of this,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11.170",43 <b>Rehav’am:</b> Pronounced <i>reh-hav-AHM;</i> meaning either “God [the Kinsman] Has Caused Expansion” or “The People [Kin] Has Expanded”; trad.

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.1","Rehav’am and the Split; Yorov’am and the Calves: The division of the kingdom is recounted, not by a humdrum description of events, but by a dramatic narrative. We are presented with the age-old clash between the old, to whom experience has taught political wisdom, and the young, who think they know better. The text raises the issue of “serving,” but the real problem is ironically posed here by the ten-time repetition of the word “return”: Will the kingdom be returned to its previous state of wholeness?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.2","In order to prevent the restoration of the newly independent north to the control of Jerusalem, Yorov’am takes the fateful step of constructing two golden calves, in a move that textually echoes the Israelites’ apostasy in Exod. 32. While it is possible, as mentioned above, that this action did not constitute idolatry—the calves, in this view, would have served simply as Y<small>HWH’s</small> symbolic footstool—it certainly was seen that way by subsequent biblical writers/editors, who trace all of the kingdom of Israel’s troubles back to this moment. Thus every northern king will be compared to Yorov’am, “who made Israel to sin.” To compound his central crime in the eyes of southern writers, Yorov’am makes priests of non-Levites and establishes a new holy day on the calendar. In Walsh’s words, “he celebrates at the wrong time, in the wrong place, on the wrong altar, in honor of the wrong gods.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.3","12:1 Rehav’am went to Shekhem,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.4",for to Shekhem all Israel came to make him king.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.5","2 And it was, when Yorov’am son of Nevat heard—he was still in Egypt, where he had run away from before King Shelomo—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.6",that Yorov’am returned from Egypt.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.7","3 They sent and called for him, and Yorov’am and the entire assembly of Israel came"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.8","and spoke to Rehav’am, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.9","4 Your father made our yoke hard,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.10","but <i>you</i> now, lighten your father’s hard servitude"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.11","and the heavy yoke that he placed upon us,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.12",and we will serve you!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.13",5 He said to them:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.14","Go off for three days, and [then] return to me."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.15",So the people went off.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.16","6 And King Rehav’am sought advice from the elders who had stood before Shelomo his father when he was alive, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.17",How do you advise returning word to this people?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.18","7 They spoke to him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.19","If today you would be servant to this people, and would serve them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.20","then answer them and speak good words to them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.21",and they will be servants to you all the days [to come].
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.22",8 But he abandoned the advice of the elders which they had advised him;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.23","he sought advice from the youngsters who had grown up with him, who were standing [in service] before him."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.24",9 He said to them:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.25","What do you advise that we return as word to this people,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.26","who spoke to me, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.27",Lighten the yoke that your father placed upon us!?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.28",10 The youngsters who had grown up with him said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.29","Say thus to this people who spoke to you, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.30","Your father made our yoke heavy,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.31",but you—lighten [it] from upon us!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.32",Thus should you speak to them:

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.34",11 So-now:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.35","my father loaded a heavy yoke upon you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.36",but <i>I</i> will add to your yoke;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.37","my father disciplined you with whips,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.38",but <i>I</i> will discipline you with “scorpions”!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.39","12 So when Yorov’am and the people came to Rehav’am on the third day,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.40","as the king had spoken to them, saying: Return to me on the third day."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.41",13 And the king answered the people roughly;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.42",he abandoned the advice of the elders that they had advised
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.43","14 and spoke to them according to the advice of the youngsters, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.44","My father made your yoke heavy,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.46","my father disciplined you with whips,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.48","15 Now the king did not hearken to the people,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.49","for it was a reversal-of-events from Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.50",in order that he might fulfill his word that Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken by the hand of Ahiyya the Shilonite to Yorov’am son of Nevat.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.51","16 And all Israel saw that the king had not hearkened to them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.52","so the people returned word to the king, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.53",What portion do we have in David?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.54",No inheritance in the son of Yishai!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.55","To your tents, O Israel!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.56","Now—see to your own house, O David!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.57",And Israel went back to their tents.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.58","17 But as for the Children of Israel who were settled in the towns of Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.59",Rehav’am reigned as king over them.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.60","18 And King Rehav’am sent Adoram, [The One] Over the Forced-Labor,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.61","but all Israel pelted him with stones, so that he died,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.62","while King Rehav’am managed to go up into a chariot, to flee to Jerusalem."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.63",19 So Israel rebelled against the House of David—until this day.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.64","20 Now it was, when all Israel heard that Yorov’am had returned,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.65",that they sent and called him to the Community
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.66",and made him king over all Israel;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.67",there was no one [following] after the House of David except for the tribe of Yehuda alone.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.68","21 Rehav’am came to Jerusalem, and he assembled the entire House of Judah, along with the tribe of Binyamin,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.69","a hundred eighty thousand chosen ones, ready for battle,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.70","to do battle with the House of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.71",to return the kingship to Rehav’am son of Shelomo.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.72","22 But the word of God [came] to Shema’ya, the man of God, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.74","and the rest of the people, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.77","return, each one to his house, for from me is this matter!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.78","They hearkened to the word of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.79","and they turned back, going in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.80","25 Yorov’am built up Shekhem in the highlands of Efrayim, and held seat in it;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.81",then he went out from there and built up Penuel.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.82",26 And Yorov’am said in his heart:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.83",Now the kingdom may [well] return to the House of David;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.84","27 if this people should go up to make sacrifices at the House of Y<small>HWH</small> in Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.85","the heart of the people will turn back to their lord, to Rehav’am king of Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.86",and they will kill me
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.87",and return to Rehav’am king of Judah!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.88","28 So the king sought advice,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.89",and made two calves of gold.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.90",He said to them:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.91","Enough for you, going up to Jerusalem!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.92","Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.93","29 He put the one at Bet-El,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.94",while the [other] one he placed at Dan.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.95",30 So this matter became a sin.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.96","And the people went before the one, as far as Dan."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.97","31 He made a temple-house [for] the sanctuaries,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.98",and made priests from [all] quarters of the people who were not from the Sons of Levi.

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.100","like the Festival that is in Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.101",and he went up on the sacrificial-altar;

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.115","20 <b>Community:</b> Some kind of representative body, probably of nobles or tribal leaders."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12.116","22 <b>Shema’ya:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Hearkens,” which is ironic given the use of the verb in this chapter (vv.15,16, 25)."

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.1","The North: Prophets and Predictions: The Yorov’am story continues in an unprecedented and directly Deuteronomistic way: a prophet, here termed a “man of God,” predicts that a purge conducted by King Yoshiyyahu (Josiah), fully three centuries hence, will undo the results of Yorov’am’s terrible idolatry. When the king stretches out his hand against the prophet, it withers, and is restored (lit. “returned”) only after the king requests the prophet’s intercession. And the recurrence of the verb “return” is once again the key here. The man of God is told by God to go home by another route, and he refuses hospitality from both Yorov’am and another prophet living in Bet-El. But eventually he relents, eating and drinking with the old prophet, and the result is his death, seen as a punishment from God. The end (and, to my mind, the main point) of the matter is that Yorov’am does not “return” from his wicked path, but instead “returns” to the appointing of illegitimate priests. Things will not go back to the way they were. The north and the south have split forever."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.2","Simon (1997) focuses on the other main theme in this chapter, which is a significant one in the Early Prophets: the divine word will be fulfilled, even if the messenger (the “man of God”) does not obey as he is told. It may take centuries, but the “signs” and “portents” will come to pass. In v.26, the old prophet understands his colleague’s death as fulfilling God’s word; v.32 equally points ahead to Yoshiyyahu’s time, when the earlier prophecy regarding the altar will also come to fruition."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.3","The enduring image in the last section is reminiscent of fairy tales. We are treated to the sight of the man of God’s corpse, the lion who has killed him, and his unharmed donkey standing in the road. Walsh sees the animals as a kind of “honor guard,” and indeed, the whole story has a kind of tragic nobility. The old prophet recognizes the truth of the man of God’s word, and seeks fellowship with his colleague (Walsh notes the play on <i>shuv</i>, “return,” accomplished through multiple occurrences of <i>yashov</i>, “sit/settle”) in death just as he had, with disastrous results, in life. For Walsh, the fate of the two prophets who have gone astray mirrors the eventual fate of the two kingdoms from which they hail."

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.35","so that the king’s hand was returned-in-health to him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.36",and became as at the beginning.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.37",7 The king spoke to the man of God:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.38","Come back with me to the house and be refreshed,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.39",so that I may give you a gift.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.40",8 But the man of God said to the king:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.41",If you were to give me half your house
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.42","I would not come back with you,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13.93","13:2 <b>he called:</b> The subject is the man of God. <b>O Altar! Altar!:</b> This is the only time in the Bible that an earthbound object is addressed (Walsh); the effect is striking. <b>Yoshiyyahu:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-shee-YAH-hoo;</i> trad.

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.1","Yorov’am and Rehav’am: Instead of merely focusing on events and policies of the kings’ reigns, the narrative now keeps the events on a personal level. As with the story of the “Wise Woman of Tekoa” in II Sam. 14, a deception is initially practiced through a female messenger, but the truth manages to come out. Ahiyya the prophet, using strident, colorful language that will recur in reference to King Ah’av (Ahab), foretells the downfall of Yorov’am’s dynasty and the eventual exile of Israel. It is jarring to hear this so early in the book, but it has the effect of setting up a pattern of prophecy and fulfillment that is very much at the ideological center of the book of Kings (Walsh)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.2","Almost nothing is attributed to Rehav’am’s reign except for Judah’s idolatrous practices. The Egyptian invasion that follows in vv.25ff. therefore feels not merely political but punitive. And Rehav’am’s death notice departs from the usual formula in that his mother is mentioned again (see v.21), perhaps because she is an Ammonite—emphasizing Shelomo’s sin of intermarriage once more."

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.37","14:1 At [about] that time,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.38",Aviyya son of Yorov’am became sick.

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.65",8 and tore the kingdom away from the House of David and gave it to you

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.67","who kept my commandments and who walked after me with all his heart,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.78","11 He who dies of Yorov’am in the city, the dogs will eat,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.79","while he who dies in the open-field, the birds of the heavens will eat;"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.103","here, they are written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.104",20 Now the days that Yorov’am reigned as king were twenty and two years;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.105","then he lay beside his fathers,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.106",and Nadav his son reigned as king in his place.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.107",21 Now Rehav’am son of Shelomo reigned as king in Judah:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.108","forty-one years old was Rehav’am at his becoming king,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.109","and for seventeen years he reigned as king in Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.110",the city that Y<small>HWH</small> had chosen to put his name there from all the tribes of Israel;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.111",his mother’s name was Naama the Ammonite.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.112",22 And Judah did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH:</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.113","they aroused his zealous-indignation more than all their fathers had done, in the sins that they sinned."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.114",23 They too built for themselves sanctuaries and standing-pillars and Ashera-poles
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.115",on every lofty hill and under every luxuriant tree.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.116",24 And there were even [male] prostitutes in the land;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.117",they did according to all the abominable deeds of the nations that Y<small>HWH</small> had dispossessed before the Children of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.118",25 Now it was
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.119","in the fifth year of King Rehav’am,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.120",that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.121",26 He took away the treasures of the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and the treasures of the king’s house
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.122",—he took everything.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.123","He [even] took all the gold bucklers that Shelomo had made,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14.124","27 so King Rehav’am made, in their place, bronze bucklers;"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 15.51",18 So Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and in the treasuries of the House of the King

Ominously, v.25 characterizes him as the most evil king to date, but the same will later be said of his son Ah’av (twice, in vv.30 and 34).

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.1","Eliyyahu and Ovadyahu; The Contest at Mount Carmel: The transition of Eliyyahu from a mysterious, isolated prophet to a significant public figure is facilitated by the introduction of a secondary character, Ovadyahu, literally “Servant of YHWH,” who in an earlier persecution of YHWH’s prophets had heroically hidden them. By v.17, Eliyyahu confronts the king, and sets up the famous contest between himself and the prophets of Baal—or, more properly, between YHWH and Baal. The setting is striking: the great promontory overlooking the Mediterranean, the upper part of today’s Haifa, still called the Carmel. Down the coast from Sidon, it continues to serve as the backdrop for Eliyyahu’s mission in Baal country, so to speak. The contest itself is as theatrical as anything in the Bible. At the center are contrasts: the lone Eliyyahu against the 450 prophets of Baal; Eliyyahu’s dialoguing with the people versus the purely ritual behavior of his opponents; and, most notably, his calm demeanor, contrasted with their “ranting” and self-mutilation. The latter, of course, produces no results, whereas Eliyyahu’s heart-felt words in vv.36–37, punctuated by a twofold “know” (the motif of the public acknowledgment of God), lead to the miraculous descent of fire onto the altar. The special effects are spectacular: the fire consumes not only the sacrifice but the altar itself, and the stones and dust, and the water which Eliyyahu had previously poured over the altar. Moreover, the behavior of the prophets of Baal is mocked, mirroring a treatment of other religious systems that appears frequently in the Bible. In the end, therefore, after the slaughter of those prophets, we should not be surprised that the rains, which had been hitherto withheld, burst out of the sky. Their suddenness is not only reflective of Middle Eastern reality, but is also an indication of where the power really lies. Baal was worshipped in the region chiefly as a storm god, so the polemic is unmistakable."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.2",17 Now after these events it was
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.3","that he became sick,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.4","the son of the woman, the mistress of the house."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.5","And his sickness was exceedingly strong,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.6",until no breath was left in him.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.7",18 She said to Eliyyahu:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.8","What have I to do with you, O man of God?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.9","You have come to me to bring my iniquity to mind, to cause the death of my son!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.10",19 He said to her:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.11",Give me your son.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.12","And he took him from her bosom and brought him up to the upper room, where he was staying,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.13",and had him lie on his bed;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.14","20 then he called out to Y<small>HWH</small>, and said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.15","O Y<small>HWH</small> my God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.16",upon the very widow with whom I am lodging
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.17","will you bring evil, to cause the death of her son?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.18","21 And he measured himself out upon the child, three times,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.19","and called out to Y<small>HWH</small>, and said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.20","O Y<small>HWH</small> my God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.21",pray let the life of this child return within him!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.22",22 And Y<small>HWH</small> hearkened to the voice of Eliyyahu;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.23","the life of the child returned within him, so that he lived."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.24",23 Then Eliyyahu took the child
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.25","and brought him down from the upper-room into the house,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.26",and gave him to his mother.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.27",Eliyyahu said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.28","See, your son is alive!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.29",24 The woman said to Eliyyahu:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.30",Now indeed I know
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.31","that you are a man of God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.32",and that the word of Y<small>HWH</small> in your mouth is truth!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.33",18:1 Now it was many days [later]
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.34",that the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Eliyyahu
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.35","in the third year, saying,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.36","Go, appear to Ah’av,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.37",that I may give rain upon the face of the ground.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.38",2 So Eliyyahu went to appear to Ah’av.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.39",—Now the famine was strong in Shomeron.—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.40","3 And Ah’av called for Ovadyahu/Servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, [The One] Over the Household,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.41",—now Ovadyahu held Y<small>HWH</small> in awe exceedingly;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.42","4 it was, when Izevel cut off the prophets of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.43",that Ovadyahu had taken a hundred prophets
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.44","and had hidden them, fifty men in a cave, and sustained them with bread and water—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.45",5 and Ah’av said to Ovadyahu:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.46","Come, let us cross through the land, to all the springs of water and to all the wadis."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.47","Perhaps we will find some green grass, that we may keep horse and mule alive,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.48",and will not have to cut off [any] of the animals.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.49","6 So they divided the land between them, to cross through it:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.50","Ah’av went on one road alone,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.51",and Ovadyahu went on another road alone.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.52",7 Now when Ovadyahu was on the road:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.53","here was Eliyyahu, [coming] to meet him!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.54","He recognized him, flung himself on his face and said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.55","Is it really you, my lord Eliyyahu?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.56",8 He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.57",[It is] I.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.58","Go, say to your lord: Eliyyahu is here!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.59",9 But he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.60","How have I sinned,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.61","that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ah’av, to cause my death?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.62","10 By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.63","if there be a nation or a kingdom where my lord has not sent there to seek you … ,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.64","and when they say: He is not [here],"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.65",he makes the kingdom or the nation swear that they did not find you.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.66",11 But now <i>you</i> say:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.67","Go, say to your lord: Eliyyahu is here!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.68",12 It will be
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.69","that <i>I</i> will go from you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.70","and the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> will carry you to I know not where,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.71","and I will come to tell Ah’av, and he will not find you—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.72",so he will kill me!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.73",Yet your servant has held Y<small>HWH</small> in awe since my youth.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.74",13 Has it not been told to my lord what I did when Izevel was killing the prophets of Y<small>HWH:</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.75","how I hid a hundred men of the prophets of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.76","fifty men, fifty men [each] in a cave,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.77",and sustained them with bread and water?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.78",14 But now <i>you</i> say:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.79","Go, say to your lord: Eliyyahu is here!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.80",So he will kill me!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.81",15 Eliyyahu said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.82","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, before whom I stand,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.83","indeed, today I will appear to him!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.84","16 So Ovadyahu went to meet Ah’av, and he told him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.85",and Ah’av went to meet Eliyyahu.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.86","17 And it was, when Ah’av saw Eliyyahu,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.87",that Ah’av said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.88","Is this you, bringer-of-disaster on Israel?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.89",18 He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.90","I have not brought-disaster on Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.91","but rather you and your Father’s House,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.92",in that you have abandoned Y<small>HWH’s</small> commandments
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.93",and have walked after the Baals!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.94","19 So-now,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.95","send [messengers], gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.96","along with the prophets of Baal, four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of Ashera, four hundred,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.97",those eating at Izevel’s table.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.98",20 Ah’av sent [messengers] among all the Children of Israel
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.99",and gathered the prophets at Mount Carmel.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.100",21 And Eliyyahu came close to all the people and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.101",How long will you hop on two branches?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.102","If Y<small>HWH</small> is God, walk after him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.103","and if Baal, walk after him!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.104",But the people did not answer him a word.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.105",22 Eliyyahu said to the people:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.106","<i>I</i> am left of the prophets of Y<small>HWH</small>, myself alone,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.107",while the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.108","23 Let two bulls be given us,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.109","and let them choose one bull for themselves,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.110","and let them section it and put it atop the wood,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.111",but fire they shall not put [on it].
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.112",<i>I</i> will prepare the other bull
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.113","and place it atop the wood,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.114",but fire I will not put [on it].
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.115","24 And you are to call on the name of your god,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.116",while <i>I</i> will call on the name of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.117",And it will be:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.118","the god who answers with fire, he is God."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.119","All the people answered, they said: The matter is good!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.120",25 Then Eliyyahu said to the prophets of Baal:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.121","Choose yourselves the one bull and prepare [it] first, for you are the many,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.122","and call upon the name of your god,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.123",but fire you are not to put [on it].
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.124","26 So they took the bull that he gave them and prepared [it],"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.125","and they called upon the name of Baal, from daybreak until noon, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.126","O Baal, answer us!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.127","But there was no voice, and no one answering."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.128",And they hopped all around the altar that they had prepared.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.129","27 Now it was at noon, that Eliyyahu taunted them; he said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.130","Call out in a great voice, for he is a god!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.131",Maybe he is busy—maybe “doing his business”—or maybe on the road for himself;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.132",perhaps he is asleep and will wake up!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.133",28 So they called out in a great voice
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.134","and gashed themselves after their practice with swords and lances,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.135",until blood spilled out over them.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.136","29 And it was, when noon had passed, that they ranted on until the [time of the] offering up of the grain-gift,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.137","but there was no voice, no one answering, and no attention."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.138",30 Then Eliyyahu said to all the people:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.139",Come close to me!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.140",And all the people came close to him.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.141",He mended the wrecked altar of Y<small>HWH;</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.142","31 then Eliyyahu took twelve stones, like the number of tribes of the Children of Yaakov,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.143","to whom the word of Y<small>HWH</small> had [come], saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.144","Israel shall be your name!,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.145","32 and he built the stones [into] an altar, to the name of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.146",and made a channel [big enough] to house two <i>sei’as</i> of seed all around the altar;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.147",33 then he arranged the wood
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.148",and sectioned the bull
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.149","and placed it atop the wood,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.150",34 and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.151",Fill four jugs with water
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.152",and pour it on the offering-up and on the wood.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.153",And he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.154",Double it! And they doubled it.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.155",And he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.156","Triple it! And they tripled it,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.157","35 so that water went all around the altar,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.158",and also the channel filled up with water.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.159","36 And it was, at the [time of] offering-up the grain-gift,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.160",that Eliyyahu the prophet came close and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.161","Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yisrael,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.162",today let it be known
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.163","that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.164",and that it is by your word that I have done all these things.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.165","37 Answer me, O Y<small>HWH</small>, answer me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.166","that this people may know that you, O Y<small>HWH</small>, are God,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.167",that you yourself have reversed their heart!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.168",38 And fire of Y<small>HWH</small> fell
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.169",and consumed the offering-up and the wood
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.170","and the stones and the dust,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.171",and the water that was in the channel it licked up.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.172","39 All the people saw,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.173","and they fell upon their faces, and said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.174","Y<small>HWH</small>, he is God! Y<small>HWH</small>, he is God!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.175",40 Eliyyahu said to them:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.176",Seize the prophets of Baal!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.177",Let not one of them escape!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.178","They seized them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.179",and Eliyyahu brought them down to Wadi Kishon
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.180",and slaughtered them there.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.181",41 Then Eliyyahu said to Ah’av:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.182","Go up, eat and drink,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.183",for hark! Roaring showers!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.184","42 So Ah’av went up to eat and to drink,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.185",while Eliyyahu went up to the top of the Carmel and crouched down to the ground
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.186",and put his face between his knees.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.187",43 Then he said to his serving-lad:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.188",Now go up and look in the direction of the sea.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18.189","He went up and looked, and said:"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.1","Eliyyahu’s Flight to Sinai; Elisha Appointed: At the moment of his greatest triumph, Eliyyahu has to take to flight. God’s stunning victory over the prophets of Baal, while it wins over the hearts of the people for the moment, cannot prevent the pagan queen Izevel from forcing the prophet into a long journey. It takes place in miraculously quick fashion, and he winds up where he began in Chap. 17: alone in the wilderness, fed at divine command. But this time there is a sense of deep despair which we have not seen previously. The theme of death echoes through Eliyyahu’s multiple negative references to the Hebrew term nefesh, here meaning “life” (Fishbane). In the midst of his torment, the prophet finds himself at Sinai, in “the cave,” perhaps the site where Moshe had communed with God in Exod. 33. In one of the Bible’s greatest revelation scenes, God speaks to Eliyyahu, but not by means of the usual Sinai pyrotechnics which were so characteristic of the Exodus stories, and which in Ugaritic literature are often connected to the god Baal. Instead, after wind, earthquake, and fire, God addresses the prophet in a “still small voice.” The message is both consoling (he is to be relieved of duty, so to speak) and concentrated: he must go back into the world and set up future events, by appointing his successor and anointing not only the next king of Israel but the king of Aram as well."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.2","The portrait of a prophet as an isolated, persecuted, and self-doubting figure is characteristic of the Hebrew Bible’s understanding of the role. Moshe begins the pattern in his initial refusal to serve (Exod. 3) and continues in the many moments when he alone stands between an angry God and the erring people. But the pattern continues elsewhere, especially in the person of Yirmeyahu (Jeremiah) (see, for instance, Jer. 1 and 20). The nature of the prophet’s role is to stand against “nations and kingdoms: / to uproot and to pull down, / to destroy and to overthrow, / to build and to plant” (Jer. 1:10). Despite the terrible personal price to be paid by the prophet in his personal and communal life, however, he is exhorted, “Do not break down before them, / lest I break you before them… . They will attack you, / but they shall not overcome you; / for I am with you—declares Y<small>HWH</small>—to save you” (Jer. 1:17,19)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.3","There is pathos in Eliyyahu’s loneliness, which stands out in contrast to his mastery of the miraculous elsewhere; the wonder-worker cannot overcome his destiny. And so it is that he finds one over whom he can literally throw his mantle, a successor (Elisha) who will surpass his master in textual space and miraculous deeds, but not in force of personality."

But it should also be noted that from Carmel to Yizre’el is a hefty run, perhaps eighteen miles. So Eliyyahu outraces the king’s chariot horses, again acting almost supernaturally (Cantrell)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.85","19:1 <b>and above all:</b> Following ancient versions; MT has “and all that,” which makes no sense."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.86",3 <b>He was afraid:</b> Ancient versions and manuscripts; MT has “he saw.” <b>Be’er-Sheva that belongs to Judah:</b> Some two hundred miles from Eliyyahu’s usual haunts in the north.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.87","4 <b>a broom tree:</b> Others, “a single/lone broom tree,” but Heb. <i>ahat</i> may simply be the indefinite article in northern biblical speech. As for the tree, commentators differ over whether this is a different bush than the one above, or some kind of textual error."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.88","5 <b>messenger:</b> From God; our “angel’’ is derived from Greek <i>angelos</i>, “messenger.” <b>touching:</b> Perhaps even with the nuance of “punching” (Mann) or “poking.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.89",7 <b>too much:</b> Or “more than enough” (Walsh).
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.90","9 <b>a cave:</b> The definite article in biblical Hebrew can often be understood as indefinite in English. Nevertheless, some take it as <i>the</i> cave of revelation to Moshe (see the “cleft of the rock” in Exod. 33:22)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.91","11 <b>Y<small>HWH</small> was not in the … :</b> The unusual form here seems to break out of narrative and belong almost to the realm of incantation, or at least oral performance, making the scene even more vivid. Before each phrase, virtually all translations insert “but,” which, however, is not in the text."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.92","12 <b>a still, small voice:</b> Heb. <i>kol demama dakka.</i> Levine suggests a usage of <i>d-m-m</i> that describes mourning or the like, and Simon (1997) notes a similar meaning in ancient versions; I therefore contemplated using “a mild murmuring voice.” But the King James Version’s “a still, small voice” has never been surpassed, and retains much of the mystery and ambiguity of the Hebrew, in which the prophetic experience encompasses both awestruck silence and speech. The genius of the King James translators is also on display here, since what they inherited from their great predecessor, WilliamTyndale (whose translation informs the bulk of their text), was “a small, still voice.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.93","15 <b>way:</b> Translated as “journey” in v.7. <b>the Wilderness of Damascus:</b> East of Lake Tiberias, and a region well-known as a place of refuge (Gray 1970). <b>anoint Hazael:</b> This action will actually be done by Eliyyahu’s disciple Elisha, so Eliyyahu will accomplish it only indirectly (Fishbane)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19.94","16 <b>Elisha:</b> Pronounced <i>eh-lee-SHAH.</i> The name means “My God Delivers.” <b>Evel-Mehola:</b> Southeast of Bet-She’an, near the Jordan River. <b>anoint:</b> In the case of Elisha, some commentators see the act as indicating “appointing,” and not literally pouring oil on his head."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.1","Ah’av/Israel and Aram: The book of Kings is highly interested in neighboring nations, as in Aram here; but typically that interest stems less from a desire to report detailed historical events and more from a need to teach about God, kings, and prophets. And so this chapter presents Ah’av as defiant of the Aramean king—a stance that is supported by God through a prophet—but he also releases the defeated Ben-Hadad following the battle, much to the chagrin of YHWH. This last is perhaps a hint of the historical record as found outside the Bible; Assyrian sources characterize Israel and Aram as close allies in the Battle of Qarqar in 853 B.C.E."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.2","Aram covers the large area to the northeast of Israel, substantially today’s Syria. It thus became, in the early centuries of the first millennium <small>B.C.E</small>., a border or buffer state between Assyria and those peoples living on the Mediterranean coast. Aram was not destined to become a great empire like those to the east and southeast, although it attained some prominence in the ninth century; throughout much of its history it was in fact disunified, never possessing a central government. Its chief contributions to the world were, first, its adaptation of Phoenician writing into a more functional alphabet, with the innovation of several letters coming to serve as vowels; and, second, its status as the birthplace of the Aramaic language, which first served as a major diplomatic language in the ancient Near East and later became the daily tongue of Jews for well over a thousand years, including of Jesus and of the Roman-period Rabbis."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.3","From the vantage point of narrative continuity, this chapter would be most fruitfully paired with Chap. 22, and indeed, in LXX the chapter order is 21–20–22."

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.88",17 And the squire-lads of the provincial commanders went out first;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.89",they sent [to] Ben-Hadad
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.90","and told him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.91",Men have gone out from Shomeron!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.92",18 He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.93","If they have gone out for peace, seize them alive,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.94","and if it is for battle that they have gone out, alive seize them [too]!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.95","19 But these went out from the city, the squires of the provincial commanders,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.96",along with the army that was behind them;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.97","20 each man struck his man down,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.98","and they fled to Aram, while Israel pursued them."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.99","And Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse, with cavalry."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.100",21 The king of Israel went out and struck down horse and chariot;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.101","he struck Aram, a great striking-down."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.102",22 And the prophet came close to the king of Israel and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.103","Go, strengthen yourself;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.104","know and take-note of what you must do,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.105","for at the turn of the year, the king of Aram will go up against you."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.106",23 Now the servants of the king of Aram said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.107","A god of the hills is their god,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.108",therefore they were stronger than we;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.109",but we should do battle with them in the plain
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.110",[and see] if we aren’t stronger than they!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.111","24 And this thing, do:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.112","Remove the kings, each one from his place,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.113",and put governors in their steads;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.114","25 while you, you are to number yourself an army"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.115","like the army fell away from you,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.116","horse like horse, chariot like chariot,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.117","that we may battle them in the plain,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.118",[and see] if we aren’t stronger than they!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.119","He hearkened to their voice, and did thus."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.120","26 So it was, at the turn of the year,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.121","that Ben-Hadad counted Aram [for war],"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.122","and he went up to Afek for battle with Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.123",27 while the Children of Israel were mustered and provided [with food]
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.124",and went to meet them;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.125",the Children of Israel encamped over against them
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.126","like two bare flocks of goats,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.127",while Aram filled up the land.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.128","28 And the man of God came close and said to the king of Israel, he said:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.129",Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.130","Because Aram said: A god of the hills is Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.131",he is not a god of the valleys—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.132","I will give all this great throng into your hand,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.133",so that you may know that I am Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.134","29 They encamped, these opposite those, for seven days,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.135","and it was on the seventh day, that the battle came near;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.136",the Children of Israel struck down of Aram a hundred thousand foot-soldiers in one day.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.137","30 Those left fled to Afek, to the town,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.138",and the wall fell upon the twenty-seven thousand fighting-men who were left.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.139","Ben-Hadad [too] had fled, and he came into the town, into a room within a room."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.140",31 His servants said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.141","Now here, we have heard that the kings of the House of Israel—indeed, they are kings [who keep] loyalty;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.142","now let us put sackcloth on our loins and cords on our heads,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.143",and let us go out [to surrender] to the king of Israel
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20.144",—perhaps he will spare your life.

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.1","Navot’s Vineyard: This story, which might be titled “The Framing of Navot,” appears to have been inserted in the middle of two accounts of Israel’s relationship with Aram. It has been made to connect to the first by means of an aural association: the description of Ah’av’s mood in 20:43 as “sullen and enraged” is repeated verbatim in v.4. The story is a high point in the biblical narrator’s art, and tells us more about a situation and an ideology than it does about the prophet himself. Eliyyahu’s ringing condemnation of Ah’av is a classic prophetic trope, rather removed from his usual miracle-working behavior. Indeed, structurally the story is almost a clone of the David and Bat-Sheva tale of II Sam. 11–12. In both instances, a king takes what is rightfully another’s; he has the owner murdered; as he is about to get away with the dual crime, a prophet confronts and condemns him; the king immediately repents; and aspects of the punishment are deflected or put off until the next generation. A message beyond specific historical circumstances is presented here, namely, that the king may not trespass on certain sacred rights, especially regarding the family inheritance of land. And Mann notes that the king and queen even break most of the Ten Commandments in this brief story. In a broader sense, then, the story exposes the unresolved tension between small community and monarchy, a tension which applies not only to Eliyyahu’s era but probably to an extended period of change, whenever it may have occurred historically. It is all the more ironic that Izevel makes use of the social mechanisms of small community, a council of elders and freemen, to bring about Navot’s murder."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.2","Of particular interest are the portraits of Izevel and Ah’av painted in the text. The Phoenician princess who becomes queen of Israel is the epitome of connivance and control, more paralleling the David of the Bat-Sheva story than her husband does. Upon hearing Ah’av’s complaint, without missing a beat she uses her power to get what he cannot, as if she has a plan already drawn up. He, on the other hand, appears utterly tentative—whether out of weakness of character or respect for ancient institutions, we are not told. But when confronted by Eliyyahu, Ah’av is transformed into the model sinner, repenting even more strongly than did his predecessor David."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.3","The chapter gives the writer the opportunity to include a Deuteronomistic note (vv.24–26) about how terrible Ah’av was, and sets up the next major section of Kings, which will recount how the Omride dynasty (and Izevel) meets its downfall. The narrative will take its time getting there; the prophecy’s fulfillment will occur only during the career of Eliyyahu’s successor Elisha. The fact that this chapter seems to be modeled on the earlier story from Samuel may indicate that the writers/editors felt so strongly about the theme of kingly usurpation that they made sure to include a separate parallel story about the north, whenever our chapter was actually written."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.4","The narrator makes use of several key words in repetition. Five times in vv.13–16 we hear the root “die,” which hammers in the seriousness of the crime (just as both David’s murder of Uriyya and the finality of David’s punishment, the death of his newborn child, are stressed through the same root in II Sam. 11:17–24 and 12:18–19). The fourfold “take possession” later in the story turns our attention to the second stage of Ah’av’s crime. Above all, however, is the signal use of the commonplace verb “give,” occurring fully nine times in the first seven verses of the story. If the David/Bat-Sheva narrative was about “sending,” the present story is about who has the power to give over what is not theirs. And the dynasty is condemned in just those terms—v.22’s “I will give your house to be” like the other defunct dynasties of the Northern Kingdom. While the Hebrew verb <i>n-t-n</i> in such passages usually signifies “make” or “place,” here it may be meant to echo the earlier theme word “give.” The same verb can also connote “to sell,” so we have here a rich use of language."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.5",32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins and cords on their heads
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.6",and came to the king of Israel
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.7",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.8",Your servant Ben-Hadad says:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.9",Pray spare my life!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.10",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.11",Is he still alive? He is my brother!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.12","33 Now the men were practicing divination and quickly seized upon it,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.13",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.14",Ben-Hadad is your brother!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.15",And he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.16","Come, fetch him!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.17","So Ben-Hadad went out to him, and he pulled him up into the chariot."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.18",34 He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.19","The towns that my father took from your father, I return,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.20","and you may put bazaars in operation for yourself in Damascus,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.21",just as my father put in operation in Shomeron;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.22","while I, under [this] covenant I will send you free."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.23","So he cut a covenant with him, and sent him off."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.24",35 Now a man from the Sons of the Prophets said to his neighbor:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.25","By the word of Y<small>HWH</small>, pray strike me!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.26","But the man refused to strike him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.27",36 so he said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.28","Because you did not hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.29","here, when you go from me, a lion will strike you down!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.30","He went from beside him, and a lion found him and struck him down."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.31",37 Then he found another man and said: Pray strike me!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.32","And the man struck him, striking and wounding [him]."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.33","38 Then the prophet went and stood [waiting] for the king, by the road,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.34",and he disguised himself with a covering over his eyes.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.35","39 It was, as the king was crossing by,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.36",that he cried out to the king;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.37",he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.38","Your servant went out into the midst of the battle,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.39","when here, a man turned aside and brought a man to me,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.40",and he said: Guard this man—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.41","if he is counted-missing, yes, missing [later],"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.42","it will be your life in place of his life,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.43",or else you will have to weigh out a talent of silver!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.44","40 Now it was: your servant was facing here and there,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.45",and then he was no more!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.46",The king of Israel said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.47",Correct is your judgment: you yourself have decided.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.48","41 Quickly he removed the covering from over his eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.49","and the king of Israel recognized him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.50",that he was of the prophets.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.51",42 He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.52",Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.53","Because you sent free the man, one devoted-to-destruction by me, from [your] hand,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.54","it will be your life in place of his life,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.55",and your people in place of his people!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.56",43 The king of Israel went back to his house sullen and enraged;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.57",thus he came to Shomeron.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.58",21:1 Now after these events it was:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.59","A vineyard belonged to Navot the Yizre’elite that was in Yizre’el,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.60",next to the Great-House of Ah’av king in Shomeron.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.61","2 And Ah’av spoke to Navot, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.62","Give me your vineyard, that it may be a garden of greens for me"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.63","—for it is nearby, next to my house—"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.64","and I will give you, in its place, a vineyard better than it;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.65","[or] if it is better in your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.66",I will give you silver for the price of this one.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.67",3 But Navot said to Ah’av:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.68",Y<small>HWH</small> forbid for me
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.69",from my giving over the inheritance of my fathers to you!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.70",4 Ah’av came back to his house sullen and enraged
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.71",over the word that Navot the Yizre’elite had spoken to him
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.72",when he said: I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.73",He lay down on his couch and turned away his face and would not eat food.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.74",5 And Izevel his wife came to him
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.75",and spoke to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.76",Now why is your spirit so sullen
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.77",that you do not eat food?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.78",6 He spoke to her:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.79",Because I spoke to Navot the Yizre’elite;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.80",I said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.81","Give me your vineyard for silver,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.82","or, if you like,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.83",I will give you a vineyard in its place—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.84",yet he said: I will not give you my vineyard!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.85",7 Izevel his wife said to him:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.86","Do <i>you</i>, now, exercise kingship over Israel?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.87","Arise, eat food, that your heart may be in good-humor;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.88",<i>I</i> will give you the vineyard of Navot the Yizre’elite!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.89",8 So she wrote letters in Ah’av’s name
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.90","and sealed [them] with his seal,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.91","and sent the letters to the elders and the freemen who were in his town, those settled with Navot."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.92","9 And she wrote in the letters, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.93",Proclaim a fast
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.94",and seat Navot at the head of the people;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.95",10 then seat two base men in front of him;
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.96","have them testify against him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.97",You cursed God and the king!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.98","Then bring him out and pelt him, so that he dies."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.99","11 So they did, the men of his town"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.100",—the elders and the freemen that were settled in his town—
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.101","as Izevel had sent to them,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.102",as was written in the letters that she had sent to them:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.103",12 they proclaimed a fast
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.104","and seated Navot at the head of the people,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.105",13 and the two base men came and sat in front of him;

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.107",saying:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.108",Navot cursed God and the king!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.109",So they took him outside the town
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.110","and pelted him with stones, and he died."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.111","14 Then they sent to Izevel, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.112","Navot has been pelted, and has died."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.113","15 Now it was, when Izevel heard that Navot had been pelted, and had died,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.114",that Izevel said to Ah’av:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.115","Arise, take possession"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.116",of the vineyard of Navot the Yizre’elite
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.117","which he refused to give to you for silver,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.118","for Navot is not alive,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.119",for he is dead!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.120","16 It was, when Ah’av heard that Navot was dead,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.121","that Ah’av arose to go down to the vineyard of Navot the Yizre’elite, to take possession of it."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.122","17 But the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Eliyyahu the Tishbite, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.135","42 <b>Because you sent free …:</b> The king is condemned here for sparing his enemy, which violated certain biblical views on warfare. In this, he is paralleled to Sha’ul (King Saul), who lost his throne over this issue in I Sam. 15. <b>devoted-to-destruction:</b> Others, “under the ban,” reserved for Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.136",21:1 <b>Navot:</b> Pronounced <i>nah-VOTE;</i> trad. English “Naboth.” It may mean “shoot” (of a plant). The Bible frequently compares human mortality to the transitory nature of plant growth. <b>Great-House:</b> Palace.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.137","2 <b>Give me:</b> Here, as in some other biblical passages, the verb has the connotation of “sell.” <b>my house:</b> Likewise, the palace."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.138","4 <b>turned away his face:</b> In II Kings 20:2, Hizkiyyahu (Hezekiah) is similarly described, indicating that he is ready to die (Walsh)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.139","6 <b>I will not give you my vineyard!:</b> Not surprisingly, Ah’av omits Navot’s emphasis on “the inheritance of my fathers.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.140","7 <b>Do <i>you</i>, now, exercise kingship over Israel?:</b> JPS reads, “Now is the time to show yourself king,” but the Hebrew seems to imply a more sarcastic tone."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.141","8 <b>freemen:</b> A different root than the one used as “free” in v.21. Others, “nobles.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.142",10 <b>cursed:</b> Lit. “blessed”; ancient scribes did not wish to use the direct word for “cursed” in reference to God. The same construction occurs in the first two chapters of Job. <b>pelt him:</b> With stones.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.143","13 <b>pelted him:</b> The mention of the incident in II Kings 9:25-26 includes Navot’s sons as well, thus solving Ah’av’s problem of heirs surviving to claim the property."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21.144",18 <b>meet:</b> Or “confront.”
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.1","War with Aram and the Death of Ah’av: In an earlier stage of the development of Kings, this chapter undoubtedly followed Chap. 20. In addition, the use of the term “king of Israel” instead of “Ah’av” or “King Ah’av” has led some scholars to theorize that the figure described here originally referred to another monarch. This is further supported by v.40’s description of Ah’av’s death in normal terms, as opposed to his falling in battle."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.2","In our discussion of the structure of Kings above (p. 551), we noted that this section of the book is concerned with the relationship between kings and prophets. Chap. 22 introduces a whole new cast of the latter, both in plural and in singular, and poses a question that is raised a number of times in the Bible: How does one know if a prophet is a “true” one or a false one? The Judahite king Yehoshafat’s initial query about the outcome of the imminent battle meets with enthusiastic predictions from a large group of professional prophets, but their answer somehow does not satisfy the king; perhaps he understands their function as “yes men.” He summons instead a prophet known to be contrary—not Eliyyahu, but a certain Mikhayhu—who proceeds first to lie, but finally reveals that Ah’av will die in the battle. The result of this revelation is Mikhayhu’s receiving a slap from one of the onlooking court prophets, and then his imprisonment."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.3","In the second part of the chapter (vv.29ff.), Ah’av meets his fate. Despite a desperate attempt to outwit the enemy by discarding his royal garb while encouraging his Judahite ally not to do so, he is hit by an Aramean arrow. Propped up in the chariot in the heat of the battle, he bleeds to death."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.4","The Ah’av who may be teased from history appears to have been more accomplished than the Bible gives him credit for. While the text hints at some building projects (v.39), archaeology credits him with more, including probably the so-called stables at Megiddo. Of equal significance is the fact that he was a participant in the important battle at Qarqar, where the burgeoning Assyrian Empire apparently suffered a temporary setback. For the book of Kings, however, the account of Navot’s framing is of much greater import, and there is no hint there of Qarqar, in an excellent example of the Bible’s attitude toward what we call history. Thus Ah’av is judged by standards other than political ones, and, regardless of his actual accomplishments, he has been effectively frozen for all time as the Baal-tolerating king of Israel, Izevel’s husband, and Eliyyahu’s opponent. It is intriguing, but not entirely unexpected, that Melville appropriated his name for the captain of the <i>Pequod</i>, who makes a virtual idol of his desire for revenge."

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.60","I am as you are: my fighting-people as your fighting-people, my horses as your horses!"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.61",5 And Yehoshafat said to the king of Israel:

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.108",and Y<small>HWH</small> said: There are no masters for these.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.109",Let each return to his house in peace!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.110",18 The king of Israel said to Yehoshafat:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.111",Did I not say to you:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.112","He never prophesies for good concerning me, but only for evil?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.113",19 He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.114","Therefore, hearken to the word of Y<small>HWH:</small>"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.115","I saw Y<small>HWH</small> sitting on his throne,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.117",20 and Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.118",Who will entice Ah’av
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.119",so that he will go up and fall at Ramot-Gil’ad?
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.120","And this one said thusly, while that one said thusly."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.121",21 Then a spirit came out and stood in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.122",and said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.123",<i>I</i> will entice him.

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.126",22 He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.127",I will go out and be a false spirit
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.128",in the mouth of all his prophets.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.129",He said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.130","You will entice [him], aye, you will prevail."

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.138",25 Mikhayhu said:

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.140",when you enter a room within a room to hide!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.141",26 The king of Israel said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.142",Take Mikhayhu
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.143","and turn him over to Amon, commander of the town, and to Yoash, the son of the king;"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.144",27 you are to say:

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.146","Put this one in the prison house and have him eat meager bread and meager water,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.147",until I return in peace.

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.149","If you return, yes, return in peace,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.150",Y<small>HWH</small> has not spoken through me!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.151",And he said:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.152","Hearken, O peoples, all of them …"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.153",29 The king of Israel and Yehoshafat king of Judah went up to Ramot-Gil’ad.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.154",30 And the king of Israel said to Yehoshafat:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.155","[I] will disguise [myself] and come to battle,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.156","but you, clothe yourself in your [royal] garments."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.157",So the king of Israel disguised himself and came to battle.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.158","31 Now the king of Aram had charged the chariot officers belonging to him,"

"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.170",and struck the king of Israel between the connecting-plates and the armor.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.171",He said to his chariot driver:
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.172","Reverse your hand and take me out of the camp,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22.173",for I have been wounded!

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.1","Eliyyahu and Ahazyahu: The text returns to Eliyyahu and his marvelous powers. It begins with a king who is ill and thus in need of an oracle; quickly the issue becomes, as previously in Chap. 18, whether to rely upon YHWH or upon Baal. King Ahazyahu unhesitatingly turns to the pagan god, and as a result he is condemned to die on his sickbed."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.2","Beyond the prophetic word, we are given another demonstration of Eliyyahu’s ability to call down fire from heaven. In this case, the “sacrifice” is two army commanders and their bands of fifty soldiers (tellingly, we recall that Eliyyahu serves “Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High”); the third commander, like Ovadyahu in Chap. 17 above, successfully pleads with the prophet. It is all a continuation of Eliyyahu’s (really, God’s) power over life and death, a theme that permeates the entire cycle of stories."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.3","The repetition of refrains relating to the king (“Is it because there is no God in Israel whose word [one] can consult?”; “the bed into which you climbed up,” etc.) serves to underscore the prophet’s condemnation of idolatry, which even more than the folktale/miraculous aspect is the key to the stories here."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.4","Interestingly, in v.8 we are given one of the few physical descriptions of a central biblical character: Eliyyahu is “a hairy man, / with a girded-belt of leather girded about his loins.” The description befits his folkloristic character. He is an elemental figure who in his very appearance brings out the struggle between the powerless and those who rule."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.5",1:1 And Moav rebelled against Israel after the death of Ah’av.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.6","2 Now Ahazya fell through the lattice of his upper-chamber that was in Shomeron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.7",and he became sick [from his injuries].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.8","So he sent messengers, and said to them:"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.10",whether I will live through this sickness!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.11",3 Now a messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Eliyya the Tishbite:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.37",and spoke these words to you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.38",8 They said to him:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.40",with a girded-belt of leather girded about his loins.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.41",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.42",It is Eliyya the Tishbite!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.43","9 So he sent to him a captain of fifty, with his [unit of] fifty."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.44","He went up to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.45","and here, he was sitting on top of a hill;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.46",and he spoke to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.47","O man of God, the king has spoken:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.48",Come down!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.49",10 Eliyyahu answered
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.50",and spoke to the captain of fifty:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.51","Now if I am a man of God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.52",let fire come down from the heavens
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.53",and consume you and your fifty!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.54",And fire came down from the heavens
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.55",and consumed him and his fifty.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.56",11 He sent again to him—another captain of fifty and his fifty;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.57",he went up and spoke to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.58","O man of God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.59",thus says the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.60",Come down quickly!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.61",12 Eliyya answered and spoke to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.62","If I am a man of God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.63",let fire come down from the heavens
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.64",and consume you and your fifty!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.65",And fire of God came down from the heavens
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.66",and consumed him and his fifty.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.67",13 He sent again—a third captain of fifty and his fifty;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.68","he went up and came, the third captain of fifty,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.69",but he bowed on his knees in front of Eliyyahu
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.70",and pleaded with him
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.71",and spoke to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.72","O man of God, now may my life and the life of these your fifty servants be precious in your eyes!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.73","14 [For] here, fire came down from the heavens"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.74",and consumed the previous captains of fifty and their fifties;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.75","but now, may my life be precious in your eyes!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.76",15 Then a messenger of God spoke to Eliyyahu:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.77",Go down with him; do not be afraid before him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.78",So he arose and went down with him to the king.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.79",16 And he spoke to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.80",Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.81","Because you sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zevuv, the God of Ekron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.82",—Is it because there is no God in Israel whose word can be inquired of?—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.83","therefore,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.84","the bed into which you climbed up,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.87","17 And he died, in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that Eliyyahu had spoken,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.88","and Yehoram reigned as king in his place,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.90",for he had no son.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.93",_____________
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.94","1:1 <b>rebelled:</b> See note to I Kings 12:19, above. Moav’s rebellion will resurface in Chap. 3."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.95","2 <b>became sick [from his injuries]:</b> Biblical Hebrew does not make a distinction between illness and injury, the latter of which is clearly meant here. <b>Baal Zevuv/Master of Flies:</b> Pronounced <i>ze-VOOV.</i> The name is a nasty pun on “Baal Zevul,” “Baal the Exalted,” commonly found in Ugaritic texts. See the name “Izevel” in I Kings 16:31, for a possible similar usage. The trad. English for the name is “Baal-zebub,” which in later Jewish and then Christian tradition became Beelzebub, a significant demon and eventually a nickname for the Devil. <b>Ekron:</b> Pronounced <i>eh-KROHN.</i> One of the five major Philistine towns."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.96",3 <b>Eliyya:</b> A shortened variant of Eliyyahu.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.97",5 <b>to him:</b> To the king.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.98","8 <b>hairy:</b> Heb. <i>baal se’ar</i>, “possessing (much) hair,” echoing “Baal Zevuv” (Cohn 2000). It is not clear whether the text means a hairy man or merely one wearing animal skins. <b>leather:</b> Lit. “[animal] skin.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.99",9 <b>captain of fifty:</b> Head of a defined military unit. The term was common in the ancient Near East.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.100","10 <b>man … fire:</b> Martin notes the sound play here, which continues throughout the chapter: <i>ish</i> and <i>esh.</i> <b>heavens:</b> In the usual biblical sense of “the sky” (and not the abode of the blessed dead, as in later concepts)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.101","12 <b>fire of God:</b> The phrase “X of God” is frequently used to express the superlative in the Bible (as in Gen. 35:5, I Sam. 26:12)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.102","13 <b>went up:</b> Heb. <i>va-yaal</i>, following LXX; MT has <i>vayaan</i>, “spoke up.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1.103","17 <b>Yehoram:</b> Some versions insert “his brother” after the name. Note that the text cites two kings with the same name, north and south."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.1","Eliyyahu’s Ascent and Elisha’s Succession: With a majesty that foreshadows such legendary heroes as King Arthur (Gaster), Eliyyahu’s end is one of the most memorable in the Bible. It is fully fitting for one whose life has been consistently mysterious and majestic."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.2","In a somewhat surprising narrative move, the manner of his death is revealed in the chapter’s opening verse. This has the effect of shifting the reader’s focus from the fantastic to what the text regards as key: first, the relationship between the prophet and his forerunner Moshe, and second, the one between him and his suecessor Elisha. The former has already been strongly suggested by Eliyyahu’s Sinai experience in Chap. 19 above, and is strengthened in our chapter by his splitting of the waters of the Jordan and his disappearance. (Cohn [2000] notes how the site of Moshe’s grave is unknown as well.) Eliyyahu’s relationship to Elisha—in particular, his passing of the literal mantle of authority—takes up most of the chapter. And this is the only place in the Hebrew Bible where a prophet gets to appoint his successor. As Cohn points out, the narrative is arranged chiastically, with Eliyyahu’s ascent at the center, but with Elisha prominent on either side. The reader is thus assured (along with Elisha’s immediate performing of Eliyyahu-like miracles) that the younger man will be the worthy successor to the older one. This is further supported by the final episode, where the prophet brings down a terrible curse on his young tormentors, parallel to what Eliyyahu had done to King Ahazyahu’s soldiers. Burnett has suggested that the traditional understanding of the taunters as little children may well be wrong, sadly for artists over the centuries; instead, he argues, they are like the “youngsters” in I Kings 12, Rehav’am’s immature counselors, in this case probably young men attached to the royal or even religious establishment at the previously delegitimized shrine at Bet-El. In this reading, the taunt “Go up … Go up!” might also be reflecting Eliyyahu’s death, suggesting that Elisha should go the way of his master. So the episode demonstrates not only that the prophet possesses or at least represents powers that are not to be tampered with, but also sets him against the powers that be, a scenario that was central to the Eliyyahu stories and which occurs frequently in the Hebrew Bible."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.3","Regardless of the age of the victims, however, already in Roman times Jews and Christians found this story troubling."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.4","2:1 Now it was,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.5","when Y<small>HWH</small> was about to bring up Eliyyahu in a storm to the heavens,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.6",that Eliyyahu went with Elisha from Gilgal.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.7",2 And Eliyyahu said to Elisha:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.8","Pray stay here,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.9",for Y<small>HWH</small> has sent me as far as Bet-El.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.10",Elisha said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.11","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> and by your own life, if I should leave you … !"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.12",So they went down to Bet-El.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.13",3 And the Sons of the Prophets who were in Bet-El came out to Elisha
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.14",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.15",Do you know
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.16",that today Y<small>HWH</small> is going to take your lord from your head?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.17",He said:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.19",4 Eliyyahu said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.20","Elisha, pray stay here,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.21",for Y<small>HWH</small> has sent me to Jericho.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.22",But he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.23","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> and by your own life, if I should leave you … !"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.24",So they came to Jericho.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.25",5 And the Sons of the Prophets who were in Jericho came close to Elisha
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.26",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.27",Do you know
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.28",that today Y<small>HWH</small> is going to take your lord from your head?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.29",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.30",Certainly I know; be silent!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.31",6 Then Eliyyahu said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.32","Pray stay here,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.33",for Y<small>HWH</small> has sent me to the Jordan.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.34",But he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.35","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> and by your own life, if I should leave you … !"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.36",Thus the two of them walked on.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.37",7 Now fifty men of the Sons of the Prophets went
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.38","and stood opposite, at a distance,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.39",while the two of them stood by the Jordan.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.40","8 And Eliyyahu took his mantle, folded it up, and struck the waters,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.41","and they split in half, to here and to there,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.42",and the two of them crossed over on dry-ground.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.43",9 It was when they crossed that Eliyyahu said to Elisha:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.44",Make-request: what may I do for you before I am taken from beside you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.45",Elisha said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.46",Pray let a twofold measure of your spirit be upon me!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.47",10 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.48",You have made a difficult request.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.49","If you see me being taken from you, it will be thus for you,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.53","they parted the two of them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.54",and Eliyyahu went up in the storm to the heavens.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.55","12 When Elisha saw [it],"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.59","So he took hold of his garments and tore them into two torn-pieces,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.60",13 and picked up the mantle of Eliyyahu that had fallen from him;

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.66",He struck the waters
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.67","and they split in half, to here and to there,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.68",and Elisha crossed over.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.69",15 And the Sons of the Prophets who were in Jericho saw him opposite;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.70",they said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.71",The spirit of Eliyyahu has come to rest upon Elisha!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.72","They came to meet him and bowed low before him to the ground,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.73",16 and they said to him:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.75","pray let them go and seek your lord,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.76",lest the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> has carried him off
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.77",and has thrown him onto one of the mountains or into one of the valleys!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.78",But he said:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.84",but they did not find him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.85",18 They returned to him
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.86",—he was staying in Jericho—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.87",and he said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.88",Did I not say to you: Do not go?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.89",19 The men of the town said to Elisha:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.90","Now here, the site of the town is good, as my lord can see,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.91","but the water is bad, and the land causes miscarrying!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.92",_____________
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.93","2:1 <b>storm:</b> Others, “whirlwind.” This phenomenon is often associated with the appearance of God in the Bible, most famously and dramatically in Job 38:1. <b>Gilgal:</b> The term for a “round place” of stones or a round platform, this particular one is probably not the significant one near Jericho (see Josh. 4:19), but a site in a central location of the Northern Kingdom."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.94",3 <b>Sons of the Prophets:</b> See note to I Kings 20:35. <b>from your head:</b> The phrase describes the master-servant relationship here (Cogan/Tadmor).
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.95",6 <b>Thus the two of them walked on:</b> Reminiscent of the pregnant “Thus the two of them walked on together” in the Avraham/Yitzhak (Abraham/Isaac) story of Gen. 22.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.96","8 <b>folded:</b> A rare biblical word, meaning more precisely “wrapped.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.97","11 <b>walking:</b> Also in the sense of an auxiliary verb that conveys repetition—for example, “going along and speaking,” meaning “continuing to speak.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.98","12 <b>Israel’s chariotry and its horsemen!:</b> Elisha appears to be equating Eliyyahu with the entire army, as if to suggest that the prophet is the people’s true strength."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2.99","14 <b>Where is Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> He equates the disappearance of his master with a rupture in divine-human communication. <b>indeed:</b> An oft-used emendation from <i>’af hu</i>, “even he,” to <i>efo</i>. No good solution has been found to this awkward sentence."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.1","Israel and Moav: This is a classic Kings text, with international events—in this case, the political and military interactions of three territories—understood in the light of prophecy. As if three kings were not enough participants in the events, the prophet serves as mediator, and is (in v.11) immediately identified as Eliyyahu’s disciple. We are even given insight into the prophetic process, at least in one manifestation: it is induced by string music (v.15). As in the Eliyyahu stories, water also plays a role here, but with the striking twist that, through the illusion of the rising sun’s reflection, the water is taken to be blood."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.2","It has long been noted that while the prophet predicts Moav’s defeat, this did not happen historically. Modern commentators therefore see in the chapter’s strange and ambiguous end an attempt to square the discrepancy."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.3",20 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.4",Fetch me a new bowl and put salt there.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.5",They fetched [it] for him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.6",21 He went out to the outflow of the waters
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.7","and threw salt in it,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.8",and he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.9",Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.10",I have healed these waters;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.11",there will no longer be death and miscarrying from there!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.12","22 And the waters were healed, until this very day,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.13",in accordance with the word of Elisha which he had spoken.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.14",23 He went up from there to Bet-El.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.15","And as he was going up on the road, some young lads went up out of the town;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.16",they jeered at him and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.17","Go up, baldhead! Go up, baldhead!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.18",24 He faced about behind him and saw them
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.19","and cursed them in the name of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.20",and two she-bears came out of the forest
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.21",and ripped up forty-two youngsters from them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.22","25 He went from there to Mount Carmel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.23",and from there he returned to Shomeron.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.24",3:1 Now Yehoram son of Ah’av became king over Israel in Shomeron
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.25",in year eighteen of Yehoshafat king of Judah;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.26",he reigned as king for twelve years.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.27","2 And he did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.28",although not like his father or like his mother:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.29",he removed the standing-stone of Baal that his father had made
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.30","3 —although he clung to the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat, who had caused Israel to sin,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.31",and did not turn aside from them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.32",4 Now Mesha king of Moav was a sheep-dealer;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.33",he would supply the king of Israel with a hundred thousand he-lambs and a hundred thousand rams in wool.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.34","5 But it was, at the death of Ah’av,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.35",that the king of Moav rebelled against the king of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.36",6 And King Yehoram went out on that very day from Shomeron
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.37",and counted all Israel [for war];
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.38","7 he went and sent to Yehoshafat king of Judah, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.39",The king of Moav has rebelled against me.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.40",Will you go with me to Moav in battle?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.41",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.42",I will go up!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.43",[For] I am as you are:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.44","my people as your people,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.45",my horses as your horses!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.46",8 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.47",By which road shall we go up?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.48",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.49",The Road of the Wilderness of Edom.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.50","9 So they went, the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.51",they [traveled] round about the road for seven days.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.52","Now there was no water for the camp or for the animals that were behind them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.53",10 so the king of Israel said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.54","Alas,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.55",for Y<small>HWH</small> must have called these three kings together
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.56",to give them into the hand of Moav!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.57",11 Yehoshafat said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.58",Is there no prophet of Y<small>HWH</small> here
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.59",that we may inquire of Y<small>HWH</small> through him?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.60",One of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.61","Here is Elisha son of Shafat,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.62",who poured water over the hands of Eliyyahu.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.63",12 Yehoshafat said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.64",With him is the word of Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.65","And so they went down to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.66","the king of Israel, and Yehoshafat, and the king of Edom."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.67",13 Elisha said to the king of Israel:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.68",What have I to do with you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.69",Go to your father’s prophets and to your mother’s prophets!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.70",The king of Israel said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.71",No—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.72",for Y<small>HWH</small> has called these three kings together
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.73",to give them into the hand of Moav!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.74",14 Elisha said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.75","By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, in whose presence I stand,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.76","indeed: were it not that I hold up the face of Yehoshafat king of Judah [in respect],"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.77","I would not look at you, I would not see you!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.78","15 So-now, fetch me a [lyre] strummer!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.79","For it was, when the strummer strummed,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.80",that the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> would [come] upon him—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.81",16 and he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.82",Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.83","This wadi will produce ditches upon ditches,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.84",17 for thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.85","You will not see wind, you will not see showers,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.86","yet that wadi will be filled with water,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.87",and you and your cattle and your animals will drink!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.88",18 And this is [but] a light matter in Y<small>HWH</small>’s eyes;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.89",he will give Moav into your hand.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.90","19 You will strike every fortified town and every choice town,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.91","every good tree you will fell,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.92","and every spring of water you will stop up,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.93",and every good plot-of-land you will mar with stones!

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3.108","19 <b>mar:</b> Lit., “cause pain.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.1","Tales of Elisha: Elisha’s status is further enhanced by a series of stories, long and short, that typify miracle tales and directly parallel his master Eliyyahu’s deeds. The text starts with another food multiplication story (see I 17). The variation is that this time the food is to be used not to feed the hungry but to pay off a debt. The “revival of the son” account that follows (vv.8–37) includes the familiar motif of a childless couple and an unexpected birth. Like Yitzhak (Isaac) in Genesis, the son is immediately in peril, and in fact dies. The story here is a much fuller one than the parallel episode involving Eliyyahu in I Kings 17; we get a sense of extended interaction between the woman and the prophet, and the addition of his servant (who, somewhat unexpectedly, is named). This time, when the child is brought back to life, there is no need for the woman to verbally confirm that Elisha is a man of God, for that, by now, is obvious to characters and readers alike. Amid the human interactions, however, it should not be forgotten that Elisha, through his life-giving actions in this story, continues the polemic against Baal that had begun with the tales of his master (Sweeney 2007)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.2","Returning to the theme of food, the next story (vv.38–41) utilizes a motif found previously with Moshe (Exod. 16:22–26) and Elisha himself (2:19–22), with the variation that here it is stew which is “healed,” whereas previously it had been naturally occurring water."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.3","As usual, the different episodes are not strung together randomly. As Fishbane notes, they are linked by means of props, personae, and the child and by actions: shutting the door and the fulfillment of the prophet’s request, “What can I/we do for you?” He also points out a series of untranslatable puns, such as <i>mi-neshei</i> (“from the wives”) and <i>ha-nosheh</i> (“a creditor”) in v.1. All this is evidence of possible oral folk composition, and the chapter simultaneously presents aspects of what scholars term “popular religion,” such as the consulting of a holy man on matters of bodily or economic well-being."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.4","The chapter ends much as it began, with another account of “stretching” food, this time to feed not only a family but a large group."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.5","20 It was at daybreak, at about the [time of] offering up the grain-gift,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.6","that here, water was coming from the direction of Edom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.7",and the land filled up with water.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.8",21 Now all Moav had heard
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.9","that the kings were coming up to do battle against them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.10","and they were summoned,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.11","from all those belting on a sword-belt and upward,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.12",and they stood at the border.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.13","22 They started early in the morning,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.14","when the sun rose over the water,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.15","and Moav saw, from a distance, water red as blood."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.16",23 So they said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.17",This is blood!—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.18","the kings have been put-to-the-sword, yes, the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.19",each one has struck down his fellow!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.20","So-now, to the spoils, O Moav!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.21","24 They came to the camp of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.22","but Israel arose and struck Moav, so that they fled before them;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.23","they came against it, to strike down Moav:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.24","25 the towns they wrecked,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.25","and into every good plot-of-land each one threw his stone, and filled it up,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.26",while every source of water they stopped up
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.27","and every good tree they felled,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.28",until [only] its stones in Kir-Hareset were left—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.29",but the slingers surrounded [it] and struck it down.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.30","26 And the king of Moav saw that the battle was too strong for him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.31","so he took with him seven hundred men drawing the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.32","to break through to the king of Edom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.33",but they could not prevail.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.34","27 So he took his firstborn son, who was to become king in his place,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.35",and offered him up as an offering-up on the wall.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.36","And a great wrath was upon Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.37",so that they had to march away from him and return to the land.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.38","4:1 Now a woman from the wives of the Sons of the Prophets cried out to Elisha, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.39","Your servant, my husband, is dead."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.40",You yourself know
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.41",that your servant held Y<small>HWH</small> in awe.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.42",But a creditor has come to take away my two children as slaves for himself!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.43",2 Elisha said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.44","What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.45",She said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.46",Your handmaid has nothing at all in the house
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.47",except for a cruse of oil.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.48",3 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.49","Go, borrow vessels for yourself from outside, from all your neighbors, empty vessels"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.50",—do not skimp—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.51","4 and come in, close the door behind you and behind your children,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.52","and pour [oil] into all these vessels,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.53",while the full ones set aside.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.54",5 So she went from him and closed the door behind her and behind her sons;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.55","as they were bringing them to her, she kept on pouring."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.56","6 And it was, when the vessels were filled up, that she said to her son:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.57",Bring me another vessel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.58",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.59",There is no other vessel!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.60",And the oil stopped.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.61",7 Then she came and told the man of God.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.62",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.63","Go, sell the oil"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.64",and pay off your debt;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.65",you and your children will live on the rest.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.66","8 Now it was, one day, that Elisha traveled to Shunem."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.67","There was a prominent woman there,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.68",and she urged him strongly to eat food [with her].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.69","So it would be, whenever he traveled by, he would turn aside there to eat food."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.70",9 She said to her husband:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.71","Now here, you know"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.72","that he is a holy man of God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.73",passing by us regularly.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.74",10 Now let us make him a little walled upper-chamber
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.75","and let us put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp there for him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.76","so that it may be, whenever he comes to us, he may turn aside there."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.77","11 And it was one day that he came there,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.78",and he turned aside to the upper-chamber and lay down there.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.79",12 He said to Gehazi his serving-lad:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.80",Call this Shunammite!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.81","He called her, and she stood before him."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.82",13 He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.83",Now say to her:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.84","Here, you have taken the trouble for us, all this trouble;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.85",what can be done for you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.86","Might you be spoken about to the king, or to the commander of the armed-forces?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.87",She said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.88",Among my own kinspeople I reside.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.89",14 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.90",So what can be done for her?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.91",Gehazi said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.92","Well, she has no son, and her husband is old."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.93",15 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.94",Call her.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.95","And he called her, and she stood in the entrance."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.96",16 Then he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.97","At this set season, when time revives,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.98",you will embrace a son!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.99",She said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.100","Do not, my lord, O man of God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.101",do not lie to your handmaid!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.102","17 But the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.103","at that set season, when time revived,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.104",as Elisha had spoken to her.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.105",18 And the boy grew.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.106","Now it was one day, that he went out to his father, to the reapers,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.107","19 and he said to his father: My head, my head!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.108",He said to a serving-lad:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.109",Carry him to his mother!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.110",20 So he carried him and brought him to his mother;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.111","he sat on her knees until noon,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.112",and then he died.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.113","21 She went up and lay him down upon the bed of the man of God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.114","closed [the door] on him, and went out."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.115",22 Then she called to her husband and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.116","Now send me one of the lads and one of the she-asses,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.117",that I may run out to the man of God and then return.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.118",23 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.119",For-what-reason must you be going to him today?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.120","It is not New-Moon, it is not the Sabbath."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.121",She said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.122",[All] is well.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.123",24 But she saddled the she-ass and said to her serving-lad:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.124","Lead and go,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.125",do not stop me from riding unless I say [so] to you.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.126",25 So she went
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.127","and came to the man of God, to Mount Carmel."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.128","It was, when the man of God saw her at a distance,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.129",that he said to Gehazi his serving-lad:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.130",Here is that Shunammite.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.131","26 So-now, pray run to meet her and say to her:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.132",Is it well with you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.133",Is it well with your husband?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.134",Is it well with the child?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.135",She said: It is well.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.136","27 She came to the man of God, to the mountain,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.137",and she took hold of him by the feet;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.138","Gehazi approached to push her away,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.139",but the man of God said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.140","Leave her be, for her feelings are bitter within her,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.141",yet Y<small>HWH</small> has concealed it from me and has not told me.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.142",28 She said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.143",Did I request a son from my lord?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.144",Did I not say: Do not set me [too much] at ease?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.145",29 He said to Gehazi:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.146","Gird up your loins,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.147","take my rod in your hand, and go."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.148","If you encounter a man, you are not to bless him [in greeting];"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.149","you are to answer no man,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.150","and if any man blesses you [in greeting],"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.151",you are not to answer him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.152",But put my rod on the face of the lad.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.153",30 The mother of the lad said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.154","As Y<small>HWH</small> lives and as you live, if I should leave you … !"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.155",He arose and went after her.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.156","31 Meanwhile Gehazi crossed over ahead of them and put the rod on the face of the lad,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.157","but there was no sound and no attention,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.158","so she returned to meet him and said to him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.159",The lad did not wake up!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.160","32 Elisha came into the house,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.161","and here, the lad was dead, lying on his bed."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.162",33 He came in and closed the door behind the two of them
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.163","and prayed to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.164",34 then he climbed up and lay down atop the child;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.165","he put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his palms on his palms,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.166","and bent over him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.167",and the flesh of the child became warm.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.168","35 He turned away and went through the house, once here and once there,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.169",then he climbed up and bent over him;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.170",the lad sneezed seven times
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.171",and the lad opened his eyes!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.172",36 He called Gehazi and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.173",Call this Shunammite!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.174","He called her and she came to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.175",and he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.176",Lift up your son!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.177","37 She came and flung herself at his feet, and bowed low to the ground;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.178",then she lifted up her son and went out.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.179","38 When Elisha returned to Gilgal,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.180",there was famine in the land.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.181",Now the Sons of the Prophets were sitting before him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.182",And he said to his serving-lad:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.183","Set on the large pot,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.184",and cook stew for the Sons of the Prophets.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.185","39 One [of them] went out into the field to gather herbs,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.186",and he came across a field vine
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.187","and gathered field gourds from it, [enough] to fill his garment."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.188","Then he came back and split them into the pot of stew,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.189",for he did not know [what they were].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.190","40 Now they were poured out for the men to eat,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.191","but it was, just as they ate them from the stew,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.192",that they cried out and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.193","There is death in the pot, O man of God!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.194",and they could not eat it.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.195",41 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.196",Then fetch some meal! …
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.197",And he threw it into the pot
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.198",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.199","Pour some for the people, so that they may eat!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.200",And then there was nothing evil in the pot.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.201",42 A man came from Baal Shalisha;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.202",he brought to the man of God bread of the firstfruits:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.203",twenty bread-loaves of barley and ears of fresh grain.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.204",And he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.205","Give some to the people, that they may eat!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.206",43 His attendant said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.207",How can I give this before a hundred persons?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.208",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.209","Give some to the people, so that they may eat!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.210",For thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.211",They will eat and have some left over.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.212",_____________

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.218","27 <b>wrath:</b> The situation is unclear, since the text seems to slip into a Moabite perspective, namely that the human sacrifice works and the Moabite god triumphs. The effect of the passage is to deny the Israelites a complete victory under an Omride king (Cogan/Tadmor, quoting D. N. Freedman)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.219","4:1 <b>cried out:</b> Lodged a formal appeal. <b>take away … as slaves:</b> The practice of indentured servitude was widespread in the ancient Near East, and it is this, rather than chattel slavery (such as later existed in America and elsewhere), that is the more common form in the Bible."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.223","16 <b>when time revives:</b> Next year.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.224","23 <b>New-Moon:</b> In biblical Israel, the New Moon was a significant religious occasion, involving a sacred meal with family and a visit to a holy man (such as I Sam. 20:6) and/or a shrine (I Sam. 1)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4.225",25 <b>Mount Carmel:</b> The scene of Eliyyahu’s great victory over the prophets of Baal in I Kings 18.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.1","Elisha and Naaman: The Bible revels in stories in which a foreigner acknowledges or comes to acknowledge the God of Israel (for example, Bil’am [Balaam] in Num. 22–24 and Rahav in Josh. 2:6), and the present chapter is another example. Elisha’s initial motive in curing Naaman’s disease is “that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel” (v.8), but here, as elsewhere in these stories, recognizing the prophet’s power is basically the same as acknowledging God’s, as Naaman confirms in vv.15 and 17."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.2","The second part of the story, in which Elisha’s servant Gehazi attempts to obtain for himself Naaman’s present of gratitude, which the prophet had refused, again demonstrates Elisha’s power. The prophet somehow knows what Gehazi has done, despite the latter’s denial, and the disease that had been removed from Naaman now cleaves to Gehazi—not temporarily, as is usual in the Bible (see Lev. 13), but, ominously, “for the ages,” down through the family line."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.3","44 So he gave it before them and they ate, and they had some left over, in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.4","5:1 Now Naaman, commander of the armed-forces of the king of Aram, was a man prominent before his lord, one lifted up of face,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.6","But the man, [though] a mighty-one of valor, was stricken-with-<i>tzaraat</i>."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.7","2 Once Aram had gone out in raiding-bands,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.8",and they had taken a young girl captive from the land of Israel;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.9",she was [in service] before Naaman’s wife.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.10",3 She said to her mistress:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.11",Would that my lord were [standing] before the prophet who is in Shomeron—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.12",then he would cure him of his <i>tzaraat</i>!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.13","4 He came back and told his lord, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.14",Like this and like that spoke the girl who is from the land of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.15",5 The king of Aram said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.16","Go, come [then]—I will send a letter to the king of Israel."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.17","He went and took in his hand ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten sets of garments,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.18",6 and he brought the letter to the king of Israel [which] said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.19","So-now, when this letter reaches you,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.20","here, I am sending you Naaman my servant,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.21",so that you may cure him of his <i>tzaraat</i>.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.22","7 But it was, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his garments"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.23",and said:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.25",that this one sends [a message] to me to cure a man of his <i>tzaraat?</i>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.26","Indeed, just know and take-note"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.27",of how he is seeking a pretext against me!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.28","8 Now it was, when Elisha the man of God heard"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.29","that the king of Israel had torn his garments,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.30","he sent to the king of Israel, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.31",Why have you torn your garments?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.32","Just have him come to me,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.33",that he may know
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.34",that there is a prophet in Israel!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.35","9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.36",and stood at the entrance to the house belonging to Elisha.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.37","10 And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.38",Go and wash seven times in the Jordan;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.39","then your flesh will be restored to you, and you will be purified."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.40",11 But Naaman became furious and went away;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.41",he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.42","Here, I had said to myself:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.43","He will come out, yes, out, and stand [there] to call on the name of Y<small>HWH</small> his god,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.44","then he will raise his hand over the diseased-spot, and take away the <i>tzaraat</i>."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.45","12 Are not the Amana and the Parpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.46",Could I not wash in them and be purified?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.47",He turned and went away in hot-anger.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.48","13 But his servants approached and spoke to him, they said:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.49","If it were a hard thing that the prophet spoke to you, would you not do it?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.50","How much more so, when he said to you: Wash and be purified!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.51","14 So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, in accordance with the word of the man of God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.52","and his flesh was returned-to-health like a young lad’s flesh,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.53",and he was purified.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.54","15 Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his camp,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.55",and he came and stood before him and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.56","Now here, I know"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.57",that there is no god in all the earth except in Israel!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.58","So-now, pray accept a blessing-gift from your servant!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.59",16 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.60","As Y<small>HWH</small> lives, before whom I stand,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.61",if I should accept [anything] … !
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.62","Now he pressed him to take [it], but he refused."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.63",17 So Naaman said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.64","If not, let there be given to your servant"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.65",a mule team’s load of earth—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.66","for never again will your servant prepare an offering-up or a sacrifice to other gods,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.67",except to Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.68","18 In this [one] matter, may Y<small>HWH</small> pardon your servant:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.69","when my lord comes to the House of Rimmon, to bow down there,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.70","and he leans on my arm, so that I bow down in the House of Rimmon—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.71","when I bow down in the House of Rimmon,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.72",may Y<small>HWH</small> pardon your servant in this matter!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.73",19 He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.74",Go in peace.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.75","And he went from him, a stretch of land [in distance]."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.76","20 And Gehazi, the serving-lad of Elisha the man of God, said [to himself]:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.77","Here, my lord spared this Naaman the Aramean by [not] accepting what he brought from his hand;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.78","by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, I will surely run after him and accept something from him!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.79",21 So Gehazi pursued Naaman;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.80","when Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.81",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.82",Is [all] well?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.83",_____________
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.84","5:1 <b>Naaman:</b> Pronounced <i>nah-ah-MAHN</i>. From a common Semitic root meaning “pleasant.” <b>lifted up of face:</b> Respected, “high in his favor” (JPS). <b>mighty-one of valor:</b> Omitted in LXX. <b><i>tzaraat:</i></b> For centuries translated as “leprosy,” the dreaded Hansen’s disease, but modern scholars understand it as some sort of unsightly but not contagious or serious skin rash. The strong negativity it invokes (see Lev. 13–14) may be due to the common visual deterioration and hence the suggestion of death, which was the great ritual pollutant in the Bible."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.85","3 <b>She said … he would cure him:</b> A young girl knows what the great general does not. <b>cure him:</b> Lit., “gather him back” into society."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.86","6 <b>[which] said:</b> Lit., “saying.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.87","7 <b>this one:</b> With the force of “this guy” (Cohn 2000). <b>pretext:</b> See, similarly, Judg. 14:4."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.88",8 <b>know:</b> Or “acknowledge.”
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.89","10 <b>purified:</b> And thus able to return to the company of society. For priestly rules regarding <i>tzaraat,</i> see Lev. 13–14."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.90","13 <b>If:</b> I follow ancient versions here in eliminating MT’s “Father, …” which seems out of place in addressing a general. Some, however, understand it as “Sir.” <b>hard:</b> Lit., “great, large.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.91","16 <b>if I should accept [anything] … !:</b> Typically, there is to be no profit for the prophet."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.92",17 <b>If not:</b> Or “at least.” <b>load of earth:</b> From his own soil (Martin).
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.93","18 <b>House of Rimmon:</b> The temple of the god Ramman (Baal-Haddad), the “Thunderer,” punned on and denigrated here as <i>rimmon</i>, “pomegranate.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5.94",20 <b>accepting:</b> Or “getting.”
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.1","More Elisha Tales; Israel and Aram: The text continues with the usual pattern of a combination of long and short episodes (Cohn 2000). In the first, Elisha solves a mundane problem, the loss of an ax head in the river, by means of what feels like magic—throwing something (in this case, a piece of wood) into the water."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.2","In the next, longer episode, the miraculous becomes more full-blown, with Elisha able to divine the king of Aram’s private conversations, and subsequently his revealing, in v.17, a mountain “full of horses and chariots of fire.” We are reminded, of course, of Eliyyahu’s end, but equally significant is the image of the prophet as one who, countering the armies of nations, can summon up an army of his own. In fact, all throughout the Elisha cycle, the stories, which are ostensibly about kings, tend to magnify the prophet’s role (see Cohn 2000)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.3","V.24 introduces a more complex narrative, which ominously introduces a note of familial cannibalism in the midst of a siege. The king of Israel reacts by threatening the life of Elisha, who had previously advised him on military matters concerning Aram. Through a long story within a story, a strange tale of four diseased men and the empty camp of Aram, God saves Israel, and the king’s officer, who had doubted Elisha’s promise of relief, is trampled in the rush for food by the townspeople of the besieged Shomeron. Once again, things happen “as the man of God had spoken” (7:17)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.4","All of the above stories are visually vivid (as Cohn 2000 points out, both “seeing” and blindness are prominent), and one can easily imagine them as subjects in classical art, as indeed some of them have been. I can only fantasize about what Pieter Brueghel the Elder, painter of the memorable <i>Parable of the Blind</i>, might have done with the incident concerning the men stricken with <i>tzaraat</i> (7:3–10)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.5",22 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.6",[All] is well.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.7","My lord sent me, saying:"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.9",Pray give them a talent of silver and two sets of garments.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.10",23 Naaman said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.11",Consent [to] accept two talents!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.12","He pressed him, and he wrapped up two talents of silver in two purses, with two sets of garments,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.13","and gave them to his two lads,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.14",and they carried them ahead of him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.15","24 He came to the Ofel/The Bulge,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.16","and he took them from their hand, and deposited them in the house."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.17","Then he sent the men off, and they went away,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.18",25 while he himself came and stood opposite his lord.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.19",Elisha said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.20","From where, Gehazi?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.21",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.22",Your servant has gone neither here nor there.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.23",26 He said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.24","Did not my heart go along, when a man reversed [course] from his chariot to meet you?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.25","[Is this] the time to take silver, to take garments, or olive-groves or vineyards, or flocks or herds, or servants or handmaids?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.26","27 So Naaman’s <i>tzaraat</i>—it will cleave to you and to your seed, for the ages!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.27","And he went out from before him, afflicted with <i>tzaraat</i> like snow."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.28",6:1 [Once] the Sons of the Prophets said to Elisha:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.29","Now here, the place where we are residing before you is too narrow for us."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.30","2 Pray let us go to the Jordan, and let each one take a log from there, and let us construct ourselves there a place to reside."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.31",He said: Go.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.32",3 One [of them] said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.33",Pray consent to go with your servants!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.34",Elisha said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.35",I will go.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.36","4 So he went with them, and they came to the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.37",where they felled some trees.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.38","5 And it was, as one was felling a log, that the iron [ax head] fell into the water;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.39","he cried out and said: Alas, my lord, for it was borrowed!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.40",6 The man of God said: Where did it fall?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.41",He showed him the place.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.42","Then he carved out some wood and threw it in there, and it made the iron float,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.43",7 and he said: Pick it up for yourself.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.44",So he stretched out his hand and took it.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.45",8 Now the king of Aram was waging battle against Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.46","He sought advice from his servants, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.47",Descend on thus and such a place [to attack]!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.48","9 But the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.49","Be careful when crossing by this place,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.50","for there Aram descends [to attack],"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.51","10 The king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God had spoken to him and warned him, so that he took care there,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.52",not [only] once and not [only] twice.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.53","11 And the king of Aram’s heart was in turmoil over this matter,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.54",so he called his servants and said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.55",Will you not tell me:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.56",who from among us is for the king of Israel?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.57",12 One of his servants said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.58","No, my lord king;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.59","but Elisha the prophet, who is in Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.60",tells the king of Israel
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.61",the words that you speak in your [very] bedroom!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.62",13 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.63","Go and see where he is,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.64",and I will send and fetch him!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.65","It was told to him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.66","Here, in Dotan."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.67","14 So he sent there horses and chariots, a weighty army;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.68",they came at night and encircled the town.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.69","15 And the attendant of the man of God started-early to rise and went out,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.70","and here, an army was surrounding the town, with horse and chariotry!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.71",His serving-lad said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.72","Alas, my lord, what shall we do?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.73",16 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.74","Do not be afraid,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.75",for many more are those who are with us than who are with them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.76",17 Now Elisha prayed and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.77","O Y<small>HWH</small>, now open his eyes, that he may see!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.78","So Y<small>HWH</small> opened the eyes of the lad, and he saw:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.79","now here, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire surrounding Elisha!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.80","18 They went down against him, but Elisha prayed to Y<small>HWH</small> and said:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.81",Now strike this nation with dazzling-light!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.82","And he struck them with dazzling-light, in accordance with the word of Elisha."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.83",19 Elisha said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.84",This is not the way and this is not the town!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.85","Go along after me, and I will lead you to the man whom you seek."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.86",And he led them to Shomeron.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.87","20 It was, when they came to Shomeron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.88","that Elisha said: O Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.89","open the eyes of these [people], that they may see!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.90","So Y<small>HWH</small> opened their eyes, and they saw:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.91","now here, [they were] in the midst of Shomeron!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.92",21 The king of Israel said to Elisha when he saw them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.93","Shall I strike, strike them down, Father?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.94",22 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.95",You are not to strike.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.96","Those whom you have taken captive with your sword, with your bow,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.97",would you strike [them] down?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.98","Put food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go back to their lords."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.99","23 And he spread out for them a great spread,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.100",so that they ate and drank;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.101","then he sent them off, and they went back to their lords."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.102",And the raiding-bands of Aram no longer came into the land of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.103","24 Now it was, [some time] after this,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.104",that Ben-Hadad king of Aram collected all his camp;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.105",he went up and besieged Shomeron.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.106",25 And there was a great famine in Shomeron;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.107","here, they were besieging it"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.108","until [the price of] a donkey’s head was eighty silver-pieces,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.109","and a quarter of a <i>kav</i> of “pigeons’ dung,” five silver-pieces."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.110","26 Now it was that the king of Israel was crossing on the wall when a woman cried out to him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.111","Save [me], my lord king!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.112",27 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.113",No; let Y<small>HWH</small> save you—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.114",from where can I save you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.115",From the threshing-floor or from the winepress?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.116",28 And the king said to her:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.117",What [ails] you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.118",She said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.119",This woman said to me:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.120","Give over your son, that we may eat him today,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.121",and my son we will eat tomorrow!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.122","29 So we boiled my son, and ate him;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.123",then I said to her on the next day:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.124","Give over your son, that we may eat him"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.125",—but she hid her son.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.126","30 Now it was, when the king heard the woman’s words,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.127",that he tore his garments;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.128","and as he was crossing by the wall,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.129","the people saw that here, the sackcloth was on his flesh, on the inside."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.130",31 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.131","Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.132",if the head of Elisha son of Shafat is left standing upon him today!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.133","32 Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.134",and he had sent a man from his presence;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.135","but before the messenger came to him, he had said to the elders:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.136",Do you see that this son of a murderer has sent to remove my head?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.137","See, when the messenger comes, close the door and press him against the door;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.138",is not the sound of his lord’s footsteps behind him?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.139",33 He was still speaking with them
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.140","when here, the king came down to him"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.141",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.142","Here now, this evil-fate is from Y<small>HWH</small>;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.143",what more hope in Y<small>HWH</small> can I have?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.144",7:1 Then Elisha said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.145",Hear the word of Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.146",Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.147","Around this time tomorrow,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.148",a <i>sei’a</i> of flour [will go] for a <i>shekel</i>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.149","and two <i>sei’as</i> of barley for a <i>shekel</i>, at the gate of Shomeron."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.150",2 Then the officer upon whose arm the king leans spoke up to the man of God
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.151",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.152","Here, were Y<small>HWH</small> to make hatches in the sky,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.153",could this thing happen?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.154",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.155","Here, you will it see with your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.156",but from there you shall not eat!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.157","3 Now there were four men with <i>tzaraat</i>, at the entrance to the [town] gate."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.158","They said, each one to his neighbor:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.159",Why are we sitting here until we die?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.160","4 If we say, Let us go into the town,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.161","there is a famine in the town,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.162","and we will die there,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.163","and if we sit here, we will die."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.164","So-now, let us go and fall away to the camp of Aram—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.165","if they let us live, then we will live,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.166","and if they put us to death, then we will die."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.167","5 So they arose at twilight-breeze, to enter the camp of Aram."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.168","They had entered the edge of camp of Aram,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.169","and here, there was no one there!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.170",6 —For Y<small>HWH</small> had made the camp of Aram hear
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.171","the sound of chariots, the sound of horses,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.172","the sound of a great army,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.173",so that each one said to his brother:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.174","Here, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt, to come against us!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.175","7 So they arose and fled at twilight-breeze,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.176","and abandoned their tents and their horses and their donkeys,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.177","[with] the camp as it was,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.178",and they fled for their lives.—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.179","8 And those with <i>tzaraat</i> came to the edge of the camp,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.180","and they entered a tent, and ate and drank,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.181","and carried off from there silver and gold and garments,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.182",and went away and hid them;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.183","then they returned and entered another tent,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.184",and carried off [things] from there
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.185",and went away and hid them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.186","9 Then they said, each one to his neighbor:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.187","It is not proper, what we are doing;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.188","this day—it is a day of [good] news,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.189",and we are keeping silent!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.190","If we wait until the light of daybreak,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.191",iniquity will find us!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.192","So-now, let us go, let us enter, and let us inform the king’s house."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.193",10 So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the town
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.194","and told them, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.195","We entered the camp of Aram,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.196","and here, no one was there, or even a human voice,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.197","but the horses were tied up and the donkeys were tied up,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.198",[with] the tents as they were.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.199","11 The gatekeepers called out and informed the king’s house within,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.200",12 and the king arose at night and said to his servants:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.201",Now let me inform you what Aram has done to us:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.202","they knew that we were famished,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.203","so they went out of the camp to hide in the open-field, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.204","When they have gone out of the town,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7.205","we will seize them alive, and the town we will enter!"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.1","Elisha, Past and Present; On the Regional Stage: The opening of this chapter is a summing up, “as if the prophet were already dead” (Cohn 2000). Elisha’s act of reviving the child in Chap. 4 is recalled, and then the mother shows up; the king of Israel and the servant Gehazi, who previously had been vilified, here appear in a positive light: Gehazi is truthful, while the king carries out proper justice for the mother."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.2","With v.7 the scene shifts to Aram and another sick king. While Elisha seems to be lying to the king about his recovery (he tells Hazael that the monarch will, in fact, die), Cohn (2000) notes that Ben-Hadad asks for Elisha’s own opinion and does not make inquiry through the proper oracular channels. He also points out the way in which the story shows how Elisha’s wide influence is not confined to Israel alone. Additionally, Elisha’s anointing of Hazael foreshadows the rise of Yehu in the next chapter."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.3","V.20 introduces an important historical note. The Edomites, inhabiting the territory east of the Negev, now achieve independence from Judah (see Gen. 27:40 for the patriarch Yitzhak’s prophecy regarding these events). This is a serious blow to Judah’s control of southern trade."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.4","A last point, of considerable significance, is the lineage of King Ahazyahu of Judah, who makes his appearance in v.25. His mother, Atalyahu, is the granddaughter of King Omri of Israel. Thus, as Sweeney (2007) notes, every Davidic king from this point forward will also be a descendant of the house of Omri. While this might be diplomatically savvy, from the text’s point of view it is yet another fact pointing toward the inevitable fall of both houses."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.5",13 Then one of his servants spoke up and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.6","Now let them take five of the remaining horses, the ones that remain in it;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.7","here, they are like the whole throng of Israel that remain in it,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.8","here, they are like the whole throng of Israel that is done for."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.9",Let us send them and let us see!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.10","14 So they picked two chariots of horses,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.11","and the king sent them after the camp of Aram, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.12",Go and see.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.13","15 They went after them, as far as the Jordan,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.14","and here, the whole road was filled with garments and vessels"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.15",which Aram had thrown away in their fearful-haste.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.16",The messenger returned and told the king.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.17",16 And the people went out and despoiled the camp of Aram;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.18","and it was that a <i>sei’a</i> of flour [went for] a <i>shekel</i>, and two <i>sei’as</i> of barley for a <i>shekel</i>, in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.19","17 Now the king had appointed the officer upon whose arm he leans to the town gate,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.20","and the people trampled him at the gate, so that he died,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.21","as the man of God had spoken,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.22",as he had spoken when the king had come down to him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.23","18 For it was when the man of God had spoken to the king, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.24","Two <i>sei’as</i> of barley [will go] for a <i>shekel</i>, and a <i>sei’a</i> of flour for a <i>shekel</i> will go at around this time tomorrow at the gate of Shomeron—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.25",19 that the officer had answered the man of God and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.26","Now here, were Y<small>HWH</small> to make hatches in the sky,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.27",could this thing happen?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.28",And he had said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.29","Here, you will see it with your eyes,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.30",but from there you shall not eat!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.31",20 And thus it happened to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.32","the people trampled him at the gate, and he died."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.33","8:1 Now Elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.34","Arise and go, you and your household,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.35","and sojourn where you wish to sojourn,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.36",for Y<small>HWH</small> has proclaimed a famine
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.37","—indeed, it has come upon the land—for seven years."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.38",2 So the woman arose and did in accordance with the word of the man of God;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.39","she went, she and her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines, for seven years."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.40",3 It was at the end of the seven years
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.41","that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.42",and she went out to cry out to the king about her house and about her fields.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.43","4 Now the king had been speaking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.44",Pray recount to me all the great things that Elisha has done.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.45","5 And it was, as he was recounting to the king how he had restored the dead one to life,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.46","that here, the very woman whose son he had restored to life was crying out to the king about her house and about her fields."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.47",So Gehazi said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.48","My lord king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.49",this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.50","6 The king inquired of the woman, and she recounted it to him;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.51","so the king gave her over to an official, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.52","Return everything that is hers, along with all the revenue from the fields,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.53",from the time that she left the land until now.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.54",7 Elisha came to Damascus
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.55","when Ben-Hadad, king of Aram, was sick,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.56","and it was told to him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.57",The man of God has come here.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.58",8 The king said to Hazael:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.59",Take a gift in your hand
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.60",and go to meet the man of God.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.61","Inquire of God through him, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.62",Will I live through this sickness?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.63","9 Hazael went to meet him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.64","he took a gift in his hand—namely, all the best-goods of Damascus, forty camel loads,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.65","and he came and stood before him, and said:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.66","Your son, Ben-Hadad king of Aram, has sent me to you, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.67",Will I live through this sickness?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.68",10 Elisha said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.69","Go, say to him:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.70","You will live, yes, live—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.71","but Y<small>HWH</small> has shown me that he will die, yes, die."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.72","11 He kept his face still, setting it [thus] until he was ashamed,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.73",and then the man of God wept.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.74",12 Hazael said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.75",Why does my lord weep?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.76",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.77",Because I know what you will do to the Children of Israel—evil:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.78","their fortified places you will set on fire,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.79","their young men you will kill with the sword,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.80","their babies you will dash-to-pieces,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.81",and their pregnant women you will split open!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.82",13 And Hazael said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.83","Indeed, what is your servant, a [mere] dog,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.84",that he could do such a great thing?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.85",Elisha said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8.86",Y<small>HWH</small> has shown you to me as king over Aram.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.1","Yeku’s Coup: A memorable and bloody account of how Ah’av’s son and wife meet their deaths, this chapter introduces the figure of Yehu, who carries out divine vengeance on the House of Ah’av for its crimes. Both of the deaths are gruesome in their details (note the similarity between Ah’av’s demise in a chariot and his son’s death). While Homer routinely describes such matters in cinematic detail, the Bible is usually reticent, unless it is trying to make a point, as here, in “a tale of conspiracy, deception, irony, and murder …” (Cohn 2000). The greatest irony is the repetition of the word shalom (vv.17–19, 22), here rendered “peace,” in a story that is shot through with violence. By the end, Eliyyahu and Navot’s vineyard are recalled, and the double crime of that story in I Kings 21 is well on the way to being expiated."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.2","Yehu dominates Chaps. 9 and 10. His personality (which centers on his zeal for Y<small>HWH</small>) is hinted at by his driving a chariot “like-a-madman” (9:20). Unlike many northern kings, he establishes a dynasty which lasts for several generations. But the text also notes (10:29 and 31) how he does not remove Yorov’am’s golden calves, and thus the Bible’s final judgment on him is decidedly mixed."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.3","A curious historical note is sounded in this chapter. V.15 introduces a certain Yonadav son of Rekhav. This family, known to scholars as Rechabites, seem to have constituted a separatist group that lived in a strict religious manner and so allied themselves with the anti-Ah’av faction headed by Yehu."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.4","14 He went out from Elisha and came back to his lord,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.5",and he said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.6",What did Elisha say to you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.7",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.8",He said to me:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.9","You will live, yes, live."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.10",15 But it was on the morrow
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.11",that he took meshed-cloth and dipped it in water;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.12","he spread it over his face, and he died."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.13",And Hazael reigned as king in his place.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.14",16 In year five of Yoram son of Ah’av king of Israel—Yehoshafat was king of Judah—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.15",Yehoram son of Yehoshafat king of Judah became king.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.16","17 Thirty-two years old was he at his becoming king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.17",and for eight years he reigned as king in Jerusalem.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.18","18 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.19","as the House of Ah’av had done,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.20",for the daughter of Ah’av was a wife for him;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.21",and he did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.22",19 But Y<small>HWH</small> was not willing to bring ruin upon Judah
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.23","for the sake of David his servant,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.24","as he had said to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.25","to give him a lamp for his children, for all the days [to come]."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.26","20 In his days Edom rebelled from under the hand of Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.27",and they kinged themselves a king.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.28","21 So Yoram crossed over to Tza’ir, and all the chariotry with him;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.29",it was that he set out in the night
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.30","and struck Edom, who was surrounding him and the chariot commanders,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.31",and the fighting-people fled to their tents.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.32","22 And Edom has been rebelling from under the hand of Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.33",until this day.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.34",Then Livna [too] rebelled at that time.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.35","23 Now the rest of the events of Yoram, and all that he did,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.36",are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.37",24 Yoram lay beside his fathers;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.38","he was buried with his fathers in the City of David,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.39",and Ahazyahu his son reigned as king in his place.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.40","25 In year twelve of the years of Yoram son of Ah’av king of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.41",Ahazyahu son of Yehoram king of Judah became king.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.42","26 Twenty-two years old was Ahazyahu at his becoming king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.43",and for one year he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.44",his mother’s name was Atalyahu [grand]daughter of Omri king of Israel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.45",27 He walked in the way of the House of Ah’av:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.46","he did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>, like the House of Ah’av,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.47",for he was a son-in-law of the House of Ah’av.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.48","28 He went out with Yoram son of Ah’av to do battle with Hazael king of Aram, at Ramot-Gil’ad,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.49",and the Arameans struck Yoram.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.50",29 And Yoram the king returned to be healed in Yizre’el
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.51",from the wounds that the Arameans had struck him at Rama
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.52",when he engaged in battle with Hazael king of Aram.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.53",And Ahazyahu son of Yehoram king of Judah went down
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.54","to see Yoram son of Ah’av in Yizre’el,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.55",for he was sick [from his wounds].
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.56",9:1 Now Elisha the prophet called one of the Sons of the Prophets
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.57",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.58","Gird up your loins,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.59","take this flask of oil in your hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.60",and go to Ramot-Gil’ad.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.61","2 When you come there, look there for Yehu son of Yehoshafat son of Nimshi;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.62","when you come, you are to take him up from the midst of his brothers"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.63",and are to bring him into a room within a room.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.64",3 Then you are to take the flask of oil and you are to pour it on his head
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.65",and say: Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.66",I am anointing you as king over Israel!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.67",Then you are to open the door and are to flee; you are not to wait.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.68","4 So the lad, the prophet lad, went to Ramot-Gil’ad."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.69","5 He came there, and here, the commanders of the army were sitting around;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.70",he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.71","I have a message for you, O Commander!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.72",Yehu said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.73",For whom of all of us?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.74",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.75","For you, O Commander."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.76","6 He arose and entered the house,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.77",then he poured the oil on his head
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.78",and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.79","Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.80","I anoint you as king over the people of Y<small>HWH</small>, over Israel!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.81","7 You are to strike down the House of Ah’av, your lord,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.82",that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.83",and the blood of all the servants of Y<small>HWH</small> at the hand of Izevel.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.84",8 All the House of Ah’av will perish;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.85","I will cut off from Ah’av he who pisses against the wall,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.86",[even] the fettered and forsaken in Israel!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.87","9 And I will make the House of Ah’av like the House of Yorov’am son of Nevat,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.88",and like the House of Ba’sha son of Ahiyya.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.89","10 And Izevel the dogs will eat in the plot of Yizre’el,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.90",with no one to bury [her]!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.91",Then he opened the door and fled.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.92",11 Now Yehu went out to the servants of his lord;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.93",they said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.94",Is [all] well?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.95",For-what-reason did this madman come to you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.96",He said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.97",<i>You</i> know the man and his talk!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.98",12 They said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.99",A lie!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.100",Now tell us!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.101",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.102","Like this and like that he said to me, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.103",Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.104",I anoint you as king over Israel!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.105",13 Quickly each one took his garment
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.106","and put it under him, on the steps themselves;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.107",then they sounded a blast on the <i>shofar</i>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.108",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.109",Yehu reigns as king!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.110",14 So Yehu son of Yehoshafat son of Nimshi bound himself [in conspiracy] against Yoram
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.111","—now Yoram had been protecting Ramot-Gil’ad, he and all Israel, from Hazael king of Aram."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.112","15 But King Yehoram had returned to be healed at Yizre’el from the wounds with which the Arameans had wounded him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.113",when he had engaged in battle with Hazael king of Aram.—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.114",Yehu said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.115","If this be your desire,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.116","do not let any escaped-one out of the town, to go tell in Yizre’el!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.117","16 And Yehu mounted up and went to Yizre’el,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.118","for Yoram was laid up there,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.119",while Ahazya king of Judah had gone down to see Yoram.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.120",17 Now the lookout was standing on the tower in Yezre’el;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.121","he saw Yehu’s horde as he was coming,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.122",and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.123",I see a horde!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.124",Yehoram said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.125","Take a rider and send him to meet them, that he may say: Is [all] well?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.126",18 The horse rider went to meet him and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.127",Thus says the king: Is [all] well?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.128",Yehu said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.129",What is it to you if [all] is well?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.130",Turn in behind me!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.131","So the lookout reported, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.132",The messenger coming to them does not return.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.133","19 So he sent a second horse rider,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.134",and he came to them and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.135",Thus says the king: [Is all] well?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.136",Yehu said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.137",What is it to you if [all] is well?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.138",Turn in behind me!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.139","20 So the lookout reported, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.140",He came to them but does not return.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.141",Now his driving is like the driving of Yehu son of Nimshi—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.142",for he drives like-a-madman!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.143",21 Then Yehoram said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.144",Harness up!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.145","They harnessed his chariot,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.146","and Yehoram king of Israel went out, with Ahazyahu king of Judah, each one in his chariot;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.147","they went to meet Yehu,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.148",and they encountered him in the plot of Navot the Yizre’elite.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.149","22 And it was, when Yehoram saw Yehu,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.150",that he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.151","Is [all] well, Yehu?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.152",He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.153","What is “well,” as long as the many whorings of Izevel your mother and her sorceries [continue]?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.154","23 Yehoram reversed his hands and fled,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.155","and said to Ahazyahu: Treason, Ahazya!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.156",24 But Yehu filled his hand with the bow
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.157","and struck Yehoram between his shoulder-blades,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.158","so that the arrow stuck out of his heart,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.159",and he collapsed in his chariot.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.160",25 Then he said to Bidkar his officer:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.161",Pick [him] up! Throw him
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.162","into the plot of field of Navot the Yizre’elite,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.163","for keep in mind—I and you were riding, each with a team, behind Ah’av his father,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.164",when Y<small>HWH</small> pronounced this pronouncement upon him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.165",26 Did I not see the blood of Navot and the blood of his sons yesterday?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.166",—the Utterance of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.167",so I will pay you back in this very plot
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.168",—the Utterance of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.169","So-now, pick [him] up, throw him into the plot, in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.170","27 Now when Ahazyahu king of Judah saw [it], he fled by the road to Bet-Ha-Gan,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.171",and Yehu pursued after him and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.172",Him too—strike him down!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.173","… in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is near Yivle’am."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.174","He fled to Megiddo, and died there."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.175","28 His servants drove him to Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9.176","and they buried him in his burial-place, beside his fathers,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 10.1","Yehu Consolidates Power: Whereas the last chapter described individual deaths in the House of Ah’av, this one moves to not one but three large-scale killings. The triple massacre involves a good deal of deception, and implicates both soldiers and the general population. Given that the dead are the heirs to Ah’av and are Baal-worshippers, it is not surprising that Yehu, whose name mimics God’s own (YHWH), is rated positively as a king by the text. Yet the chapter closes with some reservations about him, namely, that he is not guiltless of the sins of Yorov’am. In fact, Yehu is less a heroic figure and more a vehicle for divine punishment of those judged by the Bible to be wrongdoers. Even though they are set in a ruthless age, the accounts of his violent and underhanded behavior might well have caused discomfort among ancient readers as they do among modern ones."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.6","2 But Yehosheva daughter of King Yoram, sister of Ahazyahu, took Yoash son of Ahazya"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.7",and stole him from the midst of the king’s sons who were being put to death
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.8","—him and his nurse—in the bedchamber,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.9","and they hid him from Atalyahu, so that he was not put to death."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.10","3 And he was with her in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, in hiding, for six years,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.11",while Atalyahu was reigning over the land.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.12","4 But in the seventh year, Yehoyada sent and took the commanders of hundreds of the Carites, and of the outrunners,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.13",and brought them to him in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.14","he cut them a covenant and had them swear [fealty] in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.15",and showed them the king’s son.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.16","5 And he charged them, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.17",This is the thing that you are to do:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.18","a third of you coming [on your watch] for the Sabbath,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.19","those who guard the guarding of the king’s house,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.20","6 and a third at the Sur Gate,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.21",and a third at the gate behind the Outrunners’ [Gate]—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.22",you are to guard the guarding of the House. …
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.23","7 The [other] two units among you,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.24","all those going off-duty for the Sabbath,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.25","are to guard the guarding of Y<small>HWH</small>’s house, over the king."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.26","8 You are to encircle the king, all around, each one with his weapons in his hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.27",so that whoever comes through to the rows is to be put to death.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.28",And be with the king in his going out and in his coming in!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.29",9 So the commanders of hundreds did exactly as Yehoyada the priest had charged:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.30","they took, each one, his fighting-men,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.31","those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off-duty on the Sabbath,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.32",and came to Yehoyada the priest.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.33",10 And the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spear-arsenal and the bow cases that had belonged to King David
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.34","that were in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.35","11 and the outrunners took a stand, each one with his weapons in his hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.36","from the right shoulder of the House to the left shoulder, at the sacrificial-altar and at the House, all around the king."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.37",12 Then he brought out the king’s son
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.38",and placed on him the diadem and the insignia;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.39","they made him king—they anointed him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.40",and they struck their hands together and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.41",May the king live!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.42","13 Atalya heard the sound of the outrunners [and] of the fighting-people,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.43",so she came to the People in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.44","14 And she saw: here, the king was standing by the standing-column, as was the custom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.45","with the commanders and their trumpets by the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.46",and all the Landed People were rejoicing and sounding a blast on the trumpets.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.47",Then Atalyahu tore her garments and called out: Conspiracy! Conspiracy!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.48","15 And Yehoyada the priest charged the commanders of hundreds, those accountable for the army,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.49",and said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.50","Bring her out within the rows,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.51","and anyone who comes after her, put to death with the sword!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.52",For the priest said [to himself]:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.53",Let her not be put to death in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.54",16 So they laid hands on her
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.55","and she came in by way of the Horses’ Entrance to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.56",and was put to death there.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.57","17 Then Yehoyada cut a covenant between Y<small>HWH</small> and the king and the people,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.58","to be Y<small>HWH</small>’s people,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.59",and [one] between the king and the people.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.60",18 And all the Landed People came to the House of Baal and demolished it:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.61","its sacrificial-altars and its images they smashed to bits,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.62","and Mattan, the priest of Baal, they killed in front of the altars."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.63","Then the priest set accountable men over the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.64","19 and he took the commanders of hundreds and the Carites and the outrunners and all the Landed People,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.65",and they brought the king down from the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.66","they entered by way of the Outrunners’ Gate, into the House of the King,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.67",and he took his seat on the kings’ throne.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.68","20 And all the Landed People rejoiced, and the city was quiet,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.69",while Atalyahu they put to death with the sword in the House of the King.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.73",5–7 <b>guard the guarding:</b> An idiom for “keep guard.”
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.74","6 <b>Sur Gate:</b> Location unknown. <b>Outrunners’ [Gate]:</b> See v.19, where the gate leads into the palace.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11.80","14 <b>Landed People:</b> An oft-debated term, Heb. <i>am ha-aretz</i> is found frequently in this literature, perhaps indicating landholders, or what we might call citizens. Their function in Kings seems to include choosing the king in unstable circumstances such as a coup.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.1","Yehoash and the Temple: After two chapters in which the tearing down of Baal’s temple and altars figured prominently, the description of the long reign of Yoash/Yehoash, who in fact grows up in the Temple, is limited mainly to what he did regarding the “House of YHWH” in Jerusalem. The leisurely description of the repairs there, and how money was raised for them, is a welcome contrast to the bloody changes of government that have recently characterized the text. As Zevit (2004) notes, income from good deeds goes to the repair, while that from guilt, etc., is given to the priests."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.2","Two ironies spring out at the reader at the end of the chapter: after fifteen occurrences of the word “silver” in eleven verses, holy vessels and gold are quickly given over to the king of Aram, to avert an attack on Jerusalem. And after all the care that the king has lovingly lavished on the Temple’s repair, which would seem to make him deserve only praise and long life, Yehoash is assassinated."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.3",12:1 Seven years old was Yehoash when he became king.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.4","2 In year seven of Yehu, Yehoash became king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.5",and for forty years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.6","his mother’s name was Tzivya, from Be’er-Sheva."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.7","3 And Yehoash did what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>, all his days,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.8",as Yehoyada the priest had instructed him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.9","4 However, the sanctuaries were not removed;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.10",the people were still offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke at the sanctuaries.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.11",5 Yehoash said to the priests:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.12","All the silver for holy-purposes that is brought to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.13","silver of one’s counting [in the census],"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.14","—silver of the valuation of persons,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.15",[or] any silver that goes up in a man’s heart to bring to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.16","6 let the priests take it for themselves, each one from his acquaintance,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.17","and they themselves shall strengthen the breaches in the House,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.18",wherever a breach is found there.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.19","7 But it was in year twenty-three, that year of King Yehoash:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.20",the priests had not strengthened the breaches in the House.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.21",8 So King Yehoash called for Yehoyada the priest and for the [other] priests
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.22",and said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.23",Why are you not strengthening the breaches in the House?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.24","Now,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.25","do not keep silver from your acquaintances,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.26",but rather for the breaches in the House you are to give it over.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.27","9 The priests agreed not to take silver from the people,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.28",and not to strengthen the breaches in the House.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.32","6 <b>strengthen the breaches:</b> JPS and others render less literally, “repair the damage.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12.33","9 <b>and not:</b> In the sense of “nor,” “neither.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.1","Northern Kings; The Death of Elisha: The reigns of two “evil” northern kings lead up to the death of Elisha. The first, Yehoahaz, is notable for entreating YHWH (v.4), with the result that God sends an unnamed “deliverer”—phraseology that recalls Judges (Cogan/Tadmor). The second king, Yehoash, has his sixteen-year reign compressed into four verses, yet another example of the approach to history writing taken in the book of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.2","Elisha’s final act, while not as memorable as his predecessor’s, is striking nevertheless. The prophet, on his sickbed, has the king shoot an arrow through the window, and then exhorts him to strike the ground with more arrows. When the king stops at three blows, the prophet expresses his disappointment and prophesies that Israel will now not be able to defeat Aram decisively (although Yehoash is able to recover some Israelite territory). Thus ends Elisha’s career, with his powers undiminished, still affecting the course of international affairs."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.3","Integrated into this account is a tiny, two-verse story about Elisha’s grave that gives further evidence of his involvement in the miraculous, even after his death. It recounts how his bones resurrect a dead man who is in the process of being buried. This is the kind of motif that we find in world folklore but which is fairly uncommon in the Hebrew Bible. Such a typical saint story would have been unthinkable regarding Moshe, but, as we have seen, the Elisha (and Eliyyahu) narratives preserve a kind of folk religion in which almost anything can happen, especially as it relates to life and death."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.4",10 Then Yehoyada the priest took a coffer
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.5","and bored a hole in its lid,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.6","and gave it near the sacrificial-altar,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.7",on the right as one entered the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.8","the priests, the guardians of the threshold, would give there"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.9",all the silver that was brought to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.10","11 So it was, whenever they saw that there was much silver in the coffer,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.11","that the king’s scribe and the Great Priest would go up,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.12",they would tie up and count the silver that was found in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.13","12 Then they would give the silver that was measured out into the hands of those doing the work, those accountable in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.14","and they would pay it out to the carvers of wood and to the builders who were doing [tasks] in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.15","13 and to the wall-builders and to the stone-cutters,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.16",for purchasing wood and quarried stones
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.17","to strenghen the breaches in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.18","and for everything [else] that was paid out for the House, to strengthen it."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.19",14 But there would not be made for the House of Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.20","silver basins, snuffers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.21","any kind of vessels of gold or vessels of silver,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.22",from the silver that was brought to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.23","15 rather, to those doing the work they would give it,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.24",so that with it they would strengthen the House of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.25","16 And they did not have to reckon [exactly] with the men into whose hand they gave the silver,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.26","to give [payment] to those doing the work,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.27",for in trustworthy-fashion they dealt.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.28",17 Silver from <i>asham</i>-offerings and silver from <i>hattat</i>-offerings was not brought into the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.29",it was for the priests.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.30","18 Then Hazael king of Aram went up and waged battle against Gat, and took it,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.31",and [afterward] Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.32","19 So Yehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Yehoshafat, Yehoram, and Ahazyahu, his fathers, the kings of Judah, had hallowed,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.34","and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and in the House of the king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.35","and sent [them] to Hazael king of Aram,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.36",so that he went up away from Jerusalem.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.39",21 His servants arose and conspired a conspiracy;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.40","they struck Yoash down at Bet-Millo, which leads down to Silla."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.41","22 Now it was Yozakhar son of Shim’at and Yehozavad son of Shomer his servants who struck him down, so that he died;"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.48","he walked after the sin of Yorov’am son of Nevat, who had caused Israel to sin;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.49",he did not turn aside from it.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.50","3 So Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up against Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.51",and he gave them into the hand of Hazael king of Aram
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.52","and into the hand of Ben-Hadad son of Hazael, for all the days."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.53","4 But Yehoahaz soothed the face of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.54","and Y<small>HWH</small> hearkened to him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.55","for he saw the oppression of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.56",for the king of Aram had oppressed them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.57","5 So Y<small>HWH</small> granted Israel a deliverer, so that they came out from under the hand of Aram,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.58","and the Children of Israel could sit in their tents, as yesterday [and] the day-before."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.59","6 However, they did not turn aside from the sins of the House of Yorov’am, who had caused Israel to sin—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.60",in them they walked;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.61",even an Ashera-pole stood in Shomeron.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.62",7 For no fighting-people were left to Yehoahaz
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.63","except for fifty riders, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot-soldiers,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13.64",for the king of Aram had annihilated them;

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 15.1","Kings North and South II: In this remarkable chapter, eight separate reigns are subsumed. But they are constructed with the book of Kings’ standard building blocks: a king’s illness, a conspiracy and several assassinations, bloody warfare, tribute paid in silver to Assyria, and an exile of Israelite townspeople. As is typical, the northern kings are judged as evil and the southerners as good, except for the latter’s failure to destroy the local sanctuaries."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 15.2","Equally notable is the sudden appearance, in v.29, of the premier power of the ancient Near East at the time, Assyria. Although Kings has thus far ignored the growing strength of the Assyrian Empire, it will break out in full force in the chapters to come. Some background is thus in order."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 15.3","Throughout a good part of the period covered in Kings, Assyria, situated around the Tigris River in the northern part of Mesopotamia, today’s Iraq, was the first of the great ancient empires to dominate Israel after Egypt some centuries before. By the ninth century they had extended their reach westward to the Mediterranean, and in the ensuing centuries one can speak of “Neo-Assyria,” which for the first time established an empire that encompassed most of the Middle East. Its scope has been revealed by modern archaeological exploration, which has turned up extensive written documents and fine examples of monumental architecture as well, including some memorable pieces currently in the British Museum, such as the large “cherubim” (winged sphinxes) that guarded the palace at Nineveh, and the moving reliefs depicting the conquest of the Judean city of Lachish. These sources convey a vivid picture of both splendor and warfare: elaborate portraits of kings on their thrones, surrounded by gods, servants, and subject kings; scenes of royal hunting of lions; soldiers with battering rams and siege ladders. In all of these, distinctive rectangular curly beards appear, along with the pointed helmets that struck dread throughout the ancient Near East."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 15.4","Assyrian war policy included two memorable features, the impaling of captured peoples on tall stakes (as illustrated in the Lachish reliefs) and the deportation of subject populations, sometimes replacing them with others (as in II Kings 17). The former may have been done to set an example to the constantly rebelling provinces under Assyria’s domination, while the latter would have both depleted the local leadership and talent and supplied Assyria herself with new blood for administrative and commercial purposes."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 15.5","Certainly the daily political life of the Israelites was profoundly affected by the Assyrian threat, but that threat also had long-term cultural influences. Assyria’s destruction of the Northern Kingdom terrified the south, but probably also effected the fleeing of northern refugees, who may well have brought with them texts and traditions that were later incorporated into the Bible. In addition, the language and concepts used in Assyrian inscriptions and treaties appear to have been mimicked, or rather co-opted, by biblical writers in texts such as Deuteronomy, Kings, and Isaiah. So, in a very real sense, eighth-century Assyria had a major if indirect hand in the creation of the Hebrew Bible."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 15.6","27 But Y<small>HWH</small> had not resolved to wipe out the name of Israel from under the heavens,"

In addition, he appeals to the king of Assyria for military help against Aram, cementing his request with a gift/bribe of treasures from the Temple.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.1","First Catastrophe: The Fall of Israel: Readers who are accustomed to the detailed battle scenes in Homer and elsewhere will be disappointed by the long-awaited account of Israel’s destruction, which takes up a mere handful of words in two verses. While the Assyrian relief commemorating the somewhat later destruction of the Judean city of Lachish lays out the contemporary particulars of siege, execution, and exile in gripping and poignant artistic terms, the biblical writers in our chapter are content to describe Israel’s demise, which had such a major influence on biblical thinking, in the sparsest way possible."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.2","The reason for this laconic approach becomes clear beginning in v.7: “So it was, / because …,” which then continues at great length, first, to recall God’s warnings to Israel through the prophets, and then, to recount through a long string of verbs how the people turned away from the right path into idolatry. Only in v.18 does the text finally inject God’s reaction, as it were. Vv.21–23 provide an additional interpretation of the downfall, citing Yorov’am’s primal sin of idolatry."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.3","Beginning in v.24, we are additionally told how, in consonance with what we now know of Assyrian practice, the conquerors place some of their own citizens in the vanquished land. When the new settlers are attacked by lions, which the Bible understands as punishment for their not acknowledging Y<small>HWH</small>, they are given an exiled priest to teach them how to worship him. But the result, ranging far from idealized Israelite practice, is syncretism, a combination of religions. In this section, which again takes up much more textual space than the fall of Israel itself, the key word is “awe”; that is, the settlers are supposed to worship God correctly, but do not, “until this day” (v.41). So from the perspective of a southern writer, the north has lost its identity, and thus is lost to history. In fact, the northern exiles blended into the Assyrian population, and for all practical purposes disappeared. The romantic notion of the “Ten Lost Tribes,” which envisioned them in distant lands awaiting discovery by later explorers, has no historical currency, despite its being a legend beloved in the Western world. On the other hand, those northerners who fled in the opposite direction, into Judah, may have brought with them their own traditions about Israel’s past, and this contribution to the process of the Bible’s development is of the greatest significance. It may even have been the beginning of the long sequence of adaptation which ultimately led to the canonization, the final form, of the text."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.4","This chapter gives evidence of a complex history, mixing condemnations of both the north and the south, and inserting several verses (18b–21) that bring the chapter up to date with the Babylonian Exile (see Brettler 1995 for a full analysis). As we have seen elsewhere in Kings and indeed throughout Deuteronomistic History (DH), such a practice is not unusual, and supports the idea of an evolving biblical text that is a testimony to Israel’s creative memory."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.9","and placed it on the flank of the [new] altar, northward."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.86",21 When he had torn Israel away from the House of David
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.87","and had made Yorov’am son of Nevat king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.88",Yorov’am had led Israel away from [following] after Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.89",and had caused them to sin a great sin.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.90","22 And the Children of Israel had walked in all the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat which he wrought,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.91","and had not turned aside from it,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.92","23 until Y<small>HWH</small> removed Israel from his presence,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.93",as he had promised by the hand of all his servants the prophets.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.94","So Israel was exiled from its soil to Assyria,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.95",until this day.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.96","24 And the king of Assyria brought [people] from Babylon, from Kuta, from Avva, from Hamat, and from Sefarvayim,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.97","and settled them in the towns of Shomeron, in place of the Children of Israel;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.98","they took possession of Shomeron, and settled in her towns."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.99",25 Now it was:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.100","at the start of their settlement there, they did not hold Y<small>HWH</small> in awe,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.101","so Y<small>HWH</small> sent out lions against them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.102",and they were killing [some] among them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.103","26 So they said to the king of Assyria, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.104",The nations whom you exiled and resettled in the towns of Shomeron
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.105","do not know the practices of the god of the land,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.106",so he has sent out lions against them;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.107","here, they are causing their death,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.108",as they do not know the practices of the god of the land.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.109","27 So the king of Assyria commanded, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.110","Have one of the priests whom I exiled from there go there,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.111","let him go and settle there, and instruct them in the practices of the god of the land."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.112",28 So one of the priests whom they had exiled from Shomeron came
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.113","and settled at Bet-El,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.114",and he was instructing them how they should hold Y<small>HWH</small> in awe.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.115","29 But each-nation, each-nation went on making their own gods;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.116","they put them in the sanctuary buildings that the Shomeronites had made,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.117","each-nation, each-nation in their towns in which they had settled:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.118","30 the men of Bavel made Sukkot Benot,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.119","and the men of Kut made Nergal,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.120","and the men of Hamat made Ashima,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.121","31 and the Awites made Nivhaz and Tartak,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.122","and the Sefarvites were burning their children in fire to Adrammelekh and to Anammelekh, the gods of Sefarvayim."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.123","32 Now they went on holding Y<small>HWH</small> in awe,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.124","but they [also] made for themselves, from [all] their quarters, priests for the sanctuaries;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.125",they went on making [worship] for them at the sanctuary buildings.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.126","33 Now Y<small>HWH</small> they held in awe,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.127","while their gods they went on serving,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.128",according to the practice of the nations from among whom they had been exiled.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.129","34 To this day they do, according to their earlier practices:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.130",they do not hold Y<small>HWH</small> in awe;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.131","they do not do according to their laws, according to their practice,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.132","or according to the Instructions and the commandments that Y<small>HWH</small> commanded the Children of Yaakov, whose name he appointed Israel."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.133","35 But Y<small>HWH</small> had cut a covenant with them and had commanded them, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.134","You are not to hold other gods in awe,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.135","you are not to bow down to them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.136","you are not to serve them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.137",and you are not to sacrifice to them!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.138","36 Rather, Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.139","who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.140","him you are to hold in awe,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.141","to him you are to bow down, to him you are to sacrifice!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.142","37 The laws and the practices, the instruction and the commandment that he wrote down for you,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.143","you are to keep, observing it all the days [of your life];"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.150","rather, according to their former practice they went on doing."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17.151","41 So these nations have been holding Y<small>HWH</small> in awe,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.1","Hizkiyyahu: Reform and Revolt: As the text shifts for its remaining eight chapters to the Southern Kingdom, Judah, three will now be devoted to one king. Hizkiyyahu (Hezekiah) is lauded above all his predecessors, and we are immediately told why: he destroys the pagan sanctuaries and their attendant cult objects. Most of Chap. 18, however, is taken up with the problem of the threat from Assyria. The king is forced to strip more wealth from the Temple, but that does not prevent King Sanheriv (Sennacherib) of Assyria from sending a large army to menace Jerusalem."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.2","What ensues is one of the Bible’s most memorable scenes, which is retold beginning in Isa. 36, with Chap. 37 paralleling our Chap. 19. High Assyrian officials, speaking within earshot of the city walls, taunt the Jerusalem delegation, haughtily suggesting that Y<small>HWH</small> himself has commissioned them to come against the city, and that they have overcome many other gods in their military sweep through that part of the world. The tension in their speech, outside of its sarcasm and constant insulting of Y<small>HWH</small>, arises from the fact that it is delivered in “Judean,” that is, Hebrew, and thus can be understood by the onlooking soldiers who are seemingly destined to die in the siege. As for the people’s silence, while it is mandated by Hizkiyyahu (v.36), it is a hollow one, and has more dismay than defiance in it."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.3","Cohn likens the scene to a showdown in a Western movie, and notes how, by mentioning names and titles of the participants, the writer renders the action more serious and more vivid. Its historicity is impossible to verify, but its use of typical Assyrian diplomatic language (Sweeney 2007) makes it realistic. More important, as explicated by Machinist (2000), the speech at first poses a serious challenge to Israelite theology, perhaps voicelessly joined by those Judeans who must have urged capitulation; but this makes the end result in the next chapter—the precipitous withdrawal of the Assyrian army—all the more proof of Y<small>HWH</small>’s supreme power over earthly empires."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.4","18:1 Now it was in year three of Hoshe’a son of Ela, king of Israel:"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.22","but he kept his commandments, which Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.23",7 So Y<small>HWH</small> was with him;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.24","wherever he went out, he prospered."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.25","He rose-in-revolt against the king of Assyria, and would not serve him."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.30","Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Shomeron and laid siege to it,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.31",10 and he took it at the end of three years;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.32",in year six of Hizkiyyahu—that is year nine of Hoshe’a king of Israel—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.33",Shomeron was captured.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.34",11 The king of Assyria exiled Israel to Assyria;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.35","he led them off to Halah and Havor, the River Gozan and the towns of Media,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.36","12 because they had not hearkened to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small> their God,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.40","13 In the fourteenth year of King Hizkiyya,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.41",Sanheriv king of Assyria came up against all the fortified towns of Judah and seized them.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.45",So the king of Assyria imposed upon Hizkiyya king of Judah
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.46",three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.47",15 and Hizkiyya gave over all the silver that was found in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.48",and in the treasuries of the king’s house.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.49","16 At that time,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.50","Hizkiyya stripped the doors of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Great-Hall,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.51","and the posts which Hizkiyya king of Judah had overlaid,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.52",and gave them to the king of Assyria.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.53",17 But the king of Assyria sent the Field-Marshal and the Chief Official and the Chief Cupbearer from Lakhish to King Hizkiyyahu with a weighty army to Jerusalem;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.54","they went up and came to Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.55","and when they had gone up and come, they stopped at the channel of the Upper Pool that is by the road of the Washer’s Field"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.58",and Shevna the [Royal] Scribe

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.72",is it not he whose sanctuaries and whose altars Hizkiyyahu removed
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.73",and said to Judah and to Jerusalem:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.74","Before this sacrificial-altar [alone] you are to bow down, in Jerusalem!?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18.75","23 So-now, pray make a wager with my lord, with the king of Assyria:"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.1","Jerusalem Saved: From the low points at the beginning of the chapter, where Hizkiyyahu clothes himself in sackcloth (the garment of mourning) and the text repeats at least part of Assyria’s taunting (vv.10–13), the audience is assured in just two verses (6–7) that not only will the mighty conqueror fail in his designs, but he himself will also fall. It is the prophet Yesha’yahu (Isaiah) who makes this confident pronouncement, and his appearance provides the perfect counter to military force. Here, as so often in the book of Kings, politics is overcome by the divine Word."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.2","Literarily, this is accomplished in two passages. First comes Hizkiyyahu’s heartfelt prayer (vv.15–19), mimicking an old cuneiform model (Hallo/Simpson). It ends with the familiar theme of universal acknowledgment of Y<small>HWH</small>. More pointed is Yesha’yahu’s pronouncement of the word of Y<small>HWH</small>, beginning in v.21. Breaking into poetry, while unusual in Kings, is perfectly in keeping with the Bible’s practice of inserting verse at climactic moments (see, for instance, Exod. 15 and I Sam. 2). Picking up on the “mocking” motif (v.16), the prophet sends the Assyrian king packing. Significantly, he opens with the ironic reversal of an image that will be familiar a bit later in the Bible. “The Nubile Daughter of Zion” (Jerusalem), so often an object of pity and derision in the literature that postdates the destruction of Jerusalem, here gets to do a little deriding of her own. In other imagery, the poem alternates visions of agricultural growth and plenty with ones of destruction. Thus the rescue of Jerusalem is artistically adorned, as it were, and the theological challenge has been overturned (Machinist 2000)."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.10",27 But the Chief Cupbearer said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.11",Is it to your lord and to you that my lord has sent me to speak these words?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.12","Is it not to the men sitting on the wall,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.13",[who will have] to eat their filth and drink the “water of their legs” with you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.14","28 And the Chief Cupbearer stood forth and called out in a loud voice in Judean,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.15",he spoke and said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.16","Hearken to the word of the Great King, the king of Assyria:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.17",29 Thus says the king:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.18","Do not let Hizkiyyahu deceive you,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.23","31 Do not hearken to Hizkiyyahu,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.25","Make me a blessing-gift, and come out to me [in surrender],"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.26","and each will eat of his vine, each of his fig tree,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.28","32 until my coming to take you away to a land like your land,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.29","a land of new-wine and grain, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of shining olive oil and honey,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.30",that you may live and not die.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.31",So do not hearken to Hizkiyyahu

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.37","Indeed, did they rescue Shomeron from my hand?"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.38","35 Who is it among all the gods of these lands that rescued their land from my hand,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.39",that Y<small>HWH</small> should rescue Jerusalem from my hand?

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.53","A day of distress, rebuke, and scorn is this day,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.54","for children have come to the womb-breaking,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.55",but strength there is none for giving birth!

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.59","5 So the servants of King Hizkiyyahu came to Yesha’yahu,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19.60",6 and Yesha’yahu said to them:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.1","Evil Kings: Menashe and Amon: The long reign of Menashe is the last straw in YHWH’s toleration of Judah’s idolatry. We know what is to come immediately, as the usual formula, “he did what was evil in the eyes of YHWH,” is amplified by the ominous phrase “according to the abominations of [the Canaanites].” From v.12 on, a sentence of doom is pronounced over Jerusalem and Judah."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.2","Of Menashe’s successor Amon, it is only necessary for the text to note, first, how he continues in his father’s idolatrous footsteps, and second, how both he and those who assassinate him are done away with. His death may have come at the hands of an anti-Assyrian faction who were themselves killed by the “Landed People.” Their actions, which resulted in installing his eight-year-old son Yoshiyyahu on the throne, may have held off the Assyrians."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.3","12 At [about] that time,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.4","Merodakh Bal’adan son of Bal’adan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hizkiyyahu,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.5",for he had heard that Hizkiyyahu was sick.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.6","13 And Hizkiyyahu was pleased with them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.7","and he had them see his whole storehouse—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the fine oil,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.10",There was not a thing that Hizkiyyahu did not have them see in his house or in all his kingdom.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.11",14 Then Yesha’yahu the prophet came to King Hizkiyyahu and said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.12","What did these men say,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.13",and from where do they come to you?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.14",Hizkiyyahu said:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.20",there was not a thing that I did not have them see in my treasuries.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.21",16 Then Yesha’yahu said to Hizkiyyahu:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.22",Hear the word of Y<small>HWH</small>:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.23","17 Here, days are coming"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.24","when everything in your house will be carried off,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.36","21 Hizkiyyahu lay beside his fathers,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.42",according to the abominations of the nations that Y<small>HWH</small> had dispossessed before the Children of Israel:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.43","3 he once again built the sanctuaries that Hizkiyyahu his father had demolished,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.44","and erected sacrificial-altars to Baal,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.45","and made an Ashera-pole, just as Ah’av king of Israel had made,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.46","and bowed down to all the Forces of the Heavens, and served them;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.47",4 he built sacrificial-altars in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.48","about which Y<small>HWH</small> had said: In Jerusalem I will set my name!,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.49",5 and he built sacrificial-altars to all the Forces of the Heavens
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.50",in the two courtyards of the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.51",6 he had his son cross through the fire
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.52","and practiced soothsaying and divination, made [contact with] ghosts and all-knowing ones—"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.53","he did much that was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>, to provoke him."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.54",7 And he placed the statue of Ashera that he had made
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.55",in the House about which Y<small>HWH</small> had said to David and to Shelomo his son:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.56","In this House in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.57","I will set my name for the ages,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.58",8 and I will not continue to make Israel’s foot wander from the soil that I gave to their fathers;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.59","if only they take care to observe according to all that I have commanded them,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.60",including all the Instruction that my servant Moshe commanded them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.61","9 But they did not hearken,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.62","and Menashe led them astray to do what was evil, more than the nations that Y<small>HWH</small> had wiped out before the Children of Israel."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.63","10 So Y<small>HWH</small> spoke by the hand of his servants the prophets, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.64","11 Because Menashe king of Judah has done these abominations,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.65","practicing more evil than all that the Amorites did who were before him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.66","and has caused Judah too to sin with his Illicit-Things,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.67","12 therefore,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.75",19 <b>trustworthy:</b> Secure.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.76","20 <b>the pool and the channel:</b> The famous Siloam Tunnel, in which workers dug a third of a mile through rock from the Gihon Spring (outside of Jerusalem’s city wall to the east) to a pool which would supply water to the city in time of siege. A contemporary inscription chronicling the completion of the work has survived, and was uncovered in 1880."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21.77",21:1 <b>Menashe:</b> Pronounced <i>meh-nah-SHEH;</i> trad. English “Manasseh.” The meaning seems to be “He Who Makes Forget” (the name of one of Yosef’s [Joseph’s] sons; see Gen. 41:51). <b>Heftzi-va:</b> Pronounced <i>hef-tzee-VAH</i>. It means “My Delight Is in Her”; trad. English “Hephzibah.”

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 22.1","Yoshiyyahu’s Accession; The Finding of the Scroll: Having been told a few chapters previously about how Judah’s greatest king since the United Monarchy was Hizkiyyahu, the text introduces a new hero, Yoshiyyahu, another one who “did what was good in the eyes of YHWH,” and innocuously goes on to describe some Temple repairs and the payment for them, a motif which we encountered earlier. In the midst of the repairs, however, a “Record of the Instruction” is found. When it is read before the king, he breaks down, realizing that this divine Instruction, whatever its exact identity, has not been heeded for generations. In typical Kings fashion, this is confirmed by prophetic speech, this time from a female member of the profession (Hulda), and the news is not good: Judah and Jerusalem will indeed eventually fall, and Yoshiyyahu’s only consolation is that he himself will not live to see it. Similar thoughts had been addressed to Hizkiyyahu in 20:16–18."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 22.2","It has long been asserted that the newly found scroll is the book of Deuteronomy, or at least its core. Among that book’s major goals, after all, are the extirpation of idolatry and the centralization of the sacrificial cult in Jerusalem, and the language applied to Yoshiyyahu is a reprise of Deuteronomic phrases (see 23:25 below). Further, the discovery fits a known pattern in the ancient world, where a king’s desire to promulgate new laws is often accompanied by the publication of an authoritative document. If that scroll is represented as being of hoary lineage, as in this case, so much the better."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 22.3","Amid the dramatic scenario of the newly found scroll and national revival, an odd note can be heard. Three of Yoshiyyahu’s court officials have names of animals that live in concealed areas: the rock badger (<i>shafan</i>), the mouse (<i>’akhbor</i>), and the mole (<i>hulda</i>). This is possibly a coincidence, but it may also be slyly purposeful in a narrative that describes the unearthing of a long-lost document in the bowels of the Temple. I am not prepared, however, to declare this chapter the Bible’s version of <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.1","Yoshiyyahu’s Reform; His Death: After a great public ceremony in vv.1–3, in which, as Mann notes, the word “all” is used for emphasis, and during which the newly found document, now significantly called the “Record of the Covenant,” is read before the people, the text turns (v.4) to a rapid-fire and detailed recounting of the religious purge initiated by Yoshiyyahu. There is no dialogue to interrupt the violence or to oppose the king’s actions, and the verbs used are in the singular, as if to personalize the action (Cohn 2000)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.2","Except for the burial site of the prophet who had foretold the purge all the way back in I Kings 13:2–3, and that of another prophet, everything not tied to Y<small>HWH</small> is not only physically destroyed but rendered ritually polluted as well. One positive act is the re-observance of the Passover offering, which the text portrays as having been neglected for centuries. Something similar had taken place in Chap. 5 of Joshua, as an affirmation of the invaders’ peoplehood. Here too it is a fitting symbol of a utopian attempt to reorder society."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.3","Despite the superlatives applied to Yoshiyyahu, surpassing the description of Hizkiyyahu a century earlier, the decree against the Southern Kingdom is not canceled, and the king himself is overtaken by the events of international politics. On a mission northward to stop Egyptian aid to Assyria, he is killed by the Pharaoh; interestingly, the exact details are not given. So dies the last hope of Judah. His great reform as described by the text appears as too little, too late. The reign of his son Yehoahaz lasts for only three months, and is succeeded by an Egyptianappointed puppet king, Yehoyakim. Both are rated by the text as “evil.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.4",15 She said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.5","Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.8","Here, I am about to bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.9","all the words of the Record that the king of Judah has read,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.10","17 because they have abandoned me and sent-up-smoke to other gods,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.11",in order to provoke me with all the works of their hands—
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.12","so my wrath will be kindled against this place, and will not be extinguished!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.13","18 But to the king of Judah, the one sending you to inquire of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.14",thus you are to say to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.15","Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.16","As for the words that you have heard,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.17",19 because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.18","when you heard what I spoke concerning this place and concerning its inhabitants,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.19","to become a desolation and a curse,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.20","and you tore your garments and wept before me,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.21",I too have heard

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.23","20 Therefore,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.24","here, I will gather you to your fathers;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.25","you will be gathered to your burial-place in peace,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.26",so that your eyes will not see all the evil that I am about to bring upon this place.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.27",And they returned word to the king.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.28",23:1 The king sent
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.29",and had all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem gathered to him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.30","2 Then the king went up to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.33",and he read in their ears all the words of the Record of the Covenant that had been found in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.34",3 And the king stood by the standing-column
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.35",and cut a covenant in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.36","to walk after Y<small>HWH</small>, to keep his commandments, his testimonies, and his laws"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.37","with all [one’s] heart and with all [one’s] being,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.38",to fulfill the words of this covenant that were written in this Record.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.39",And all the people took a stand in the covenant.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.40",4 Then the king charged Hilkiyyahu the Great Priest and the priests of second rank and the guardians of the threshold
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.41",to take out of the Great-Hall of Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.42","all the vessels that had been made for Baal and for Ashera and for all the Forces of the Heavens,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.43","and he burned them outside Jerusalem, on the terraces of Kidron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.44",and carried their ashes to Bet-El.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.45","5 And he put an end to the clerics whom the kings of Judah had given-license to send-up-smoke at the sanctuaries in the towns of Judah and in the [sacred] places around Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.46","namely, those who sent-up-smoke to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, and to the constellations,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.47",and to all the Forces of the Heavens.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.48","6 And he brought out the Ashera-pole from the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, outside Jerusalem, to the Wadi Kidron,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.49",and burned it in the Wadi Kidron;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.50",then he crushed it into dust
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.51",and threw its dust over the burial-ground of the [common] people.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.52","7 And he demolished the houses of the [male] prostitutes that were in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.53",where the women had been weaving coverings for the Ashera-pole.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.54","8 And he brought in all the priests from the towns of Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.55",and he rendered <i>tamei</i> the sanctuaries where the priests had sent-up-smoke
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.56","from Geva to Be’er-Sheva,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.57","and he demolished the sanctuaries at the gates that were at the entrance to the gate of Yehoshua, commander of the city,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.58",which were at a person’s left [entering] the gate of the city.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.59","9 However, the priests of the sanctuaries did not go up to the sacrificial-altar of Y<small>HWH</small> in Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.60",although they ate unleavened-bread among their brothers.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.61","10 And he rendered <i>tamei</i> the <i>Tofet</i>/Hearth that is in the Valley of Ben Hinnom,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.62",so that no [one could] cross his son or his daughter through the fire to the Molekh.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.68",the king demolished them;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.69",he hastened them from there and threw their rubble into the Wadi Kidron.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.70","13 And the sanctuaries which were facing Jerusalem, which were to the right/south of the Mount of the Ruinbringer,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.71","which Shelomo king of Israel had built to Astarte, the Detestable-One of the Sidonians,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.72","to Kemosh the Detestable-One of Moav,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.73","and to Milkom the Abominable-One of the Children of Ammon,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.74",the king rendered <i>tamei</i>.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.75","14 And he smashed the standing-pillars,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.76",and cut down the Ashera-poles
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.77",and filled in their sites with human bones.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.78","15 And also the sacrificial-altar that was at Bet-El, the sanctuary that Yorov’am son of Nevat made, [the one] who had caused Israel to sin,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.79","also that altar and the sanctuary, he demolished,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.80","and he burned the sanctuary and crushed it fine, into dust,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.81",and he burned the Ashera-pole.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.82",16 And Yoshiyyahu faced about
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.83","and saw the burial-places that were there on the hill,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.84","so he sent and had the bones taken from the burial-places and burned on the altar, rendering it <i>tamei</i>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.85","in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which the man of God had proclaimed,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.86",who had proclaimed these things.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.87",17 Then he said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.88",What is this marker that I see?
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.89",The men of the town said to him:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.90","It is the burial-place of the man of God who came from Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.91",who proclaimed these things that you have done against the sacrificial-altar of Bet-El.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.92",18 He said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.93",Let it rest;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.94",let no one disturb his bones!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.95","So they let his bones be,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.96",along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Shomeron.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.97",19 And also all the sanctuary buildings that were in the towns of Shomeron
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.98","which the kings of Israel had made to provoke [Y<small>HWH</small>], Yoshiyyahu removed;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.99",he dealt with them in accordance with all the deeds that he had done in Bet-El.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.100","20 And he slew all the priests of the sanctuaries who were there, on the sacrificial-altars,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.101",and burned human bones on them.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.102",Then he returned to Jerusalem.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.103","21 And the king commanded all the people, saying:"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.104","Observe the Passover to Y<small>HWH</small> your God,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.105",as is written in this Record of the Covenant!
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.106",22 —For no such Passover had been observed
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.107","since the days of the judge-leaders who led Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.108",and all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.109",23 But in the eighteenth year of King Yoshiyyahu
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.110",such a Passover was observed to Y<small>HWH</small> in Jerusalem.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.111","24 And also the ghosts and the all-knowing ones, the <i>terafim</i> and the Illicit-Things,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.112","and all the Detestable-Things that could be seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.113","Yoshiyyahu eradicated,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23.114","in order to fulfill the words of the Instruction, the ones written in the Record that Hilkiyyahu the priest had found in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.1","The First Exile: All of a sudden a new dominant power, Babylon, appears in the text. The Bible is chiefly interested in how several Judean rebellions bring down the wrath of the Babylonian king, Nevukhadnetzar, upon the Southern Kingdom, leading to disaster. The destruction of Jerusalem takes place in two stages in the two remaining chapters. The first is triggered by a revolt against Babylon by Yoshiyyahu’s son Yehoyakim; this is followed by Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite attacks (attributed, however, not to the king’s wrongdoings but to those of Menashe, decades earlier). During Yehoyakhin’s brief reign, the Babylonians themselves invade. The resulting exile, dated to 597 B.C.E., involves the remaining Temple treasures and the military and elite of the country. Those left, according to the text, are simply the poor and the new puppet king, Yehoyakhin’s uncle Tzidkiyyahu."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.2","Amid the narratives of destruction, it will be useful for the reader to have a sense of who the Babylonians were. By the mid-seventh century, Assyria began to falter. Several decades later, civil war provided the opportunity for the Neo- Babylonians to throw off the Assyrian yoke, and in 612, Nineveh, the capital, was sacked."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.3","Based around the Euphrates in southern Mesopotamia, Babylonia arose on a hoary foundation of language (Sumerian and Akkadian), law, literature, and architecture. By the ninth century, the Chaldeans (anachronistically mentioned in Gen. 11:31) had taken over the area, although within a century, the Assyrians to the north conquered Babylonia and established a dual monarchy which lasted for a long period. With the fall of Nineveh, the Neo-Babylonian Empire came to dominate the Middle East for the next seven decades, until the rise of Persia."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.4","The accomplishments of Babylonian civilization were considerable. Nebuchadnezzar built the fabulous Hanging Gardens in his capital city. The country abounded in ziggurats, the pyramid-shaped temples whose ruins still dot the Iraqi landscape. As befitted an old civilization, the Babylonians made signal advances in astronomy, astrology, and mathematics, and already possessed an advanced irrigation system. They also contributed or transmitted some of the world’s earliest surviving great literature, including the immortal Epic of Gilgamesh."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.5","In the Hebrew Bible, all this is barely hinted at, but many biblical narratives, especially those that appear early on (such as aspects of the Creation, Flood, and Tower of Babel stories in the first section of Genesis), may well be reacting to, or against, some of its ideas and institutions. There may even be an element of parody in some of these stories. Once again, then, the Bible comes across as a kind of counter-text, a text which, as the prophet Jeremiah himself was characterized, was “appointed against nations and kingdoms, / to uproot and to pull down” (Jer. 1:10), despite the seeming insignificance of ancient Israel in the context of the region."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.6","25 Now like him there was none before him as king,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.7","who turned back to Y<small>HWH</small> with all his heart, with all his being, and with all his substance,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.8","in accordance with all the teaching of Moshe,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.9",and after him there arose none like him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.10","26 Yet Y<small>HWH</small> did not turn back from his great flaming-anger, whose anger flared up against Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.11",on account of all the provocations with which Menashe had provoked him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.12",27 So Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.13","Judah too I will remove from my presence,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.14","just as I removed Israel,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.15","and I will reject this city which I chose, Jerusalem,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.19","29 In his days, Pharaoh Nekho king of Egypt came up to the king of Assyria, to the River Euphrates,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.32",and placed a fine on the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.33","34 Pharaoh Nekho made Elyakim son of Yoshiyyahu king in place of Yoshiyyahu his father,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.34","and changed his name to Yehoyakim,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.36","35 Now the silver and the gold, Yehoyakim gave [as payment] to Pharaoh,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.39","36 Twenty-five years old was Yehoyakim at his becoming king,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.49",in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had spoken by the hand of his servants the prophets.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.50","3 Yes, at the order of Y<small>HWH</small> did all this [come] against Judah,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.62",all that had belonged to the king of Egypt.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.63","8 Eighteen years old was Yehoyakhin at his becoming king,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24.65","his mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnatan, from Jerusalem."

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.1","Final Catastrophe: The Fall of Judah: As in Chap. 17, the account of the final battle here is extraordinarily brief; the narrator clearly has little interest in military details. More central, once the city wall is breached, are the capture and treatment of Tzidkiyyahu, the king, and the destruction of the Temple. After, once again, a brief description of the fate of the buildings and people of Jerusalem, the text becomes expansive, dwelling longingly (and not surprisingly) on the destroyed or despoiled vessels and columns of the Temple."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.2","Some key political details remain. The Babylonians appoint a governor, ironically named Gedalyahu (“God has done great things”), to administer what is left of Judah. He counsels cooperation with the conquerors, but is assassinated by those Judahites who are still in a rebellious frame of mind."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.3","The entire narrative of Kings then fast-forwards and comes to an end (vv.27–30) with what amounts to an extended note, precisely dated in the spring of 561 <small>B.C.E.</small>, describing the treatment of the surviving Davidic king, Yehoyakhin, who had been exiled thirty-six years before. The captive king’s fate—he is taken out of prison and allowed to eat at the Babylonian king’s table for the rest of his days—could be read in two ways: either he is highly favored in his limited circumstances (his throne is “set above the thrones of the [other] kings” who have been taken to Babylon), thus providing a shred of hope for the exiles, or the text is reaffirming that his power is quite limited, since he is supported not by his own subjects but at the whim of the king of Babylon. This subdued, even depressing ending leaves us in a kind of limbo; as McKenzie (2010) puts it, both Kings and the DH overall are “strangely silent about the future.” In any event, with the end of the book, Israel embarks on centuries of control by others or other forces (Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans), which would lead ultimately to both a wider exile and the creation of the Hebrew Bible in its final form."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.4",13 And he brought out from there all the treasuries of the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and the treasuries of the king’s house;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.5","he cut-to-pieces all the vessels of gold that Shelomo king of Israel had made in the Great-Hall of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.6",as Y<small>HWH</small> had promised.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.7",14 He exiled all of Jerusalem:

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.9","ten thousand exiles,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.10",and all the carvers and the smiths;

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.26",until he cast them out from his presence.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.27",And Tzidkiyyahu rose-in-revolt against the king of Babylon.

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.31","they set up camp against it and built a bulwark against it, all around."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.32",2 And the city came under siege until the eleventh year of King Tzidkiyyahu.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.33","3 On [day] nine of the [fourth] month, hunger became strong in the city;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.34",there was no food [even] for the Landed People.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.35","4 The city-wall was broken through,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.36","[and Tzidkiyyahu] and all the men fit for battle [fled] at night through the gate between the double-walls that are near the king’s garden,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.37",with the Chaldeans all around the city;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.38",he went by the Road of the Plain.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.39",5 But the Chaldean army pursued after the king
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.40","and overtook him in the Plains of Jericho,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.41",with all his army having scattered from him.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.42","6 They seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon, at Rivla,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.45",and Tzidkiyyahu’s eyes were blinded;

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.56",Nevuzar’adan the Captain of the Guard exiled;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.57","12 but from the poor of the land, the Captain of the Guard allowed some to remain,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.68","17 Eighteen cubits was the height of the one column,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.82","21 And the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Rivla, in the land of Hamat."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.83",So Judah was exiled from its soil.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.84","22 Now as for the people who remained in the land of Judah,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.85",whom Nevukhadnetzar king of Babylon allowed to remain—

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.87","23 And all the commanders of the soldiers heard, they and their men, that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedalyahu,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.92",he said to them:
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.93",Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.94","stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you!"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.95",25 But it was in the seventh month

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.99","26 Then all the people, great and small, and the commanders of the soldiers, arose and went to Egypt,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.100",for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.101","27 Now it was in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Yehoyakhin king of Judah,"

"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.104",28 He spoke kind-words with him
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.105",and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.106",29 So he changed his prison garments
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.107","and ate food regularly before him,"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25.108",all the days of his life;
