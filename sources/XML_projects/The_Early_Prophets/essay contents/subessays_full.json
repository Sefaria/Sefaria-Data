{"Part I; The Primeval History": {"God as Creator": ["Genesis 1:1-2:4", "Three principal themes emerge from the great creation account with which Genesis opens. The first is the total and uncompromised power of God as creator; the second, the intrinsic order and balance of the created world; and the third, humankind\u2019s key position in the scheme of creation. These themes are brought home as much by the form in which they are presented as by their actual mention.", "God (Heb. <i>elohim</i>, a generic term) is introduced into the narrative without any description of origins, sex, or limitations of power. As the only functioning character of the chapter, he occupies center stage. There is no opposition, no resistance to his acts of creation, which occur in perfect harmony with his express word.", "As a sign of both God\u2019s total control and his intent, the world unfolds in symmetrical order. The division of God\u2019s labor into six days, plus a seventh for rest, itself indicates a powerful meaningfulness at work, as well as providing the external structure for the narrative. Interpreters have tended to divide these into either three groups of two days or two groups of three, with always the same results: a balanced and harmonious whole. In addition, the number seven is significant (as it will be elsewhere in the Bible) as a symbol of perfection, not only in Israel but in the ancient world in general.", "The narrative uses several repeating words and phrases to both unify the story and underscore the theme of order. These include \u201cGod said,\u201d \u201cLet there be\u2026,\u201d \u201cGod saw that it was good,\u201d \u201cIt was so,\u201d and \u201cThere was setting, there was dawning. \u2026\u201d", "<img src=\"images/Art_P1.jpg\" alt=\"art\"/>", "The text is so formed as to highlight the creation of humankind. Although in each previous day \u201cGod said\u201d is the keynote, suggesting forethought as well as action, here (v.26) God fully spells out his intentions, as it were, thinking out loud. Humanity, created in the divine \u201cimage,\u201d is to hold sway over the rest of creation. Only with the addition of humankind is God able to survey his newly formed world and to pronounce it \u201cexceedingly good\u201d (v.31).", "At least two motifs appear in this chapter which will become important later in Genesis. The three occurrences of \u201cblessing\u201d (1:22, 1:28, 2:3) point to a central idea in the Patriarchal stories. In addition the concept of order and its logical conclusion\u2014that history makes sense\u2014figures prominently in the familial histories of the book. This is accomplished largely by the meaningful use of numbers, as above.", "The entire account concludes (2:1\u20133) with a tightly structured poem. \u201cGod,\u201d \u201cthe seventh day,\u201d \u201cwork,\u201d and \u201cmade\u201d are mentioned three times, \u201cfinished,\u201d \u201cceased,\u201d and \u201call\u201d twice; and \u201ccreated\u201d returns, echoing 1:1, to round out the whole creation narrative.", "The postscript (2:4a; some scholars align it with what follows in Chap. 2 instead) introduces the key structural phrase of Genesis, \u201cThese are the begettings.\u2026\u201d It may also indicate the polemical intent of the creation story. Rosenzweig understood the verse to contrast \u201cbegetting,\u201d i.e., sexual creation as it occurs in non-Israelite myths, with the \u201ctrue\u201d creation.", "In that vein, a final word needs to be said about extrabiblical evidence. As has often been pointed out, Gen. I is unmistakably reacting against prevailing Near Eastern cosmogonies of the time. Most of the cultures surrounding ancient Israel had elaborate creation stories, highlighting the birth, sexuality, and violent uprisings of the gods. As we indicated at the outset, the concept of God presented here militates against such ideas, arguing chiefly out of omission and silence. (It should also be noted that in poetic books such as Isaiah, Job, and Psalms, a tradition about violent conflict at creation has been preserved.) The Genesis narrative has taken such old mythological motifs as battles with the primeval (female) waters or with sea monsters and eliminated or neutralized them. What remains is both utterly simple and radical in its time."], "Garden and Expulsion": ["Genesis 2:4-3:24", "From the perspective of God in Chap. 1, we now switch to that of humankind (note how the opening phrase in 2:4, \u201cearth and heaven,\u201d reverses the order found in 1:1). This most famous of all Genesis stories contains an assortment of mythic elements and images which are common to human views of prehistory: the lush garden, four central rivers located (at least partially) in fabled lands, the mysterious trees anchoring the garden (and the world?), a primeval man and woman living in unashamed nakedness, an animal that talks, and a God who converses regularly and intimately with his creatures. The narrative presents itself, at least on the surface, as a story of origins. We are to learn the roots of human sexual feelings, of pain in childbirth, and how the anomalous snake (a land creature with no legs) came to assume its present form. Most strikingly, of course, the story seeks to explain the origin of the event most central to human consciousness: death.", "The narrative unfolds through a series of contrasts: good and evil, life and death, heaven and earth, give and take, knowledge and ignorance, humans and animals, hiding and revealing. Some of these concepts appear literally as key words in the text. The characters also appear through contrasts: man as God\u2019s image and as dust, woman as helper and hinderer, the snake as shrewd and (after the curse) lowly.", "A further focus is provided by the echoing of the word \u201ceat,\u201d whose connotation changes from sustenance/bounty (2:9, 16) to prohibition (2:17) to misunderstanding (3:1\u20135) and disobedience (3:6, 11\u201313), and finally to curse (3:14, 17, 19). Such a flexible use of words sets up a rhythmic drama which, as much of Genesis, bears resemblance to poetry rather than to prose.", "Part I of the story (Chap. 2) sets the stage in the garden, focusing on <i>Adam</i>, \u201cEveryman\u201d (see <i>Cambridge Bible Commentary</i>, Gen. I\u2013II). God is here regularly called \u201cY<small>HWH</small>, God,\u201d a rare designation which may suggest a preexpulsion view of the wholeness of God as well as of humankind. Man continues his status as \u201cGod\u2019s image\u201d (1:26\u201327), imitating the divine act of giving names (1:5, 8, 10). He is also nevertheless a creature of the dust, both at the beginning (2:7) and end (3:19) of the story.", "The bridge to Part II (Chap. 3) is deftly accomplished by linking two identical\u00adsounding words in the Hebrew, <i>arum</i> (here, \u201cnude\u201d and \u201cshrewd\u201d). The choice of the snake as the third character is typically ancient Near Eastern (it is so used in other stories about death and immortality, such as the <i>Gilgamesh Epic</i> from Mesopotamia). Some interpreters have seen sexual overtones in this choice as well. Yet a plain reading of the text need not overemphasize the snake, who disappears as a personality once the fatal fruit has been eaten.", "The ending of the story has also raised questions of interpretation. Buber was among those who see in the act of expulsion from the garden a deed of mercy rather than one of fear or jealousy. Certainly a creature whose first act upon acquiring new \u201cknowledge\u201d is to cover himself up poses no threat to the Creator. The text, like its late successor, the book of Job, may be suggesting that in the human sphere, unlike the divine, knowledge and mortality are inextricably linked. This is a tragic realization, but it is also the world as human beings know it.", "Although the specifics of this story are never again referred to in the Hebrew Bible, and are certainly not crucial for the rest of Genesis, one general theme <i>is</i> central to the Bible\u2019s worldview. This is that rebellion against or disobedience toward God and his laws results in banishment/estrangement and, literally or figuratively, death. Thus from the beginning the element of <i>choice</i>, so much stressed by the Prophets later on, is seen as the major element in human existence.", "All this said, it should be recognized that the garden story, like many biblical texts, has been the subject of endless interpretation. One line of thought takes the psychological point of view. The story resembles a vision of childhood and of the transition to the contradictions and pain of adolescence and adulthood. In every way\u2014moral, sexual, and intellectual\u2014Adam and Havva are like children, and their actions after partaking of the fruit seem like the actions of those who are unable to cope with newfound powers. The resolution of the story, banishment from the garden, suggests the tragic realization that human beings must make their way through the world with the knowledge of death and with great physical difficulty. At the same time the archetypal man and woman do not make the journey alone. They are provided with protection (clothing), given to them by the same God who punished them for their disobedience. We thus symbolically enter adulthood with the realization that being turned out of Paradise does not mean eternal rejection or hopelessness."], "The First Brothers": ["Genesis 4:1-16", "With the story of Kayin and Hevel the narrative points both forward and backward. For the first time the major Genesis themes of struggle and sibling hatred, and discontinuity between the generations, make their appearance. In addition the concept of <i>sin</i> is introduced (Rosenzweig), having not appeared by name previously.", "One may observe significant links to the garden story. Once again human beings are given a choice; once again disregarding the warning leads to death and estrangement from God; and once again the primal bond between humanity and the soil is ruptured. Chapter 3 is directly recalled by the use of specific wording: God echoes the curse he had put on the woman (3:16) in his warning to Kayin (4:7), and \u201cWhere is Hevel your brother?\u201d (4:9) brings to mind \u201cWhere are you?\u201d (3:9), which had been addressed to Kayin\u2019s father.", "The text is punctuated by the use of \u201cbrother,\u201d a meaningful seven times, as well as by changing connotations of the word \u201cface\u201d (Kayin, unable to bring about a lifting of his own face, becomes estranged from God\u2019s). Repetition also helps to convey the harshness of Kayin\u2019s punishment: he is exiled to the \u201cland of Nod/Wandering\u201d (v.16), for which we have been prepared by the \u201cwavering and wandering\u201d of verses 12 and 14.", "Although this story may well have originated as a tale of enmity between two ways of life (farmer and shepherd), or in another context, it has obviously been transformed into something far more disturbing and universal."], "The Line of Kayin": ["Genesis 4:17-26", "From whole stories the text turns to several brief accounts, some of which are clearly fragments. The first of these deals with origins: of cities, of certain crafts, and of worship. The former two are associated (perhaps negatively) with Kayin s line. The only personality in these texts about whom we learn anything is Lemekh\u2014and his \u201csaying\u201d (vv.23\u201324) seems hopelessly obscure. Some interpreters have understood it as a challenge to God, and thus believe that it has been included here as an example of the wickedness typical of the generations that preceded the Flood.", "The names of Adam and Havva\u2019s son and grandson (vv.25\u201326) are sad reminders of Hevel\u2019s death\u2014a personal touch in an otherwise prosaic section of narrative."], "From Adam to Noah": ["Genesis 5:1-32", "The extraordinary numbers in this section are significant, not so much for their length as for their message. Cassuto has tried to fit them into a defined scheme, showing that the purpose, and achieved effect, of our text is to convey that human history follows a meaningful pattern. Pride of place on the list is occupied by the seventh member, Hanokh, who is portrayed as the first man of God. He serves as a preparation for Noah, who also \u201cwalks in accord with God\u201d (6:9). Hanokh\u2019s life span, 365 years, exemplifies the number scheme of Genesis: as an expression of numerical perfection (the number of days in a year), it symbolizes moral perfection."], "Antiquity and the Preparation for the Flood": ["Genesis 6:1-8", "The final pre-Flood section of the text includes a theme common to other ancient tales: the biological mixing of gods and men in dim antiquity. Perhaps this fragment, which initially seems difficult to reconcile with biblical ideas about God, has been retained here to round out a picture familiar to ancient readers, and to recall the early closeness of the divine and the human which, according to many cultures, later dissolved. It is also possible that the episode serves as another example of a world that has become disordered, thus providing further justification for a divinely ordered destruction.", "The stage is set for the Flood by means of a powerful sound reference. In 5:29 Noah was named, ostensibly to comfort his elders\u2019 \u201csorrow\u201d over human \u201cpains\u201d in tilling the soil. Here (6:6), however, the meaning of the name has been ironically reversed. The one who was supposed to bring comfort only heralds God\u2019s own being \u201csorry\u201d and \u201cpained\u201d (vv. 6\u20137). A similar ironic wordplay, where the audience knows what the name-bestower does not, occurs in Ex. 2:3; curiously, the hero of that passage, the baby Moses, is also connected with an \u201cark\u201d\u2014the term for the little basket in which he is set adrift."], "The Deluge": ["Genesis 6:9-8:19", "The biblical account of the Flood is replete with echoes and allusions which point to three clear motifs: God\u2019s justice, the totality of punishment, and a new beginning patterned after Gen. I.", "The first of these is brought out in 6:11\u201313: the repetition of the word \u201cruin\u201d indicates not only the sorry state of society but also the principle of just retaliation, for God is to \u201cbring ruin\u201d upon the earth (v.13).", "The totality of the disaster is conveyed by the repeated use of the word \u201call\u201d in 7:21\u201323, as well as by the completeness of the list of those destroyed (7:21\u201323). Humans, as befits their place in the order of creation, appear last, but actually it is they who drag virtually all of creation down with them. This reflects a deeply held biblical idea that human action directly affects the orderly and otherwise neutral functioning of nature.", "There are striking parallels between the Flood narrative and the creation account of Chap. 1. Just as the animals were created, each \u201caccording to its kind,\u201d their rescue, both in boarding and leaving the Ark, is similarly worded. \u201cOcean\u201d and the great \u201crushing-wind\u201d which existed at creation (1:2) return here, the former to signify a lapse into chaos and the latter, the restoration of order and peace (7:11, 8:1). Finally, after the Flood (9:1\u20133) Noah is blessed in wording that recalls Adam\u2019s blessing in 1:28\u201330. The world thus begins anew, with the implication of some hope for the future.", "Repetition emphasizes other aspects of the story\u2019s message. In general the word-stem \u201clive\u201d occurs constantly throughout the text, highlighting the rescue and renewal of life as well as its destruction. Noah\u2019s obedience, another major theme, is indicated by variations on the phrase \u201caccording to all that God commanded him, so he did\u201d (6:22). Of rhythmical, almost ritual-sounding import is the phrase \u201cyou and your sons and your wife and your sons\u2019 wives.\u201d", "Our story has often been compared, with much justification, to the several Mesopotamian Flood accounts (e.g., in the <i>Gilgamesh</i> and <i>Atrahasis</i> epics), with which it shares a great deal of detail. At one time scholars were quick to concentrate on the parallels, but the differences are now recognized as being much more significant. In general one may say that in contrast to the earlier (Mesopotamian) versions the biblical one is unambiguous in both tone and intent. It has been placed in Genesis to exemplify a God who judges the world according to human behavior, punishes evil and rescues the righteous. This is a far cry from the earlier accounts, where the gods plan the destruction of the world for reasons that are unclear (or in one version, because humankind\u2019s noise is disturbing the sleep of the gods), and where the protagonist, Utnapishtim, is saved as the result of a god\u2019s favoritism without any moral judgments being passed."], "Aftermath": ["Genesis 8:20-9:19", "The passages immediately following the Flood narrative speak of a God who is remarkably receptive to a human kind of change. From having been \u201csorry\u201d that he created humankind (6:6), he now evinces a change of heart about the entire issue of evil, conceding human imperfections (8:21). In a wonderfully structured declaration, where \u201cnever again\u201d moves in position from the middle to the beginning of the phrase (8:21\u201322), God as it were chooses to restrain his own ability to radically disturb the processes of nature. Where later on in Genesis the human characters exhibit the capacity to change, here it is God himself.", "The blessing in 9:1\u20133 establishes Noah as a kind of second Adam (and it might be noted that chronologically Noah is the first man born after Adam dies). It repeats the basic formulation of the blessing in 1:28\u201330, with an important exception: meat-eating is now to be allowed, as part of God\u2019s concession to human nature. Previously only the plant world had been accessible to humankind for food. However\u2014and this very word punctuates the text twice in 9:4\u20135\u2014there is to be an accounting for willful bloodshed, as if to suggest that the eating of meat is being permitted only under strict conditions. To underscore the importance of this concept, the section about bloodshed uses the vocabulary of creation: human beings are made \u201cin the image of God.\u201d", "With vv.8 and 9 the key concept of \u201ccovenant\u201d is established in fact for the first time in the Bible. It is accompanied, as is usual in the Bible, by a symbol or \u201csign\u201d (in this case, the rainbow). We are led back to the creation story again, as other biblical texts speak of the Sabbath as a \u201csign of the covenant\u201d between God and Israel (e.g., Ex. 31:12\u201317).", "The sixfold repetition of the phrase \u201cnever again\u201d provides a thematic unity in these passages."], "Drunkenness and Nakedness": ["Genesis 9:20-29", "From the lofty poetry of God\u2019s blessings and promises, we encounter an all-too-brief description of a bizarre event. The soil, which evidently has not entirely shaken off its primeval curse, proves once again to be a source of trouble. The nature of the crime mentioned here (\u201cseeing the father\u2019s nakedness\u201d) has been variously interpreted; Buber and others see in it a reference to the sexual \u201cimmorality\u201d of the Canaanites, which the Israelites found particularly abhorrent. This would explain the emphasis on the <i>son</i> of the culprit in the story, rather than on the perpetrator.", "A similar undistinguished ancestry is traced in Chap. 19, referring to the incestuous origins of Israel\u2019s neighbors and frequent enemies, the Moabites and Ammonites."], "The Table of the Nations": ["Genesis 10:1-32", "Genesis, with its typically ancient Near Eastern emphasis on \u201cbegettings,\u201d now traces the development of humanity from the sons of Noah. The key formula throughout is \u201ctheir lands, their nations.\u201d Commentators have noted numerical unity in the list, citing a total of seventy nations (once repetitions are omitted) laid out in multiples of seven. That number, as we have indicated, represents the concept of totality and perfection in the Bible. Thus the stage is set for the Babel story of the next chapter, with its condemnation of humanity\u2019s attempt to forestall the divinely willed \u201cscattering\u201d into a well-ordered world.", "Many of the names in this chapter have been identified (see Speiser), but some are still not known with certainty. Israel is conspicuous in its absence; despite the biblical narrative\u2019s ability to trace Israel\u2019s origins, those origins are meant to be seen not solely in biological terms but rather in terms of God\u2019s choice. Similarly, Israel arises from women who begin as barren\u2014thus pointing to divine intervention in history, rather than the perfectly normal account that we have here."], "The Unfinished Citadel": ["Genesis 11:1-9", "At its most obvious, in an isolated context, this famous story is about the overweening pride of man, as represented by his technology. God\u2019s actions here recall the ending of the garden story, where humanity was also within reach of the divine.", "Yet more is involved than a threat. Buber felt that this episode has been inserted at this point to show that humanity has failed again, as at the time of the Flood. It has not spread out and divided into nations, as in Chap. 10. The failure paves the way for a new divine plan, which is to be realized through one man (Avraham) and his descendants.", "Structurally, the story is a tiny literary masterpiece. It utilizes numerous plays on sound which make meaningful and often ironic linkages between sections and ideas in the text. Most significant is how the general message\u2014that God\u2019s response occurs in exactly the same terms as the human challenge (i.e., divine justice)\u2014is transmitted by means of form. Fokkelman has provided a detailed study; it will suffice here to indicate only the outline. The divine \u201cCome-now!\u201d of v.7 clearly stands as an answer to humankind\u2019s identical cry in vv.3 and 4. In addition humans, who congregated in order to establish a \u201cname\u201d and to avoid being \u201cscattered over the face of all the earth\u201d (v.4), are contravened by the action of God, resulting in the ironic name \u201cBabble\u201d and a subsequent \u201cscattering\u201d of humanity (v.9). The text is thus another brilliant example of biblical justice, a statement about a worldview in which the laws of justice and morality are as neatly balanced as we like to think the laws of nature are.", "There is an important cultural background to the story. \u201cShinar\u201d refers to Mesopotamia, and the \u201ctower,\u201d undoubtedly, to the ubiquitous <i>ziggurratu</i> (now unearthed by archeologists) which served as man-made sacred mountains (i.e., temples). By portraying an unfinished tower, by dispersing the builders, and by in essence making fun of the mighty name of Babylon, the text functions effectively to repudiate the culture from which the people of Israel sprang (Avram\u2019s \u201cUr\u201d of 11:28 was probably the great Mesopotamian metropolis). From Chap. 12 on, a new worldview is created."], "Noah to Avram": ["Genesis 11:10-32", "Here are enumerated another ten generations, making the orderly connection between the origins of the world (Noah was viewed as a second Adam) and the origins of the people of Israel. The life spans are considerably shorter than those of Chap. 5, yet some sort of careful number scheme seems evident here as well (see Cassuto 1972).", "Beginning with v.26 we are introduced to Avram, with little hint of what is to come in his momentous life. For the moment he is only a son, a brother, and a husband, and a man whose early life is marked principally by the death of the old world (Haran and Terah), with little hope for the new (his wife is barren)."]}, "The Patriarchal Narratives": {"The Call and the Journey": ["Genesis 12:1-9", "The Avraham cycle begins decisively, with a command from God to leave the past behind and go to an unnamed land. Prominent in this speech, clearly, is the concept of blessing, which will be realized by the gifts of land (Canaan) and seed (Yitzhak, the son)."], "The Wife I": ["Genesis 12:10-20", "Almost immediately upon his arrival in the promised land Avram is forced to leave it.

Equally important, he is respected by foreigners, a theme that will return both in Genesis and later. Perhaps this very different story has been included here as part of the early sections of the cycle in order to establish Avram\u2019s status and stature. He is no longer merely a wanderer but well on the road to becoming a powerful local figure."], "The Covenant between the Pieces": ["Genesis 15:1-21", "Amid scenes of great drama and almost mystery, a number of significant motifs are presented: (1) Avram\u2019s expressions of doubt that God will keep his promise about descendants (thus heightening the tension and final miracle of Yitzhak\u2019s birth); (2) the linking of the Patriarch to the event of the Exodus centuries later; and (3) the \u201ccutting\u201d of a covenant, in a manner well known in the ancient world.

In this chapter Avram is given a command to perform\u2014not only of circumcision, but to be moral and upright (v.1, expanded in 18:19).

And Avraham, the man through whom the nations \u201cwill find blessing\u201d (v.18; see 12:3), the progenitor of \u201ca great \u2026 nation\u201d (v.18; see 12:2) that will see injustice its great goal, is now confronted with an urgent question of justice. While Avraham seems to be testing God in this story, it may in fact be precisely the reverse that is intended. Perhaps here more than anywhere else in the entire cycle (with the possible exception of Chap. 22), Avraham appears as the worthy father of his people, the one who will \u201ccharge his sons and his household \u2026 to do what is right and just\u201d (v.19).

And Avraham, the man through whom the nations \u201cwill find blessing\u201d (v.18; see 12:3), the progenitor of \u201ca great \u2026 nation\u201d (v.18; see 12:2) that will see injustice its great goal, is now confronted with an urgent question of justice. While Avraham seems to be testing God in this story, it may in fact be precisely the reverse that is intended. Perhaps here more than anywhere else in the entire cycle (with the possible exception of Chap. 22), Avraham appears as the worthy father of his people, the one who will \u201ccharge his sons and his household \u2026 to do what is right and just\u201d (v.19). Without this story Avraham would be a man of faith but not a man of compassion and moral outrage, a model consistent with Moses and the Prophets of Israel.", "The tightly structured, almost formal dialogue allows us to focus totally on the issue at hand. Predominating as refrains are the words \u201cinnocent\u201d and \u201cguilty,\u201d along with the expected versions of \u201cjust/justice\u201d that pervade Avraham\u2019s remarks."], "The End of Sedom and Amora": ["Genesis 19:1-38", "The detailed and colorful story of Lot in Sedom and in flight from it adds a great deal to the Avraham cycle. On the one hand there is the portrayal of Lot\u2019s continuing his uncle\u2019s tradition of hospitality (vv.1\u20133), even to the extent of being willing to sacrifice his own daughters\u2019 virginity. On the other hand Lot comes across as timid (vv.7\u20138) and fearful (vv.18\u201320). In fact the word \u201cpray\u201d (which we noted in Chap. 18 as a \u201chospitality term,\u201d and which serves that function in verse 2 here as well) is used later in this chapter in a way that almost suggests whining. He thus once again brings Avraham\u2019s personality into sharper focus.", "The crimes of Sedom and Amora are at last indicated more openly: abuse of the sacred duty of hospitality, and sexual immorality (v.5). The latter theme returns at the end of the story, with the incestuous incident that takes place at the instigation of Lot\u2019s daughters.", "The story uses some stylized vocabulary. In v.13, the messengers talk of \u201cbringing ruin,\u201d just as we encountered in the Flood narrative (6:13). The narrative also gives negative twists to words which were positive in the previous chapter: \u201cknow\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d are changed to indicate illicit sex (v.5) and a condemnation of the alien Lot (v.9, \u201cact-the-judge and adjudicate\u201d). Here too, \u201cdoor/entrance\u201d is transformed from a place of contact with God to one of confrontation with men.", "The account of the destruction itself is terse and mysterious, but it also reveals the predicament of an all-too-human man, Lot.", "The final section of the Sedom and Amora story recounts the origins of two of Israel\u2019s neighbors, the Moabites and Ammonites. As traditional enemies, they are not treated very kindly, any more than was the ancestor of the Canaanites in 9:20\u201327."], "The Wife II": ["Genesis 20:1-18", "The second occurrence of \u201cThe Matriarch Protected\u201d comes immediately before the story of Yitzhak\u2019s birth, as if to emphasize God\u2019s hand in the process one more time. In this long variation on the theme, God is most active and Avraham most revealing of his past. He emerges from danger as a man who clearly enjoys God\u2019s full protection and bounty.", "The story almost draws a web of magic around Sara. Avimelekh is nearly killed by God, and Sara\u2019s childlessness is inflicted upon all the women in the king\u2019s household\u2014even though there is not the slightest doubt of his innocence (he \u201chad not come near her\u201d)."], "Yitzhak Born": ["Genesis 21:1-8", "Two principal ideas punctuate this climax for which we have waited since Chap. 12: God keeps his promises (hence the poem in v.1), and the key word in the stories about Yitzhak: \u201claughter\u201d (here the result of the actual birth)."], "Yishmael Banished": ["Genesis 21:9-21", "Once Yitzhak has been born, separation must be made between heir and firstborn. Despite Avraham\u2019s obvious love for him, Yishmael must leave; his mother must repeat her ordeal of Chap. 16 as well. Nonetheless the text emphasizes that God is there \u201cwith the lad\u201d (v.20); twice the Yishmael motif of \u201cGod hearkening\u201d resounds (v.17); and God promises that the boy will eventually attain the same exalted status as his brother (vv.13, 18).", "Structurally, this brief tale foreshadows the next chapter, the ordeal of Yitzhak. It speaks of a journey into the unknown, a child at the point of death, the intervention of God\u2019s \u201cmessenger,\u201d the parent\u2019s sighting of the way out, and the promise of future blessing. Of course the differences between the two stories are equally important."], "Treaty": ["Genesis 21:22-34", "This interlude, which usefully separates the life threats to Avraham\u2019s two sons (for a similar example, see I Sam. 25), is one of many scenes demonstrating Avraham\u2019s relationship with local princes."], "The Great Test": ["Genesis 22:1-24", "This story is certainly one of the masterpieces of biblical literature. In a famous article by Erich Auerbach it is remarked how biblical style as exemplified here, in contradistinction to that of Homer and other epic bards, eschews physical and psychological details in favor of one central preoccupation: a man\u2019s decision in relation to God. The result of this style is a terrible intensity, a story which is so stark as to be almost unbearable.", "Chap. 22 is a tale of God\u2019s seeming retraction of his promise (of \u201cseed\u201d) to Avraham. The fact that other issues may be involved here (i.e., Israel\u2019s rejection of local and widely practiced ideas of child sacrifice) may be quite beside the point. Coming just one chapter after the birth of the long-awaited son, the story completely turns around the tension of the whole cycle and creates a new, frightening tension of its own. The real horror of the story lies in this threatened contradiction to what has gone before.", "Most noticeable in the narrative is Avraham\u2019s silence, his mute acceptance of, and acting on, God\u2019s command. We are told of no sleepless night, nor does he ever say a word to God. Instead he is described with a series of verbs: starting-early, saddling, taking, splitting, arising, going (v.3; similarly in vv.6 and 9\u201310). Avraham the bargainer, so willing to enter into negotiations with relations (Chap. 13), allies (Chap. 14), local princes (Chap. 20), and even God himself (Chap. 18), here falls completely silent.", "The chapter serves an important structural function in the Avraham cycle, framing it in conjunction with Chap. 12. The triplet in v.2 (\u201cPray take your son,/ your only-one,/ whom you love\u201d) recalls \u201cfrom your land/ from your kindred/ from your father\u2019s house\u201d in 12:1; \u201cgo-you-forth\u201d and \u201cthe land that I will tell you of\u201d (v.2; the latter, three times in the story) similarly point back to Avraham\u2019s call (12:1, \u201cGo-you-forth \u2026 to the land that I will let you see\u201d). There he had been asked to give up the past (his father); here, the future (his son). Between the two events lies Avraham\u2019s active life as man of God, ancestor, and intercessor. After this God will never speak with him again.", "In many ways this story is the midpoint of Genesis. It brings the central theme of continuity and discontinuity to a head in the strongest possible way. After Moriyya, we can breathe easier, knowing that God will come to the rescue of his chosen ones in the direst of circumstances. At the same time we are left to ponder the difficulties of being a chosen one, subject to such an incredible test.", "The story is also the paradigmatic narrative of the entire book. The Patriarch passes the test, and we know that the fulfillment of the divine promise is assured. Yet there is an ominous note: love, which occurs here by name for the first time, leads almost to heartbreak. So it will be for the rest of Genesis."], "Purchase and Burial": ["Genesis 23:1-20", "Even though he is now secure in God\u2019s covenant, Avraham must still live and function in the human world. His purchase of a burial plot for Sara shows us once more his dealings with his neighbors, here as their equal, and also establishes at last his legal foothold in Canaan, albeit with a small piece of land. The long conversations and considerable formality of the chapter, which are not unusual in an ancient Near Eastern context, contrast with the extreme brevity of the previous chapter.", "The narrative strikes a curious balance between the emotional reality of the situation (e.g., the repetition of \u201cdead,\u201d \u201cpresence,\u201d and \u201cbury\u201d) and the requirements of legal procedure (\u201cHear me,\u201d \u201cgive title,\u201d and \u201cholding\u201d)."], "The Betrothal Journey": ["Genesis 24:1-67", "The last full episode of the Avraham cycle is the longest in the book. Its leisurely pace, attention to detail, and concentration on speeches as well as action belie the importance of what is being recounted: the finding of a wife for Yitzhak, who is biologically to continue the line. Yet after all that has happened in the previous chapters, we know that this will be taken care of by God. That is implied in Avraham\u2019s assured \u201che himself [God] will send his messenger on before you\u201d (v.7).", "Many meeting/betrothal scenes in the Bible take place at a well (e.g., Yaakov, Moshe); this was probably a literary convention (see Culley 1976b and Alter 1981 for a discussion of the significance of such a phenomenon). Like other crucial moments in Avraham\u2019s life the chapter involves a journey, albeit one made by his emissary. It is therefore natural that the key words of the chapter are \u201cgo,\u201d \u201cjourney,\u201d and \u201cgrant success.\u201d \u201cTake\u201d also appears frequently, as the biblical term often used for \u201cmarry.\u201d"], "Avraham's Descendants and Death": ["Genesis 25:1-18", "Avraham\u2019s death is bracketed by two passages dealing with his offspring: first, through Ketura (a concubine), and then through Hagar (Yishmael\u2019s line).

From the first, vv. 19\u201328, all the necessary conditions are introduced for what is to come: struggle in the womb (foreshadowing Yaakov\u2019s wrestling match in Chap. 32, the structural resolution of this earlier one), God\u2019s plan for the younger son to outdo the older one, the importance of names as clues to personalities, and parental preference. This last point seals the fate of the two boys.", "The second story (vv.29\u201334) is Yaakov\u2019s first act of stealth, and sets the pattern for his whole life.

Esav resembles Yishmael, the man of the bow; and parental preference will launch the initially tragic action in the Yosef story (Chap. 37)."], "In the Land": ["Genesis 26:1-6", "As we have suggested, there is no true collection of stories about Yitzhak. That is, virtually nowhere does Yitzhak appear in a tale where, as a distinct individual, he is a central character. And unlike Yaakov and Yosef, Yitzhak never directly receives his father\u2019s blessing. This is bestowed by God, and one gets the impression that even Avraham does not deal with his son as an individual. This is not surprising, given Yitzhak\u2019s function in his father\u2019s life.", "For the narrative, his main purpose, as we have stressed above, is simply to remain in the land (note the repetition of the word \u201cland\u201d in this section). It is almost as if Avraham, the man who lives in the shadow of sacred trees, plants one in the person of his son. In this chapter Yitzhak is forbidden to go beyond the borders of Canaan. Even his death, so seemingly out of place in Chap. 35, occurs after Yaakov has returned home from his wanderings: only when it is assured that there will be continuity in the land is he allowed to die\u2014despite the fact that as a result the text must leave him blind and dying for twenty years."], "The Wife III": ["Genesis 26:7-11", "Here is the final \u201cYitzhak version\u201d of the tale, constructed around the same king whom Avraham had encountered in Chap. 20. Its individual coloring is supplied by the \u201claughing-and-loving\u201d of v.8, playing on Yitzhak\u2019s name. Otherwise, just as in the following episode, he is merely repeating his father\u2019s experience."], "Blessing": ["Genesis 26:12-33", "Confirmation of Yitzhak\u2019s status as heir comes in vv.12\u201314, in the form of material blessings (already referred to immediately after Avraham\u2019s death, 25:11).

Nowhere is the narrative so vivid as here, and nowhere, even including Chap. 22, is the tension so masterfully drawn out.", "Despite the fact that the story line is a simple one, involving deception and the \u201ctaking\u201d of the blessing, the text is imbued with great subtlety. Most striking is the sensuality it invokes: seven times we hear of \u201cgame,\u201d six of the \u201cdelicacy\u201d (or \u201ctasty-dish\u201d), and three times Yitzhak \u201cfeels\u201d Yaakov (who \u201ccomes close\u201d four times). In fact the story makes use of all five of the senses. One sense\u2014that of sight\u2014is defective, and on that deficiency will turn the action of the story. Yet another level of meaning is apparent: \u201cto see\u201d in ancient Israel, as in many cultures, was a term connected to prophetic powers, as we observed regarding Avraham. So here, ironically, Yitzhak\u2019s blindness leads to both deception and to the proper transferral of the blessing.", "Structurally the story is framed by two references to Esav and his wives: 26:34\u201335 prepares the way for his loss of the blessing, by showing that he has alienated himself from his parents (and broken Avraham\u2019s charge regarding Yitzhak in 24:3), and 28:6\u20139 finds Esav obeying his father and making a rather pathetic attempt to reassure himself of his love.", "Some of the story\u2019s motifs will return later. The threefold \u201cas he loves\u201d looks to the crucial role that the theme of \u201clove\u201d will play later on in Genesis (as well as being a key to the story itself).

The notion of a ladder or ramp (or \u201cgateway,\u201d v.17) between the divine and human worlds is well known in ancient stories. A variation of the theme occurs in 32:2\u20133, where Yaakov sees \u201cmessengers\u201d again in an \u201cencounter\u201d; these two stories frame the middle of the entire cycle.", "As Yaakov enters his adult life, he resembles both his grandfather Avraham, the visionary, and his son Yosef, the dreamer."], "Arrival in Aram": ["Genesis 29:1-14", "As one might expect from the usual biblical pattern, Yaakov meets his bride-to-be at a well.

The emotions, interestingly, are portrayed largely through the names given to Yaakov\u2019s sons.

The repeating words point to major themes: \u201cserve,\u201d \u201cwages,\u201d \u201cface\u201d (which will become central to the whole cycle by Chap. 32), and a whole vocabulary of trickery: \u201csteal\u201d (with the variations \u201cbe stealthy\u201d and \u201csteal the wits\u201d), \u201ctake away\u201d (see Chap. 27), \u201csnatch,\u201d and \u201crob.\u201d"], "Preparations for Esav": ["Genesis 32:2-24", "As if to portend something momentous, Yaakov\u2019s first act upon setting out for home is an encounter with \u201cmessengers of God.\u201d From this starting point everything is subsequently a matter of \u201ctwo camps\u201d (v.8) or two levels: the divine and the human.

Struggle, the motif already introduced in the mother\u2019s womb (Chap. 25), returns here, but that is not the only consideration. At issue is Yaakov\u2019s whole life and personality, which despite his recent material successes are still under the pall of Esav\u2019s curse (27:36). Central, then, is the change of name in v.29, which suggests both a victorious struggle and the emergence of a new power.

Some feel that the suspension in the drama helps to raise tension; others argue that this is the only possible place to put an important tradition about the important brother. While these and other arguments may have their merit, one may discern some significant thematic connections as well, both within the context of the Yosef story and of Genesis as a whole.", "The episode first of all demonstrates the growth of Yehuda as a character who is central to the Yosef novella. Already in Chap. 37 he had demonstrated active leadership, albeit in a questionable cause. There he actually saved Yosef\u2019s life, in contrast to Re\u2019uven\u2019s unsuccessful and ultimately self-centered rescue attempt. As the one who basically assumes responsibility, he will be made to undergo an inner development in the narrative, and again becomes the one to take charge of the youngest son (Binyamin, in Chaps. 43 and 44). The missing piece that begins to explain his nobility in this regard (Chap. 44) is the present chapter. Yehuda here learns what it is to lose sons, and to want desperately to protect his youngest. Although his failure to marry off Tamar to the youngest son leads to public humiliation (twice, actually), his response shows that he immediately accepts blame: \u201cShe is in-the-right more than I\u201d (v.26). Such an interpretation is further confirmed by the restriction of the word \u201cpledge\u201d to here and 43:9. Yehuda has learned what it means to stake oneself for a principle.", "Only after we have been informed of Yehuda\u2019s change can the narrative resume with Chap. 39. True to biblical thinking, redemption may start only after the crime has been punished (e.g., the Samson story, where the hero\u2019s hair begins to grow immediately after his imprisonment).", "Actually the chronology works out quite well. We are told via 41:46, 53\u201354, that about twenty years elapse between the sale of Yosef and his meetings with the brothers in Egypt; this often signifies a period in biblical parlance and could encompass a generation or a bit less. Since Yehuda was quite possibly a father already in Chap. 37, the present story could well end just before the events reported in Chap. 43\u2014in other words, Yehuda reaches full inner maturity just in time.", "The other function of this story seems to be to carry out the major theme of Genesis as we have presented it: continuity and discontinuity between the generations. What is at stake here is not merely the line of one of the brothers, but the line which (as the biblical audience must have been fully aware) will lead to royalty\u2014King David was a descendant of Peretz of v.29. This should not be surprising in a book of origins; we noted the possible mention of Jerusalem in 14:18. Apparently a popular early theme, connected as we have noted to the power of God in history, continuity/discontinuity is repeated in somewhat similar circumstances in the book of Ruth (which contains the only other mention of \u201cbegettings\u201d outside of Genesis and Num.3:1).", "The narrator has woven Chaps. 38 and 37 together with great skill. Again a man is asked to \u201crecognize\u201d objects, again the use of a kid, and again a brother (this time a dead one) is betrayed."], "Yosef: Rise and Fall": ["Genesis 39:1-23", "This chapter prefigures Yosef\u2019s eventual rise to power and simultaneously chronicles his lowest point, literally and figuratively. The two strands of the plot are woven together into a pattern of success/authority \u2192 imprisonment \u2192 success/authority. This also mirrors the larger story, which progresses from favorite son \u2192 slavery \u2192 viceroy of Egypt. The integration takes place partly through the medium of a key word, \u201chand\u201d\u2014which also occurred four times at the end of Chap. 38 and thus acts as a further textual connector. Yosef\u2019s success is tied six times to the phrase \u201cin his hands\u201d (vv.3, 4, 6, 8, 22, 23); he is thrown into prison because of the garments that he left in his mistress\u2019s \u201chands\u201d (vv.12, 13). Similarly, the movement of the chapter is mirrored in the word \u201ceyes,\u201d which is linked first to the theme of authority (v.4), then to the attempted seduction (v.7), and finally to authority again (v.21) (Alter).", "The chapter also repeats the phrase \u201cAnd it was\u201d (in one form or another) some twelve times, as a distinct stylistic pattern.", "Yosef\u2019s temporary downfall occurs here for reasons beyond literary balance or suspense. It is in a very real sense the punishment for the bratty behavior of his adolescence. Once again words (this time not his own) get him into trouble (vv.17, 19), as they did in 37:8. And once again a garment is displayed as proof of a fabricated crime."], "The Rise to Power: Dreams": ["Genesis 40:1-41:52", "Continued are the themes of Yosef\u2019s success in adversity and skill in interpreting dreams (yet his father and brother, and not he, had done the interpreting in Chap. 37!). In Chap. 37 dreams had brought about his downfall; here (Chap. 40) they will help the cupbearer and in Chap. 41 ultimately save a country, his family, and himself. Yosef\u2019s self-assurance and reliance on God, already evident in 39:9, here mean that it will not be long before he stands at the pinnacle.", "Yosef\u2019s dramatic rise to power is an old and favorite motif in folklore. The text colorfully presents Pharaoh\u2019s dreams, in great detail, especially in his emotional retelling. All the more striking then is Yosef\u2019s simple interpretation (41:23\u201327)."], "Famine: The Brothers Come": ["Genesis 41:53-42:38", "Worldwide famine creates the backdrop for the family drama that is about to unfold. The ancients understood famine as sent by the gods, often as punishment; and the events of our text suggest that God is indeed the prime mover here. We are again presented with the characters of Chap. 37, all of whom have somehow changed. Yaakov emerges as more pitiful than ever (a shadow of the wrestler at the Yabbok), Yosef as powerful governor, not only of all Egypt but of his family\u2019s destiny as well, and the brothers, remarkably, are repentant (42:21\u201322). We also see Yosef\u2019s emotional side for the first time. He weeps in 42:24, as he will do three times again (43:30; 45:2, 14\u201315)."], "The Test": ["Genesis 43:1-44:34", "Yosef\u2019s testing of his brothers is masterful, not only because of the plan itself, but also because of the depth of emotion that the text evokes in its characterizations. It demonstrates how well the whole story has been integrated into the Yaakov material, for here as well as there long conversations are used to reveal complex passions.", "Some have questioned the morality of Yosef\u2019s actions, seeing that the aged Yaakov might well have died while the test was progressing, without ever finding out that Yosef had survived. But that is not the point of the story. What it <i>is</i> trying to teach (among other things) is a lesson about crime and repentance. Only by recreating something of the original situation\u2014the brothers are again in control of the life and death of a son of Rahel\u2014can Yosef be sure that they have changed. Once the brothers pass the test, life and covenant can then continue."], "Reconciliation": ["Genesis 45:1-28", "In revealing his true identity at last, Yosef makes two points: first, that it was all part of God\u2019s plan; and second, that the family must immediately prepare for migration to Egypt. Thus the personal story is intertwined with the national one, and the text therefore gives limited time and space to psychological details. The motif of God\u2019s plan is stressed by the repetition of \u201cGod sent me\u201d (vv.5, 7, 8), while the anticipated bounties of settling in Egypt are brought out by the threefold \u201cgood-things of Egypt\u201d (vv.18, 20, 23) and by the repeated exhortation to \u201ccome\u201d (vv.18, 19)."], "Migration to Egypt": ["Genesis 45:16-47:12", "Yaakov\u2019s descent to Egypt involves three meetings: with God, with Yosef, and with Pharaoh. The first is God\u2019s final revelation to Yaakov. God had previously forbidden Yitzhak to go to Egypt during a famine (26:1\u20132), but his son may now go as part of the divine plan, his people\u2019s destiny. The blessing given to Avraham\u2019s children (particularly to Yishmael) is repeated in 46:3, and God will be \u201cwith\u201d Yaakov (46:4) on this journey as he has been on others.", "The meeting between father and long-lost son is brief but powerful, returning as it does to the \u201cface\u201d motif (46:30). Immediately afterward Yosef gives the family advice on how to demonstrate their usefulness to the Egyptians, and one is struck by the precariousness of their situation in even this best of circumstances.", "Yaakov\u2019s brief audience with Pharaoh is both moving and pathetic. The Patriarch sums up his life in depressing terms, and it becomes clear that long life (he believes his own to be short), in addition to wealth and fertility, is considered a sign of divine favor.", "The actual migration is sketched in a few brief strokes. The list of names in 46:8\u201327 has been constructed on patterned numbers, with a total of seventy."], "Yosef the Life Giver": ["Genesis 47:13-26", "The events of this section are not attested historically in Egyptian records. Perhaps they have been included here to confirm Yosef\u2019s stature as Rescuer, not only of his family but of all Egypt as well (see note to 42:2).

Elder and younger sons are switched by the blind Patriarch, who this time, though, is one who is fully aware of their identities. As in both literature and life, a dying man sees both past (here) and future (the next chapter) with great clarity, as in a vision."], "Yaakov\u2019s Testament and Death": ["Genesis 49:1-33", "In this ancient piece of poetry, Yaakov addresses his sons, not as they are, but as they will be. There is little resemblance, for instance, between the Binyamin as the beloved and protected youngest son of the Yosef story and the preying wolf of v.27, but the Benjaminites were later to be known for their military skills. Scholars have therefore seen the entire poem as a retrojection of Israel as it came to be on the days of the Patriarchs.", "As in the fuller Yosef narrative, the first three sons are quickly disqualified from active leadership, paving the way for the rise of Yehuda (the tribe from which sprang David and the royal house of Israel). Despite this, Yosef still receives the richest blessing.", "The chapter is textually among the most difficult in the Torah. Many passages are simply obscure, leaving the translator to make at best educated guesses."], "Yaakov\u2019s Burial": ["Genesis 50:1-14", "The funeral of Yaakov seems to presage the Exodus from Egypt\u2014here with Pharaoh\u2019s permission and a large royal escort (including \u201cchariots and horsemen,\u201d who in several generations will pursue Yaakov\u2019s descendants into the sea).", "Interestingly, the <i>Iliad</i> also ends with an elaborate burial scene. The contrast is instructive: the Homeric epic celebrates the deeds and mourns the lost youth of a hero (Hector); Genesis reflects Yosef\u2019s standing at court and the desire to bury Yaakov in the land of Canaan, in the family plot. Note too that Genesis has two more scenes, tending to lessen the impact of this impressive funeral sequence."], "The End of the Matter": ["Genesis 50:15-26", "Drawing out the tension inherent in the Patriarchs\u2019 family relationships to the very end, the text repeats an earlier situation in Yaakov\u2019s life\u2014his brother\u2019s feelings of \u201cgrudge\u201d and threats to kill him\u2014in the guise of his sons\u2019 fears toward Yosef. Here, however, there can be no question of personal vengeance, since Yosef sees the brothers\u2019 betrayal of him as but part of a larger purpose. In his words of v.20, \u201cGod planned-it-over for good \u2026 to keep many people alive,\u201d the text resolves two of the great hanging issues that have persisted throughout Genesis: sibling hatred and the threat to generational continuity.", "Left hanging, of course, is the issue of the promised land, since the narrative concludes \u201cin Egypt,\u201d but these final chapters lead to the assurance that God will \u201ctake account\u201d (vv.24\u201325) of the Sons of Israel, as they are soon to be termed."]}, "Part I; The Deliverance Narrative": {"Prologue in Egypt": ["Exodus 1:1-22", "Rather than being presented as a totally separate story, the book of Exodus opens as a continuation of the Genesis saga. This is true both specifically and generally: the first five verses echo and compress the information about the descent of Yaakov\u2019s family into Egypt that was given in Gen. 46:8\u201327, while \u201cNow these are the names\u201d (v.1) recalls the oft-repeated formula \u201cNow these are the begettings,\u201d which forms the structural background of Genesis. At the same time one might note that the main subject matter of our chapter, life and death (or, threatened continuity), is central to the thematic content of Genesis (see my <i>At the Beginning,</i> \u201cOn the Book of Genesis and Its Structure\u201d).", "Kikawada and Ackerman (1974) have shown that the opening chapters of Exodus reflect other Genesis material as well. For instance, the five verbs in v.7 mirror the language of creation (Gen. 1:28 and 9:1\u20132), where a similar vocabulary of fecundity signals the divine desire to \u201cfill the earth.\u201d It is as if Israel\u2019s \u201cbecoming many\u201d in Exodus fulfills the plan of history inaugurated at creation, at the same time reminding us of God\u2019s promise to Avraham, to make his descendants as numerous \u201cas the stars in the heavens and [as] the sand that is on the shore of the sea\u201d (Gen. 22:17).", "This leads to the predominant issue of Chap. 1: Pharaoh\u2019s paranoid fears about Israel\u2019s growth. What for God was a sign of blessing (cf. the \u201cswarming\u201d of creatures in Gen. 1:20f.) is for Pharaoh a sign of disaster, a feeling of being overwhelmed by what is alien. The birth of the Israelite nation is thus placed in a vivid context, completely physical in its description. And because birth, and not the economic aspects of slavery, is central, the actual description of the oppression of the Hebrews has been reduced to a bare minimum here. Contrary to DeMille\u2019s spectacular and stereotyped portrayal of the Israelites\u2019 sufferings, the Bible limits itself to a few brief verses in the early chapters of the book. The same holds true for parallel depictions of bondage in biblical literature, such as Psalms 78 and 105. It is the experience of being a stranger in Egypt that the Bible has chosen to focus on, rather than on the horrors of slave labor.", "In Exodus, the Egyptians cannot stand having aliens among them (this theme has already appeared in Genesis regarding their eating habits\u2014see Gen. 43:32); they dread their presence and fear their increase. A natural plan of attack, to stem the human tide, is genocide. Ironically, because of his fear of war Pharaoh concentrates his worries around the males, ignoring the true source of fecundity. And it is the women in these chapters, as many commentators have pointed out (see Exum), who play the major role in beginning the liberation process. The midwives accomplish a successful coverup; Moshe\u2019s mother and sister, and Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, save the future liberator\u2019s life. \u201cIf she be a daughter, she may live\u201d (v.16), along with four other occurrences of \u201clive\u201d in vv.17\u201322, underscore the irony and the certainty of Israelite survival. The use of women\u2014a group that was often powerless in ancient societies\u2014in these stories makes the eventual victory of the Israelites all the more striking from a traditional patriarchal point of view (see Ackerman 1982); the motif returns a number of times in Israelite literature, as with Jael and Judith.", "Failing in his commissioning of special agents (midwives) to carry out his genocidal plan, Pharaoh finally must enlist \u201call his people\u201d (v.22), and shift the scene to a cosmic setting, the Nile. The stage is thus set for the birth, endangering, and rescue of Moshe.", "The historically minded reader may ask: Why would the ruler of a society that is (literally) built on slavery destroy his own workforce? Two answers are possible. First, the story is tied to Chap. 2, the survival of Moshe, and thus must be told to that end (a threat to males). Second, the story does not describe a rational fear, but paranoia\u2014paralleling the situation in Nazi Germany of the 1930s and 1940s, where Jews were blamed for various economic and political catastrophes not of their own making and were eliminated from a society that could have used their resources and manpower."], "Moshe\u2019s Birth and Early Life": ["Exodus 2:1-22", "Picking up from the last phrase of Chap. 1, \u201clet every daughter live,\u201d Chap. 2 opens as a story of three daughters (the word occurs six times here), Moshe\u2019s real and foster mothers, and his sister.", "It has long been maintained that the story of Moshe\u2019s birth is a classic \u201cbirth of the hero\u201d tale, sharing many features with other heroes of antiquity. (See p. 250.) The parallel most often drawn is that of Sargon of Akkad, whose birth story is set in an era before Moshe but was written down later; similar elements include being separated from the real parents through a death threat, and being set adrift on the river. Hallo cites other parallels in Hittite and Egyptian literature, noting at the same time that \u201cnone of them includes all of the elements of the Moses birth legend.\u201d", "If, as I maintained in the introduction (\u201cOn the Book of Exodus and Its Structure\u201d), most of this material has been collected for didactic and not for historical purposes, we are entitled to ask what this story was intended to teach. It cannot simply be written off as an attempt to explain away Moshe\u2019s name and origins. Two elements seem crucial. First, the text as we have it centers around the activity of women\u2014giving birth, hiding, watching and adopting Moshe. The female principle of life-giving triumphs over the male prerogatives of threatening and death-dealing; the Nile, source of all life in Egypt, births another child. Second, the story and its continuation to the end of the chapter set up Moshe as a man of two sides: Hebrew and Egyptian. He is at once archetypal victim (of Pharaoh\u2019s death decree) and archetypal collaborator, growing up, as he apparently does, in Pharaoh\u2019s palace. What are we to make of this two-sided fate and personality? It may well have been intended as a reflex of the people of Israel itself. Often in the Hebrew Bible the hero\u2019s life mirrors that of Israel (see Greenstein 1981), and the case of Moshe is a good example. Moshe develops into a Hebrew\u2014that is, he eventually recovers his full identity. This is accomplished, first, through his empathy with and actions on behalf of \u201chis brothers\u201d (vv.11, 12), then through his exile from Egypt, and finally through the purifying life in the wilderness as a shepherd. Thus Moshe\u2019s personality changes are wrought by means of separations, and the same process will characterize the coming Plague Narrative (with its emphasis on \u201cdistinction\u201d between Egypt and Israel) and the entire Israelite legal and ritual system, which stresses holiness and separation.", "The first section of the chapter (vv.1\u201310) uses a number of repeating words: \u201ctake\u201d appears four times, indicative of divine protection; \u201cchild,\u201d seven times (Greenberg 1969); and \u201csee,\u201d which as I have mentioned, will recur meaningfully in Chap. 3. There is also a threefold motif of death threat in the chapter: at birth, on the Nile, and at the hand of the avenging Pharaoh. Isbell notes several items of vocabulary (e.g., \u201cdeliver,\u201d \u201cfeared,\u201d \u201camid the reeds\u201d) that return in the victory account at the Sea of Reeds (Chap. 14).", "From the other two accounts here (vv.11\u201314 and 15\u201322), we learn all we need to know about Moshe\u2019s early personality: he is Hebrew-identifying but Egyptian-looking; concerned with justice, but impetuous and violent in pursuit of that goal. It is also ominous that his first contacts with the Israelites end in rejection, since that will so often be his experience with them later on. The doubly unsatisfactory situation of confused identity and impetuous means must be rectified, and it is exile that accomplishes it. The Midyanite wilderness transforms Moshe into shepherd, foreigner, father, and seer\u2014in short, into a son of the Patriarchs (see also \u201cOn the Journey Motif,\u201d above).", "Incredibly, the man whose activity is to span four whole books has, it seems, half his life (or, according to the chronology of 7:7, two-thirds of his life!) described in a single chapter. Typical of biblical storytelling, much has been compressed and left out, but enough is told to establish the person who is to come."], "God Takes Notice": ["Exodus 2:23-25", "Chap. 2 ends on a note that looks forward and backward simultaneously. The fourfold \u201cGod\u201d plus verb (vv.24\u201325) echo the same structure at Creation\u2019s first day (Gen. 1:3\u20135), and suggest that he puts his concern for the people of Israel on a par with his concern for creation of light (connoting \u201cgood\u201d in folklore). In addition, the four verbs used here play a prominent role in the entire Deliverance Narrative, as Isbell has shown.", "and also he drew, yes, drew for us and watered the sheep!"], "At the Bush: The Call": ["Exodus 3:1-4:17", "The great revelation scene in these two chapters, so much a classic in the literature of the West, comes as somewhat of a surprise in the close context of our story. Nothing in Exodus so far has prepared us for such a religious, inward vision on the part of Moshe; and indeed, Genesis itself contains no meeting between God and a human being of such a dramatic character. Adam and Avraham converse with God; Yaakov experiences him, to be sure, in dreams and in the guise of a wrestler; but nowhere thus far does one find a biblical hero encountering God with such intensity and purity of vision.", "The shepherd, now in the service of his father-in-law, the \u201cpriest,\u201d comes upon the \u201cmountain of God,\u201d \u201cbehind the wilderness.\u201d The results are those of an unintended or half-intended journey. Moshe, who had fled previously, finds himself at the utmost reaches of the wilderness, almost like Jonah in the bowels of the boat or of the great fish. The sight that Moshe is granted is of unclear nature, but it involves fire, with all its pregnant associations: passion, purity, light, mystery (Greenberg 1969), and here, inextinguishability.", "God\u2019s initial speech (vv.6\u201310) contains all the elements basic to the Deliverance Narrative: it identifies him as the ancestral deity, establishes his compassion for the oppressed people, demonstrates his resolve to rescue them, and ends with the commissioning of Moshe to be his emissary. Central here is the verb <i>see,</i> whose threefold occurrence (vv.7 and 9) ties together the threads of the previous parts of Moshe\u2019s story (see above).", "The entire scene is the model for the \u201ccall\u201d of the biblical prophet, with its emphasis on God\u2019s speaking to the fledgling prophet amid a vision and the motif of refusal; of the call scenes in the Bible, this is the longest and most memorable in its starkness. A man is called by God to return to society and serve as God\u2019s spokesperson\u2014despite any opposition he may encounter and despite his personal shortcomings. Moshe\u2019s reluctance, indeed his almost obsessive need to turn down the commission, is as much indicative of the general nature of prophecy (cf. Elijah and Jeremiah) as it is of Moshe\u2019s own personality. The prophet must be prepared \u201cto uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and plant\u201d (Jer. 1:10), and to stand tall against kings if necessary (Jer. 1:13). So it comes as no surprise that the call is met with less than enthusiasm. And this refusal also teaches something about Israel\u2019s political conceptions. With such a response as this, there can be no question of personal ambition or inner lust for power. The prophet does what he does out of compulsion: he is driven by forces that he perceives as external to him.", "In our text, Moshe refuses the commission five times, and five times God counters. In four of these cases the assurance is given that God will \u201cbe-there\u201d with him (3:12, 14; 4:12, 15), and the use of that verb carries in its essence one of the most significant motifs of the Bush Narrative: the interpretation of God\u2019s name.", "When Moshe asks God for his name in 3:13, he asks for more than a title (Buber and Rosenzweig 1994). In the context of Egyptian magic, knowing the true name of a person or a god meant that one could coerce him, or at the very least understand his true essence. Moshe foresees that the slaves will want to be able to call on this power that has promised to deliver them.", "God\u2019s answer is one of the most enigmatic and widely debated statements in the Hebrew Bible (the reader will want to consult Childs for a full bibliography). What does <i>ehyeh asher ehyeh</i> mean? One\u2019s suspicions are aroused from the outset, for the answer is alliterative and hence already not easy to pin down; the poetics of the phrase indicate both importance and vagueness or mystery. There is some scholarly consensus that the name may mean \u201cHe who causes (things) to be\u201d or perhaps \u201cHe who is.\u201d Buber and Rosenzweig, taking an entirely different tack (of which one occasionally finds echoes in the scholarly literature), interpret the verb <i>hayoh</i> as signifying presence, \u201cbeing-<i>there</i>,\u201d and hence see God\u2019s words as a real answer to the Israelites\u2019 imagined question\u2014an assurance of his presence. The B-R interpretation has been retained here, out of a desire to follow them on at least this significant point of theology, and out of my feeling that it also fits the smaller context. For of the several times that Moshe tries to wriggle out of his mission, God answers him all but once with the same verb, in the same meaning: \u201cI will be-there with you\u201d (note the parallel between Moshe and the people again).", "It is, however, also possible that <i>ehyeh asher ehyeh</i> is a deliberately vague phrase, whose purpose is antimagical and an attempt to evade the question (Rosenzweig speaks of this as well), as if to suggest that possession of the true name cannot be used to coerce this God. In this interpretation, it would follow that, just as God is magicless (see v. 20), he is nameless, at least in the conventional sense of religion. On the other hand, the name Y<small>hwh</small>, however it may have been vocalized throughout the history of the text, did function as a name in ancient Israel (and possibly outside of Israel as well). It was used in oaths (e.g., Gen. 22:16, II Sam. 12:5), and later, in the Second Temple period, limited in public pronunciation to the high priest on the Day of Atonement. As happens frequently in the history of religion, if we follow a concept long enough it transforms back to the beginning, often in an opposite meaning, and so when the use of Y<small>hwh</small> is traced through the Middle Ages one finds it turned into a magical name at the hands of Jewish mystics.", "To return to the Bush Narrative as a whole: these chapters introduce a number of important words that will recur throughout the enire Liberation Narrative. These include \u201ctrust,\u201d \u201chearken to (my) voice,\u201d \u201cstaff,\u201d \u201cheavy,\u201d \u201cgo out,\u201d \u201cstrong,\u201d \u201csend,\u201d and \u201cblood\u201d (see Isbell). It should also be mentioned that several key words occur in multiples of 7 from 2:23 to 4:31 (Cassuto): \u201csee\u201d (7), \u201csend\u201d (7), \u201cgo\u201d (14), \u201cmouth\u201d (7), \u201cspeak/word\u201d (Heb. <i>dabber/davar;</i> 7). This vocabulary in particular focuses the story around major aspects of prophecy.", "In the end, what does Moshe have with which to return from the mount of vision? In the DeMille film version his face and personality clearly change; in the biblical text, however, he comes back with a word\u2014the divine promise\u2014and a staff, \u201cwith which you shall do the signs\u201d (4:17). He had previously been a man whose lack of tolerance for injustice produced violence; now he is armed with words and a wonder-working object\u2014not a sword or a helmet, but a shepherd\u2019s staff."], "The Journey Back": ["Exodus 4:18-31", "It is clear that something has been inserted into the normal course of our narrative. What follows v.20 should be v.27; Moshe, ready to go back to Egypt, is met by Aharon in the wilderness, and they subsequently announce their mission to the Children of Israel. However, the editor has prefaced the brothers\u2019 meeting, first with a warning to Moshe that his mission will be strongly resisted by Pharaoh, and a warning that Moshe is to deliver to Pharaoh. Then follows a bizarre episode, which, like the Name passage discussed above, has provoked centuries of comment and attempts to explain it. What are we to make of the circumcision story here, especially the last scene, which is unclear not only in import but in details such as pronouns as well?", "Buber (1988) explains it as an event that sometimes occurs in hero stories: the deity appears as \u201cdivine demon\u201d and threatens the hero\u2019s life. Perhaps this underlines the dangerous side of contact between the human and the divine. But there seem to be other reasons for the passage\u2019s inclusion at this point in the text. First, it serves as an end bracket to Moshe\u2019s sojourn in Midyan. As mentioned earlier, Moshe flees Egypt under pain of death (2:15); here, on his return, he is in mortal danger once more. Second, our passage seems to be an <i>inclusio</i> or bracketing passage for the entire Plague Narrative (Kosmala and others). This is confirmed by the use of vv.21\u201323 as an introduction. God, designating Israel his firstborn and alluding to the future killing of Pharaoh\u2019s/Egypt\u2019s firstborn sons, demonstrates his power as life-taker, to be pacified or turned away only by a ceremonial blood-smearing\u2014parallel to the Israelites\u2019 smearing of blood on their doorposts when their own firstborn are threatened by the Tenth Plague (12:12\u201313).", "Two final points should be noted here. First, it is with the act of his son\u2019s circumcision that Moshe finally becomes a true Israelite (that, after all, was the major term of God\u2019s covenant with Abraham in Gen. 17). Similarly, Yehoshua (Joshua), Moshe\u2019s successor, will circumcise the next generation of Israelites in the process of conquering the Promised Land (Josh. 5:2). And second, it is telling, again, that the person who saves Moshe\u2019s life in adulthood is a woman. In a sense, Moshe\u2019s early life is now over, having come full circle."], "Before Pharaoh": ["Exodus 5:1-6:1", "Moshe and Aharon\u2019s initial efforts to free the people\u2014even temporarily for an act of worship\u2014are unsuccessful, as foretold in the previous chapter. But even though God had predicted failure, we are still left with a portrait of clashing human wills: the liberators\u2019, the king\u2019s, and the reluctant people\u2019s. The narrative appears to be a set-up for the second major revelation of God to Moshe (Chap. 6), which, preceded by expressions of doubt on both Moshe\u2019s part and that of the people, harks back to the concerns voiced at the Burning Bush. There is also a forward-looking figure, Pharaoh, who is a prototype for other foreign rulers and enemies in the Bible who challenge God (Greenberg 1969).", "Chap. 5 contains the Bible\u2019s most extended description of the conditions of Egyptian bondage. Not surprisingly, the root \u201cserve\u201d occurs seven times in vv.9 to 21 (Greenberg 1969), and sound variations on the Hebrew <i>ra\u2019</i> (\u201cill/evil\u201d) three times (vv.19\u201323)."], "The Promise Renewed": ["Exodus 6:2-13", "Greenberg (1969) and others have noted how this section in many respects recapitulates God\u2019s speeches at the Bush. Once again God assures Moshe that he has \u201cheard\u201d and \u201crecalled\u201d the Israelites and their old covenant; once again he promises to act (\u201cbring out\u201d resounds four times); once again the promise is linked to an interpretation of God\u2019s name; and once again Moshe expresses doubt as to whether he will be believed or listened to (v.12).", "Why the repetition? Perhaps here, as elsewhere, to double is to emphasize. Also, just as Moshe initially failed as a self-appointed liberator in Chap. 2, only to be sought out by God in the wilderness, he fails as a leader here as well, followed by God\u2019s reassuring speech. There can be no question from whence the liberation comes."], "The Genealogy of Moshe and Aharon": ["Exodus 6:14-27", "At this tension-filled moment in the narrative, in the face of Moshe\u2019s self-doubt and the possible collapse of his mission, there is an unlikely break, at least by Western storytelling standards. Apparently the genealogy has been inserted to buttress Moshe and Aharon\u2019s claim to represent the people before the Egyptian crown, and to stress their Levite ancestry (which solidly establishes them within the priestly class in Israel). Significantly, the genealogy of Yaakov\u2019s sons ends with the third, Levi, and the rest of the list enumerates the Levite clans. More significantly, the ages mentioned are composed of patterned numbers such as 3, 7, 30, and 100. As in Genesis, this betokens a concept of order and meaning in history.", "Thus legitimated, Moshe and Aharon can return to the task at hand. It would seem, then, that the passage is speaking to the Israelites, both in Egypt and in the audience of later generations."], "The Mission Renewed": ["Exodus 6:28-7:13", "As preparation for the next meeting with Pharaoh, Moshe is once more reminded that the king will not listen to him. Taking a page from his speech at the Bush, God instructs Moshe and Aharon to use the \u201csign\u201d that had previously served to convince the people: snake magic. Yet despite Aharon\u2019s one-upping the Egyptian magicians in the warm-up for the plagues, Pharaoh remains unconvinced.

No more effective choice could have been made for this first demonstration of the far-reaching power of the Israelite God.", "As with the first six plagues, the threat is long and the actual carrying-out brief. Note the relationship, at the end of the episode, between the uncaring Pharaoh and his own people, who have to scratch for water."], "Third Blow": ["Exodus 8:12-15", "With the third plague, the curse becomes more intimate, affecting the bodies of all living creatures in Egypt (cf. the refrain in vv.13\u201314, \u201con man and on beast\u201d). The narrative uses the briefest plague formula here, without introduction or warning to Pharaoh. Yet it results in an Egyptian effort to end the siege, as the magicians term the plague \u201cthe finger of a god\u201d (v.15)."], "Fourth Blow": ["Exodus 8:16-28", "Despite its similarity to the previous plague (insects), number four introduces a new and important element into the tale: the idea that God makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. It also involves protracted bargaining between Moshe and Pharaoh over the issue of allowing the Israelites to worship God."], "Fifth Blow": ["Exodus 9:1-7", "Although this plague spares humans, it is nevertheless described as \u201cheavy\u201d (v.3). The narrative uses a play-on-words as well: the Hebrew for pestilence (<i>dever</i>) echoes that for thing (<i>davar</i>)."], "Sixth Blow": ["Exodus 9:8-12", "Just as in the previous \u201cshort\u201d plague, number 3, the magicians come to the fore. No longer do they cry to Pharaoh; they cannot even take the stage!"], "Seventh Blow": ["Exodus 9:13-35", "Long like its corresponding predecessors (numbers 1 and 4), the seventh plague prefaces its occurrence with an emphatic introduction by God, and its warning gives God-fearing Egyptians a chance to save themselves (vv.19\u201321), something new. The description of the plague itself is fraught with spectacle, presaging Sinai with its use of thunder and fire. There is also the ominous note, twice in the text (vv.18, 24), that such a plague was unique in Egyptian annals. The plagues, at least for the Egyptians, now transcend the realms of normal, explainable experience, as well as of historical recollection."], "Eighth Blow": ["Exodus 10:1-20", "Anticipating Pharaoh\u2019s eventual capitulation, the Egyptians now urge their king to release the Israelites, before Egypt is truly \u201clost\u201d (v.7). The request occurs before the plague does. This longest plague is in many ways the most devastating of all, affecting as it does the very soil itself. Here the last two plagues are anticipated (v.15, \u201cthe ground became dark\u201d; and v.17, \u201cthis death\u201d), and the previous one is echoed (vv.6, 14, with the reference to past history). Also foreshadowed, in the locusts\u2019 removal, is the final victory at the Sea of Reeds (Chap. 14), through the mention of the location and the use of a powerful wind."], "Ninth Blow": ["Exodus 10:21-29", "Little is new here; darkness foreshadows the final plague, death. Yet at the end of the brief episode, as well as in 11:8, we are given a glimpse into the human element, as Moshe and Pharaoh rage in anger against each other."], "The Final Warning": ["Exodus 11:1-10", "What seems to be the introduction to the last plague is made up of motifs common to several of the previous ones. It also reintroduces the idea of despoiling the Egyptians, which had been mentioned in Moshe\u2019s original commission (3:21\u201322)\u2014so we know that redemption is at hand. Artfully, the specification of what \u201cone more blow\u201d is, is delayed until v.5. In addition, there is the motif of Moshe\u2019s greatness/fame among the Egyptians, which would appear to be a suppressed remnant of the story (in the face of the desire to glorify God as the hero). The section ends (vv.9\u201310) with a summary of the entire Plague Narrative\u2014or at least of what is to be learned from it."], "The Passover Ritual": ["Exodus 12:1-28", "The festival depicted in this chapter is, in the opinion of many scholars, a combination of two ancient holy days: a shepherds\u2019 festival, in which each spring a lamb was sacrificed to the deity in gratitude and for protection of the flock, and a celebration of the barley harvest, at which time all leaven/fermentation products were avoided (although see Ginsberg, who theorizes a shepherds\u2019 festival with <i>matza</i>). Each has numerous parallels in other cultures (see Gaster 1949). What has apparently happened here is that the two days have been fused together and imbued with historical meaning. In addition, rites that were originally protective in function have been reinterpreted in the light of the Exodus story. But whatever its origin, Passover as described in our text bespeaks a strong sense of Israelite tribal community and of distinctiveness. And it is distinctiveness, which played such an important role in Israelite religion, that is singled out here, with the striking penalty for transgressing the boundaries of the festival\u2014being \u201ccut off\u201d (probably death). One also notes the repetition of the phrase \u201ca law for the ages\u201d (vv.14, 17, 24). Passover, then, is central both to the Exodus story and to Israelite ideas as a whole (see Sarna 1986 for a detailed discussion)."], "Tenth Blow and Exodus": ["Exodus 12:29-42", "The final blow falls. This most horrifying of all the plagues, and the reaction to it, are described in only two verses, whereas the rest of the narrative concerns itself with preparations for and actual description of the exodus. Note how, as above, the narrative is surrounded by ritual concerns\u2014trying to explain the subsequent reason for eating unleavened bread (which had not been done in v.15f., above). There also returns the important motif of despoiling (\u201cstripping\u201d) Egypt.", "The section ends (vv.40\u201342) with a dramatic summary of Israel\u2019s sojourn in Egypt and the importance of the Passover festival, built on repetition (\u201cthirty years and four hundred years,\u201d \u201ca night \u2026 for Y<small>hwh</small>,\u201d \u201ckeeping-watch\u201d). Again, a past event is made immediate for the audience. The powerful religious tones of story and ceremony are established by the threefold reference to night as the setting for both (vv.29\u201331)."], "Who May Make Passover": ["Exodus 12:43-50", "Continuing the immediacy of ritual, the narrative pauses where one would expect it to talk about the Israelites\u2019 route, to specify carefully that partaking of the Passover meal, and indeed being a part of the community in general, requires circumcision on the part of the participant. In essence, it creates the new Israelite nation, on the heels of common participation in a historical event. This small passage has been inserted between two occurrences of the same phrase (\u201cthat same day\u201d), an editorial device often used in biblical literature."], "Passover and the Firstborn": ["Exodus 12:51-13:16", "To close out the text\u2019s celebration of the exodus event, the editor includes a peroration on the firstborn. This too is a reinterpretation of earlier religious practices. Many ancient cultures selected the firstborn as an object for sacrifice to the gods\u2014whether firstborn of fruit, of animals, or of human beings\u2014the grounds for this being that the firstborn represents the best that nature has to offer (see Gen. 49:3, where Jacob\u2019s firstborn is \u201cbeginning of my strength\u201d). The idea of strength is played upon in the reinterpretation of sacrifice: four times, including at the end of the passage, we are told that the firstborn is to be consecrated, \u201cfor by strength of hand Y<small>hwh</small> brought you out of Egypt\u201d (vv.3, 9, 14, 16).", "The chapter has a few notable characteristics. For one, the eating of <i>matzot</i> has been integrated into the firstborn material; for another, the language is unmistakably reminiscent of Deuteronomy (vv.5 and 11, \u201cit shall be [a refrain here]/when Y<small>hwh</small> brings you to the land of the Canaanite \u2026\u201d; see Deut. 6:10, 7:1, etc.). This has led some scholars to point to a relatively late date for the material, supporting the idea that Israel in its sixth-century <small>b.c.e.</small> exile in Babylonia looked back to recast the past in its own image. At any rate, memory is clearly important here, with two passages stressing the continuity of commemoration through the following generations (vv.8\u201310 and 14\u201316)."], "The Route and the Escort": ["Exodus 13:17-22", "The initial exit from Egypt highlights an ominous fact about the Israelites: God is well aware of their weaknesses and leads them by a detour, lest they \u201csee war\u201d and seek to recover the familiar security of being serfs. The section also explains what they are doing out of the way of the logical route to Canaan (the place names are difficult to identify, but the general stress is clear), and sets up the great final victory of the next chapter.", "Two other elements of weight enter in this brief passage. One concerns Yosef\u2019s bones, which leave Egypt with his descendants. The body of Yosef seems to anchor early Israelite history: its mummification brings the Genesis stories to a close, its journey here links up Israel\u2019s patriarchal past with the radically new deliverance from bondage, and its final interment in the land of Israel formally closes out the conquest of the land under Yehoshua (Joshua) (Josh. 24:32).", "Another unifying motif is that of God\u2019s accompanying the journeying Israelites in the form of cloud and fire. This passage is the first of what I have called the \u201cPresence Accounts\u201d described in \u201cOn the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,\u201d above."], "At the Sea of Reeds": ["Exodus 14:1-31", "The liberation account ends with two literary masterpieces: the semipoetic story of Israel\u2019s miraculous passage through the Sea of Reeds along with God\u2019s smashing of the Egyptian war machine, and the song of triumph that follows in Chap. 15. Taken together, they form a natural conclusion to what has gone before and a bridge to what follows. Chap. 14 marks the Israelites\u2019 last contact with the Egyptians, and the beginning of their desert journey.", "As if the actual exodus were not dramatic enough, the narrator or editor has included a battle scene at this point in the text. As before, the principal combatants are God and Pharaoh, and as before, we begin with God\u2019s hardening the monarch\u2019s heart (v.4) to teach him a final lesson (\u201cI will be glorified\u201d). In that vein, some of the plague motifs are repeated, making Chap. 14 a fitting conclusion to the Deliverance account stylistically and thematically (see also Isbell). At the same time the story includes a foreshadowing of Israel\u2019s behavior in the wilderness for the next two years, with a detailed account of their complaints against Moshe (and God\u2019s miraculous response).", "God appears in this story in his most warlike garb, and temporarily resembles many of the gods of antiquity (Cross uses the term \u201cthe divine warrior,\u201d relating it to Northwest Semitic imagery). This is not unusual for the Bible, and seems appropriate here, given the climactic nature of the events and the general context of the Deliverance Narrative. Otherwise, the Hebrew God was conceived of as the originator of all things, good and evil, and was of course not compartmentalized into limited tasks as were other gods of neighboring cultures.", "From a formal point of view, the sea narrative is among the most formulaic in the Hebrew Bible. That is, it is built entirely upon several phrases that repeat throughout the text, stressing its major themes. These include: God\u2019s \u201cmaking Pharaoh\u2019s heart strong-willed\u201d (vv.4, 8, 17); God\u2019s \u201cbeing glorified\u201d through what he does to the Egyptians (vv.4, 17, 18); Israel\u2019s going \u201cupon dry-land\u201d (vv.16, 22, 29); the waters\u2019 \u201creturning\u201d (vv.26, 27, 28); Israel\u2019s marching \u201cthrough/into the midst of the sea\u201d (vv.16, 22, 23, 27, 29); Pharaoh\u2019s \u201cchariots and riders\u201d (vv.17, 18, 23, 26, 28); and a description of the standing waters, \u201cthe waters a wall for them to their right and to their left\u201d (vv.22, 29); see also the refrain, \u201cbefore Pi ha-Hirot \u2026 before Baal-Tzefon\u201d (v.4) and \u201cby Pi ha-Hirot, before Baal-Tzefon\u201d (v.9). The text is thus much more than a journalistic account of what happened: it is a rhythmic retelling of an experience, strongly conditioned by traditional (probably oral) Israelite forms of storytelling.", "The ending (vv.29\u201331) betrays the influence of Deuteronomy. Using language that mirrors the end of the entire Torah (Deut. 34), the text speaks of seeing, fearing, hand, eyes, and the unique-to-Deuteronomy phrase \u201cMoshe his servant\u201d (see Deut. 34:5). Significantly, then, the final narrative of Israel\u2019s relationship to Egypt is cast as a classic ending in general.", "What exactly happened at the sea? As I indicated in \u201cOn the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,\u201d above, such a point is unanswerable, and may not have a great bearing on the meaning of our text. Scholars have scrambled their brains for decades, trying either to reconstruct precisely what \u201cnatural\u201d event this \u201creally\u201d was (e.g., tides, tidal wave), or to identify the exact location of the \u201cSea of Reeds.\u201d While such matters are important to the historian, the Bible itself concentrates on the theme of the story. The narrator was concerned to demonstrate God\u2019s final victory and to portray Israel\u2019s escape in terms of a birthing (through a path, out of water), and these themes had the most influence both on later biblical tradition and on the generations of inspired Jews and Christians that heeded them."], "The Song of God as Triumphant King": ["Exodus 15:1-21", "Moshe\u2019s famous Song at the Sea provides a natural boundary in the book of Exodus. It sets off the Egypt traditions from those of Sinai and the wilderness, and brings to a spectacular close the saga of liberation. This is borne out even in scribal tradition, still observed in the writing of Torah scrolls today, where the Song is written out with different spacing from the preceding and following narrative portions.", "A poem is necessary at this point in the story, to provide emotional exultation and a needed break before the next phase of Israel\u2019s journey in the book. The Song manages to focus the Israelites\u2019 (the audience\u2019s?) intense feelings in a way that neither the ritual of Chaps. 12\u201313 nor even the semipoetic description of God\u2019s miraculous intervention in Chap. 14 can do. Only poetry is capable of expressing the full range of the people\u2019s emotions about what has happened. This is similar to the effect of the great poems that occur toward the end of Genesis (Chap. 49, the Blessing of Yaakov) and Deuteronomy (Chaps. 32\u201333, the Song and Blessing of Moshe).", "A major concern of the poet is God\u2019s kingship, with which he ends the poem (a one-liner\u2014\u201cLet Y<small>hwh</small> be king for the ages, eternity!\u201d\u2014contrasting with the doublets and triplets in the body of the poem). This is no accident, nor is it inappropriate; since Chaps. 4 and 5 the story of Exodus has revolved around just who shall be king (God or Pharaoh) and just who shall be served. By the end of Chap. 14 this is no longer an issue. The victorious Y<small>hwh</small> can now be acclaimed as king, while we hear nothing further of Pharaoh. (Has he drowned or merely been written out of the story? Later generations of Jews enjoyed giving him a role in the world to come: he stands at the gate of Hell, admonishing evildoers as they enter; see Ginzberg.)", "The attempts to recover what happened at the sea through the poem are doomed to failure, considering that the piece is constructed out of two traditional stories, the victory at the sea and the later conquest of Canaan (vv.1\u201312, 13\u201317). Further, it is set in cosmic terms. The words \u201cOceans\u201d (Heb. <i>tehomot;</i> vv.5, 8) and \u2018breath\u201d (<i>ru\u2019ah;</i> v.8) recall the primeval chaos at the beginning of Creation itself (Gen. 1:2). This technique is characteristic of much of ancient/religious literature: a great event is told in a way that reflects the beginnings of the gods and the world (this may include statements about the end of the world as well).", "It should be noted that some scholars point out the close resemblance between God\u2019s victory here and scenes in other ancient Near Eastern literatures that portray the triumph of a storm god over a sea god. So however historical the events in Chaps. 14\u201315 may have been, in their biblical retelling they have been patterned after antecedents in myth.", "Much has been written concerning the structure of the Song (see, e.g., Cassuto, Cross, and Lichtenstein). I will mention only a few points here. The vocabulary of the poem is extremely concentrated. Major ideas are expressed by clusters of key verbs. Note, for instance, the grouping of \u201cflung,\u201d \u201churled,\u201d \u201cplunged,\u201d \u201cshattered,\u201d \u201csmashed,\u201d \u201cconsumed\u201d\u2014a veritable lexicon of military victory. A number of verbs describe divine leadership (\u201cled,\u201d \u201cguided,\u201d \u201cbrought\u201d), and God\u2019s establishment of the Israelites in Canaan (\u201cplanted,\u201d \u201cfounded\u201d). The fear of the Canaanites (of Israel and its God) is graphically expanded to \u201cshuddered,\u201d \u201cseized with writhing,\u201d \u201cterrified,\u201d \u201cseized with trembling,\u201d \u201cmelted away,\u201d \u201c\u2026 dread and anguish,\u201d and \u201cgrew dumb.\u201d Finally, there are a number of nouns that express weight (cf. Heb. <i>kaved,</i> previously discussed): \u201cstone,\u201d \u201cdam,\u201d and \u201clead.\u201d", "The overall effect of the poem is of fierce pride at God\u2019s victory, and exultant description of the destruction and discomfort of enemies, whether Egyptian or Canaanite. This general tone parallels many ancient war poems; what is characteristically Israelite about it is God\u2019s choosing and leading a people. Therefore the last verse goes far beyond the celebration of a single military victory. The Song constitutes the founding of a theocratic people.", "Scholars have long noted the archaic style of the Song, which uses forms characteristic of early biblical Hebrew. Its tone is for this reason even more exalted than is usual in biblical poetry. An imaginative reflection of the effect can be found in Daiches, who paraphrases the Song in the style of early English epic poetry.", "Two sections have been appended to the end of the poem. First there is the poetically remarkable summary of the narrative in v.19, notable for the fact that it is composed wholly from phrases used in Chap. 14. There follows a women\u2019s repetition/performance of at least part of the Song complete with dance. Some scholars see this as the \u201coriginal\u201d form of the poem. Of equal interest is the characterization of Miryam as a \u201cprophetess.\u201d But there may be a structural reason for her appearance as well: the enterprise of deliverance from Egypt began with a little girl at the Nile, watching through the reeds to make sure her baby brother would survive; it ends with the same person, now an adult, a \u201cprophetess\u201d celebrating the final victory at the Sea of Reeds."]}, "Part II; In the Wilderness": {"Grumbling I": ["Exodus 15:22-27", "The first of the wilderness narratives is linked to what has gone before via the theme of water. Fresh from their rescue from death at the sea, the Israelites look for water in the desert and find the discovery of unpotable water intolerable. The key word, especially for the many later wilderness traditions such as we find in Numbers, is \u201cgrumbled\u201d (Heb. <i>lyn</i>), which leads to God\u2019s nurturing of the people. Strangely, the theme of undrinkable water recalls the beginning of the plague sequence in Egypt (7:20\u201321).", "Right away in this first desert episode we are told the purpose of Israel\u2019s journey: God is testing them, to see if they will \u201chearken\u201d to what he bids them to do. The language is in the style of Deuteronomy. One should also mention the idea of \u201claw and judgment,\u201d indicating another crucial desert theme: Israel\u2019s ability or inability to govern itself.", "The account ends with an abundance of water in v.27."], "Grumbling II": ["Exodus 16:1-36", "Moving now halfway (in terms of time) to their Sinai destination, the people encounter a new lack: food. This reintroduces the \u201ctesting\u201d motif (V.4), with its built-in answer: God provides quails and <i>mahn</i> (trad. English \u201cmanna\u201d). The story is full-blown, and its repeating vocabulary sets forth the issues clearly: \u201cgrumble\u201d occurs seven times, and \u201ccommand/commandments\u201d four times, linked to the idea of testing. Indeed, this long story poses the question central to all the wilderness narratives: \u201c\u2026 whether they will walk according to my instruction or not\u201d (v.4).", "The manna was important in early Israelite tradition as a witness to God\u2019s nurturing, as attested by the end of the chapter with its ritual prescriptions regarding it (vv.32\u201334; note the threefold repetition of \u201csafekeeping\u201d). But it also sets up an emphasis on a more permanent institution in Israelite culture: the Sabbath. One notion that this passage may convey is the antiquity and importance of the Sabbath, preceding the laws of Sinai as it does here. Also at issue is whether the Israelites can follow simple rules laid down by God."], "Grumbling III": ["Exodus 17:1-7", "With the third wilderness story we return to the water theme. This time the element of \u201cquarreling\u201d with Moshe is added, in addition to the portrayal of Moshe\u2019s eroding patience (v.4). Otherwise it is a variation on the basic theme (notice, for instance, the similarities between 16:3 and 17:3). The ending is ominous, reversing the previously held idea of God\u2019s testing Israel."], "War with Amalek": ["Exodus 17:8-16", "In addition to testing/grumbling, conflict with foreigners is a significant wilderness theme (see Num. 20\u201324). It is perhaps for this reason that it has been included in the pre-Sinai traditions. Its placement here may depend on its use of Moshe\u2019s staff; the previous narrative ended with the use of that object, and such linkage was a known form of composition in ancient literature.", "The tradition about Israel\u2019s relationship with Amalek, however brief, persists as an important one in the Bible. Saul, Israel\u2019s first king, is commanded by God to wipe out the Amalekites, as punishment for their opposition of Israel in our passage (I Sam. 15), and centuries later, Haman, the evil Persian councillor who proposes to exterminate the Jews of his country, is portrayed as a descendant of the Amalekite king (Esther 3:1).", "Our story, however, is no mere military report, but also a tradition about the power of the \u201cstaff of God.\u201d In another culture, indeed in later Midrashic literature, such a theme would receive Excalibur-like treatment, but the Bible suppresses the magical side and simply uses it as a tool, expressing God\u2019s continuing deliverance of Israel."], "The New Society: Yitro\u2019s Visit": ["Exodus 18:1-27", "Israel finally reaches the \u201cmountain of God,\u201d but this, remarkably, is subordinated to the fact that Moshe and the people meet up with Yitro, whom we recall from Chaps. 2\u20134. The designation \u201cfather-in-law\u201d recurs throughout this chapter (thirteen times), perhaps playing up the importance of the relationship in Israelite society. The real concern of the story, however, is Moshe\u2019s early attempt to set up a functioning judicial system in Israel (hence the key word <i>davar,</i> ten times, translated here as \u201cmatter\u201d in the sense of \u201clegal matter\u201d). The chapter thus serves as a good prelude to Sinai, which will include far-ranging legal material (despite the fact that some scholars see it as an insertion from a later period\u2014cf. v.16, \u201cGod\u2019s laws and his instructions\u201d).", "It has been noted (Cohn) that the \u201ctrek narratives\u201d in Exodus and Numbers have been laid out evenly, with six \u201cstations\u201d between Egypt and Sinai and another six between Sinai and the land of Israel. Thus here, Israel has come to the midpoint of its journey. In another perspective, Moshe himself has come full circle, returning to both the spot and the man in whose presence the mature adult phase of his life had begun."]}, "Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai": {"The Meeting and the Covenant": ["Exodus 19:1-25", "The account of God\u2019s revelation at Sinai, like the narrative of the tenth plague and exodus, is embedded in a wider setting. After the covenant has been elucidated, the people assent; preparations are made to meet God; and the brief initial meeting is followed by more preparations, including stern warnings against trespassing on the mountain\u2019s sanctity. When one takes Chap. 20 into account, the effect of all this is anything but smooth, from a narrator\u2019s point of view, and I would agree with Greenberg (1969) that this may be deliberate\u2014stemming from a desire either to include every tradition about this key event that was available to the editor(s), or else to suggest that such things are impossible to describe in normal language and logical sequence (Buber [1981], in another context, once referred to the Creation story of Gen. 1 as a \u201cstammering account\u201d). In any event, the entire description of the fateful meeting between God and the Israelites at Sinai is confined to a mere four verses (19:16\u201319). This stands in blatant contrast to other ancient Near Eastern traditions, which would have treated such an event with epic length and poetic diction (see, for instance, Deut. 32, or Psalm 78). So here, as in the opening chapter of Genesis, all has been stripped down, focusing attention on the covenant rather than on the mysterious nature of God.", "In that vein, it must be observed that the narrative centers around speaking, words, and sounds, keeping the visual to a minimum (in line with the warning in Deut. 4:12: \u201cThe sound of words you heard/a form you did not see/only a voice\u201d). It also abounds in terms connoting warning and boundaries/separateness\u2014the text contains three sets of warnings: vv.10\u201313, 21\u201322 (introducing the phrase \u201cburst out,\u201d which refers to God\u2019s potential destructiveness if the boundaries are violated), and 24. This recalls Moshe\u2019s own experience at Sinai earlier (cf. 3:5). And the number 3 gives the story the same touch of meaning provided by the numbers in Genesis; Israel arrives at the mountain three months after the exodus and meets God on the third day after their preparations.", "As Cassuto points out, the chapter does not begin with \u201cNow it was \u2026\u201d (Heb. <i>va-yehi</i>), a normal marker for continuing a previous narrative. The Sinai material thus presents itself in utter newness. To use the previously cited wedding analogy: this text betokens a new relationship between God and Israel, however well they have known one another previously.", "Also notable in Chap. 19 is the emphasis on movement: going up (Heb. <i>\u2019aloh</i>) and down (<i>yarod</i>) (see also 24:15\u201318). This movement serves to bridge the gap, usually great, between heaven and earth; but note that it is Moshe, and not the people, who does the ascending and descending.", "Structurally, vv.20\u201325 appear to have been added, to emphasize the warning theme. They also delay the pronouncement of the \u201cTen Commandments,\u201d creating thereby a more dramatic effect with the appearance of the latter. But it seems clear that considerable editing has taken place."], "The Ten Words (The Decalogue)": ["Exodus 20:1-14", "This section, among the most famous and important in all of religious literature, is set in dramatic tone. Its rhetoric could hardly be more striking. In a form relatively rare in ancient Near Eastern legal documents, a god sets forth demands, with no punishments listed. This \u201capodictic\u201d form seems to indicate that the Ten Words function as a preamble to the actual laws of Chaps. 21\u201323, by laying forth the major principles on which Israel\u2019s relationship to God is to be based (as is to be expected, the secondary literature on Chap. 20 is enormous; see Childs for a bibliography).", "The numbering of the ten differs slightly in the Jewish and Christian traditions, with the main divergences coming in the split of vv.2\u20133 (or 3\u20134, as here); see Cassuto. There are also different opinions on the overall structure of the \u201cCommandments.\u201d Jewish tradition separates out those that treat the relationship between God and human beings (vv.2\u201311, numbers 1\u20135) and those that involve human society alone (vv.12\u201314, numbers 6\u201310), although it should be kept in mind that all offenses in ancient Israel were seen as affronts to God. This division might be borne out by stylistic considerations, for the last five, of course, begin \u201cYou are not to \u2026\u201d and numbers 2\u20134 all use the Hebrew word <i>ki</i> (\u201cfor\u201d) to express reasons or results of the initial stipulations (vv.5, 7, 11, with the substitution of \u201cin order that\u201d in verse 12).", "Other notable stylistic aspects here include the fact that \u201cyou\u201d is always singular, and that numbers 2\u20134 and 6\u201310 are all put in the negative.", "Several other features of the \u201cDecalogue\u201d are unique: the prohibition against worshiping images, which would have had a strange ring in the ancient world; the Sabbath as a holy day on which not even servants, farm animals, or noncitizens are to work, equally unprecedented in its time and place; and, strangest of all, the final prohibition against desiring (another person\u2019s property).", "The language and the content of the Decalogue, then, cooperate to create a lofty and challenging ethical code, which both the people of Israel and the Western world in general have struggled with ever since. The reader may wish to consult Buber\u2019s stimulating essays (1982, 1963) \u201cThe Words on the Tablets\u201d and \u201cWhat Are We to Do about the Ten Commandments?\u201d, as well as the essays in Segal."], "Aftermath": ["Exodus 20:15-23", "The verses that follow the Decalogue highlight an important aspect of the Sinai tradition: its occurrence in a public setting. Vv. 15\u201318 could fit nicely after 19:20a; the Decalogue would then follow 20:18. Yet it seems to have been important for the narrator to stress (v.19) that God spoke to the people as a whole, not merely secretly in a revelation to a visionary or priest. To emphasize this point, the verb <i>ra\u2019oh,</i> \u201csee/perceive,\u201d occurs seven times in vv.15\u201319. V.19 also serves as a framework for the entire Revelation episode, recalling as it does the language of 19:4. Israel now has two reasons for obeying God: he brought them out of Egyptian bondage and he talked to them \u201cfrom the heavens\u201d (v.19).", "The rest of the chapter functions as an introduction to the general body of the legislation that begins in the next chapter. Like Israel\u2019s other law collections in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, it starts with rules pertaining to worship.", "<i>On the Laws:</i> The reader should bear in mind again that the section headings used in the Commentary are for reference only. This is especially true for Chaps. 21\u201324, where the final form of the Hebrew text discourages distinguishing between different types of offenses (see p. 361, \u201cOn Biblical Law\u201d)."], "Laws Regarding Israelite Serfdom": ["Exodus 21:1-11", "Given the importance of the root \u201cserve\u201d in the book of Exodus, it is fitting that the Covenant Code open with this theme. In vv.1\u20136 the text considers the case of the native serf, a status rather like that of the indentured servant in early American history. Immediately, the act of releasing such an individual\u2014providing for his \u201cgoing out\u201d\u2014is stipulated. \u201cFor they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt\u201d (Lev. 25:42). While the institution of serfdom existed of necessity in ancient Israel, it could not be tolerated as a permanent and fully dehumanizing one (on the other hand, these regulations deal with natives, not with foreigners). Note the use of seven here, as the number of perfection and limit\u2014the servant goes free after seven years, just as the land rests every seven years (23:10\u201311).", "The second case (vv.7\u201311) deals with a woman whose poverty-stricken father sells her as a servant. Here, too, there is an attempt to soften the conditions and to humanize what appears as essentially a property situation in the ancient world."], "Capital Crimes of Violence": ["Exodus 21:12-17", "Four situations involving grave crimes are cited in this section, each ending with the pronouncement of the death penalty in rhetorical form (Heb. <i>mot yumat,</i> \u201cHe is to be put-to-death, yes, death\u201d): murder, striking one\u2019s parents, kidnapping, and denigrating one\u2019s parents. Our society has in general supported the first and third of these; but the regulations concerning father and mother do not accord with twentieth-century Western practice, and point up well the enormous importance of the parent-child relationship in ancient Israel (already suggested by \u201cHonor your father and your mother\u201d in the Ten Words). That relationship was often used to describe the one between God and Israel, and thus obedience is an important theme in the covenant as a whole."], "Injuries": ["Exodus 21:18-32", "The vocabulary of verbs in these verses outlines the subject at hand: \u201cquarrel,\u201d \u201cstrike,\u201d \u201ccontend,\u201d \u201charm,\u201d \u201cstrike,\u201d \u201cbreak-off,\u201d \u201cgive.\u201d The text treats a number of extenuating circumstances, imposing penalties of varying degrees. The case of an accidentally caused abortion is especially highlighted (vv.22\u201325), and in a famous verse (23), the lawgiver breaks into rhetoric in order to stress that punishments be scrupulously fair. Also notable is the regulation concerning the goring ox (vv.28\u201332), where an <i>animal</i> is made to pay the death penalty, since it has destroyed the most sacred thing of all\u2014life itself. Both of the latter cases have received exhaustive treatment in the scholarly literature (see Sarna 1986)."], "Property": ["Exodus 21:33-22:14", "These regulations cover various damages to property, commonly through negligence. The key word here is \u201cpay\u201d (Heb. <i>shallem,</i> denoting restitution); also repeated are \u201cfellow\u201d and \u201cGod\u2019s-oracle.\u201d"], "Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters": ["Exodus 22:15-23:19", "A great variety of offenses is covered in this section: rape, oppression, talebearing, unjust sentencing, and bribery, among others. Yet the category is not so neatly drawn; interspersed with these are laws concerning what we would consider religious affairs: sorcery, idolatry, blasphemy, and the sacred calendar. Once again the implication seems to be that all of these areas are of immediate concern to God, regardless of how they are labeled or pigeonholed.", "Stylistically there is also great variety, as categorical prohibitions (22:18) alternate with pleas (23:5\u20136) and positive commands (23:10\u201312). A number of times the justification for the law is given in the text itself (e.g. 22:20, 26; 23:7, 8, 9, 11, 12), with the operative word being \u201cfor.\u201d (Such a verse is called a \u201cmotive clause,\u201d and is characteristically although not exclusively biblical; see Sonsino.)", "Most notable about this section is the full use that it makes of rhetoric. Several key laws are accompanied by an emotional appeal\u2014e.g., \u201cOh, if you afflict, afflict them \u2026 !\u201d (22:22); \u201cfor it is his only clothing \u2026 in what (else) shall he lie down?\u201d (v.26); \u201cfor a Compassionate-One am I\u201d (v.26); and \u201cyou yourselves know (well) the feelings of the sojourner\u201d (23:9).", "No passage in these chapters, and indeed throughout the entire Torah, can easily surpass vv.21\u201323 (as I have mentioned above), with their appeal to language and emotions alike. So at the core of the legal concerns here is the protection of the powerless.", "Toward the end (23:10\u201319), emphasis shifts to the festivals of Israel, with a special focus on the agricultural setting. As a result the general scholarly consensus is that these laws could not be wilderness regulations, but refer instead to life after the conquest of Canaan. Be that as it may, the fact that this section ends with ritual concerns provides a rounding-out of the entire body of Exodus legislation, which, as I noted above, began with worship as its subject (20:20ff.).", "Finally, this ending passage is notable for its numerical layout\u2014two sets of seven (years and days) and one of three (times a year)."], "Epilogue; The Future Conquest": ["Exodus 23:20-33", "It would not be suitable, given the grave nature of the covenant, to end the legal passages merely with a particular law, and so our narrator appends a long speech, in the style of Deuteronomy, warning the Israelites, first, to follow God\u2019s messenger, and second, not to assimilate with the nations they are about to conquer. The Deuteronomic themes are classic: \u201ctaking care,\u201d smashing Canaanite idols, God\u2019s removing disease from the faithful Israelites, and the spelling-out of Israel\u2019s future borders.", "Also to be remarked are the sevenfold repetition of \u201cbefore you\u201d as a stylistic unifying device, and the ending theme of serving YHWH as opposed to \u201ctheir gods.\u201d"], "Sealing the Covenant": ["Exodus 24:1-11", "To close out the account of covenant-making which began back in Chap. 19, the text recounts a formalized ceremony which has many points of contact with what was generally done throughout the ancient Near East when a covenant was \u201ccut.\u201d Twice Moshe reads God\u2019s words to the people, and twice (vv.3, 7) they give their assent. This is no imposing of laws by a dictator, but a freely accepted, \u201csigned, sealed, and delivered\u201d agreement cemented by blood, the signifier of life itself.", "As representatives of the people, Moshe, Aharon, Aharon\u2019s sons, and seventy elders ascend Mount Sinai, and, most remarkably, \u201csee\u201d God in some sort of vision\u2014without, as one might expect, their being destroyed. They also eat and drink, as was customary in the sealing of the agreement (and often done in business to this day; see Gen. 31:44\u201354)."], "Moshe Ascends Alone": ["Exodus 24:12-18", "Finally, Moshe leaves the people, in order to receive the laws in permanent (stone) form. He \u201cgoes up\u201d the mountain four times (or, most likely, is on his way up). In order to give his absence the weight it needs\u2014so that the people will grow restless, setting up the situation that produces the Golden Calf in Chap. 32\u2013the text will now turn to a completely different matter for fully seven chapters.", "The ending of this section anticipates the ending of the book of Exodus, with its mention of God\u2019s \u201cglory,\u201d \u201cdwelling,\u201d \u201cfire,\u201d and \u201cday/night.\u201d"]}, "Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult": {"The Contribution": ["Exodus 25:1-9", "In the first seven verses of this opening section dealing with the Dwelling, the Israelites\u2019 contribution toward the structure is described in detail; but only in v.8 is the purpose of this activity made clear. Despite the concreteness of the description, however, the actual blueprints, as it were, are shown to Moshe by God, and are not recorded in the text. Architects in the creative sense are superfluous here.", "Moderns want to know where the Israelites procured such materials as gold and silver in quantity (see Chap. 38), or how they acquired the skills necessary for the fine artisanry involved (e.g., weaving, dyeing, manufacture of incense, and the setting of jewels). These questions, while logical in a historical setting, do not take the Bible on its own terms. The text appears to present the awed report of the Dwelling and its construction without leaving room for totally practical issues (just as Gen. 4 deals with Cain and his descendants without being concerned with the origins of Cain\u2019s wife)."], "The Coffer": ["Exodus 25:10-16", "The coffer or ark was a cult object of major importance in premonarchic and early monarchic Israel. In our text it contains the \u201cTestimony\u201d (i.e., the tablets with the Ten Words); in Josh. 3:14\u201315 it precedes the people into the Promised Land; in I Sam. 4:11\u20135:12 it is captured in battle but mysteriously wreaks havoc among the enemy (hence its cinematic offspring <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>). Finally, David\u2019s transporting of it to Jerusalem (II Sam. 6) marks the formal establishment of that city as a holy one and as the capital of Israel.", "In Exodus the coffer literally plays a central role. It stands in the innermost recesses of the Tabernacle, at the sacred center. Considering what the coffer contained\u2014tablets with God\u2019s words on them rather than statues of gods\u2014it addresses the primacy of divine word over divine representation in ancient Israelite thought."], "The Purgation Cover": ["Exodus 25:17-22", "<i>Kapporet</i> here could indicate simply \u201ccover,\u201d yet its function goes beyond mere protection. The name of this central part of the above-cited central cult object may be a play on words. The Hebrew verb <i>kapper,</i> which occurs again later in these texts (see 29:33\u201337), often means \u201cpurge\u201d or \u201cpurify\u201d; earlier translators rendered it as \u201cexpiate\u201d or even \u201cpropitiate,\u201d and the <i>kapporet</i> as \u201cmercy-seat\u201d or \u201cpropitiatory.\u201d The <i>kapporet</i> was apparently the holiest spot in the Israelite cult system, and it was there that God was said to speak his will to the people. This idea represents a remarkable shrinking and intimatizing process: the God who spoke to the assembled people, amid thunder, fire, and trembling earth at Sinai, now communicates with them from an area roughly the size of a small desk or table. In addition, there is a shift from a one-time event (Sinai) to the permanent fact of a sanctuary\u2014a development which will later be repeated in Solomon\u2019s Temple."], "The Table": ["Exodus 25:23-30", "The table and its implements, like some of the other features of the Tabernacle, are holdovers from a more blatantly pagan model, where the gods were seen to be in need of nourishment. By thus using conventions of worship common throughout the ancient Near East, Israel expressed its desire to serve God, even while it was aware that he was not the sort of deity who requires food and drink. It might also be mentioned that another common object found in ancient sanctuaries, a bed, has intentionally been omitted from our structure."], "The Lampstand": ["Exodus 25:31-40", "Despite the wealth of detail lavished on this striking symbol, its exact construction, like that of the Dwelling in general, remains unclear. The vocabulary used for its constituent parts comes from the realm of plants: shaft, stems, blossoms, almond shapes, etc. Indeed, the major latent symbol behind the lampstand is the tree\u2014which appears in many forms and in almost all religions (Meyers). The tree as a symbol is to be found throughout human culture, in such diverse settings as Native American stories and Norse myths; in the ancient Near East it specifically connoted permanence, growth, and majesty\u2014in other words, a reflection of the divine. If one adds to this range of meanings the function of the lampstand\u2014illumination (which often implies not only the giving of physical light but also, as the English phrase has it, enlightenment)\u2014the lampstand will be seen to emerge as an object with considerable evocative power. All these meanings may not have been immediately obvious and conscious to the ancient pilgrim or worshiper, but they periodically surfaced; the lampstand was ancient Judaism\u2019s symbol of preference (judging from synagogue ruins) and not the \u201cStar of David,\u201d which, as Gershom Scholem has shown, was a medieval mystical addition.", "The importance of the lampstand in our text is indicated by v.40, where the motif of God\u2019s revealing the structure of a sacred object on the mountain is resumed. Its significance is also attested by its major material of construction: pure gold."], "The Dwelling Proper": ["Exodus 26:1-14", "The text describes the network of tapestries or curtains that comprise the structure itself, in two layers (vv.1\u20136 and 7\u201312), with two additional layers mentioned (v.14). The outer layers function to protect the inner ones from the elements, while the inner ones, true to the gradations of holiness previously mentioned, are more elaborate."], "The Framework": ["Exodus 26:15-30", "The rigid part of the Tabernacle structure, while described in some detail, leaves room for many questions about specifics (e.g., how exactly did the boards fit together? was there one corner board or two? is the text perhaps describing planks or frames?). What is most important, as mentioned above, is the sense of proportion and approach to the divine implied by symmetrical numbers."], "The Curtain and the Screen": ["Exodus 26:31-37", "Two hangings separate different parts of the Tabernacle: the curtain, which closes off the inner sanctum; and the screen, which separates tent and courtyard."], "The Altar": ["Exodus 27:1-8", "As Cassuto points out, Israelite worship, like that in surrounding cultures, would have been unthinkable without an altar for animal sacrifices. The one described here is a compromise between permanence and portability: it was hollow for transporting, to be filled in with earth at each encampment.", "As with the lampstand, the exact construction of the object is to proceed along lines given to Moshe by God at Sinai."], "The Courtyard": ["Exodus 27:9-19", "Returning to the Tabernacle structure, the outer courtyard is laid out, composed of hangings and columns. Again, the numbers fit meaningfully together. Since we are dealing with the extremity of the Dwelling, the material used is the least precious: bronze."], "The Oil": ["Exodus 27:20-21", "The transition from structure to human institution (the priesthood) is accomplished by both the opening formula here, \u201cNow you \u2026,\u201d and by the oil itself, which is here used for light but which will soon be spoken of (Chap. 29) as a major agent in the anointing of the priests."], "The Priestly Garments": ["Exodus 28:1-5", "As in the opening section on the Tabernacle itself (25:1\u20139), we are now given a listing of what is to come, the clothing in which the priests will perform their sacred functions. The purpose of the objects is mentioned again, this time at both the beginning and the end of the section.", "In virtually all traditional religions such garments are of great importance, often signaling the status of the wearer as representative of the community (hence Aharon\u2019s breastpiece in this chapter). An additional function, stressed in our account, is that the garments somehow reflect God himself, through the use of certain colors and/or materials.

First, sacrificial animals and bread are brought and prepared; then the priests are systematically clothed in their sacred vestments. After the first animal is slaughtered, its blood is dashed against the altar and the innards are burned as an offering; then the second ram is slain, and its blood is placed on the priests\u2019 extremities, to purify them. Blood is sprinkled on the priests\u2019 garments; then they hold up the fat-parts and breast of the ram, and follow by offering it up. Then the priests eat the cooked flesh of a special ram, the remains of which are to be burnt.

In a word: by \u201cmeeting\u201d with the Children of Israel at the Tent, God\u2019s glory makes tent, altar, priests, and most important, the people of Israel, holy.

It seems that a census was viewed as a dangerous undertaking, perhaps analogous to the taking of photographs among certain peoples (which is felt to be threatening to one\u2019s essence).

At least two reasons have been advanced for its use: purification, and a fragrance pleasing to the deity.

Moshe receives God\u2019s word engraved in stone, by God himself; this will presumably be deposited in the \u201ccoffer\u201d of which the text spoke in its opening chapter (25).

But now, as Moshe prepares to descend from the mountain, we are reminded of the other side of the coin: the real world of human frailty. This has occurred before, at the very same site: in Chaps. 19 and 20 we observed a fearfulness on the part of the people toward getting too close to the divine, as a power too awesome to deal with. Now the fear goes the other way, and, with the disappearance of Moshe, the intermediary, turns to despair. The very thing that had been warned against in the Decalogue (and hence, the first of the terms of the covenant)\u2014the making of a \u201ccarved-image/or any figure/that is \u2026 on the earth beneath\u201d (20:4), and bowing down to it (20:5)\u2014takes place here, requested by the people in their hour of need. It is abetted by, of all people, their divine spokesman and priest, Aharon.", "Some scholars have sought to soften the sin of the calf by claiming that the Israelites did not view it as an idol but rather merely as a representation of the divine. This does not seem to be borne out by the text, either in the Decalogue or later in the Jeroboam incident, which is often equated with the most heinous crimes (see I Kings 16:26)."], "Response: God\u2019s Anger": ["Exodus 32:7-14", "Now that the people have committed what amounts to a capital crime, the issue at stake is what the punishment shall be. After informing the unsuspecting Moshe of what has taken place down below, with the words \u201c<i>your</i> people [italics mine] \u2026 has wrought ruin\u201d (v.7), God indicates his intent to destroy Israel, and to found a new nation beginning with Moshe. However, early Jewish tradition already sensed that something deeper might be happening here. The phrase \u201clet me be\u201d (Heb. <i>hanniha li</i>), it has been observed, suggests that God actually wishes Moshe to argue with him, and this is supported by his acquiescence in record time (v.14). Indeed, the text never says \u201cGod\u2019s anger flared up,\u201d reserving that key verb for Moshe (v.19). What we learn from this section is not only God\u2019s forgiving nature but something significant about Moshe: faced with a dictator\u2019s dream\u2014the cloning of an entire nation from himself\u2014he opts for staunchly defending the very people who have already caused him grief through their rebelling, and who will continually do so in the ensuing wanderings. And he does not even eschew blackmail to attain his goal. His argument in v.12, that the Egyptians will jeer at this God who liberated a people only to kill them in the wilderness, rings truer in a pagan context than in the Bible. But the next verse reveals Moshe\u2019s vision: he knows that his task is to continue the foundation established by the Patriarchs and to assure the continuity that has been imperiled so many times before."], "Response: Moshe\u2019s Anger": ["Exodus 32:15-29", "In a sense, the text backtracks chronologically here, to focus solely on Moshe. The first four verses are prefatory but important. Possibly to set the drama of the scene to follow, Moshe is described as carrying the \u201ctablets of the Testimony,\u201d which are dubbed the work of God. Yet another point is being made: the work of God is contrasted with the imperfect work of human beings, the law with its hope versus the idol with its underlying despair.", "Sounds of revelry, implied as being worse than sounds of war, reach Moshe, and upon his descent into the Israelite camp he loses control. But smashing the tablets has implications beyond the emotional: it is a legal voiding of the covenant (as in the English \u201cbreaking an agreement\u201d). Moshe deals with all concerned in swift succession: the calf is destroyed, Aharon is confronted, and the people are brutally purged.", "It is possible that there are historical considerations behind this section. Some see the portrayal of Aharon, who certainly comes across as weak, as part of a strain in the political thinking of a later period. According to this view, the later decline of Aharon\u2019s priestly line is reflected in his behavior here. Others see the \u201cmandating\u201d of the Levites (v.29) as a reflection of a later power struggle among the priestly classes in Israel. Childs finds Aharon\u2019s role in the story to be a literary one: he is a foil for Moshe. Aharon is willing to capitulate to the people, seeing them (perhaps realistically) as \u201cset-on-evil\u201d (v.22). Moshe holds fast to his dream of a \u201ckingdom of priests\u201d (19:6) and thus demands of himself a type of leadership that cannot compromise. The Calf story, then, focuses not only on the great crime of idolatry but also on the nature of Moshe as leader. It is the resumption of the biblical portrait of Moshe, which will return again with greatest force throughout the book of Numbers."], "After the Purge": ["Exodus 32:30-33:6", "Although blood has been spilled to punish the guilty, Moshe must still expiate Israel\u2019s sin. In this vein, he offers to be erased from God\u2019s \u201crecord\u201d if the people are not forgiven. Then commences God\u2019s reply, couched in terms of who will lead the people to the Promised Land. He will not do it himself, as previously (see the glorious image of 13:21\u201322), but through the agency of a \u201cmessenger.\u201d He will fulfill his promise to the Patriarchs, but not himself among his \u201chard-necked\u201d people. Their \u201csin\u201d (the word occurs eight times in vv.30\u201334) has destroyed that possibility.", "An interesting chord is struck at the end. Israel must strip themselves of their ornaments, the spoils of battle, as it were, from the Egyptians. Those ornaments had been used to build the Calf. The final note is ominous: God is yet to decide \u201cwhat to do with you,\u201d reminiscent perhaps of another scene with identical wording\u20142:4, where Moshe\u2019s sister had followed the little-ark downstream, \u201cto know what would be done to him.\u201d In both cases, the people of Israel stand on the brink of disaster, saved only by divine intervention."], "Moshe at the Tent": ["Exodus 33:7-11", "This brief digression seems to function as support for Moshe\u2019s role, so important in the book as a whole and in this story in particular.

Six times the verb \u201cknow\u201d echoes, along with repetitions of \u201cpray\u201d and \u201cfavor\u201d\u2014and so the issue at hand is intimacy and the bonded relationship of covenant. Significantly, also, Moshe refers to Israel three times as \u201cyour people,\u201d trying to force God to acknowledge them as his own once more. Answering Moshe\u2019s request for intimacy, God agrees to let him get close, but with limits, and we are reminded of Sinai once more (see the boundary-setting in 19:12\u201313, 21ff.).

In contrast to the scenes given in other ancient literatures, where, for instance, the texts speak of a physical brightness too great to bear, or of epic descriptions of the gods, our passage is remarkably brief and devoid of physical description. All that is ventured here is a statement of God\u2019s essence, or, more precisely, of his essence for human beings: merciful but just. This image, which had such a great influence on the development of Christianity and Islam as well as Judaism, is of the highest importance in the understanding of the biblical God; it is almost as if the text is saying \u201cThis is all that can be known, intimately, of this God, and this is all one needs to know.\u201d There is no shape, no natural manifestation (in contrast to the thunder and lightning approach at Sinai\u2014but one should bear in mind what has just happened with the Calf): only words, which describe God\u2019s relationship to human beings.", "Moshe hastens, at the climactic moment, to plead on behalf of the people. Most curious is the fact that God does not seem to agree to \u201cgo in their midst,\u201d nor does he ever give in and reinstate Israel with the term \u201cmy people\u201d (see v.10). Nevertheless, it appears that the rift between deity and people has been satisfactorily repaired, given what comes next."], "The New Covenant": ["Exodus 34:10-28", "A preamble (vv.10\u201316) promises God\u2019s continued \u201cwonders\u201d and warns emphatically against Israel\u2019s mixing with the Canaanites upon its future possession of the land. Once the actual legislative content of the passage begins in v.17, one notes the continuation of the stylistic pattern which began with v.10: Deuteronomic language. The laws bespeak an agricultural society, not a nomadic one, and suggest that the warning against blending with Canaanite society may be from the perspective of a later period\u2014an Israel long settled in the land. Although some scholars see Egypt as the origin of the Calf symbol, it also has a well-known existence in Canaanite mythology, as a symbol of Baal, god of fertility. Therefore the connection between our text and that of Kings may be close indeed, and the Calf story may have had a very contemporary ring to later audiences.", "As is typical of the Calf narrative, our passage concludes, not only with wider issues\u2014the formal writing-down of the covenant\u2014but also with Moshe: that he neither ate nor drank during the encounter with God.

Gone is any reference to the molten image; the central concern is the effect of God\u2019s communication upon Moshe. Indeed, \u201cspeak\u201d occurs seven times here, and the formula \u201cthe skin of Moshe\u2019s face was radiating\u201d three times. Putting this section at the end of the narrative leaves the reader with the sense that Moshe\u2019s prayer for God\u2019s closeness in Chap. 33 has at last been answered, and that his very body now bears the sign of divine favor (note the use of the rich symbol of light). Communication between God and Moshe, with Israel witnessing and therefore involved again (in contrast to its removal from this activity at the beginning of Chap. 32), may now proceed again without interruption, and it will now be possible and appropriate to resume construction of the structure whose purpose it is to embody God\u2019s presence in the world of human beings."]}, "Part VI; The Building of the Dwelling": {"The Sabbath Restated": ["Exodus 35:1-3", "Bracketing the Calf Narrative, we return to the regulations concerning the Sabbath, which receive here a different explanation from what was given in 31:12\u201317.

The Israelites, at the close of the book chronicling their founding as a people, link up with God\u2019s scheme in creating the world. The Dwelling is therefore a reflection of the perfection of the world and the divine hand that oversees it.

Many of the phrases recur throughout the opening chapters of the book, but the main refrain is the concluding \u201cfire-offering of soothing savor for Y<small>HWH</small>.\u201d Three kinds of animals appear here; they are, again, all domesticated."], "Varied Sacrificial Offerings II": ["Leviticus 2:1-16", "The <i>minha</i>, understood earlier in the Bible as simply \u201ctribute\u201d or \u201cgift\u201d (cf.

Using a three-part structure of grain cooked in an oven/griddle/pan, paralleling Chap, 1\u2019s cattle/sheep/birds, the description of the <i>minha</i> focuses on the type of grain offered, what is added to it, the strictures against fermenting, and the \u201ccovenant of salt.\u201d The chapter ends with the usual refrain, \u201ca fire-offering for Y<small>HWH</small>.\u201d"], "Varied Sacrificial Offerings III": ["Leviticus 3:1-17", "The purpose of the so-called <i>shalom</i> sacrifice has been debated. Levine, for one, sees it as a \u201csacred gift of greeting,\u201d intended to address God in the fellowship of other laypeople and priests at a sacred meal. This communal, lay aspect of the sacrifice is significant. Some scholars have understood animal sacrifice to be essentially humanity\u2019s way of bonding with the gods (as well as with dead ancestors), and would thus see in the present form, with its emphasis on the meat, an example of this idea.", "Unlike the obligatory sacrifices, the shalom sacrifice accepts a variety of animals, and the rules regarding them are not as stringent. Some theorize that originally all meat-eating in ancient Israel was of this type.", "Once again, we have the division into larger and smaller domestic animals. Notable is the descriptive refrain regarding the disposal of the animals\u2019 innards."], "Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings I": ["Leviticus 4:1-35", "The first of these, the <i>hattat</i>, is the subject of voluminous recent debate among scholars. Formerly translated as \u201csin-offering,\u201d it is now (thanks to Milgrom) understood more accurately as a purification offering in a variety of settings. The <i>hattat</i> decontaminates the sanctuary, and apparently individuals as well, and so is extraordinarily important in Israelite cultic thinking and practice. B-R rendered it (as have others) as a \u201cde-sin offering,\u201d which, while inelegant, preserves the biblical connection between sin (moral pollution) and ritual pollution. Again the sacrifice involves a multiple structure, dealing with the different components of the community: priests, community as a whole, leaders, and individuals. The High Priest\u2019s ritual is more elaborate than those that follow, as befits the representative of the community. Once his ritual is complete, we encounter for the other parties the refrain \u201cand he/they shall be granted-pardon.\u201d", "Central to the <i>hattat</i>-offering is the use of its blood as a detergent to absorb and purify the pollution that has accrued in the sanctuary.

There is disagreement about whether the verb means \u201cto feel guilt\u201d (Milgrom) or \u201cto realize guilt\u201d; in any event, the sacrifice deals with the realm of blame/liability, especially in cases of unintentional wrongdoing. Notable in this chapter are several refrains: \u201cand the priest is to effect-purgation for him from his sin,\u201d \u201cit is a <i>hattat</i>-offering\u201d (which returns here), and \u201che shall be granted-pardon.\u201d"], "Instructions on Disposing of Sacrifices I": ["Leviticus 6:1-23", "What happened to the sacrifices after their being offered belongs to the category of what Hallo calls \u201cconsumption\u201d\u2014that is, a complex system of either nonuse (burning), \u201cpayment\u201d for the priests (eating), or permission for the worshiper to eat. Here again we encounter a threefold structure corresponding to groups of three sacrifices. This time, however, the order adopted depends on the frequency of the sacrifice, from daily to voluntary (Wenham). The chapter also introduces the important word <i>tora</i> (conventionally spelled <i>Torah</i>), \u201cinstruction,\u201d which will recur at key points throughout the first half of Leviticus.

For a discussion of the complex relationship between the Exodus and Leviticus texts, see Milgrom.) We now shift from a prescriptive mode to a descriptive, narrative one, which will prepare us for the brief but disastrous story of Aharon\u2019s sons in Chap. 10.", "A refrain here is various forms of \u201cas Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe,\u201d also a key phrase in the Exodus texts. In addition, one hears the constant use of the verb \u201cmake-holy,\u201d appropriate in this context.

Now the perspective changes to narrative, and is from the viewpoint of the priests\u2014with the recognition at the same time that it is a public ceremony. Again, as Milgrom has noted, there is no verbal component to the ceremony (although some have argued that it is inconceivable that sacrifices could have been offered in silence). The sacrifice of the <i>hattat</i>-offering, along with other types of offerings, once again suggests the importance of a purified, perfect system in the worship of God.", "The refrain in vv.4 and 6 concerns God\u2019s \u201cbeing-seen\u201d by the Israelites; what is in fact seen is his \u201cGlory\u201d or \u201caura,\u201d reminiscent of Mount Sinai and the completion of the Dwelling in the book of Exodus. The ending of the chapter also recalls the ending of Exodus, with the leaders blessing the people and fire proceeding from God."], "Systems Failure": ["Leviticus 10:1-20", "As so often in the Torah, a brief narrative breaks in at this point, apparently to illustrate the dangers associated with the priests\u2019 tasks that we have just celebrated in the previous chapter. Just as the sin of the Golden Calf followed scenes of revelation at Sinai, so here too we are taken from the pomp of the priests\u2019 installation and set face to face with human failure. Alternatively, the story could be explained as a lead-in to the laws on priestly behavior in vv.9\u201311, just as the Golden Calf story precedes a remade covenant in Ex. 34.", "What exactly was Nadav and Avihu\u2019s capital crime? Commentators over the ages have argued back and forth. Some see it as accidental: Nadav and Avihu somehow misconstrued what they were supposed to do\u2014but divine service can brook no errors on the part of the people\u2019s representatives. Other interpreters, taking their clue from v.9, feel that Nadav and Avihu were drunk and so not in full control of their ritual duties. Milgrom\u2019s suggestion, that the story serves to warn the Israelite audience to stay away from offering their own incense (which often was connected to idolatry), makes historical sense; but the context of the tale here, after what has gone before, makes the specific crime less important than the idea that the priests must in general \u201cget it right.\u201d", "The chapter has a three-part structure: crime/punishment/mourning; laws on drunkenness of priests and the proper disposal of the sacrifices; and a confrontation between Moshe and Aharon over ritual procedure, which is resolved, not by death but by reasoned discussion."]}, "Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification": {"The Dietary Rules": ["Leviticus 11:1-47", "After ten chapters devoted mainly to cultic rules, we move from the priestly altar to everyone\u2019s table\u2014a fine example of the dual concerns of Leviticus (later Judaism was in fact to dub the table an \u201caltar in miniature,\u201d taking literally the injunction in Exodus for Israel to become a \u201ckingdom of priests\u201d). The chapter, as mentioned in \u201cOn the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure,\u201d functions as a bridge between the first two parts of the book. As Hallo notes, it rounds out the question of consuming food, a major issue in sacrifices; it also introduces the motif of pollution in a systematic way (there were references to it in regard to sacrifices, but not in as full a manner). The use of \u201cInstruction\u201d in v.46 echoes the summaries of sacrifices in Chap. 7, while \u201cyou are to separate\u201d in v.47 links the chapter with the previous one. Looking forward, \u201cInstruction\u201d is also used in the pollution chapters that follow, and the fivefold repetition of \u201challow/holy\u201d in vv.44\u201345 even points us toward the major section on Holiness in the third part of the book.", "It should be noted that, from vv.24\u201340, eating is not the issue, but rather coming into contact with the carcass of a <i>tamei</i> animal.

Her separation from and reintegration into the community echo similar customs in many societies (see Bamberger); as often happens with life-cycle events, ritual here reflects what is happening psychologically. The doubling of the separation period when it is a girl that is born is best explained by the concept that a girl potentially doubles the \u201clife-leak\u201d that has taken place (Greenstein 1984a), since she will one day be a childbearing woman who will herself confront the life-death continuum.", "While men obviously do not contract ritual pollution through childbirth, the concept of pollution from bodily discharges applies to them as well, as in the case of an involuntary emission of semen (cf. Chap. 15).", "<i>Pollution from</i> Tzaraat (13): Notable in this chapter is the role of the priest, who functions neither as medicine man nor as doctor, but simply as a religious official whose duty it is to check the afflicted person for signs of what is considered ritually polluting, and to act accordingly.", "Like other sections of Leviticus, this chapter and the next show signs of editing (for instance, the material in 13:47\u201359).

We now turn to the ceremony attending his purification and, from v.33 on, that of a house. In a complex ritual that foreshadows the great Purgation ceremony of Chap. 16 (with some connections to the ritual of purging the impurity of death in Num. 19), <i>tzaraat</i> is removed from its dangerous position in the camp. Many aspects seem to be archaic and even tinged with magic; in Milgrom\u2019s view, these characteristics survive only symbolically, and ancient Israel has rid itself of dependence on magic\u2014in his words, it has \u201ceviscerated\u201d demonism.", "The substances used for purification\u2014cedar, scarlet, hyssop\u2014seem to connote life (and hence remove the death symbolism of <i>tzaraat</i>): they all bear the red color of blood, which itself was the great biblical indicator of life (cf. 17:11 below). Notable is the adjective \u201cliving,\u201d applied to both the birds and the water utilized in the ceremony.", "The purification ritual itself, interestingly, parallels the consecration of the priests in Chap. 8. This is particularly evident in the fourfold dabbing of blood on the right extremities of the diseased person (cf. 8:23, 24 for the corresponding action). In Chap. 8, movement took place from the everyday sphere into that of the holy; here, the person with <i>tzaraat</i> moves from isolation to eventual reintegration into society (i.e., the camp).", "<b>14:1 Y<small>HWH</small></b> spoke to Moshe, saying:"], "Polluting Discharges": ["Leviticus 15:1-33", "This chapter concerns genital discharges\u2014both those that arise from disease and those that are normal but involuntary. As Levine notes, sexual purity was crucial for approaching the Israelite sanctuary, as opposed to ancient Near Eastern rituals in general, where sexuality was frequently part and parcel of the worship of the gods.", "Such pollution was considered much more contagious than that we have encountered previously, which is not surprising, given the area in which it falls. Wenham has noted the chiastic structure here, with male and female interchanging with short-term and long-term events. The core (vv.16\u201324)\u2014the normal flows of seminal emissions for men and menstrual discharge from women\u2014contrasts with discharges resulting from disease (vv.2\u201312, 25\u201327). The former merely pollute until sunset (except for the case of a couple having intercourse during the wife\u2019s period), and thus demonstrate the modesty and restraint in matters of divine worship more than pointing to some kind of stigma per se."], "The Day of Purgation/Atonement": ["Leviticus 16:1-34", "This chapter forms the climax of the section that began in Chap. 11. It is, along with Num. 19, the purification ritual par excellence, and has received much attention throughout the ages. As modern commentators have pointed out, two things are happening here: first, the sanctuary is being purged of the ritual pollution that has accumulated from both priests and laypeople; and second, the accumulated sins of the community are receiving atonement. It is not surprising, therefore, that the chapter is built on different uses of the verb <i>kipper</i>, which can denote covering, purging, atonement (expiation), or ransom; here the two meanings \u201cpurging\u201d and \u201catoning\u201d seem to fit the double context best. Probably the \u201cpurging\u201d part is the earlier one, as many ancient Near Eastern cults utilized purification ceremonies for their sanctuaries.", "Appropriately, the ritual includes two processes, outlined by Levine: riddance, which involves transferring sin to a living creature and driving it outside the community into the uninhabited wilderness, and purification, which utilizes the blood of a sacrifice (rather like the <i>hattat</i> encountered previously in the book). Both rituals are conducted largely by Aharon, who as High Priest acts on behalf of the entire community.", "Later Judaism was fascinated by these rites; a detailed account of how they were to be conducted in postbiblical times has survived in the Mishnah (ed. c. 200), and a narrative version is still verbally reenacted by traditional Jews once a year on the Day of Atonement.", "The chapter opens with direct mention of the deaths of Nadav and Avihu (Chap. 10). This serves at least two purposes: first, it creates a bracket into which the Leviticus texts on pollution occur; and second, it reminds the audience of the pressing need to purify the sanctuary, whose very first recorded defilement came about as a result of the illegitimate act of Aharon\u2019s sons."], "On the Shedding of Animal Blood": ["Leviticus 17:1-16", "This chapter appears to be either an appendix to the first two parts of the book (sacrifices and purity) or a transition between them and the chapters on \u201choliness.\u201d It must be said, however, that it does not use the standard wording of the holiness chapters. The text deals with the Israelites\u2019 slaughtering of animals for food outside the sanctuary (\u201cDwelling\u201d), insisting instead that such killing take place \u201cat the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.\u201d In contrast, Deut. 12:20ff. permits the slaughtering of animals for meat without bringing them to the sanctuary\u2014provided that their blood is poured out (since the consumption of blood is universally prohibited in the Torah). Scholars disagree about which practice came first; some (e.g., Wenham) argue for a wilderness setting here, while others see the chapter as reflecting the antipagan feelings of postexilic Israel (Bamberger; cf. v.7). Whatever the provenance, our chapter is clear about the extraordinary power of blood in Israelite thinking. As the life, which belongs to God, it must be returned to him, either actually, at the altar, or symbolically, on the ground (Greenstein 1984a). Here it is seen as effecting ransom; the life of the sacrificial animal substitutes for that of the sacrificer (cf. \u201cOn Sacrifice,\u201d above). The upshot is that the taking of animal life is done with extreme awareness and care.", "The chapter is built at least partially on repeating sound patterns. A threefold refrain is \u201cthat man is to be cut off from his kinspeople,\u201d stressing the seriousness of the prohibition. Four times we hear \u201cany-man, any-man\u201d (Heb. <i>ish ish</i>), reinforcing the unusually broad scope of the command indicated by the beginning of the chapter (\u201cto Aharon and to his sons and to all the Children of Israel\u201d). Finally, in v.10 through 15, the word <i>nefesh</i> occurs nine times, with the alternating meanings of \u201cperson\u201d and \u201clife\u201d (the pattern is 1\u20133\u20131\u20133\u20131 in these meanings)."]}, "Part III; Holiness": {"Pollution from Forbidden Unions": ["Leviticus 18:1-30", "Now begin, thematically and stylistically, the chapters on holiness. Like much of this final section of the book, Chap. 18 is distinguished by its powerful use of rhetoric (cf. vv.3\u20135, similar in tone to much of Deuteronomy). Separation returns as a major theme, this time stressing the divide between Israel and the nations around (vv.3 and 27\u201330). The emphasis on sexuality mirrors that on food in Chap. 11; the two often reflect each other in culture, both in practice and in imagery Thus the wording here (\u201cit is insidiousness,\u201d \u201cit is perversion\u201d) parallels the rhetoric of Chap. 11 (\u201cit is abomination,\u201d \u201cit is a detestable-thing\u201d). Structurally, just as the laws on pollution began with categories of and distinctions between animals for the purpose of eating, so the holiness laws begin with categories of and distinctions between partners for the purposes of sexual relations (Eilberg-Schwartz, Goodman). The confusing of boundaries again becomes a grave matter.", "In Schwartz\u2019s (1987) view, the list of forbidden women goes through a sequence from close relatives, to indirect ones, to women related to each other, and finally to other cases of \u201cabomination.\u201d In general, the list deals with women whose sexuality and reproductivity are controlled by males (Wegner 1992)\u2014in other words, it reflects a highly patriarchal society.", "An odd omission of sexual prohibitions is the one between a man and his daughter; perhaps it was universally understood as the primary one, and hence did not require mentioning.", "Refrains in the chapter, which create its backbone, include \u201cI am Y<small>HWH</small> your God\u201d and the constant \u201cthe nakedness of X you are not to expose.\u201d Late in the chapter, the words \u201cabomination\u201d and \u201c<i>tum\u2019a</i>\u201d frequently recur."], "General Regulations on Holiness I": ["Leviticus 19:1-37", "As the key chapter of this part of Leviticus, Chap. 19 is wide-ranging and rhetorically powerful. It extends holiness to virtually all areas of life\u2014family, calendar, cult, business, civil and criminal law, social relations, and sexuality. Most (but not all) of the laws deal with what we would term ethics, that is, relations between people (Wenham notes the alternation of the terms \u201cfellow [citizen],\u201d \u201ckinsman,\u201d and \u201cneighbor\u201d). As such, they have become an exemplar and a cornerstone, at least in idealized form, in Western thinking about these issues.", "Structurally speaking, the chapter is not systematic. As Schwartz (1987)has noted, this is probably intentional, reflecting the desire to avoid categorization or compartmentalization of life before God. He lays out the structure of the core part of the chapter, vv.3\u201332, as discrete subsections, each ending with \u201cI am Y<small>HWH</small> [your God],\u201d with vv.33\u201336 as two appendices, and a summary in v.37.", "The opening (v.2) is crucial, even though the word-root \u201choly\u201d does not recur in the chapter (it does, however, reverberate within the next four chapters). The style is predominantly apodictic\u2014\u201cYou are not to \u2026,\u201d as was Chap. 18, and concentrates mostly on the negating of certain kinds of behavior. At the same time, the chapter makes a moving positive plea for proper treatment of the elderly, the poor, and, in general, one\u2019s \u201cneighbor\u201d (which is extended to the foreigner [\u201csojourner\u201d] in vv.33\u201334)."], "General Regulations on Holiness II": ["Leviticus 20:1-27", "We move now into laws dealing with some of the more serious offenses against God in the biblical view: idolatry (including worship of the \u201cMolekh\u201d and consulting spirits), insulting parents, adultery, and sexual crimes. These are distinguished from the previous chapter by the inclusion of punishments; their seriousness is indicated by their capital nature. The reiteration of sexual laws forms a bracket with Chap. 18, thus highlighting the central position and rhetoric of 19. Another bracket, this time within the chapter, involves the chiasm of necromancy and the exhortation to be holy (vv.6\u20137 and 26\u201327). Finally, while the motifs of the Israelites avoiding pagan practices, and the land \u201cvomiting out\u201d its wrongdoers, return from Chap. 18, there is a further throwback (vv.24\u201326): to Chap. 11, where \u201cseparation\u201d from the nations was a major issue in terms of diet."], "Regulations Concerning Holiness: Priests I": ["Leviticus 21:1-24", "This chapter, and the one that follows, relate holiness to the suitability of priests to serve in the sanctuary. The laws are in the main negative ones, that is, they outline ways in which a priest may be disqualified. The first part of the chapter concentrates on how contact with death disqualifies a priest; in Levine\u2019s view, this avoidance of the dead reflects the Bible\u2019s abhorrence of pagan cults centered around death. The laws concerning soundness of body and sexuality confirm earlier passages on holiness as wholeness.", "The central word-root is again \u201choly\u201d; six times in Chaps. 21\u201322 we hear the refrain \u201cI am Y<small>HWH</small> the one-who-hallows you/them.\u201d"], "Regulations Concerning Holiness: Priests II": ["Leviticus 22:1-33", "The priestly rules on holiness continue, with special attention given to the priest\u2019s proper state when he eats of the \u201choly donations.\u201d The second part of the chapter, from v.17 on, turns to the state of the sacrificial animals. They are to be without blemish, just as the priests must be (cf. Chap. 21). This correspondence between human and animal has been noted before; it is part of Leviticus\u2019s general scheme of a perfect God requiring perfection in worship."], "Holy Days": ["Leviticus 23:1-44", "Having dealt with holiness in such areas as worship, family life, ethics, priestly qualifications and behavior, and sacrificial animals and objects, the text now turns to holiness in time: the sacred calendar. While all ancient societies marked sacred time, in Judaism as it evolved out of the Bible the calendar took on particular significance, especially in the situation of exile. The centrality of time in Judaism has been articulately portrayed by Heschel; here we will limit discussion to the fullest of the biblical sacred calendars (others occur in Ex. 23 and 34, and Deut. 16), the one set forth in the present chapter.", "The scheme is characteristically Levitical\u2014it focuses on order and perfection, expressing these qualities by the use of the number 7, which was used thus in a number of ancient Near Eastern cultures. A partial list in this regard would include: 7 days from sabbath to sabbath; 7 days of two major festivals, spring and fall; 7 weeks between the two pilgrimage festivals in the spring; and all the holy days falling within the first 7 months of the year, with a major cluster occurring in the seventh month. To this could be added material from other passages in the Torah: 7 years to every sabbatical year (Ex. 23:10\u201311, Lev. 25:2\u20137, Deut. 15:1\u20133); and 7-times-7 years (plus one) till each Jubilee year (Lev. 25:8\u201317). One could go further (cf. the discussion and lists in Jenson), but the thrust should be clear: time, as well as space and behavior, is to be ordered in a way that again reflects divine perfection. One might also mention the continuation of this kind of thinking in both later Judaism and Christianity, which looked upon history itself in a schematic way.", "As laid out in Leviticus, the sacred days of the seventh month follow a conventional ancient pattern described by Gaster (1961): the dying of the old year (\u201cmortification\u201d and \u201cpurgation,\u201d as expressed in Rosh Ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur), followed by the birth of the new year (\u201cinvigoration\u201d and \u201cjubilation,\u201d as expressed in Sukkot). The biblical calendar, then, evolved along dual tracks\u2014lunar-solar (lunar months of 29 or 30 days, with an extra month added in late winter, 7 times every 19 years); and spring/fall new year (Passover falls in the \u201cfirst month,\u201d but the full new year pattern, as we have mentioned, is played out in the fall).", "A final indication of a late provenance for Chap. 23\u2019s calendar lies in the long treatment (vv.9\u201322, a third of the chapter) of Shavuot, the \u201cFeast of Weeks.\u201d The emphasis seems to be on land here, suggesting a resettlement motif that would be particularly appropriate after the exile in Babylonia.", "Theme words in the chapter include: \u201cappointed-times,\u201d \u201cproclamation of holiness,\u201d \u201cthroughout all your settlements,\u201d \u201ca fire-offering to YHWH,\u201d and \u201canykind of servile work you are not to do.\u201d V39\u201343, on the practice of and rationale behind Sukkot, seem to be another addition to the text, as they disrupt its natural flow."], "Miscellany": ["Leviticus 24:1-23", "Two issues, unrelated to what has gone before, are treated here: certain ritual objects in the Dwelling (oil/lamps and \u201cshowbread\u201d), and the story of a man who insulted God and therefore had to be executed (along with further rules about capital crimes). The function of this chapter is not clear; perhaps it serves as a breather between the important sections on sacred days (23) and land tenure (25). It is also possible (as Levine notes) that chapters such as this one and Num. 15 serve as a repository for various cultic laws that needed a location. There are two other places in the Torah where a brief passage on the lights in the sanctuary may originally have served to separate sections: the end of Ex. 27 and the beginning of Num. 8. If so, that function no longer is as major as it once might have been.", "The first two parts (2\u20134 and 5\u20139) are linked by their common vocabulary: \u201ctake,\u201d \u201carrange,\u201d \u201cregularly,\u201d and \u201cbefore the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>\u201d (Wenham). The second section (vv. 10\u201323) is united by its chiastic structure (cf. Wenham here as well). It has points of contact with material in the Exodus laws, but here with the characteristic addition (v.22) of \u201cI, Y<small>HWH</small>, am your God.\u201d"], "Regulations Concerning Land and Slavery": ["Leviticus 25:1-55", "A final area of holiness that Leviticus discusses is that of ownership. The rules set forth in this chapter are based on the assumption that land, a most precious commodity in the ancient (and modern) Near East, and human beings, equally precious in the Bible, are not in fact the property of other human beings. The phrases \u201cthe land is not to be sold inharness, / for the land is mine\u201d (v.23) and \u201cFor my servants are they \u2026 they are not to be sold as the sale of serfs\u201d (v.42) express the main corollary: God is the sole owner of land and people. The chapter, then, sets out regulations that make perpetual human ownership of these impossible. In the case of land, not only is the soil to rest every seven years, but every fifty years (7 \u00d7 7 + 1), the land is to be \u201creleased\u201d back to its original owner (who \u201credeems\u201d it). Similarly, indentured servants\u2014those who are forced into working for someone because of debts\u2014are redeemable, if not by kin then by the occurrence of the Jubilee year.", "Several things about the chapter suggest a late date to Levine. Redemption focuses on the individual rather than on the clan; \u201cat Mount Sinai\u201d might indicate an editorial hand; and the passages here, unlike their counterparts in Ex. 21 and Deut. 15, concentrate less on eradicating poverty than on ensuring that property stays in the family over generations. Indeed, some of the conditions presupposed by the chapter suggest the situation portrayed in Neh. 5, after the Babylonian Exile."], "Conclusion: Blessings and Curses": ["Leviticus 26:3-45", "The initial ending of Leviticus (Chap. 27 was added later) follows a pattern common to treaties in the ancient Near East: it provides blessings for remaining loyal to God (the suzerain) and curses for spurning him. A similar pattern, with greater rhetoric and emotional force, occurs in Deut. 28\u201330, with briefer examples in Ex. 23:25ff. and Josh. 24:20. The blessings center around peace and its attendant benefit, agricultural abundance; the curses detail, in increasing force, the calamities brought on by war: famine, defeat, and ultimately exile. That the curses take up much more room than the blessings is not surprising, given the didactic nature of the chapter; this is also characteristic of ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaty literature, where the major emphasis is placed on what will happen if the pact is violated. Later Jewish tradition dealt with the devastating tone and content of the curses by prescribing that, when read publicly as part of the weekly Torah cycle, they be chanted in an undertone.", "The structure of the chapter gives strong indication that there has been considerable editorial work here, and that may explain some of the difficulties in the later parts of the chapter. The confusion may well reflect the passage of time during and after the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587 <small>B.C.E.</small>, and thus an evolving response to the catastrophe. The pattern (suggested by H. L. Ginsberg, who is quoted by Levine) moves from doom to hope, and then to an explanation of why restoration has been delayed. In any event, it should be noted (as Levine does) that the curses are not all doom; they do, at various points, leave the door open for Israel\u2019s \u201cturning,\u201d a point much emphasized by the Prophets.", "Lev. 26 is the first great monotheistic response to catastrophe, built on the idea that human beings have the capacity to influence their own fate by obeying or disobeying God. In Judaism, which was to experience numerous such catastrophes over the course of its history, literary response became an important mode of coping. Christianity took its own characteristic path in answering some of the same issues on a personal level."]}, "Part I; The Wilderness Camp": {"The Mustering of Israel": ["Numbers 1:1-54", "For the opening of the book about the Israelites\u2019 wanderings in the wilderness, the editor has chosen a logical point of departure: a tally of males prepared for war, listed by tribe. It is in fact a double list\u2014first, the names of the tribal representatives who are to assist Moshe, and second, the count itself. The chapter is the epitome of orderliness, proceeding from the date of the census to who is to be counted, on to the counters and the census itself, and finally a treatment of the special case of the Levites (who, as noncombatants, are not mustered). It utilizes a number of repeating phrases, especially in the central census section. In this sense, the opening chapters of the book are a fitting companion to Leviticus\u2014which likewise opens with God speaking from the Tent of Appointment, still in the Wilderness of Sinai.", "The large numbers that appear here have been a major source of debate in modern as well as earlier interpretation. After all, extrapolating from 600,000 adult males (excluding the elderly), one certainly winds up with a population in the millions\u2014a theoretically possible but extremely unlikely scenario. Some alternatives are: (a) to understand Hebrew <i>elef</i> as not \u201cthousand,\u201d but rather as \u201cunit\u201d or \u201cdivision,\u201d which would especially make sense in a military setting; and (b) to regard the numbers as simply exaggerated. One might also, following Olson, see the statistics here as an attempt to impress the audience with the size of Israel, and/or to demonstrate how God has blessed them (as in the promises to Avraham in Genesis and the account in Ex. 1). There may, finally, be a \u201cnumbers game\u201d occurring here, that is, some kind of symbolism of figures that eludes us (cf. Sarna 1986)."], "The Layout of the Camp": ["Numbers 2:1-34", "Chap. 2 lays out a schematic diagram of the Israelite camp prepared for the desert march. The \u201cDwelling\u201d naturally stands at the center, with four groups of three tribes each surrounding the structure on the outside, and three groupings of Levite clans guarding the inside of the rectangular sanctuary. Geographical pride of place, the eastern side, goes to the tribe of Yehuda (Judah) and two other tribes tracing their ancestry to sons of Lea (outside track), while Moshe and Aharon and their sons occupy the inside track."], "Levites I": ["Numbers 3:1-51", "Already introduced in 1:47\u201353, the issue of the Levites\u2019 status and their tasks is an important subtheme in Numbers, and makes its central appearance in Chaps. 3 and 4. The present chapter opens with the genealogy of Moshe and Aharon (similarly, Chap. 6 of Exodus, which is a prologue to the Plague cycle, contains a genealogy of the two leaders).", "Notable is the concept that the Levites symbolically replace all the firstborn sons among the Israelites. In a more manageable way, then, the entire community participates in the sacred task of ministering in the sanctuary.", "Theme words in the chapter, not surprisingly, are \u201ccharge,\u201d \u201ccount/accountable,\u201d and \u201cserve/serving-tasks.\u201d Milgrom has also noted the sevenfold \u201cby order of Y<small>HWH</small>\u201d that permeates this chapter and the next."], "Levites II": ["Numbers 4:1-49", "Here the tasks of the Levites are presented in great detail and listed according to clan. The jobs involve the guarding, dismantling, and transport of the \u201csancta\u201d (holy objects). We are subsequently given a census of the Levites from ages 30 to 50, which fits here better than in Chap. 1. This age of service implies, perhaps, the physical strain associated with Levite tasks."], "Priestly Matters; The Wife Under Suspicion": ["Numbers 5:1-31", "Chaps. 5 and 6 are texts that seem most appropriate in a priestly setting. In both cases, the priest plays a central role in the ceremony described, administering the test and oath to the suspected adulteress and purifying the Nazirite (Milgrom).", "Here, as in several other cases in the book of Numbers, texts that one might have expected to find in Leviticus seem to have been deferred. The reasons are not difficult to fathom. Leviticus as it has been edited deals with three broad areas: the sacrificial cult, ritual pollution and purification, and holiness in communal and priestly behavior. Chaps. 5 and 6 of Numbers do not easily fit into these categories, although some connections can be found. These chapters are also long, detailed cases, and it is possible that they might have deflected the central thrust of Leviticus.", "Having said this, Chap. 5 opens, appropriately, with concern for the purity of the sacred camp that has just been described in Chap. 2. It continues with an innovation (vv.5\u201310): some sins that were intentional can now apparently be expiated via confession and an <i>asham</i>-offering (cf. Lev. 5)\u2014unlike the situation that obtains in Lev. 4\u20135, where it is only sins committed \u201cin error\u201d that are forgivable by means of the sacrificial system (with the addition of confession and restitution). This little section has been placed here perhaps because of its verbal link with the next, larger section\u2014which addresses the issue of \u201cbreaking faith\u201d (vv.6 and 12).", "Beginning with v.11, we encounter a strange ceremony such as is found nowhere else in the Torah. Its odd aspects are not surprising, though, given the gravity of the accusation. Adultery in ancient Israel was a capital crime, while in the rest of the ancient Near East (Mesopotamia, for instance) it could sometimes be expiated through payment to the wronged husband. And significantly, it is the husband who is in total control here, and the mere \u201cbreath of suspicion\u201d (a possible rendering of the text\u2019s \u201crush of jealousy\u201d in v.14) on his part results in a grave psychological ordeal for his wife. This is consistent with the male control over the sexuality of wives (and daughters) often observed in biblical texts (cf. Wegner 1988); there was of course no such procedure in regard to husbands. The last verse is telling; it presumes guilt on the part of the wife.", "Frymer-Kensky (1984) sees the chapter as a manual for priests, and as a ritual that addresses \u201ca crisis in the legal system\u201d\u2014for the crime is not provable by human agency (Milgrom points out that the word for \u201cadultery\u201d does not appear at all). She views the structure of the central parts of the ritual as revolving around pairs of verbs: the priest is to have the woman \u201cstand before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>\u201d (vv.16\u201318); \u201cswear\u201d (vv.19, 21); and \u201cdrink\u201d (vv.24, 27). The combination of drink, oath-taking, and declaration of innocence is found elsewhere in the ancient Near East (Fishbane 1974).", "Fishbane (1980) notes how the chapter ends with two summaries (vv.29 and 30) relating back to the descriptions in vv.12\u201314. The phrase found at the end of the chapter, \u201cThis is the Instruction,\u201d often concludes ritual sections in the Torah (cf. Lev. 11\u201315), and indeed is found in 6:21 below; it may indicate the former existence of these laws in separate scrolls."], "The Nazirite": ["Numbers 6:1-21", "A \u201cconsecrated\u201d or \u201cseparate\u201d person, traditionally transcribed as \u201cNazirite\u201d after the Hebrew <i>nazir</i>, was one who took upon himself or herself a special vow, exceeding the normal demands of the religious life. The urge to such behavior appears throughout the ages in many religious traditions, and doubtless reflects a deep-seated human desire. The motivation may stem from a joyous or tragic event, or simply from the need to serve God in what is felt to be a fuller way.", "Three prohibitions characterize the Nazirite: no drinking anything made from grapes (note the Bible\u2019s early sense that cultivation of the vine is problematic\u2014the story of Noah\u2019s drunkenness in Gen. 9:20ff.); no shaving the hair (hair was understood by the ancients as possessing almost magical characteristics); and no contact with the dead (including relatives; death was considered the major poilutant in Israelite thinking). Given that the Nazirite\u2019s vow has a finite period, Milgrom theorizes that our chapter represents a priestly attempt to control ascetic urges.", "The ritual (vv.12ff.) that ends the Nazirite\u2019s \u201cstate of consecration\u201d involves a variety of sacrifices, most notably a <i>hattat</i>-offering (cf. Lev. 4). This purification offering suggested to later interpreters that the Nazirite vow was to be viewed in at least a somewhat negative light. Certainly by Rabbinic times, formative Judaism came to look askance at undue asceticism; on the other hand, religious vows and abstentions were to survive and even flourish in medieval and later Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.", "In light of the fact that a Nazirite could be either a man or a woman, the translation of this chapter uses \u201cone\u201d regularly instead of the text\u2019s \u201che\u201d\u2014which in any event indicates both genders in this chapter."], "The Priestly Blessing": ["Numbers 6:22-27", "with which the chapter ends is striking and sufficiently beloved by Jews to have survived to this day in the synagogue liturgy. But why is it here? Perhaps the blessing of the people is yet another example of a priestly function that has not been preserved in Leviticus, since it relates neither to sacrifice nor to purification (although it should be pointed out that Moshe and Aharon give an unquoted blessing to the people in Lev. 9:23).", "The blessing itself makes wonderful use of ancient Hebrew rhythm, with a threefold structure of progressively longer lines that is reminiscent of a magical formula. The varied verbs give comfort and reassurance, as does the last word of the blessing: <i>shalom</i> (\u201cwell-being\u201d). The benevolent \u201clifting\u201d of God\u2019s face is a known image in the ancient Near East (cf. the references in Fishbane 1988). Its devastating opposite, the \u201chiding\u201d of his face, is found in the Psalms, and also in Deut. 31.", "That this section was popular already in biblical times is indicated by its occurrence in a two-part version in Ps. 67:2, as well as its appearance, in various forms, on ancient Israelite amulets."], "The Gifts to the Sanctuary": ["Numbers 7:1-89", "Chaps. 7\u20139 constitute a threefold conclusion to the Tabernacle texts that began in Ex. 25. The contribution of each chapter will be explained in sequence.", "The longest chapter in the Torah in number of verses, and another one of the many lists in the book, Chap. 7 parallels what Levine calls \u201ctemple accounts\u201d in the ancient Near East. These are inventory lists that were frequently written in columns. At the same time, it is a ritual text that focuses on description and not prescription, which is more usual. The chapter ends in v.89 with the first of our Tabernacle endings: a description of precisely where God would communicate with Moshe within the \u201cHoliest Holy-Shrine.\u201d The implication is that with the dedication of the structure, its purpose can now be fulfilled.", "The length of the chapter reinforces the importance and grandeur of the ceremony, and makes of the \u201cDwelling\u201d an institution in which all participate, not only priests and Levites (Levine)."], "Purifying the Levites": ["Numbers 8:1-26", "A parallel to Lev. 8\u20139, where the dedication of the priests is the last act before the cult goes into operation, this chapter concludes the Levitical portions of Part I of Numbers\u2014a distinctive contribution, as we have noted. Many scholars see the Levitical sections as reflections of later power struggles within the Israelite priesthood. In Levine\u2019s view, this evolution (perhaps from family-based guilds into a full-fledged tribe) is an indication of a relatively late provenance for our text here.", "Milgrom rightly makes the distinction between the \u201cpurification\u201d of the Levites and the higher-level \u201challowing\u201d (i.e., sanctification) of the priests. It is also interesting to note the cultic rites used here: the offering of a <i>hattat</i> (the standard purificatory sacrifice), and mention of the Levites themselves being considered an \u201celevation-offering\u201d (v.11)."], "The Second Passover; Cloud and Dwelling": ["Numbers 9:1-23", "It has been noted by Milgrom that, a number of times in the Bible, ceremonies dedicating a House of God are followed by the observance of one of the three pilgrimage festivals: Passover, Shavuot (Weeks), and Sukkot (Huts). Under Solomon, Hezekiah, Josiah, and Ezra/Nehemiah, respectively, we find a major celebration of Sukkot, Passover, Passover, and Sukkot. This linking of sacred space with sacred time is only natural. The account here echoes the first Passover as well, which similarly inaugurated a wilderness march (Milgrom). In contrast to the Exodus account, however, something new has been added with the inauguration of the Tabernacle/Dwelling. In Exodus (12:43\u201349), the major laws concerning Passover had to do with excluding non-Israelites and not breaking the bones of the sacrificial lamb; here, the bone motif returns, but the existence of the sanctuary raises the issue of ritual pollution.", "The second part of the chapter (vv. 15\u201323) parallels the ending of the book of Exodus (40:36\u201338), where, once the Tabernacle has been dedicated, the \u201cCloud\u201d takes up residence there, to guide Israel \u201con all their marches.\u201d Our passage here is longer and rather redundant, perhaps in order to set the chronological framework of the narrative straight."], "Setting Out": ["Numbers 10:1-36", "Once trumpets for signaling the march have been made, the Israelites at last begin their trek from Sinai to Canaan\u2014nineteen days after the opening events and commandments of the book. True to the orderly character of Part I, which here draws to a close, the exact progression of the march is laid out, tribe by tribe and Levite subgroup by subgroup.", "A few other brief traditions have been included here: first, a renewed mention of Moshe\u2019s father-in-law (cf. Ex. 18), who is exhorted to accompany the Israelites to Canaan. This text most likely continues the tradition recorded in the Bible of friendship between Israelites and Kenites, Hovav\u2019s group.", "The departure sequence ends, as sections in the Bible sometimes do, with a poem\u2014in this case, the battle cry (similar to the one in Ps. 68:2) associated with the coffer (vv.35\u201336). These verses, now completely stripped of their military connotations, are universally used by Jews when Torah scrolls are taken out and put back in the synagogue ark on Sabbaths and holidays."]}, "Part II; The Rebellion Narratives": {"First Rebellion": ["Numbers 11:1-35", "The mood of the book, which up until now has been orderly and celebratory, abruptly shifts. We move from a God who commands, leaders who lead, and a people that obeys, to a bitter triangle of constant complaining, questioning of leadership, and divine punishment.", "The chapter that introduces the rebellion narratives is long and complex. Although it resembles Ex. 16 (the manna chapter) in some general respects, it has its own distinct vocabulary and concerns. It is stylistically held together by the repeating roots \u201ceat,\u201d \u201cgather,\u201d and \u201cweep\u201d; the \u201cgrumbling\u201d of the Exodus story does not yet appear. The chapter combines the people\u2019s complaints about the manna (and a concomitant craving for meat) with Moshe\u2019s complaints about how difficult it is to lead this people; both receive answer from God, the people in the form of quails and Moshe through the dissemination of prophetic gifts to others in the camp.", "It is in this chapter that Moshe\u2014the dramatic and at times tragic Moshe of the Golden Calf story in Exodus\u2014reappears as a character with deep emotions. Although his fate as a leader destined never to enter the Promised Land is not sealed until Chap. 20, one has the sense already here that the strain of his mission is beginning to tell. The vividness of the portrayal of Moshe is matched by that of the Children of Israel, whose words, usually complaints, include the picturesque description of Egyptian cuisine in v.5."], "Sibling Rebellion": ["Numbers 12:1-16", "A challenge to Moshe\u2019s leadership, which we had encountered both in Exodus and in the previous chapter, now comes from an unexpected source\u2014Aharon and Miryam. Their complaint begins with some kind of objection to Moshe\u2019s wife, but its core is quickly revealed in v.2: Does not God speak through them as well as through their stuttering brother? Milgrom speculates that it is the spreading of prophetic gifts in the previous chapter that gives them the idea. God\u2019s response is to clarify Moshe\u2019s uniqueness, and to punish Miryam\u2014yet Aharon gets off easily here, possibly owing to a later editor who was highly sympathetic to the priesthood descended from Aharon, or because the latter, as High Priest, could not be tainted by <i>tzaraat</i> without damaging his priesthood, as Lev. 22:4ff. suggests (Sakenfeld).", "Chap. 12 is linked to the previous chapter by use of the words \u201ceat\u201d and \u201cgather.\u201d As its own unit, it is built on the ironic use of Heb. <i>dabber be</i>-, which can mean either \u201cspeak through\u201d or \u201cspeak against.\u201d"], "The Spies in Canaan and Back": ["Numbers 13:1-33", "Here, as at the beginning of the book, we begin with a list\u2014this time, of the men Moshe sends out to reconnoiter the land of Canaan. Order may also be perceived in the phraseology of Moshe\u2019s questions to them (vv.18\u201320), and the mission goes well (witness the giant grape cluster in v.23). But everything falls apart in the middle of the report (vv.28ff.), and the ending of the chapter, in which the spies compare themselves (and, by extension, all the Israelites) to grasshoppers vis-a-vis the Canaanite natives of the land, is telling. It is a classic case of failure of nerve.", "Scholars have detected a number of creative hands in this and the next chapter, based on the text\u2019s alternating use of Calev and Calev/Yehoshua as the faithful spies, as well as other factors. The final result is a tug of war between sets of spies, the people, Moshe, and God. True to the new human tone of the narrative, so mundane a form as a reconnaissance mission has been here suffused with emotion, a trend that will continue throughout this part of the book."], "Rebellion and Evil Decree": ["Numbers 14:1-45", "Another long and dramatic account, this chapter contains echoes of previous narratives. The \u201cgrumbling\u201d of Ex. 16 finally returns, and God and Moshe talk to one another in a manner that recalls the Golden Calf incident of Ex. 32\u201334. God wishes to destroy the people and start all over again with Moshe; the prophet, for his part, reminds God of his essentially merciful nature, and basically blackmails him by pointing out what will happen to his reputation among the nations should he destroy the Israelites. Unlike the resolution in Exodus, this time the people\u2014at least the older generation\u2014are doomed to die out. After two years of both miraculous rescues and despair, it has become clear that the former slaves will not be able to accomplish the work of conquest\u2014even with divine help. That is to be left to their children, whom Moshe will address in Deuteronomy.", "V.26 begins a section that seems to double the earlier part of the chapter. Perhaps it stems from a separate tradition concerning the incident. It leads to the people\u2019s disastrous attempt to force the issue by invading Canaan without the Coffer and Moshe (hence, without God). Thus the spy story of 13\u201314, which began in orderly fashion, ends in disarray, with a crushing defeat."], "Interlude": ["Numbers 15:1-41", "Chap. 15, which gives respite from the striking rebellion narratives of 11\u201314, and a breather before the Korah story in 16\u201317 (although Wenham notes verbal ties to 13\u201314, and Buber 1988 to 16\u201318), brings together five rather disparate pieces of material that seem wrenched out of other contexts. We can, however, make some sense of them. Vv.1\u201316 (on various sacrifices) and 17\u201321 (about a \u201ccontribution\u201d for God) are commanded for the time \u201cwhen you enter the land of your settling / that I am giving you\u201d or \u201cwhen you enter the land / that I am bringing you to,\u201d connecting them to the potential entry into Canaan of the two previous chapters and thus providing a setting that is missing in most of Leviticus. Further, vv.1\u201316 and 22\u201331, which, like Lev. 4, deal with the unintentional sins of the Israelites, both make pointed reference to the \u201csojourner,\u201d the resident alien who is to be treated in respect of the laws involved here exactly like a native. The final section, on the tassels (Heb. <i>tzitzit</i>), is interestingly connected to the spy narrative via the term \u201cscout around\u201d in v.39 (Milgrom); \u201cscout\u201d had occurred seven times in the earlier story. \u201cBear in mind\u201d also recalls the many instances of \u201creminders\u201d in the Torah\u2014objects such as a portion of manna\u2014that serve as a visual warning or memorial for the Israelites of later generations. This is especially important after the Israelites\u2019 losing heart in Chaps. 13\u201314. Stylistically, the four sections just mentioned are drawn together by the use of the phrase \u201cthroughout your generations\u201d (vv.15, 21, 23, 38).", "This leaves the incident of the Sabbath violator in vv.32\u201336. It has clearly been placed in Numbers because it takes place \u201cin the wilderness\u201d (v.32); it has found its way into this specific chapter perhaps because it is, in its own way, a miniature rebellion story. Since it is so brief, it may well have been felt that it needed to be placed in a chapter already composed of short pieces. Stylistically it might have better appeared at the end of the chapter, but that position has been reserved for the rhetorically more dramatic section on the tassels.", "let us go up to (attack) the place that Y<small>HWH</small> promised,", "for we have sinned!"], "The Great Revolt": ["Numbers 16:1-35", "In the two collections of wilderness rebellion traditions we have encountered thus far in the Torah, Ex. 15:22\u201317:7 and Num. 11\u201314, the rebels are a faceless \u201cthe people\u201d or \u201cthe entire community.\u201d An exception was Num. 12, where Aharon and Miryam complained against their brother; their personal example is now taken up by another relative, in a memorable narrative. The story of the revolt of Korah the Levite and Datan and Aviram the Reubenites, which may have stemmed from two different accounts, holds the common thread of the rebels\u2019 feeling left out\u2014Korah, as Moshe\u2019s and Aharon\u2019s first cousin, might well have headed the priestly line (his father was older than theirs), whereas Datan and Aviram\u2019s tribe of Re\u2019uven had lost some of its firstborn primacy, and was not even camped on the choice east side of the Dwelling. Moshe clearly sees the political motivation behind the revolt, and is indignant that anyone would impute greed (cf. v.15) or lust for power to him.", "As Buber (1988) points out, however, more is at stake here. The rebels\u2019 contention that \u201cthe entire community, the entirety of them, are holy,\u201d though it sounds at first blush like the ideal expressed in Ex. 19:6 (God\u2019s offer to make of the Israelites \u201ca kingdom of priests, / a holy nation\u201d), is in reality a most dangerous claim. Holiness in the Bible is a trait that can be acquired, even transmitted to an extent, but it is not absolutely innate, except in the case of God; and the Torah sees as ope of its major goals developing the means whereby people can, with holy intent and preparation, properly serve the Holy. The fate of the rebels therefore bespeaks the seriousness of the threat they pose, and is unique in the Bible.", "The narrative hinges on a number of expressions. The conflict between Moshe and the rebels is nicely encapsulated by two pairs of identical charges and countercharges\u2014\u201cToo much (is) yours\u201d (vv.3 and 7) and \u201cIs it too little\u201d (vv.9 and 13). The terms \u201ccommunity\u201d and \u201cassembly\u201d are played upon, designating alternately the body of the people and the minicommunity of the rebels. More significantly, this chapter and those around it\u201415, 17, and 18\u2014are meaningfully linked together by variations on the Hebrew root <i>k-r-b</i> (Buber 1994). The thread of meaning runs from \u201cbringing near-offerings near,\u201d to God \u201cdeclaring [Moshe and Ahron] near\u201d to him, to the fact that he has \u201cbrought-near\u201d the Levites in terms of their duties, to Korah and his band being asked to \u201cbring-near\u201d the incense, whose fire-pans later become holy because they were \u201cbrought-near,\u201d and finally, to the repeated warning to outsiders not to \u201ccome-near\u201d the sancta. At issue is what Buber calls \u201cauthorized\u201d and \u201cunauthorized nearing,\u201d which is mentioned frequently in Leviticus but is used in the present text with the full artistic resources at the narrator\u2019s command. Viewed in this light, order is restored to the blurring of lines threatened by Korah.", "for it was an error,", "but they have brought their near-offering,", "a fire-offering of soothing savor for Y<small>HWH</small>,", "and their <i>hattat</i>-offering before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, on account of their error."], "Aftermath": ["Numbers 17:1-28", "The revolt of Korah, with its macabre ending, has made it clear that Levites must not \u201ccome-near\u201d the priestly domains, physically or professionally. Accordingly, the incense pans of the dead rebels become plating for the altar, as a warning for the future. The \u201cfire-pan\u201d becomes instrumental immediately thereafter, as Aharon must obtain forgiveness for the people, who understand the deaths of Korah and his followers as a political purge by the two brothers. Aharon\u2019s action, it should be noted, cannot prevent the initial round of deaths by divine plague.", "Upon hearing the \u201cgrumbling\u201d of the Israelites (a word that did not, interestingly, appear in the Korah story), God now deems it necessary to provide another sign: proof that it is the Sons of Aharon that he has chosen (cf. 16:5)\u2014as if the earth opening up were not enough! This is Aharon\u2019s flowering rod, a stick that, though long-severed from its original tree, still manages to produce flowers and fruit. The motif is noted in many other cultures (cf.

The priests\u2019 reward\u2014actually, their means of support\u2014consists of firstborn animals and firstffuits; the Levites\u2019, of tithes.", "The chief refrain in the chapter is variations on \u201cso that they may not die\u201d; this has occurred already in 17:25, thus linking Chaps. 17 and 18 nicely."], "Death and the Red Cow": ["Numbers 19:1-22", "Apparently to close out the Korah story, the text turns to a mysterious and powerful ritual, one designed to remove the contaminating pollution of death. It is important to note that the revolt in Chap. 16 led, not only to the deaths of the rebels and their households, but also to the perishing of 14,700 people in the subsequent plague (17:12\u201314). So despite the fact that priests and Levites now have their tasks straight, thanks to Chap. 18, there remains the serious matter of purification.", "Levine notes the typical priestly pattern at work: first the remedy is prescribed, and then the actual circumstances that call for it are enumerated. He also sees the chapter as essentially a protest against the widespread cult of the dead in the ancient Near East, from which the Israelites notably separated themselves.", "Milgrom has illuminated a number of aspects of the Red Cow ritual, notably by characterizing it as a sort of <i>hattat</i> ceremony. That ritual, it may be recalled, enabled the priests to decontaminate the sanctuary of ritual pollution, chiefly through the sprinkling of blood against the altar. Milgrom points to the unusual nature of the ritual here, in that the purifying agent (in this case, water that has been mixed with the special cow\u2019s ashes, which came partly from burned blood) is sprinkled on persons, not objects."], "Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites": ["Numbers 20:1-29", "The first part of this chapter contains a story that has deeply troubled readers for over two millennia. Its length belies its weight; in only thirteen verses, Moshe and Aharon have lost their most cherished dream\u2014the privilege of entering the Promised Land.", "The brevity here may result from the fact that, for the narrator, this story was a variant of, or constructed from, a similar one in Ex. 17, to explain more fully why the leaders shared the fate of their generation. In other words, their deaths may affect us more than the text meant it to. Nonetheless, the question of why exactly Moshe and Aharon received such a terrible punishment for a moment of indiscretion will not go away. Can it really be that the towering figure of Moshe, liberator and lawgiver, parent and prophet, is to be done away with in the blink of an eye, over a fit of justifiable temper? But it is a public moment, and there the answer may lie. The Bible consistently takes a stringent view of leadership: that leaders must be above reproach, and that they must not lose sight of the fact that it is God whom they represent. A similar impulse led to the strict standards to which the writer of Samuel-Kings, the so-called Deuteronomistic historian, held such revered personalities as David and Solomon.", "From v.14 to v.21, the text gives us a moment to digest what has just happened, at the same time managing to introduce the major theme of the next several chapters: encountering other peoples and tribes as the Israelites near Canaan. First is Edom, in the territory to the east roughly between Eilat and the Dead Sea. The sequence begins tentatively, not with an Israelite victory, but not with a defeat either: they are forced to reroute their approach.", "So as to keep the memory of Merivat-Kadesh close, the chapter ends with the death of Aharon, \u201cbefore the eyes of the entire community\u201d (v.27). For the first time in all the rebellion texts, the word \u201crebel\u201d itself is used (v.24). On a positive note, leadership is seamlessly passed to the next generation; when Moshe returns from witnessing Aharon\u2019s death, he is accompanied by the latter\u2019s son El\u2019azar, who is tellingly dressed in Aharon\u2019s garments.", "cut off shall that person be from the midst of the assembly,", "for the Holy-Area of Y<small>HWH</small> has he made-<i>tamei</i>,", "Waters Kept-Apart have not been dashed upon him,", "he is <i>tamei!</i>"], "First Victory: Rebellion Again; Traveling; Sihon and Og": ["Numbers 21:1-35", "A miscellany of wilderness traditions, Chap. 21 begins with a military victory\u2014perhaps a sign that Israel\u2019s terrible trials are coming to an end. Not insignificantly, the victory comes after the Israelites have properly vowed to allot booty to God (v.2), a far cry from their willful attempt at conquest at the end of Chap. 14. This brief account may in fact be a reworking or different account of the Horma incident in that passage.", "The strange events surrounding the \u201cviper of copper\u201d that follow provide a reminder, even amid the progress of the march and military successes, of the Israelites\u2019 usual waywardness. As usual, the problem is food; several things, however, make this brief story unusual amid the rebellion narratives. For one, the punishment is unique; for another, the people call upon Moshe to remove the plague\u2014in a manner that is more reminiscent of Pharaoh of Egypt, with the Plagues, than of previous Israelite behavior. Finally, there is the Bible\u2019s record of what happened to the copper object: it was preserved in the cult and worshiped by the people, until it was smashed during the large-scale religious reform under King Hezekiah of Judah (late eighth century <small>B.C.E.</small>). One might note that the divine punishment for sin, once accomplished, clears the way for the Israelite victories that follow immediately.", "Of additional interest in this chapter is the inclusion of three ancient poems (vv. 14\u201315, 17\u201318, and 27\u201330), whose origins and language are both obscure. Preceded by a brief itinerary of the Israelites\u2019 travels up to Moabite territory, soon to be the scene of the Bil\u2019am narratives (Chaps. 22\u201324), the chapter ends with two successful clashes against local kings, Sihon and Og. While the accounts here are brief, postbiblical Jewish tradition took delight in spinning fantastic tales about these two kings (cf. Ginzberg)."], "The Hiring of Bil'am": ["Numbers 22:1-41", "Faced with overwhelming evidence of Israelite superiority, especially as evinced in the previous chapter, the Moabite king Balak tries to vanquish the invaders via a means more powerful than force of arms: a sorcerer\u2019s curse. The first part of the story is memorable in its vivid characterization, use of theme words, and comic thrust. The central personalities have suggestive names: Balak sounds like a verb that means \u201cto destroy,\u201d Bil\u2019am suggests \u201cswallower\u201d (hence destroyer), and Be\u2019or, present only as the name of the sorcerer\u2019s father, also connotes \u201cdestroying.\u201d The text uses two different words for \u201ccurse,\u201d soon to be joined by a third. The chapter introduces key themes of the story: \u201chonor,\u201d which Bil\u2019am will refuse in the overwhelming face of God\u2019s truth; \u201conce again,\u201d through which it becomes clear that, for God, \u201conce [refusal of permission for Bil\u2019am to go] is once-and-for-all,\u201d and God\u2019s blessing, once given, will not be rescinded (Rosenzweig 1994); and the emphatic refrain that, as noted above, in one form or another will echo throughout the story, \u201cwhatever God tells me, that (alone) must I speak/do.\u201d Most memorable, of course, is the sequence about the talking donkey, which must have been more than a little amusing to ancient audiences. For here we have a dumb animal who sees divine messengers and possesses the divine gift of speech, contrasting with a prophet\u2014who in Israelite thinking was supposed to be distinguished by his abilities as \u201cseer\u201d and mouthpiece of God\u2014who sees nothing and raises his voice only to complain."], "Bil'am's First Visions": ["Numbers 23:1-30", "Having been granted permission to hire himself out to Balak, but with the caveat that he may speak only God\u2019s word, Bil\u2019am prepares to curse Israel.

And, professionally speaking, hired prophets are supposed to tell kings what they want to hear."], "Bil'am the Prophet": ["Numbers 24:1-25", "Few moments in the Torah, to my thinking, can compare with what now happens in this story. The description of Bil\u2019am\u2019s transformation in the opening verses is matched and even surpassed by what happens to the poetry of this section.

As the last section of Part II (at least as I have laid out the book\u2019s structure), it prevents the wilderness traditions from ending on an up note. The Bil\u2019am cycle with its exalted poetry would have made a positive conclusion, but the editor does not wish us to forget the basic facts of Israel\u2019s wilderness experience: dissatisfaction, complaint, and rebellion.

His action here recalls the killing spree of the Levites at the Golden Calf incident, another major apostasy (Wenham). The text goes out of its way to name also specific offenders; the Moabite woman who is remembered for evil is, in fact, the daughter of a chieftain.", "The horrifying details of Pin\u2019has\u2019s act remind the reader once again that, for the biblical writers, idolatry was the worst of all crimes.

These children of slaves are now mustered, in the same tribal order as the census in Chap. 1. The purpose of the counting is set forth in vv.52\u201356: so that the Promised Land may be properly divided up, according to population. True to the scheme of Chap. 1, the Levites go through their own census (vv.57\u201362)\u2014since they receive designated towns but not a large mass of land. The ending verses assure us that the census in this chapter does not include anyone of the Exodus generation, excluding Calev and Yehoshua.

In that vein, the text, in almost Talmudic fashion, brings a case with some difficulties: What if a father dies without sons but does leave daughters\u2014may they inherit the ancestral land, given the context of a patriarchal society? Moshe is unable to solve the problem, but must leave it up to God, who rules that not only daughters but other relations as well may serve to keep the land in the family (an attendant question, how to keep land within a tribe\u2019s territory, will be answered in Chap. 36). This section of the chapter is a good example of a law embedded in a narrative, or a narrative created for the sake of a law. It also has the effect of showing that the divine promise of land is about to be fulfilled, that all tribes must be included in the process, and that the growing biblical tradition allows for reinterpretation (Olson).", "From v.12 on, we are reminded that Moshe is about to die. In an expansive speech (vv.18\u201321), God designates Yehoshua as Moshe\u2019s successor, and publicly the aging leader transfers authority to him. Given the structure of Part III of the book, which is bracketed by daughters of Tzelofhad sections, we might expect Moshe\u2019s death to parallel the passage here, and thus come at the end of Chap. 36.

We would expect 28 and 29, which form a logical unit and enumerate the sacrifices brought on holy days, to be properly placed in Leviticus. In fact, Lev. 23 does set out a sacred calendar. The purpose of that passage, however, was to indicate the overlay of the holy on the cycle of the year; the material here neither creates the calendar itself nor has anything to do with either voluntary offerings or those brought for expiation of sin. It may have been inserted at this point, in this book, because in its drawn-out, formulaic rhetoric, it has the character of a list such as we often find in Numbers. Part III of the book is a logical setting for it, given that it concentrates on the \u201cpilgrimage-festivals\u201d that fit a settled, agricultural context, and these chapters deal with various issues arising from Israel\u2019s immanent possession of the land.", "Interesting is the addition of the New Moon festival (vv.11ff.), not mentioned in Lev. 23. It was apparently a serious holy day, although the Bible does not forbid work on it.

Wegner 1988). In this respect it continues the priestly concern with women, who do not always fit the priestly categories as neatly as that class might have wished. The length of the chapter signals the importance, or rather the sacredness, of an oath in ancient Israel; it stood as uttered unless an annulment procedure was followed. Human words, and not only divine ones, were seen as having effects in the real world.", "The chapter is built around repeating words, such as \u201cvow,\u201d \u201cbind,\u201d \u201cestablish,\u201d \u201cannul,\u201d and \u201csilent.\u201d"], "War against Midyan": ["Numbers 31:1-54", "We return to preconquest war traditions, such as we encountered in Chap. 21.

And it is unfinished business that he takes up here, since the Midyanites had been identified as the ones who lured the Israelites to sin at Baal Pe\u2019or (25:16\u201318). Also notable in this long chapter is the detailed account of dividing the spoils (vv.25\u201354); this is both characteristic of Numbers, as a list, and an indication of an important issue that will need attention once the conquest proper proceeds. It also may be an indication of a later tradition; Levine sees in the allotment of spoils for sanctuary income a characteristic royal policy.", "The cruel aspect of this war, while not unusual by ancient standards, feels jarring to modern Jewish and Christian readers, who perhaps expect the Bible to be more peace-oriented. It is not, although it often \u201cseeks peace,\u201d and there are passages (e.g., Deut. 20 and 21:10\u201314) where an attempt is made to mute some of the harsh realities of ancient warfare.", "Niditch has pointed out that this chapter presents an ideology of war slightly different from some other biblical accounts. The term \u201cdevote-to-destruction\u201d is not used; virgin girls, who are not yet of the status of \u201cthe enemy,\u201d are spared; and war is seen as a ritually defiling activity, i.e., contact with death.

Moshe accedes to their wish, provided that they assist their fellow Israelites in conquering Canaan proper. The historical result of this settlement\u2014which gives us a taste of settlement before the larger conquest in the book of Joshua\u2014seems to have been a checkered one, with Moabites and Ammonites reclaiming land at various subsequent periods.", "Milgrom has demonstrated how the chapter is built by a select vocabulary of words repeated seven times; the whole may be summarized by the composite statement \u201cIf Gad and Reuben cross over as vanguard [Heb. <i>h-l-tz;</i> see below) before Y<small>HWH</small>, they will receive the land holdings (they desire).\u201d The sevenfold \u201cbefore Y<small>HWH</small>\u201d of the chapter drums in the participation of the divine in the conquest (Milgrom also brings up the possibility that it suggests the Coffer\u2019s presence at the battle)."], "The Wilderness Marches": ["Numbers 33:1-56", "Another list in the book of Numbers traces the full journey of the Israelites from Egypt\u2014as the Egyptians are still burying their firstborn dead!\u2014to a spot opposite Jericho by the Jordan.

Greenberg (1959) has claimed that the specified towns probably were a substitute for what in other ancient Near Eastern societies was banishment; in his view, the idea of internal banishment presented here affirms the high and nonnegotiable value put on human life in the Bible\u2014even when it is ended by accident. Be that as it may, the law in this chapter puts a brake on a reality of ancient life.", "It is likely that the towns in question were previously sacred Canaanite towns, and Frick has raised the interesting possibility that from that special character or status may have evolved the concept of citywide asylum (and not just at the altar, a temporary measure)."], "A Case of Inheritance: Daughters of Tzelofhad II": ["Numbers 36:1-13", "To round out both Part III and the entire book, the text returns to issues of inheritance, brought up first in Chap. 27. The decision rendered here (that the daughters of Tzelofhad may inherit their father\u2019s holdings, but that they must agree to marry within their tribe) ties the final loose end relating to the land, and so we are able to leave the wilderness narratives and laws with a sense that the future in the Promised Land is both assured and orderly.

This section is connected to the previous material by its evocation of past events (the sin at Baal Pe\u2019or and the revelation at Sinai/Horev), but it also points to the future, by means of its vision of exile and return. Not surprisingly, the words \u201chear/hearken,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201claws (and regulations),\u201d and \u201ccommand\u201d are all key expressions; these become increasingly important in the chapters to follow.", "Ironic is the repeated warning, which appears here for the first time, not to add anything to the Instruction.

Perhaps this has been placed here because it is one of the few \u201claws and regulations\u201d in the Torah whose observance is mandated on the east bank of the Jordan River\u2014and hence is one of the few that Moshe personally gets to carry out."]}, "Part II; Opening Exhortation": {"The Basic Rules": ["Deuteronomy 4:44-5:30", "After a brief introduction, the text appears to begin the sequence of \u201claws and regulations\u201d with the Ten Commandments.

Here memory is the key: the experience of slavery in Egypt, Israel\u2019s trying behavior in the wilderness, and, above all, the constant rescuing grace of God. The idea that there should be constant reminders of the covenant became a staple of Jewish ritual practice, from the early education of children in the biblical text, to the <i>tefillin</i> (see below) worn in daily prayer, to the <i>mezuza</i> (a small box containing passages from Deuteronomy) on the doorpost.

A logical result of the centralization of the cult is the need to permit the eating of meat in local sites; previously it had been permitted only at the Dwelling (cf.

In all three cases, the penalty is death, with the chapter building up the sentences into a crescendo of destruction in vv.16\u201319.

Holiness includes banning Canaanite practices regarding the dead, distinguishing between pure and impure animals, avoiding carcasses as a major source of ritual pollution, and following the rules concerning tithes.

Added to this are considerations of troop morale (vv.8\u20139), offers of peaceful surrender terms (10\u201311), and the end results of siege as commonly portrayed in the ancient world (12\u201314). A different outcome is to be striven for in the case of the native Canaanites, who are to be wiped out, that Israel not be led astray into their \u201cabominable\u201d practices (16\u201318). The latter passage, especially since it is followed by an ecologically compassionate one about fruit trees, seems genocidal and hence morally unacceptable today.

It was formerly identified with, and translated as, leprosy, but that is now felt to be incorrect by virtually all scholars. The law recurs here, among examples of injustice, because the disease was often viewed as the result of a person\u2019s wrongful behaviors."], "Pledge II": ["Deuteronomy 24:10-13", "A parallel to Ex. 22:24\u201326, which, in contrast to other cases of comparison between the two legal collections, has the more emotional tone.

The \u201ccalling out\u201d to Y<small>HWH</small> recalls a similar cry of the oppressed in Ex. 22:22, 26.

In Ex. 22:23, God was to punish oppressors by making their \u201cwives widows, and [their] children orphans\u201d; Deuteronomy has toned this down by punishing the evildoer and not his or her children.

Fishbane (1988) for discussion."], "The Oppressed Again": ["Deuteronomy 24:17-22", "The three classic powerless groups in Israel and elsewhere have been mentioned before, but now receive help based on a particularly Israelite rationale: the people\u2019s historical experience of having been oppressed in Egypt.

Here the law provides for the widow of a man who dies without heirs to provide one, through the institution of \u201clevirate marriage\u201d\u2014whereby the man\u2019s brother marries her, and the subsequent offspring bears the deceased brother\u2019s name. This institution, applied to a more distant relative, vividly appears in the book of Ruth, which in fact contains a ceremony scene (4:1\u201311) of the kind set forth here."], "Improper Intervention in a Struggle": ["Deuteronomy 25:11-12", "In a law literally protecting maleness, a wife loses her hand over an act understood by a patriarchal society to be completely intolerable. Not even the close ties of a woman to the males of her family may overrule this (Frymer-Kensky 1992a). But also at issue may be the idea that the convenant is passed on biologically, and hence damaging the genitals damages the covenant (Greenstein, personal communication)."], "True Weights": ["Deuteronomy 25:13-16", "Not only violating \u201cpurity\u201d in diet and worship are adjudged \u201cabominations,\u201d but also the practice of falsifying weights and measures.

The attack on the rear was remembered bitterly in the Bible; cf. I Sam. 15 and the book of Esther, where the villain, Haman, is portrayed as a descendant of the Amalekite king Agag."], "The Declaration of the Farmer": ["Deuteronomy 26:1-15", "In a climactic set of ceremonies, those who work the land are to acknowledge God\u2019s ownership of the soil.

The descendants\u2019 rootedness in \u201ca land flowing with milk and honey\u201d (9) is made to contrast with the ancestors\u2019 wandering. This characterization of the land, and thanksgiving for its produce, is reiterated in the brief section about tithes (12\u201315). Thus the land is not taken for granted, and Israel celebrates, not the sexuality of the gods as the source of the soil\u2019s fertility, but rather the gift of a God who has intervened in human history.", "This chapter is a fitting end to the sequence of laws in Deuteronomy; emphasizing the gift of the land (as Buber 1982 points out, \u201cgive\u201d in various permutations occurs seven times) suggests that the gift may be revoked if the society does not uphold the covenant. Also notable is the sixfold use of the Hebrew root b-w-\u2019(<i>bo</i>\u2019), appearing here variously as \u201center,\u201d \u201cproduce,\u201d \u201cbring.\u201d"], "Summary": ["Deuteronomy 26:16-19", "The chapter, and the laws proper, end with the general observation that a two-way covenant has been made, as in Ex. 19:5\u20136. The result takes a high nationalistic turn in v.19, which once again seems to fit primarily an age of monarchy."], "The Covenant Ceremony": ["Deuteronomy 27:1-26", "As if to dramatize what has just concluded, the text at this point interpolates a ceremony that in location (Shechem) and theme anticipates what we find at the end of the book of Joshua (Chap. 24). It also encourages viewing Deuteronomy as a Northern document. Here the core is the series of curses uttered on Mount Eval in vv.15\u201326 (the blessings, curiously, do not appear). The curses, which do not introduce any new material as such, reflect the community\u2019s fear that someone will sin in secret and not be found out, and the entire community will suffer as a result (Bellefontaine). The public pronouncement of threats was not unusual at the sealing of an agreement in the ancient Near East. As in previous legal sections, we are presented with a mixture of areas\u2014criminal, sexual, and ritual\u2014ending with the general provision that the \u201cwords of this Instruction\u201d are to be carefully observed."], "The Consequences": ["Deuteronomy 28:1-69", "Following the dramatic ceremony of Chap. 27, which, as an event placed in the future, feels somewhat artificial, is the more conventional listing of blessings and curses, parallel to Lev. 26. The latter functionally ends the book of Leviticus (Chap. 27 is obviously a kind of appendix), and our chapter here ends the long legal portion of Deuteronomy. A further parallel is the summary verses in each; Lev. 26 ends with \u201cThese are the laws, the regulations and the instructions that Y<small>HWH</small> gave / between himself and the Children of Israel at Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moshe,\u201d while v.69 of our chapter is \u201cThese are the words of the covenant / that Y<small>HWH</small> commanded Moshe to cut with the Children of Israel / in the land of Moav, / aside from the covenant that he cut with them at Horev.\u201d", "As is typical of this kind of literature, the curses seem to outweigh the blessings, not only in verse count (55 to 14) but in color of description as well. While later generations of Jews, horrified by the warnings of disaster, stipulated that this chapter be read in an undertone when it is a weekly public synagogue reading, it is fairly standard stuff in the context of ancient Near Eastern treaties."]}, "Part IV; Concluding Exhortation": {"Renewed Exhortation": ["Deuteronomy 29:1-28", "Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4\u20136). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the \u201cassembly\u201d in front of him and those to come.", "Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah\u2019s discovery of the \u201cbook.\u201d Such may be the reason for the reference to \u201chidden\u201d and \u201crevealed\u201d things in v.28\u2014for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."], "Exile and Return": ["Deuteronomy 30:1-20", "A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe\u2019s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11\u201320). In this section the key root is \u201clife,\u201d occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe\u2019s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. <i>shuv</i> (\u201creturn / restore\u201d)."]}, "Part V; Final Matters": {"Preparing for the Future": ["Deuteronomy 31:1-30", "Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua\u2014or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe\u2019s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a \u201csong,\u201d a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a \u201cwitness\u201d against aberrant behavior.", "It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the \u201cInstruction\u201d and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."], "The Song of Moshe": ["Deuteronomy 32:1-43", "Especially in the ancient and medieval world, the death accounts of heroes tend to end with inspired visions. The inclusion of an ancient poem here is made to fit further into the context of Moshe\u2019s exhortations in Deuteronomy\u2014as a final warning to and witness against the people whom he has led. The \u201csong\u201d emphasizes the power and caring nature of God, which is contrasted with Israel\u2019s pathetic response of unfaithfulness. God is likened to a nurturing parent and a protecting eagle; when Israel responds with idolatry, he turns into a destroyer. Much of this poem reminds one of other biblical literature, such as Psalm 78\u2014also a reprise of Israel\u2019s history. That poem is recited as a proof of God\u2019s choosing the (southern) House of David; the political motivation behind Deut. 32, if there was one, is no longer clear to us.", "Skehan notes that the number of verses in the song, 69, equals the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet (23) times three. Similar or related schemes appear elsewhere in the Bible, often in the form of acrostics (cf. Lamentations).", "The song, which may predate Deuteronomy, may have been placed here as a traditional poem that meaningfully deals with catastrophe (Tigay). Despite the obscurity of some of its phrases, it stands as a witness to Israel\u2019s self-understanding, albeit a negative one."], "Some Final Words": ["Deuteronomy 32:44-52", "Moshe\u2019s last regular words to the people reiterate the theme of \u201clife\u201d noted earlier. On the other hand, God, at the end of Moshe\u2019s life, cannot refrain from reminding him (and us) of the reason that the great leader may not enter the Promised Land (v.51)."], "The Blessing of Moshe": ["Deuteronomy 33:1-29", "As if to balance Yaakov\u2019s deathbed blessing of his sons at the end (Chap. 49) of Genesis, Moshe doubles his poetic vision and blesses Israel, tribe by tribe. The weighting of tribes is very different here from what it was in Genesis: Levi is quite strong, Shim\u2019on has disappeared, and Yehuda, the tribe of David\u2019s royal lineage, has a reduced role. Some scholars are therefore inclined to see a background of Northern ascendancy behind this poem, perhaps the days of Jeroboam II (early eighth century <small>B.C.E.</small>).", "For a useful comparison of this chapter with other tribal blessings in the Bible, see Plaut; for discussion of textual problems, Tigay is clear and helpful."], "The End": ["Deuteronomy 34:1-12", "Genesis concluded with the death of Yosef; Joshua will end with the death of the victorious general. Moshe\u2019s passing provides the natural ending for the Torah; like that other great work of the first millennium <small>B.C.E.</small>, the <i>Iliad</i>, a funeral marks the end of the old generation and old circumstances. Israel, the narrated audience of the book of Deuteronomy, is now armed for what lies ahead, thanks to the leader\u2019s orations that have comprised an entire book. The rhetorical force of Deuteronomy thus caps the stories, poems, and laws of Genesis through Numbers, and makes of the five books truly a \u201cteaching\u201d or Instruction."]}}
