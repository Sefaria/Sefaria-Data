"Torah, Introduction, To Aid the Reader of Genesis and Exodus",1,"G<small>IVEN THE ILLUSTRIOUS PREDECESSORS THAT ANY TRANSLATOR OF</small> G<small>ENESIS AND</small> Exodus follows, I have not tried to provide here either a comprehensive commentary or an all-encompassing system of notes. Rather, I have sought to suggest some fruitful avenues for thought and discussion in the Commentary, and to provide such information in the Notes as will be helpful to the nonspecialist. Naturally, the selection of material for these purposes is entirely mine; others might single out different details and different aspects of the text."
"Torah, Introduction, To Aid the Reader of Genesis and Exodus",2,"Since I have espoused a “rhetorical” approach to biblical texts in my work, I have decided to limit myself largely to literary remarks in the Commentary: indicating themes and motifs as they appear and are developed in these books and elsewhere in the Bible; pointing out structural aspects of the text; and treating issues of character development in the narrative. I have by and large eschewed historical issues, and those pertaining to the origins and textual history of Genesis and Exodus. These matters, which are highly theoretical and subject to detailed and often heated scholarly discussion, are treated comprehensively in standard works such as Speiser (1964) for Genesis and Childs (1974) for Exodus (see also the volumes of the Jewish Publication Society’s <i>The Torah Commentary</i>, currently appearing). More detailed information on the ancient Near Eastern background and parallels to Genesis and Exodus can be found in Cassuto (1967, 1972/1974) and Sarna (1966, 1986). Readers whose interest is primarily archaeological will seek works such as Mazar (1990)."

"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",2,"T<small>HE TEXT OF</small> G<small>ENESIS SEEMS TO SPEAK WITH MANY VOICES</small>. F<small>OR A BOOK WHOSE BASIC</small> arrangement is chronological, tracing the history of a single family, it exhibits a good deal of discontinuity on the surface. Here time flows uniformly, there it takes startling jumps; fragments are followed by more or less full-blown tales; genres alternate, from mythic to genealogical to folkloristic. In addition, scholars often portray Genesis as a collection of historically diverse materials that were compiled by scribes for whom deviating from received tradition was anathema. Hence the repetitions, the inconsistencies, and the irregular pacing."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",3,"Is Genesis then, at best, a collection of stories related to the origins of Israel, with most of its seams still showing? Such an assessment does not do justice to what must have been a complex process of addition and growth or to the final product. An overview of the book does produce a certain scheme; at some point in the text’s history a coherent picture must have begun to emerge from the disparate materials handed down. For the modern reader, utilizing the Buber-Rosenzweig method of focusing on repeating words and key themes as the text presents them may make it possible to generalize about the organization of the book and also to speculate on its overall intent in the form in which it has come down to us."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",4,"On its most obvious level Genesis is a book about origins. It seeks to link the origin of the people of Israel with that of the world, relating in the process how various human characteristics and institutions arose."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",5,"On the surface this parallels much of ancient literature and folklore. All peoples are interested in their own beginnings, picturing them in a way which validates their present existence. Genesis, however, is different in that, like the rest of the Torah, it downplays the heroic element of the people’s origins and in its place stresses God’s role in them. Moreover the one great omission—the origin of God—establishes from the beginning a unique basis for a tribal chronicle. From Genesis and subsequent books we learn primarily about God’s relationship to the people and what he expects of them; almost everything else is subordinated to this purpose."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",6,Preliminarily one can speak of at least seven major themes whose recurrence establishes their importance in the book:
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",7,"1. <i>Origins:</i> Of the world, of humanity, and of the people of Israel.<br>2. <i>Order/Meaning in History:</i> By means of stylized or patterned chronology—reliance on certain round numbers such as 3, 7, and 40—it is suggested that human events are not random but somehow planned.<br>3. <i>Blessing:</i> From creation onward God bestows blessings on his creatures in general and on the fathers and mothers of Israel in particular.<br>4. <i>Covenant:</i> God concludes agreements with human beings.<br>5. <i>God Punishes Evildoing:</i> God is provoked to anger not by his capriciousness but by human failure to uphold justice and morality.<br>6. <i>Sibling Conflict, with the Younger Usually Emerging the Victor:</i> The order of nature (primacy of the firstborn) is overturned, demonstrating that God, not nature, is the ruling principle in human affairs.<br>7. <i>Testing:</i> God tests those who are to carry forth his mission; the result is the development of moral character."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",8,"Superseding these important themes, which occur throughout the Bible in various forms, is the dominant one of <i>continuity</i>, represented by the unifying word in Genesis <i>toledot</i> (“begettings”). The word appears eleven times, often accompanied by long genealogical lists. The names may deflect attention from what is central to Genesis. The major thrust of the book would seem to be toward human fecundity, following the early divine command to “bear fruit and be many” (1:28), and pointing toward the eventual fecundity of the people of Israel (which will only be realized in the book of Exodus). Such an emphasis seems appropriate in a book about origins."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",9,"Ironically, however, the undercurrent in Genesis points not to life and its continuation, but rather to its threatened extinction. In story after story the protagonist, his people, and occasionally the entire world are threatened. In at least one case (Avraham) a perfectly legal and natural solution is found—the birth of Yishmael as his heir—only to be rejected by God in favor of a more difficult one: a son born to an elderly woman."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",10,"It is clear that the stress on continuity and discontinuity has one purpose: to make clear that God is in control of history. Human fertility and continuity in history come not from magical rites or from the arbitrary decisions of the gods, but from a God who bases his rule on justice. Nature disappears as a ruling factor in human affairs, replaced by a principle of morality which is unshakable precisely because it comes from a God who is beyond the rules of nature."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",11,"But the result is a book which abounds in tension. From the beginnings of human history (Chap. 4) we encounter contradictions and opposites, whether on a small scale (fertility and barrenness) or a large one (promise and delayed fulfillment). Nowhere is this so clear as in the dramatic high point of the book, Chap. 22. As Avraham stands with knife upraised, the entire enterprise of Genesis hangs in the balance. But the entire book is replete with such tensions and continuity-threatening situations. There are barren wives, brothers vowing to kill brothers, cities and even a world being destroyed by an angry God. The main characters of Genesis thus emerge as survivors, above all else. Noah sets the pattern, but he is merely the first, and too passive an example. The Patriarchs must brave hostile foreigners, bitter intrafamily struggles, and long wanderings before they can find peace."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",12,"While by the end of the book many of the tensions have been resolved, one conspicuously has not: God’s promise of the land of Canaan. As the book ends, “in Egypt,” we are left to ponder how this God, who keeps his promises to “those who love him” (Ex. 20:6), will bring the people back to their land—a land inhabited by someone else and in which the Children of Israel own only a burial site. Yet despite the tension, we may assume from the experiences of the Patriarchs that God will indeed “take account of” the Israelites (50:24), that he will take whatever ill has been planned against them and “plan-it-over for good” (50:20)."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",13,"A word should also be said here about hero traditions. In the great epics of the ancient world the hero often stands as a lonely figure. He must overcome obstacles, fight monsters, acquire helpers (whether women, “sidekicks,” or magic objects); and his triumph in the end signals man’s triumph over his archenemy, Death. Every battle won, every obstacle hurdled, is psychologically a victory for us, the audience, a cathartic release from our own frustrating battle against death."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",14,"The Bible sees things rather differently. Death is also overcome, but not only by the individual’s struggle. It is rather through the covenant community, bound together by God’s laws and his promises, that the heroic vision is lived out. Despite the triumphs of the characters in Genesis, it is really in the book of Exodus that the great battle scenes (the plagues in Egypt, the Red Sea) and meetings with the divine (Mount Sinai) take place. And it is therefore God himself who is most properly the “hero” of these stories. No major character in Genesis achieves success without depending fully on God, and the standards that are held up to them are ultimately seen as God’s own, to be imitated by imperfect humankind."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",15,"The book of Genesis falls naturally into four large sections. The first, usually termed the “Primeval History” (Chaps, 11–11), begins with creation and progresses through the early generations of humanity, ending in Mesopotamia. The second (Chaps. 12 through 25:18) is the cycle of stories concerning Avraham, the father of the people of Israel. Part III (Gen. 25:19 through Chap. 36) deals in the main with stories about his grandson Yaakov. The final section (Chaps. 37–50) is the tale of Yosef and of how the Children of Israel came to live in Egypt (thus paving the way for the book of Exodus)."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",16,"The following skeletal outline will lay out some of the interesting structural features of the book. There is an elemental symmetry that emerges from the four sections; further comments, especially about how the sections cohere, will be found in the explanatory material accompanying the text in this volume."

"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",45,"There is of course great variety within this bare structure; each version of a motif has its own special characteristics and emphases. Yet the patterning observed above gives the book a general coherence, above and beyond differences. It also demonstrates a conscious hand at work, one concerned about the texture of the book as a whole and able, despite the possible rigidity of what had been handed down, to shape the received material into a plastic and breathing unity."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",46,"Two general observations about Genesis will round out the picture here. First, as the book progresses there is a tendency for the style of the literature to become smoother. The abrupt changes and sometimes fragmentary nature of the material in Part I, and the vignettes built around Avraham’s life in Part II, give way to a greater coherence and concentration in Part III, and finally to a relatively flowing and psychologically complete narrative in Part IV Along with this, the characters in the latter half of the book seem to be more changeable and human, in contrast to Noah and Avraham, who often appear almost perfect models of piety."
"On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure",47,"Second, contact with God becomes less and less direct as Genesis moves on. Avraham’s dreams and visions seem a far cry from Adam’s conversations with God in the garden (although see Chap. 18); Yaakov’s encounters with God are less frequent than Avraham’s; and finally, Yosef never has a conversation with God, although he receives dream interpretations from him. This process of distancing may reflect an often-observed tendency in religions to think of primeval times as a “golden age” of closeness between gods and men, as contrasted to today (whenever one is writing), when humankind finds itself tragically distant from the divine and in need of communication."
"Part I; The Primeval History",1,(1-2)
"Part I; The Primeval History",2,T<small>HE COLLECTION OF STORIES WHICH FORMS PART I OF</small> G<small>ENESIS HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED</small> for a number of purposes:
"Part I; The Primeval History",3,"1. History is traced from the creation of the world, in a direct line, down to Avraham, father of the People of Israel. Through use of the leading-word <i>toledot</i>, “begettings,” we are meant to view him as the logical end point in God’s preliminary plan in history."
"Part I; The Primeval History",4,"2. The nature of God, as he will appear throughout the Hebrew Bible, is firmly established. He is seen as a Creator who is beyond fate, nature, and sexuality; as an all-powerful orderer and giver of meaning to history; as a bestower of blessing to living creatures; as a giver of choice to human beings; as a just punisher of evil and, simultaneously, a merciful ruler; and as a maker of covenants. The one quality of God which does not unfold until the Patriarchal stories (Parts II-IV) is his shaping of human destiny through focusing on the People of Israel. It is portrayed as the logical outcome of the characteristics just mentioned."
"Part I; The Primeval History",5,"3. It appears that the Mesopotamian origins of Israel are reflected in such narratives as the Creation, the Flood, and the Tower of Babel, and are transformed or repudiated in the biblical versions. What in the older culture appears arbitrary and chaotic has been changed in the Bible into stories that stress morality and order. Further, human beings in Genesis Chapters 1–11, despite their failure to five up to God’s expectations, are nevertheless considered capable of doing so, in contrast to the Mesopotamian view that humankind was created merely to be slaves to the gods."
"Part I; The Primeval History",6,"4. Like virtually all other creation stories, Part I is concerned with the origin of the world and its institutions. Chapter 1 expounds on the origins of earth, sky, vegetation, animals, and human beings (as well as the Sabbath); Chapter 2, of sexuality, death, pain in childbirth, and work; Chapter 4, of sin, hatred, and murder, as well as of cities and crafts; Chapter 6, of giants; and Chapter 10, of nations (including the low status of the Canaanites) and languages."
"Part I; The Primeval History",7,"In sum, Part I serves as a fitting Prologue, not only to Genesis but to the entire Bible. The reader’s chief task in interpreting it is to be able to determine the reason for the inclusion of any one section into the whole."
"The Patriarchal Narratives",1,(12-50)
"The Patriarchal Narratives",2,"T<small>HE STORIES ABOUT THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF</small> I<small>SRAEL, AS A COLLECTION, ARE</small> almost contrapuntal in their richness. Life experiences are repeated and common themes recur; yet at the same time there is a remarkable variety of personalities."
"The Patriarchal Narratives",3,"Two prominent themes throughout are God’s promises (of land and descendants) and his blessing. The texts revolve around the question of whether and how God will fulfill his promises, and how people will effect the transfer of the blessing. Each generation portrayed in the narratives must deal with the inherent tensions raised by these questions, since their resolution does not occur easily."
"The Patriarchal Narratives",4,"The stories are also marked by each figure’s struggle to develop a concept of the religious life, of “walking in accord with God.” Each one carves out his own distinct path, to arrive at a mature understanding of what it means to be a father of the people of Israel. In order to bring about such an understanding, God apparently “tests” them in both obvious and more oblique ways, often against a backdrop of bitter sibling rivalry. One also observes a physical unsettledness about the Patriarchs’ quest; only Yitzhak is spared the wanderings that occur so regularly in the stories."
"The Patriarchal Narratives",5,"Rather interestingly, although the texts purport to be about “fathers,” it is God himself who most consistently fits that role for the characters. God acts <i>in loco parentis</i> for each of the Patriarchs, always, significantly, after the loss of the human father. He first appears to Avraham after the death of Terah; to Yitzhak after that of Avraham; to Yaakov after he leaves home (and a seemingly dying father); and he helps Yosef directly, after he has left his father’s home."
"The Patriarchal Narratives",6,"Numbers play an important role in the Patriarchal stories, as they did in Part I. It has been pointed out (see Sarna 1966) that the life spans of the Patriarchs fit into a highly ordered pattern. Avraham lives for 175 years, equaling 7 × 5<sup>2</sup>; Yitzhak, for 180 years, equaling 5 × 6<sup>2</sup>; and Yaakov, for 147 years, or 3 × 7<sup>2</sup>. This is unmistakably a purposeful scheme, meant to convey that human history is orderly and meaningful. Similarly an examination of the stories reveals that Avraham lives for 75 years in the lifetime of his father and 75 years in the lifetime of his son, while Yaakov spends 20 years away from his father, with Yosef roughly following suit in the next generation."
"The Patriarchal Narratives",7,"Last, it should be noted that the Patriarchal stories in various details anticipate the later Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. The specific references will be mentioned in the Notes."
"Part II; Avraham",1,(12–25:18)
"Part II; Avraham",2,"A<small>LTHOUGH</small> A<small>VRAHAM IS THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER OF</small> I<small>SRAEL, THE DIVERSE TRADITIONS</small> about him which have been collected and connected to form a cycle of stories give evidence of much more. The cycle portrays an active <i>Homo religiosis</i> who converses with God, sometimes with an air of doubt and questioning, who proclaims God’s name at various sacred sites, who is concerned about justice and the treatment of the oppressed, and who makes dramatic life decisions without flinching. The stories thus reveal struggle, despite the fact that Avraham often appears to be the “perfect” man, always obeying God’s bidding and prospering."
"Part II; Avraham",3,"Buber (1982), noting the unifying effect of the verb “see” throughout the cycle, understood Avraham as the father of the Prophets of Israel (formerly called “seers”). He also viewed the cycle as based around the series of tests that Avraham must undergo, tests quite different, we might add, from the labors of Hercules and other such ancient challenges."
"Part II; Avraham",4,"Other than “see,” a number of leading-words launch the major concerns of the Patriarchs: “bless,” “seed,” and “land.” At the same time the cycle contains previously encountered motifs, albeit with interesting refinements: punishment for sin (this time, with human questioning), intimacy with God (here through visions), and sibling rivalry (with more complex results than murder). Above all we note the singling out of one man to perform the will of God, a man very different from the rather passive Noah."
"Part II; Avraham",5,"Avraham stands at the core of the entire book of Genesis, as his experiences will in many ways be reflected in those who follow him. At the core of both the book and the cycle looms the disturbing Chapter 22, which brings together and resolves, for the moment, the major themes encountered so far."
"Part III; Yaakov",1,(25:19–36:43)
"Part III; Yaakov",2,"B<small>EFORE COMMENTING ON THE</small> Y<small>AAKOV CYCLE, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO CONSIDER WHY HIS</small> father Yitzhak, the second of the Patriarchs, receives no true separate group of stories on his own."
"Part III; Yaakov",3,"Yitzhak functions in Genesis as a classic second generation—that is, as a transmitter and stabilizing force, rather than as an active participant in the process of building the people. There hardly exists a story about him in which he is anything but a son and heir, a husband, or a father. His main task in life seems to be to take roots in the land of Canaan, an admittedly important task in the larger context of God’s promises in Genesis. What this means, unfortunately, is that he has almost no personality of his own. By Chapter 27, a scant two chapters after his father dies, he appears as (prematurely?) old, blind in both a literal and figurative sense, and as we will see, he fades out of the text entirely, only to die several chapters, and many years, later."
"Part III; Yaakov",4,"The true dynamic figure of the second generation here is Rivka. It is she to whom God reveals his plan, and she who puts into motion the mechanism for seeing that it is properly carried out. She is ultimately the one responsible for bridging the gap between the dream, as typified by Avraham, and the hard-won reality, as realized by Yaakov."
"Part III; Yaakov",5,"Avraham is a towering figure, almost unapproachable as a model in his intimacy with God and his ability to hurdle nearly every obstacle. Adding to this the fact that Yitzhak is practically a noncharacter, and that Yosef, once his rise begins, also lacks dimension as a personality, it becomes increasingly clear that it is Yaakov who emerges as the most dynamic and most human personality in the book. The stories about him cover fully half of Genesis, and reveal a man who is both troubled and triumphant. Most interestingly, he, and not Avraham, gives his name to the people of Israel."
"Part III; Yaakov",6,"Distinctive themes of the cycle include physical struggle, deception, and confrontation. These are expressed through the key words of Yaakov’s name (“Heel-Holder” and “Heel-Sneak,” then Yisrael, “God-Fighter”), “deceive” and similar words, and “face.” Also recurring are the terms “love,” “bless,” “firstborn-right,” and “wages/hire” (one word in Hebrew). The cycle is structured partly around etiologies (folk explanations of place-names and personal names) and also around Yaakov’s use of stones in several of the stories."
"Part III; Yaakov",7,"Continuing from the Avraham cycle are such earlier themes as wandering, sibling rivalry, the barren wife, wives in conflict, the renaming of the protagonist, God perceived in dreams and visions; and particular geographical locations such as Bet-El, Shekhem, and the Negev (Cassuto 1974)."
"Part III; Yaakov",8,"Finally, it should be mentioned that the Yaakov stories are notable in the manner in which they portray the two levels of biblical reality: divine and human. Throughout the stories human beings act according to normal (though often strong) emotions, which God then uses to carry out his master plan. In this cycle one comes to feel the interpretive force of the biblical mind at work, understanding human events in the context of what God wills. It is a fascinating play between the ideas of fate and free will, destiny and choice—a paradox which nevertheless lies at the heart of the biblical conception of God and humankind."
"Part III; Yaakov",9,"<img src=""images/Art_P2.jpg"" alt=""art""/>"
"Part III; Yaakov",10,"<b><i>Gen. 28:12</i> And he dreamt:/Here, a ladder was set up on the earth,/its top reaching the heavens …</b>"
"Part IV; Yosef",1,(37–50)
"Part IV; Yosef",2,"T<small>HE STORIES ABOUT THE LAST</small> P<small>ATRIARCH FORM A COHERENT WHOLE, LEADING SOME</small> to dub it a “novella.” It stands well on its own, although it has been consciously and artfully woven together into both the Yaakov cycle and the entire book."
"Part IV; Yosef",3,"Initially the tale is one of family emotions, and it is in fact extreme emotions which give it a distinctive flavor. All the major characters are painfully expressive of their feelings, from the doting father to the spoiled son, from the malicious brothers to the lustful wife of Potifar, from the nostalgic adult Yosef to the grief-stricken old Yaakov. It is only through the subconscious medium of dreams, in three sets, that we are made to realize that a higher plan is at work which will supersede the destructive force of these emotions."
"Part IV; Yosef",4,"For this is a story of how “ill”—with all its connotations of fate, evil, and disaster—is changed to good. Despite the constant threat of death to Yosef, to the Egyptians, and to Binyamin, the hidden, optimistic thrust of the story is “life,” a word that appears in various guises throughout. Even “face,” the key word of the Yaakov cycle which often meant something negative, is here given a kinder meaning, as the resolution to Yaakov’s life."
"Part IV; Yosef",5,"A major subtheme of the plot is the struggle for power between Re’uven and Yehuda. Its resolution has implications that are as much tribal as personal, for the tribe of Yehuda later became the historical force in ancient Israel as the seat of the monarchy."
"Part IV; Yosef",6,"Although many details of the narrative confirm Egyptian practices, those practices actually reflect an Egypt considerably later than the period of the Patriarchs (Redford). Of interest also is the prominence of the number five in the story, a detail that is unexplained but that gives some unity to the various sections of text."
"Part IV; Yosef",7,"In many ways the Yosef material repeats elements in the Yaakov traditions. A long list could be compiled, but let us at least mention here sibling hatred, exile of the hero, foreign names, love and hate, dreams, and deception—even so detailed as to duplicate the use of a goat-kid. But its focusing on a classic rags-to-riches plot, with the addition of a moralistic theme, make the Yosef story a distinctive and always popular tale, accessible in a way that the more difficult stories of the first three parts of Genesis are not."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",1,(1-40)
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",2,"T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> E<small>XODUS IS</small> I<small>SRAEL’S SECOND BOOK OF ORIGINS</small>. G<small>ENESIS HAD CONCERNED</small> itself with the beginnings of the world, of human beings and their institutions, and of the people of Israel as a tribal family. Exodus continues this thrust as it recounts the origin of the people on a religious and political level (here inseparable as concepts). A number of biblical ideas receive their fullest early treatment in this book: God’s acting directly in history; making himself “known” to both Israelites and foreigners; covenant as a reciprocal agreement between God and humans; law as an expression of total worldview; and the use of sacred structure (Tabernacle or “Dwelling”) as a vehicle for and expression of perceived truths about the world. In addition, several biblical institutions make their first appearance in Exodus: Passover, Sabbath, rudimentary leadership/government, and cult/priesthood. All this is presented in a general narrative framework, raising the question as to whether what we have here is story or history. Is Exodus a fanciful reconstruction of what happened to Moshe (Moses) and his generation, riddled with anachronisms? Or is it a faithful and reliable handing-down of eyewitness data which only the cynical or irreligious would doubt?"
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",3,"For the first position there are several supports. We possess virtually no extra-biblical references to the events recorded in our book, either in Egypt or elsewhere. Then, too, there seem to be inconsistencies of time within the story (Chaps. 16 and 18 appear to presuppose laws which were given later), and patterns within the telling of the tale that are too symmetrical (the Plagues) or too stereotyped (the constant use of stylized language) to be simple reporting of fact. Finally, Exodus is lacking in the citation of personal and geographical names, especially as compared to the books that precede and follow (Genesis and Numbers)."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",4,"For the second position, that of Exodus as a reliable historical record, there exist no methods of proof other than evaluation of literary form—that is, accepting that oral literature is able to preserve facts without later coloration. But even if it could be shown that Exodus is oral literature—an evaluation which is too sweeping, given the present form of the book—modern scholarship has come to cast doubt on the absolute historical reliability of oral tradition (see Vansina)."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",5,"Despite these observations, there is still something unsettling about writing Exodus off as a work of fiction, however pious that fiction may have been. For the rest of the Hebrew Bible abounds in emotional references to the experience of the exodus. At every stage of biblical literature, that experience is invoked for the purpose of directing behavior (see especially Judg. 2, I Sam. 8, II Sam. 7, II Kings 17, Neh. 9, and Ps. 78; and most of Deuteronomy is rhetorically grounded in it). The entire structure and emotional force of biblical law rest upon such exhortations as “A sojourner you are not to oppress:/you yourselves know (well) the feelings of the sojourner,/for sojourners were you in the land of Egypt” (Ex. 23:9) and such situations as that of the Hebrew serf (Ex. 21:2ff.). Apparently the experience of the exodus period was crucial in forming the group consciousness of the Israelites, and ever since it has provided a model from which both later Judaism and Christianity were to draw frequently and profoundly."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",6,"A hypothetical analogy, based on American history, may help to shed light on the historicity of Exodus. Imagine a book based on the following outline: first, a section on the American Revolution, with some biographical material on a few of the Founding Fathers, focusing mostly on the outbreak of the war and key battles; second, a description of the Constitutional Convention, including some of the more important speeches and discussions; third, the text of the Constitution itself; and finally, L’Enfant’s original blueprints for the building of the new capital, Washington, D.C., interspersed with accounts of the first few presidents’ inaugural addresses. What would be the underlying message of such a book? We are certainly dealing here with more than a straight journalistic description of the events, more than a legalistic discussion of constitutional law, and more than a technical presentation for architects. Such a book would actually be presenting the ideals of America’s self-image: a nation founded on the willingness to fight for particular rights against Old World tyranny, established under democratic laws based on reason and providing governmental checks and balances, and whose ideals would be embodied in the construction of a brand-new, centrally located capital city that used classically grounded forms of architecture to express grace and reason as the basis for the new society."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",7,"Now this portrayal is very simplistic, but it gets its point across (and I would be willing to wager that, somewhere in this country, there exists a school textbook written along these lines). In a similar manner, although with much more weight given to God’s role in the process, the book of Exodus unfolds. The dramatic story of Israel’s deliverance from bondage, coupled with Moshe’s own early development, is only the first part of the book, and accounts for less than half of it. It is followed by several stories of desert wanderings, and then by a presentation of the covenant made between God and Israel at Sinai, against a stunning natural backdrop. The second half of the book enumerates a series of laws which constitute the covenant, and the details of construction of a portable sanctuary designed both to symbolize and actually to accommodate God’s presence among the Israelites (with the interruption of a major rebellion). So, like our theoretical American model, Exodus conveys far more than information about events. It is, rather, the narration of a worldview, a laying out of different types of texts bearing the <i>meaning</i> of Israel’s historical experience."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",8,"I stress the word “experience” because that is what is at stake here. Human memory is always selective. We remember what we wish to remember, giving weight to particular emotions, sometimes over and above the facts (or, as the poet Maya Angelou puts it autobiographically, “The facts sometimes obscure the truth”). The same thing appears to be true of group memory. What a people remembers of substance is not nearly as important as how they process their experience."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",9,"In our Exodus text one can perceive a characteristically Israelite process at work. The book emerges as a mix of historical recollection, mythical processing, and didactic retelling, what Buber and others have called a “saga.” What is preserved in the book of Exodus, therefore, is a Teaching (Heb. <i>Tora</i>) based on a set of experiences, which became history for ancient Israel. Hence, to understand better the workings of the book, we need to turn to its themes and its structure. This will be more fruitful than trying to find the exact location of the Sea of Reeds or Mount Sinai, or the “Lost Ark,” or Moshe’s burial site— of whose location “no man has knowledge until this day” (Deut. 34:6). These have all receded into archeological oblivion. What has survived of ancient Israel is its approach to history and to life, and its literature. In that sense, the book of Exodus is an attempt to distill history and to learn from it, using echoes from the past to shape the present and the future."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",10,"When we turn to a closer consideration of the structure of Exodus, we must proceed on the assumption that a work of art stems from both artful and unconscious design. Therefore, any structuring of such a book can only be hypothetical and must not limit itself to ironclad categories."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",11,"With that said, a number of potential divisions of our book present themselves. The first emerges from a close look at the subject matter of the text. Strikingly, Exodus appears to be arranged in groups of a few chapters each (bearing in mind that the chapter divisions are historically late), resulting in the following scheme:"
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",12,"1. Prologue in Egypt (Chap. 1)<br>2. Moshe’s Early Life and Call (Chaps. 2–4)<br>3. Moshe’s Mission in Egypt (5:1–7:13)<br>4. The First Nine Plagues (7:14–10:29)<br>5. The Tenth Plague and the Exodus (Chaps. 11–13)<br>6. In the Wilderness I: The Deliverance at the Sea (14:1–15:21)<br>7. In the Wilderness II: Early Experiences (15:22–18:27)<br>8. Covenant at Sinai (Chaps. 19–20)<br>9. The Terms (Laws) and Conclusion of the Covenant (Chaps. 21–24)<br>10. Details of the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25–27)<br>11. Details of the Cult (Chaps. 28–31)<br>12. Rebellion and Reconciliation (Chaps. 32–34)<br>13. The Building of the Tabernacle, Priestly Vestments (Chaps. 35–39)<br>14. Conclusion (Chap. 40)"
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",13,Such a measured shifting of focus helps to maintain the flow of the text and our interest in it.
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",14,"A glance through this list will also lead to the positing of larger structures. The traditions collected in Exodus fall naturally into both geographical and thematic divisions. The first part of the book takes place in Egypt (1:1–15:21), the second in the wilderness (15:22–40:38); this could alternatively be viewed as the events preceding Mount Sinai (Chaps. 1–17/18) and those that take place there (Chaps. 18/19–40). One could also combine the geographical and thematic aspects, resulting in the structure (1) Israel in Egypt (1:1–15:21), (2) Israel in the Wilderness (15:22–24:18), and (3) Tabernacle and Calf (Chaps. 25–40)."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",15,"My own preference for structuring Exodus also combines these aspects, as follows:"
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",16,I. The Deliverance Narrative (1:1–15:21)
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",17,II. In the Wilderness (15:22–18:27)
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",18,III. Covenant and Law (Chaps. 19–24)
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",19,IV. The Blueprints for the Tabernacle and Its Service (Chaps. 25–31)
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",20,V. Infidelity and Reconciliation (Chaps. 32–34)
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",21,VI. The Building of the Tabernacle (Chaps. 35–40)
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",22,"These divisions exhibit a great deal of overlapping. In Part I, Israel’s life in Egypt (Chap. 1) paves the way for Moshe’s early years (Chaps. 2–4), then the account of his mission before Pharaoh and the Plagues (Chaps. 5–13), and the final victory (Chaps. 14–15); Part II is anticipated by some of what happens after the exodus itself (Chap. 14), and leads to Sinai (Chap. 19); the covenant and laws of Part III naturally lead to other prescriptions, this time the building instructions for the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25–31); planning the sacred structure in Part IV is followed by the making of a forbidden construction, the Golden Calf (Chaps. 32–33); and the reconciliation between God and Israel (Chap. 34) restores Israel’s capacity to return to the actual building of the Tabernacle, and to complete it (Chaps. 35–40). So despite the presence of what must have been several very diverse traditions behind the final text of Exodus, it has been skillfully woven together to form a coherent whole. In addition to the above structures, it can be said that the book of Exodus rests on several textual backbones, inner structures and recurring themes and motifs that help to create a unified work. These may be listed by category:"
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",23,"1. There are various climaxes which serve to highlight the action—the Encounter at the Bush (Chaps. 3–4), the Tenth Plague and Exodus (12:29–42), the Deliverance at the Sea (14–15:21), the Revelation at Sinai (Chaps. 19–20), the Calf Episode (Chap. 32), and Completion of the Tabernacle (Chap. 40). Anchoring these dramatic scenes, at the center of the book, is the Sinai Revelation. The Binding of Yitzhak (Isaac) in Chapter 22 of Genesis serves much the same focusing function."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",24,"2. There exist three strategically placed accounts of God’s Presence accompanying the Israelites (13:21–22, 24:15–18, 40:34–38) which share a common vocabulary. Key words in these passages are “day/night,” “cloud,” “fire,” “dwell,” “Glory,” “cover,” “go up,” and “in the eyes of the Children of Israel/before the people” (it should be noted that not every passage uses all of these terms). These words chart God’s movement: first, following the Exodus; second, following the concluding of the covenant; and third, following the erection of the Tabernacle, at the end of the book. A variation of these Presence accounts occurs in Numbers 9:15–23, where it rounds out the picture—for it is at this point that the Israelites finally depart from Sinai (having spent about a year there), on their journey toward the Promised Land."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",25,3. Several leading words recur throughout the book and give it a sense of unity:
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",26,"<i>serve</i>— The Israelites pass from “servitude” to Pharaoh into the “service” of God; laws are given that warn against “serving” other gods, that specify how a “serf” is to be treated, and that detail the “service” (i.e., construction and dismantling) of a sanctuary where God is to be properly “served.”"
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",27,"<i>Glory</i>—Liberated from Pharaoh’s “stubbornness” (Heb. <i>koved lev</i>), the Israelites experience God’s “Glory” (Heb. <i>kavod</i>) at the Sea of Reeds, and encounter it again at Sinai (Chap. 24) and when the Tabernacle is completed (Chap. 40). When Israel falters in Chapter 32, Moses begs to see God’s “Glory” as a sign of reassurance. This is one of the central issues of the book, receiving its clearest formulation in Chap. 17:7—“Is Y<small>HWH</small> in our midst, or not?” Without the accompanying Presence, the Israelites can survive neither in Egypt nor in the wilderness. That the book ends with the “Glory” taking up residence in the Tabernacle is a sign that all is well in this regard."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",28,<i>know</i>—The Plagues and the liberation take place so that Egyptian and Israelite alike will acknowledge God as the true ruler (who “knows” the slaves’ sufferings). The book as a whole portrays a God who is “known” by his compassion toward the oppressed.
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",29,<i>see</i>—God “sees” and rescues the people early in the book (Chap. 3); they “see” his deliverance at the sea (Chap. 14) and the awesome display at Sinai (Chaps. 19-20); the Tabernacle blueprint is given to Moshe to “see” (Chaps 25ff.).
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",30,"4. Aside from theme words, there are also several thematic threads that run through the book. These may be listed as well:"
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",31,"<i>distinction</i>—The Israelites learn what it is to be separated out, first for oppression and later for God’s service. This process occurs during the Plagues and throughout the legal sections, which are often based on the making of distinctions (the Hebrew word for “holy,” <i>kadosh,</i> may originally have had this connotation). In general, Exodus is a book that abounds in polarities and distinctions: between God and Pharaoh, life and death, slavery and freedom, Egyptianness and Israeliteness, city and wilderness, visible gods/magic and an invisible God who is not conjurable, doubt and trust."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",32,"<i>construction</i>—The Israelites are enslaved as builders of Egyptian cities; they go on to build a society, a calf-god, and a Tabernacle."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",33,"<i>rebellion</i>—From the beginning, God and Moshe are often unheeded, as the Israelites seek to maintain or return to their status as dependent slaves in Egypt (Chaps. 2, 5, 14, 15–17, 32)."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",34,"<i>Sabbath</i>—As a newly freed people, Israel is to adapt to a rhythm of work and sacred cessation, which celebrates both creation and freedom. The Sabbath is at issue immediately after liberation (Chap. 16) and is commanded three times (Chaps. 20, 31, 35); and the account of the Tabernacle’s completion echoes the vocabulary of God’s completed creation in Genesis 2, a passage which serves as one justification for observing the Sabbath (see Ex. 20:11)."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",35,"<i>origins</i>—We are told of the beginnings of the new covenant (distinct from that concluded with Abraham), the law system, the cult/priesthood, and the sacred calendar, but with the significant omission of the monarchy."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",36,"<i>covenant</i>—God establishes a relationship with the people of Israel: if they will obey him and observe his laws, he will protect them and treat them as his “firstborn son.” This form of covenant is different from the ones in Genesis, and plays a significant role in subsequent books of the Bible."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",37,"<i>God in History</i>—The God of Exodus actively intervenes to rescue a people, defeating their oppressors in battle; he leads them through the wilderness, meets them, and makes a covenant with them."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",38,"5. The above themes are specifically Israelite themes. There are, however, motifs in Exodus that have a more universal ring. One could term these anthropological, since they employ standard aspects of human experience to convey the overall messages of the book."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",39,"<i>Fire</i> is used frequently and in varied contexts (at the Burning Bush and later back at Mount Sinai, in the desert trek, in the Tabernacle service, and at the Calf incident), usually to make a statement about God. In contrast to conventional fire gods (e.g., the Norse trickster Loki), the God of Exodus is most often associated with the more positive aspects of fire: constancy, purity, and transformation. The fire at Sinai does not destroy Moshe and the people, but rather turns them into something new. At the same time it should not be forgotten that fire is used regularly to connote anger in the Bible, especially God’s, and especially in the later wilderness narratives."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",40,"<i>Water</i> appears throughout Exodus, not as a backdrop but as an active medium which most often signifies life and death simultaneously. The Nile, into which the enslaved Hebrews’ babies are thrown, gently bears the infant Moshe to safety: the Nile, the giver of life in Egypt, is changed into blood, itself a major signifier of life in the Bible but useless here because it is undrinkable; the Sea of Reeds acts as a passageway of birth for the Israelites but as a graveyard for their Egyptian pursuers. The availability of water becomes a central issue in the wilderness, as an instrument for survival and for the testing of the Israelites’ faith. Finally, water creates the ritual purity necessary for the people at Sinai and their priests in the Tabernacle to approach God."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",41,"<i>Desert/Wilderness</i> is the scene of the crucial second part of the book. Only in the desert, away from the massive influence of age-old Egyptian culture, can the new Israelite society be forged. Moshe, like many other real-life and fictional heroes, demonstrates this in his own early life. The desert acts as a purifying agent for him, changing the Egyptian prince into a member of his own true people. Similarly, the Israelites begin the process of transformation from bondage to self-rule, a process which is taught in the harsh reality of desert life and which will take an entire generation to complete."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",42,"In point of fact, all these media—fire, water, and desert—suggest change as a major concern of the book of Exodus. Our text chronicles the start of Israel’s journey as a nation, a transformative journey which takes vastly changed circumstances, a whole generation in time, and indeed several books of recounting to complete. Exodus is very concerned with topography—not for the purposes of historical recollection (as Genesis was, apparently) but as an account of an inner journey. Thus the people travel to the boundary between Egypt and the desert, through the sea, to the great fiery mountain; and we know that they cannot but be on their way to a final goal. That goal, the Promised Land, will not be realized in Exodus, because in this book we stand only at the beginning of the journey. Change does not occur quickly, and the true molding of a people, like that of an individual, requires formative experiences over time. In Exodus, then, the People of Israel begins in adolescence, as it were. It has survived infancy in Genesis, a period marked by constant threats of physical extinction, and must now begin the tortuous process of learning to cope with adulthood—that is to say, people-hood—in a hostile world."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",43,"That process will take us past the present text. Exodus stands at the beginning of a trilogy in the middle of the Torah. It takes us from slavery up to Sinai, inaugurating the law-giving process. Leviticus will concentrate almost exclusively on laws (of “holiness”), never budging geographically, while Numbers will see the conclusion of the Sinai experience and the traveling toward (and actually reaching) the land of Israel. Exodus is thus of great importance in the overall five-book pattern, introducing key elements of the wilderness books: law, institutions, rebellion, and—Moshe himself. It serves as a bridge between the great narratives of Genesis and the priestly code of Leviticus and the wanderings of Numbers (Green­berg 1972 notes how the opening of Exodus points back, to Gen. 46; and the closing points forward, to Num. 9). It in fact contains elements of all three books."
"On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure",44,"Exodus is the basis not only of what follows in the Torah, but also sets the stage for the rest of the Hebrew Bible. What Israel understood of its God, and what that God expects of them, are set forth most directly and unforgettably in the memories enshrined in the book of Exodus."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",1,(1:1–15:21)
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",2,"T<small>HE FIRST PART OF THE BOOK OF</small> E<small>XODUS IS PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF THE</small> Genesis narratives, by abbreviating the genealogy of the immigrant Yaakov from Gen. 46:8–25. We find here the same centrality of God, the same kind of sparse but powerful biographical sketch of the human hero, and a narrative style similar to that of the previous book."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",3,"And yet Exodus introduces a new and decisive element into the Hebrew Bible, which becomes paradigmatic for future generations of biblical writers. The book speaks of a God who acts directly in history, blow by blow—a God who promises, liberates, guides, and gives laws to a people. This is, to be sure, an outgrowth of a God who brings the Flood and disperses the Babel generation, but it is also a decisive step forward from a God who works his will in the background, through intrafamily conflicts (which comprise most of Genesis). This deity frees his people, not by subterfuge, but by directly taking on Egypt and its gods. Pharaoh and the Nile, both of which were considered divine in Egypt, are in the end forced to yield to superior power. Surely it is no accident that the ending of Part I—the Song of Moshe at the Sea—hails Y<small>HWH</small> as Israel’s true king, a king whose acts of “leading,” “redeeming,” and “planting” his people are exultingly affirmed in the body of the Song."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",4,"Part I receives its structural coherence in a number of ways. For one, it encompasses a straight chronological narrative, moving from Israel’s enslavement to its liberation and triumph over its oppressors. The ending, Chapter 15, is rhetorically and stylistically fitting (see Gaster 1969), celebrating as it does the mighty deeds of God. For another, Part I carefully paces its climaxes, building up from the Burning Bush to various stages of Plagues, to the Tenth Plague/exodus and finally the great scene at the sea. There are also a number of key words that help to tie together various sections of the narratives: “know,” “serve,” and “see.” All of these go through interesting changes in meaning, through which one can trace the movement of central ideas (see the Commentary)."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",5,"In the area of vocabulary, David Daube (1963) has made the interesting observation that the Deliverance Narrative uses a number of verbs that occur regularly in biblical law regarding the formal release of a slave: “send free” (Heb. <i>shale’ah’</i>), “drive out” (<i>garesh</i>), and “go out” (<i>yatzo</i>’). In addition, the motif of the Israelites’ “stripping” the Egyptians (3:22, 12:36) links up with the regulation of release in Deut. 15:13. “… you are not to send him free empty-handed.” Daube sees our text as bearing the stamp of Israelite social custom: Pharaoh is made to flout “established social regulations.”"
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",6,"Finally, several scholars (Kikawada, Ackerman 1974, Fishbane 1979, and Isbell) have pointed out that the vocabulary of the first few chapters of the book foreshadows the whole of Part I. This use of sound and idea helps to create unity in these narratives (despite their possibly diverse origins), and is also of importance in viewing the biographical material in the first four chapters."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",7,<b>T<small>HE</small> E<small>ARLY</small> L<small>IFE OF</small> M<small>OSHE AND</small> R<small>ELIGIOUS</small> B<small>IOGRAPHY</small></b>
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",8,"Dominating the early chapters of Exodus, more than the description of bondage itself, is the figure of the reluctant liberator, Moshe. The portrayal of his beginnings contrasts strongly with the classic hero stories of the ancient world."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",9,"This is not immediately apparent. Moshe’s birth narrative parallels that of King Sargon of Akkad; his flight from Egypt and return as leader are reminiscent of Jephthah and David in the Bible, and of the Syrian king Idrimi (as recounted in Akkadian texts) as well. In addition, half a century ago Lord Raglan attempted to demonstrate common elements in hero biographies by compiling a list of up to thirty key motifs. Those relevant to Moshe include: the father a relative of the mother, an attempt made to kill him at birth, his escape through the action of others, being raised by foster parents, little information about his childhood, his traveling to his “future kingdom” upon reaching adulthood, promulgating laws, losing favor with the deity, dying on the top of a hill, not being succeeded by his children, and a hazy death/burial. Moshe therefore shares with Oedipus, Hercules, Siegfried, and Robin Hood, among others, a host of common elements; his point total according to Raglan’s scheme puts him toward the top of the list as an archetypal traditional hero. It must be concluded that, far from being a factual account, his biography is composed largely of literary constructs."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",10,"When one looks closer at the biblical portrayal of Moshe, however, the purpose and particularly Israelite thrust of these constructs becomes clear. Almost every key element in Moshe’s early life—e.g., rescue from death by royal decree, rescue from death by water, flight into the desert, meeting with God on the sacred mountain—foreshadows Israel’s experience in the book of Exodus. The key theme of the distinction between Israel and Egypt, so central to the Plague Narrative and to Israelite religion as a whole, is brought out beautifully in the depiction of Moshe’s development from Egyptian prince to would-be liberator to shepherd in the wilderness, the latter an ancestral calling (cf. Nohrnberg, who also discusses Yosef as developing in exactly the opposite direction—from Israelite shepherd boy to Egyptian viceroy, complete with Egyptian appearance, wife, and name). What is important in these early chapters of Exodus, then, is not the customary focus on the young hero’s deeds (e.g., Hercules strangling serpents in the cradle) or his fatal flaw (although there is a hint of this too!), but on what he shares with his people, or, more precisely, how he prefigures them."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",11,"Another aspect of these stories removes them from the usual realm of heroic biography. Elsewhere in the Bible, individual hero types are at least partially overshadowed by the true central “character”: God. This appears to be true in Exodus as well. Moshe develops only so far; he recedes as a full-blown personality during the Plague Narrative, to emerge sporadically in later encounters with the people (e.g., Chaps. 16 and 32–33; the portrait expands in the narratives of the book of Numbers). No wonder that later Jewish legend (and further, Christian and Muslim stories as well) found it necessary to fill in the tantalizing hints left by the biblical biographer, with sometimes fantastic tales. But in the Exodus text, it is God who holds sway. In this context, one is reminded that Israelite thinking had room neither for worship of human heroes nor interest in the biography of God (i.e., divine birth and marriage) on the model of surrounding cultures. The biblical portrayal of both God and Moshe has been reduced in our book to only such facts as will illuminate the relationship between Israel and its God. Thus we learn from the Moshe of Exodus much about the people themselves, and about prophecy (cf. Chaps. 3-4); from the God of Exodus, how he acts in history and what he demands of the people. More than that is not easily forthcoming from our text (interestingly, the Passover Haggadah picked up on the Bible’s direction and all but omitted Moshe’s name in the celebration of the holiday)."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",12,"As we have suggested, later Jewish legend—some of which may actually be of great antiquity—sought to fill in various aspects of Moshe’s life that are missing from the Exodus text. A perusal of Ginzberg will uncover rich legendary material, dealing with Moshe’s childhood, family identity, experience in Midyan and elsewhere as a hero. While this material does not always illuminate the biblical story, it does demonstrate how folk belief includes a need for heroes in the classic Raglan mold; the Midrashic portrait of Moshe corresponds nicely to what we find in other cultures."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",13,"Turning to stylistic characteristics of these early chapters, we may note that a good deal of repetition occurs, as if further to highlight the themes. Baby Moshe is saved from death twice; three times he attempts acts of opposing oppression; twice (Chaps. 2 and 5) he fails in his attempts to help his enslaved brothers; and twice (Chaps. 3 and 6) God reassures him with long speeches that center around the Divine Name. This kind of continuity is artfully literary, but it is also an echo of real life, where people often live out certain themes in patterns."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",14,"Finally there is the matter of recurring words. Most important is the telling use of “see,” from the loving gaze of Moshe’s mother (2:2), through to the auspicious glance of Pharaoh’s daughter (2:6), then to Moshe’s sympathetic observing of his brothers’ plight (2:11); all this seems to be linked to the episode at the Burning Bush, where God “is seen” by the future leader (3:2), and where the climax of this whole development takes place: God affirms that he has “seen, yes, seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt…. and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them” (3:7, 9). Thus Moshe’s biography leads to, and is an outgrowth of, the people’s own situation."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",15,"In sum, Moshe’s early biography leads us to ponder the “growing up” process through which the people of Israel must pass on their way out of Egypt. The narratives that deal with his leadership of the people in the wilderness period, from Ex. <i>16</i> on, will help to round out our picture of him as a real personality, with the tragedies and triumphs that are a part of human life but magnified in the case of great individuals."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",16,<b>O<small>N THE</small> J<small>OURNEY</small> M<small>OTIF</small></b>
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",17,"World literature is dominated by stories involving a journey. More often than not, these tales are framed as quests for holy or magical objects (e.g., the Holy Grail), or for eternal youth/immortality (Gilgamesh). The classic pattern, as Joseph Campbell has described it, calls for the hero to make a kind of round trip, crossing dangerous thresholds (monsters, giants, unfriendly supernatural beings) both on the way toward the goal and on the way home. Either at the middle or at the end of the journey stands the goal, which often entails meeting with the divine and/or obtaining a magical or life-giving object (e.g., the Golden Fleece)."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",18,"Such stories mirror our own longings for accomplishment and acceptance, as well as our universal desire to overcome the ultimate enemy, Death. In the hero’s triumphs, we triumph; his vanquishing of death cathartically becomes our own."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",19,"This mythic substructure has penetrated the biblical tales, but it has been toned down for human protagonists, to suppress the idea of the mortal hero in favor of the divine one. Thus all the Patriarchs except Yitzhak (Isaac) go on fateful long journeys (his is reserved for the three-day trip to Moriah in Gen. 22), yet there is none of the color and adventure that we find, for example, in Greek mythology. Outside of Yaakov’s encounter with the mysterious wrestler in Gen. 32, there is little in Genesis to suggest hero tales on the classic mold. In Exodus, too, Moshe makes a significant journey—to Midyan—one might say, within himself, to find his true identity and calling, but it is highly muted, containing virtually no details. The round trip contains two thresholds of death, with Moshe first threatened by Pharaoh’s justice (2:15) and, on the way back to Egypt, by God himself (4:24–26). The initial goal is attained at the “mountain of God” “behind the wilderness,” where, meeting with divinity amid fire, he is finally able to integrate his own past, present, and future (as he will return to this mountain with the entire people in Chaps. 19ff). At the Burning Bush, the Egyptian prince, the Israelite shepherd, and the Hebrew liberator coalesce, investing Moshe with unique qualifications for his task."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",20,"But it is to a larger journey framework that we must look to understand the “hero” content of Exodus, and with it, that of the Torah as a whole. The major journey undertaken is, of course, that of the people of Israel, from slavery to Promised Land. It is also a journey from death to life, from servitude to god-king to the service of God as king; along the way, death serves to purify an entire generation. And yet even this most obvious of journey stories differs markedly from those of gods and heroes so familiar in Western culture. The people of Israel function as a collective antihero, an example of precisely how not to behave. They play no active role whatsoever in their own liberation, use neither brawn nor wits to survive in the wilderness, constantly grumble about wanting to return to Egypt, and at both Sinai and the threshold of the Promised Land (in the book of Numbers), their chief form of behavior is first fear and later rebellion."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",21,"Moshe’s own journeys parallel those of the entire people later on. Like them, he flees from Pharaoh into the wilderness, meets God at flaming Sinai, and has trouble accepting his task but must in the end. Here is where Moshe shines as the true leader: he epitomizes his people’s experience and focuses and forges it into something new."

"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",23,"The heart of the Exodus story sets out the confrontation between the visible god-king, Pharaoh, who embodies the monumental culture of Egypt, and the invisible God of Israel who fights for his ragtag people. The drama is conveyed by means of alternating conversations/confrontations and events. The narrator has built his account, bracketed by the early approach of Moshe and Aharon (Aaron) to Pharaoh, which fails (Chap. 5), and the extended construct of the Tenth Plague (11—13); in between fall the schematically arranged first nine plagues."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",24,"Three overall stages characterize this latter section. The first is indicated by the oft-repeated demand, “Send free my people, that they may serve me!”; the second is the “hardening” of Pharaoh’s heart; and the third, the unleashing of each plague. Further, it can be shown that the plagues are presented via a variety of structures and substructures (see Greenberg 1969 and the chart in Sarna 1986). Some commentators divide them into five thematic groups of two apiece—1 and 2, the Nile; 3 and 4, insects; 5 and 6, disease; 7 and 8, airborne disaster; and 9 and 10, darkness/death (Plaut). Also fruitful is the following threefold division: 1, 4, and 7, God’s command to confront Pharaoh in the morning; 2,5, and 8, God says, “Come to Pharaoh”; 3, 6, and 9, no warning is given to Pharaoh. Yet another grouping of themes is possible (Bar Efrat): 1–3, God vs. the magicians of Egypt; 4–6, stress on the distinction between Israel and Egypt; 7–9, the most powerful plagues."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",25,"This utilization of order, symbolized by “perfect” numbers such as 3 and 10, finds a parallel in the creation story of Genesis 1 (where the key number, of course, is 7, 3 + 3 + 1, whereas here we have 3 + 3 + 3 + 1). Both texts display a desire to depict God as one who endows nature and history with meaning. The poetic tradition about the plagues, as represented, for instance, by Psalm 78, was content to describe the plagues in brief, within the setting of a single poem. The narrator of the Pentateuchal traditions, however, has a different point to make, and structured exposition is the best way to do it."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",26,"There is another structural tendency that one may observe in the Plague Narrative. Repeating words and motifs comprise over twenty shared and discrete elements in the story. Since the vast majority of these occur by the end of the fourth plague, this leaves the narrator free to develop plagues 7 and 8 with particular intensity, using a full palette of descriptions, with the addition of the theme that these were the worst of their kind ever to take place in Egypt. It will be useful here to list a few of the key words and phrases, and motifs, that can be found in the Plague Narrative:"
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",27,"<i>Words/phrases:</i> Go to Pharaoh; send … free; know; throughout the land of Egypt; plead; distinguish; tomorrow; man and beast; not one remained; heavy [i.e., severe] as Y<small>HWH</small> had said."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",28,<i>Motifs:</i> Moshe’s staff; Aharon as agent; magicians; death.
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",29,"It is important to note here that the structuring of the plagues is not a perfectly balanced one. The narrative varies between exact repetition of elements and phrases and nonrepetition (Licht). By thus using sounds and ideas in variation, the narrator is able to weave a tale whose message constantly reinforces itself, and which holds the audience’s attention without getting tedious."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",30,"I have deliberately omitted the question of Pharaoh’s heart above, as a separate issue. A host of expressions is used in the text to describe Pharaoh’s stubbornness: “harden” (Heb. <i>hiksha</i>), “make heavy-with-stubbornness” (<i>hakhbed</i>), and “strengthen” (<i>hehezik/hazzek</i>), with the resultant “refused” and “did not hearken.” This motif is the only one that occurs in all nine plagues, and therefore stands at the very heart of our narrative. When one notes the pattern within—that Pharaoh does the hardening at the beginning, God at the end—the intent begins to become clear. The Plague Narrative is a recounting of God’s power, and Pharaoh’s stubbornness, which starts out as a matter of will, eventually becomes impossible to revoke. The model is psychologically compelling: Pharaoh becomes trapped by his own refusal to accept the obvious (in biblical parlance, to “know”). Despite the prophetic idea that human beings can be forgiven, we find here another one—that evil leads to more evil, and can become petrified and unmovable."
"Part I; The Deliverance Narrative",31,"A final note about the backdrop of these stories. Cecil B. DeMille did it differently, and in the difference lies the gap between Western culture and biblical culture. In the movie <i>The Ten Commandments</i> (a strange title, given the actual content of the film!), DeMille’s own 1956 remake of his earlier silent film, great stress is put on the physical, visual trappings of Pharoah’s court. Apparently no expense was spared to bring in costumes, sets, and extras, and the result causes the audience to focus on the splendor of Egyptian culture, despite the fact that it is peopled by the villains of the story. In contrast, the Bible says practically nothing about the visual backdrop of the Plague Narrative. Just as Genesis made reference to the mighty culture of Babylonia by parodying it (for instance, in the Babel story of Chap. 11), Exodus strips down Egyptian culture by making it disappear, and by ridiculing its gods. The book saves descriptive minutiae for the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25ff.), preferring to stress the positive and simply to omit what it found as negative. This profoundly “anticultural” stance (see the intriguing analysis by Schneidau) was characteristic of Israel’s worldview and was a mystery to the Greeks and Romans who centuries later conquered the land; it was to stand the people of Israel in good stead in their wanderings through the centuries."
"Part II; In the Wilderness",1,(15:22–18:27)
"Part II; In the Wilderness",2,"T<small>he wilderness narratives in the</small> T<small>orah must have been extraordinarily im</small>portant to the narrator/editor, as evidenced by their placement at this point in Exodus. Why did he/they see fit to insert here material which, chronologically at least, would fit better at a later point—for instance, in the book of Numbers (which reports essentially the same sort of incidents)?"
"Part II; In the Wilderness",3,"The answer comes from several quarters. The wilderness stories embody a key process for the Torah story: Israel’s passage from enslaved childhood to troubled adolescence, with a hopeful glance toward adulthood (the Promised Land). This process starts immediately after liberation; indeed, it is its direct result. Further, the three “desert themes” prominent in Chapters 15–18–“grumbling” against God and Moshe, hostile neighbors, and early self-government—are appropriate to include before the meeting at Sinai, in that they demonstrate dramatically the people’s need for reassurance, protection, group solidarity, and institutions (whereby they can live harmoniously). These narratives, therefore, lay out Israel’s precarious position and create the hope for a cure. It is only later on in the Torah, in the book of Numbers, that we will discover that the growing-up process in the wilderness could not be accomplished in a single generation."
"Part II; In the Wilderness",4,"The portrait of a people (or of an individual, as is often the case in religious literature) undergoing transformation in a place outside of normal geographic/cultural boundaries is a well-known phenomenon in traditional stories. Anthropologist Victor Turner speaks of the “liminal” experience, where the protagonist or initiant is separated spiritually and geographically from his origins in order to be changed into something new (see Fredman and Cohn). This is paralleled by the process of pilgrimage in the world of ritual, as can still be observed among many communities of the world to this day. The desert is the site of liminality par excellence: it is a harsh place that contains none of the succoring elements of human civilization, yet at the same time it leads the wanderer into truer communication with nature and the divine, metacultural forces of the universe. It is a place of betwixt and between, which mirrors the experiencer’s psychological state. In the case of Israel, later biblical sources speak of the wilderness period with striking force, either as an example of the people’s long-standing and deeply ingrained rebelliousness (e.g., Psalm 95), or fondly, as a kind of honeymoon period between God and Israel (e.g., Jer. 2:2). In both cases what is evoked is only a stage on the way, and not the final goal (see Talmon)."
"Part II; In the Wilderness",5,"Transformation always involves both life and death, and so it is not surprising that a characteristic theme of the stories before us is lack of food and/or water. The opening episodes of the section (15:22–17:7) comprise three scenes of “grumbling” about the difficulties of survival (with the structure: water-food-water), with a unique biblical twist: God and the people “testing” each other. And so the transformation depends very much on God’s action on the people’s behalf (twice he has to “instruct” them—the very verb from which the term “Torah” is derived). The suspension of the life process, or at least its imperiling, is notable also in the fact that, in contrast to the fertility of the Israelites in Egypt, “the trek narrative does not relate a single birth” (Cohn). This is especially striking given the strong birth image of Israel at the Sea of Reeds, which is still in the reader’s mind as the section opens."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",1,(19—24)
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",2,"T<small>he narrative has returned to its source.</small> A<small>t</small> S<small>inai it had been foretold that</small> when Pharaoh “sends you free, you will serve God on this mountain,” and it is at Sinai that Moshe and the people now arrive. The fateful public meeting between the deity and the amassed human community will betoken the formal change of masters: the people, no longer enslaved by the Egyptian crown, now swear fealty to their divine Lord, who imposes rules of conduct upon them in return for his protection and their well-being."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",3,"The settings for these events of covenant-making and law-giving are appropriately impressive. The mountain naturally functions as a bridge between heaven and earth (with only Moshe allowed to ascend!), but it is additionally accompanied on this occasion by the powerful manifestations of smoke, fire, cloud, thunder, lightning, and trumpet blasts. To try and pin down exactly to what natural phenomena the story alludes, be they volcano, earthquake, or the like, is somewhat beside the point; what speaks through the text is the voice of an overwhelming experience. Indeed, as Greenberg (1972) points out, the account in Chapter 19 may have been deliberately left ambiguous and contradictory, showing that the editor wished to include all the received traditions about the event."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",4,"At the same time, it should be noted that the Sinai revelation resembles the appearance of the storm-god Baal in Canaanite texts, especially in the combining of thunder/lightning and earthquake. Psalm 18:8 portrays a similar scene. So as varied as the phenomena accompanying God’s appearance here are, they conform to a known literary pattern (Greenstein 1984c)."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",5,"As mentioned previously, Sinai stands geographically at the center of the Israelite wanderings. As the textual center of the book of Exodus as well, it anchors the people of Israel on their journey toward the fulfillment of their destiny. But that function is purely a mythic one. Sinai never became an important biblical cult site, and the only later story to take place there, that of Elijah in I Kings 19, clearly stems from the desire to draw a parallel between Elijah and Moshe. The Hebrews apparently could not conceive of God’s abiding place’s being located outside the land of Israel. On the other hand, it was necessary to demonstrate that Israel’s laws and institutions arose, not out of normal settled political and economic circumstances, but rather as the direct gift and stipulation of God himself (see Cohn), and hence the choice of a site wholly removed from the great culture centers of the ancient Near East: the monolithic culture of Egypt, the ancestral heritage of Mesopotamia, and the fertility-based society the people were to encounter in Canaan. Sinai, the originating point of Israel as a self-defined community, had to start everything anew, on a stage in which all other considerations had been stripped away."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",6,"Early in the history of biblical exegesis (the Midrash) it was noted that the events on Sinai resemble the conclusion of a marriage ceremony. Such an idea may even have been in the minds of the transmitters of the Exodus traditions. Indeed, the entire book is remarkably reminiscent of a pattern of rescue—courting—wedding with stipulations—home planning—infidelity—reconciliation—and final “moving in” (these stages fit into the general Part divisions I have used throughout the book). Lest this appear to be too Western a model, let it be noted that such analogies occur in the writings of the prophets, where the relationship between God and Israel is likened to that between husband and wife. This constitutes Israel’s version of what Joseph Campbell has termed “sacred marriage” in hero stories—not, as classically, the hero’s successful wooing of a goddess or semidivine creature, but an intimate relationship established between God and his people. As such, it is unique in the ancient world."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",7,<b>O<small>n</small> C<small>ovenant</small></b>
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",8,"Marriage may be one imaginative model for the Sinai experience, but it was covenant that the writers wished to stress above all in these chapters. Here we observe a fascinating phenomenon that occurs again and again in biblical religion: an institution well known in the secular world is given a religious emphasis in the Bible. For covenant (others, “pact”) was a widespread form of political bonding in the ancient Near East. Kings and vassals, from Anatolia to Assyria, regularly aligned themselves in treaties involving either freewill granting of privileges or an agreement of mutual obligations between parties. A number of texts laying out the stipulations and ceremonies particular to covenant-making in the ancient Near East have been recovered, and study of them is helpful for an understanding of what we have in Ex. 19–24. Three things are clear. First, the stylistic pattern in our chapters resembles what is found in Hittite treaty texts (Mendenhall 1954); second, the Exodus passages use narrative to express these events, not merely a list of conditions; third, and most important, no other ancient society, so far as we know, conceived of the possibility that a <i>god</i> could “cut a covenant” with a people. This last fact leads to the observation that, for Israel, the true king was not earthly but divine—despite the later establishment of a monarchy (Weinfeld 1972b). Hence the narrator’s concentration on these chapters, especially considering the dramatic nature of what had gone before (Chaps. 1–15)."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",9,"The covenant found in Exodus and subsequently in the Torah differs substantively from the two described in Genesis. Noah (Gen. 9) and all living creatures had been promised no further universal destruction, with the stipulation that human beings were not to eat meat with blood or commit willful murder. Avraham, too (Gen. 15, 17), was the recipient of a covenant: God would give him land and descendants, and Avraham was to attend to the circumcision of all his males (yet this is more sign than stipulation). What these early events have in common is the aspect of bestowal—God acts and promises, and human beings are the passive recipients. Exodus introduces the notes of mutuality and conditionality. Both parties are now to have a stake in the agreement, and it can be broken by either (as in Chap. 32; contrast this with the promise to Noah in Gen. 8:21–22, “I will never doom the soil again … never shall [natural processes] cease,” and Gen. 9:11, “Never again shall there be Deluge….”). From the Creator God we have moved to the God of History, who enters into a fateful relationship with the people of Israel (for more on this, see Sarna 1986)."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",10,<b>O<small>n</small> B<small>iblical</small> L<small>aw</small></b>
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",11,"A century of modern Bible scholarship has led to far-reaching changes in the perceptions of biblical law. Initial archeological findings, which often included legal documents, had led comparativists to see in the biblical material a pale reflection of its Mesopotamian antecedents. The Code of Hammurabi, for instance, was deemed the source of some of the Exodus material. These early judgments have given way to a view that places more emphasis on what is distinctive about the biblical laws."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",12,"For our purposes here, several brief points should be made, drawn from recent research; the reader may find them explored at greater depth in the essays by Greenberg (1970), Greenstein (1984), Paul, and Sarna (1986), and the work of Sonsino. Expressions of law in the ancient Near East, especially in documents from Mesopotamia, reveal a strong economic underpinning, tied to class structure. They also have at times a personal or political function. Hammurabi, for instance, presents his code with the express purpose that the gods and men may see what a just king he is. The laws are listed by category, with religion occupying its own sphere. Finally, the king acts as the enforcer of the laws, having received them from a god—who is nevertheless not their ultimate source. Law exists in the Mesopotamian texts as an abstract value, designed for the smooth functioning of society."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",13,"By way of contrast, Hebrew law, as typified by our chapters, displays very different concepts and concerns. Class is hardly alluded to, reflecting a totally different kind of society economically but also expressing an ideal that began in the Genesis creation story with the common ancestor of the human race. The laws are presented as the terms of the covenant (our section is often termed the “Book of the Covenant”), and the motivation behind them is portrayed as historical/psychological (“… for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). Strikingly, the biblical regulations, not only here but in the other major collections as well (in Leviticus and Deuteronomy), blur the distinctions between religious and secular, and treat all law as a matter directly related to God. He is perceived as the source of laws; they are the expression of his will; and breaking them is a direct affront to and act of rebellion against him (contrast, for example, the modern American view)."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",14,"The key concept behind much of biblical law seems to be that of Ex. 19:6, to make of the people of Israel “a holy nation.” This expression, which appears nowhere else in the Bible, combines a secular notion (the Hebrew <i>goy</i>, meaning a political body, a state) with a sacral one: this people is to transform all of its life into service of God. There is, therefore, no subject in the code before us—slavery, social relations, torts, cult, or diet—that is not of immediate concern to the biblical God. The first part of 19:6, “a kingdom of priests” (Buber: “a king’s-retinue of priests”), would seem to suggest that despite the clear existence of a priestly group in ancient Israel, the ideal approached a more democratic form of religious expression."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",15,"This leads us to posit a final question: Are the materials in Ex. 21–24 (and other texts in the Torah that enumerate laws) to be taken as actual regulations or cases, or as something else, rather more didactic? We have little evidence for the former view, and in fact other ancient Near Eastern legal documents such as the Hammurabi Code seem to point in the other (didactic) direction. Given the nature of Torah literature, where narrative has a teaching function rather than a purely historical one, it seems plausible that the legal texts as well were intended to elucidate principles of Israelite belief—to present, as it were, a worldview. The other possibility, more in keeping with the history of law, is Daube’s (1947) view that “many ancient codes regulate only matters as to which the law is dubious or in need of reform or both.” In other words, law in day-to-day Israel was regulated by established precedents, and certainly not by Ex. 21–23, in the main. But in this case, too, our text would be instructive of the biblical mentality. For a fuller treatment of biblical law and its context in the ancient Near East, see Sarna (1986)."
"Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai",16,"Any attempt to describe this section structurally is bound to run into a roadblock; perhaps precisely because of the Bible’s desire <i>not</i> to distinguish between various categories of life, we do not have a watertight structure. Suffice it to say that, overall, most sections in these chapters begin with the general proposition “When …” (Heb. <i>ki</i>), and break down the issue under discussion into subsections beginning with “If …” (Heb. <i>’im</i>), a pattern found commonly in other legal systems as well. Beyond this, and the observation that there are some general categories and logical connections (for which, see the Commentary), one striking stylistic device in the Hebrew should be pointed out. From 21:5 through 23:24 a double verb form appears (the infinitive absolute followed by the imperfect) fully twenty-seven times. The effect of this device, which is rhetorically emphatic, is to give a sense of coherence to what are otherwise quite diverse laws."

"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",1,(25–31)
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",2,"D<small>espite the importance of all that has preceded, the section of</small> E<small>xodus we</small> now encounter occupies a significant amount of text, and therefore commands our attention, in the overall scheme of the book. It may seem puzzling to modern readers that a book that purports to be about a people’s origins should choose to fill a third of its pages with a detailed description of a sanctuary, down to the last piece of tapestry and the last ritual vessel. Yet it is an indication of the “Tabernacle’s” centrality in Israel’s idea system that the story of its construction dominates the last half of Exodus."
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",3,"Several factors may help to explain. First, the system of animal and grain sacrifices, or cult, was as important in ancient Israel as it was elsewhere in antiquity, as the chief means of formally expressing religious feeling. Indeed, the Bible traces this institution back to the beginning of human history, to Cain and Abel (Gen. 4:3–4). The cult’s centrality survived the railings of the Prophets and the destruction of Solomon’s Temple, and was still strong enough in late antiquity to provoke a severe crisis when its chief site, the Second Temple, fell to the Romans in the year 70 <small>c.e.</small> The latter event was a crux upon which the creation of classical Judaism took place, and the process was a painful one. So the opinion that many moderns have, that animal sacrifice was a barbaric custom, is quite beside the point as far as ancient Israel was concerned."
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",4,"Second, there is the great theme of the book of Exodus, “Is Y<small>hwh</small> in our midst or not?” (17:7), to which our account gives a resounding positive answer. The book of Exodus traces not only the journey of the people of Israel from Egypt to Sinai, but also the journey of God to rescue the people and to dwell (“tabernacle”) among them (Greenberg 1972). A detailed presentation of God’s “residence,” as it were, is meant to convey the assurance that the people are led by God himself. This further supports the biblical image of the divine king, who dwells among his subjects and “goes before” them."
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",5,"Third, the Israelites shared with their neighbors the idea that a victorious God, following his triumph, was to be honored by his enthronement in a human-built structure (see Hallo). Thus the last half of Exodus, far from trailing off into obscure priestly details, fits a well-known mold in its contemporary environment."
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",6,"A final explanation of the prominence of the Tabernacle sections may be found in their intimate connection with the idea of the Sabbath. The “blueprint” chapters, 25–31, end with an extended passage on observing the Sabbath; the construction chapters, 35–40, begin with a brief passage on the prohibition of work on the holy day. These structural aspects suggest (as the ancient rabbis also saw) that cessation from work here means precisely from the tasks of construction, and that once a week human beings must step back from their own creating to acknowledge the true “work” of creation. Chapters 25–40, including the Golden Calf narrative, bring out these ideas through their use of refrainlike phrases, especially the repetition of one key word: “make” (Heb. <i>’asoh</i>). The entire section is an object lesson in what the Bible deems it proper for human beings to make, and is a vehicle of contrast between God’s creation and human attempts to reach the divine. Israel is engaged in the making of the Tabernacle (notice how “build,” which would make more sense, is not used); when the time comes for the work to be put aside temporarily, they are to “make” the Sabbath. To these observations may be added the long-observed fact that the vocabulary of the Tabernacle’s completion (“finished,” “work,” “blessed”) recalls the completion of Creation in Gen. 2:1–4. Thus we are taught that Israel, through its religious life as typified by Sabbath and cult, becomes a partner in the process of Creation, either by imitating the divine act or by celebrating it."
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",7,"Other peoples, to be sure, recall the beginning of the world in ritual and story, so it is important to make an anthropological observation. The purpose of all sanctuaries is to build a bridge to the divine, to link up with the forces that transcend human beings. It is perceived that certain places are particularly appropriate for this (folklore terms such places “the navel of the earth”), and, by extension, sanctuaries firmly anchor that inherent holiness. What the Tabernacle account initially accomplishes, most notably in its closing chapter (40), is to transfer a topographic “bridge” to a human-made and portable one. With the completion of this Dwelling, we find God resident neither on Sinai nor in the later Jerusalem, but rather accompanying the people “upon all their marches” (40:38). The sacred center here thus moves; it is a portable anchor that establishes stability wherever it goes. The vitality that surrounded this idea is still to be seen in the successors of the Hebrew Bible, classical Judaism and Christianity, for whom, respectively, Torah and Cross provide a center that is at once movable and stabilizing."
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",8,"But the sacred center, for biblical religion, finds equal expression in <i>time.</i> While the Dwelling account seems obsessed with matters of space, its setting among the Sabbath passages stresses more the concept of time. Such an aspect already begins to make itself felt in 24:16, where Moshe, on Sinai to receive the laws, waits for six days while the “cloud” covers the mountain, and is able to ascend only on the seventh day, at God’s summons. We are thus left, paradoxically, with a structure (Dwelling) which at first glance uses many well-known art forms and religious motifs common to the ancient Near East, but which is a total departure from them via its connection with the Sabbath—an institution with no known equivalent in the ancient world. The Dwelling account presents us with a people for whom sacred time takes precedence over sacred space (for more on these themes, see Sarna 1986)."
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",9,"There have been many attempts, textually and artistically, to reconstruct the Tabernacle on the basis of our text here, the rationale being that surely so much detail as we find here will serve as the guidelines for an actual structure. Rabbinic and medieval Jewish commentators, as well as modern scholars, have expended considerable energy to that end. But in fact none of the reconstructions has succeeded, for, as with narrative, the text is as much message as description. The text’s main concern, it seems, is for the Dwelling to reflect holiness, in its choice of measurements and materials (see Haran 1985). The layout of the Dwelling expresses aesthetic ideas of perfection, through various symmetrical proportions (see Appendix); the materials are graded such that the closer one gets to God (in the “Holiest Holy-Shrine”), the more precious the metal. In addition, both the colors used and the types of workmanship employed are similarly graded. In a general way, the intent of the narrator seems to have been close to the intent of the great cathedral builders of the Middle Ages: to reflect divine perfection and order in the perfection and order of a sacred structure."
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",10,"The Dwelling, as described in Exodus, resembles other ancient Near Eastern sanctuaries in many particulars (for which, see the Commentary below), as well as strongly reflecting aspects of the later Temple of Solomon (I Kings 6–7). Some scholars have also likened it to a Bedouin tent (Heb. <i>shakhen</i> seems to be an archaic verb for “to tent”), appropriate to desert conditions. It is perhaps all three, a coalescing of Israel’s ideas of the cult from a variety of historical and religious settings. That the Dwelling was viewed as historical is clear from biblical tradition itself (see II Sam. 7:6, for instance). But one should keep in mind that it is also a paradigmatic model, that helps to round out the overall scheme of Exodus. The book traces the progress of the people of Israel from servitude (to Pharaoh) to service (of God), and uses the human activity of building to do so. Thus, as Exodus opens, the Israelites are forcibly made to build royal storage cities; as the book ends, the people complete a structure through which they may serve the divine king."
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",11,"Finally, there is the sequence of description in these chapters: the text begins with the blueprint for the holiest object, the “coffer” (ark), and proceeds through the structure in descending order of holiness. After the building instructions themselves are given, a number of related matters are treated, chief among them the attire of the priests and the ceremony consecrating the priests. The establishment of the cult, like that of the system of justice, is thus viewed as the command of God rather than the result of the need or request of human beings (contrast this with the “requested” monarchy in I Sam. 8)."
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",12,"<i>The “Contribution”</i> (25:1–9): In the first seven verses of this opening section dealing with the Dwelling, the Israelites’ contribution toward the structure is described in detail; but only in v.8 is the purpose of this activity made clear. Despite the concreteness of the description, however, the actual blueprints, as it were, are shown to Moshe by God, and are not recorded in the text. Architects in the creative sense are superfluous here."
"Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult",13,"Moderns want to know where the Israelites procured such materials as gold and silver in quantity (see Chap. 38), or how they acquired the skills necessary for the fine artisanry involved (e.g., weaving, dyeing, manufacture of incense, and the setting of jewels). These questions, while logical in a historical setting, do not take the Bible on its own terms. The text appears to present the awed report of the Dwelling and its construction without leaving room for totally practical issues (just as Gen. 4 deals with Cain and his descendants without being concerned with the origins of Cain’s wife)."

We are also given a classic biblical description of God in this story—that he is demanding but also compassionate."
"Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored",3,"There is no doubt that the narrative wishes to portray the breaking of the recently made covenant, and also to focus once again on the anxiety about God’s presence that pervades the whole book. Some see it as a political polemic, given that a similar story is found in I Kings 12:28ff., about Jeroboam’s split from the Solomonic monarchy; according to this theory, the Exodus account is a projection backward of the sin of the Northern Kingdom. Jeroboam, leading a secessionist movement, intended to set up a sanctuary to rival Jerusalem. At the same time, the Exodus story does appear first, and thereby helps to explain why Jeroboam’s deed was considered so terrible by later generations."
"Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored",4,"But surely the Golden Calf story plays such an important role in the present book of Exodus as to sidestep the question of which version came first. It puts into sharp relief the nature of the people, its leader, and its God, and provides some insights into the complex relationships between these parties; it focuses particular aspects of the Tabernacle idea (see above); and it makes clear the difficulties of the emerging faith community."
"Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored",5,"The story also contributes some welcome dramatic scenes at this point. It is as if the reader has awakened from a dream: major characters, including God himself, reemerge as real personalities, while secondary characters (Aharon and Yehoshua) are fleshed out. Everywhere there are fierce emotions: doubt, anger, panic, pleading for mercy, courage, fear. And, indeed, the entire enterprise of Exodus hangs in the balance, as God wishes only to destroy the faithless people (a rough parallel exists in Gen. 22, where all that has previously been promised to Avraham is threatened). Only after the stark emotions just mentioned have been cathartically absorbed, and the covenant restored, can there be a return to the task at hand—the building of an abode for the divine amid the very human community of Israel. As to the stylistic aspects of the story, we should note the repeated use of the verbs “see” and “know,” among others. Their transformation at different points of the story signals a return to these earlier Exodus themes, this time with a new urgency and a new enterprise at stake: the continuity of the fledgling people."

"Part VI; The Building of the Dwelling",2,"A<small>S IF NOTHING HAD GONE AWRY</small>, <small>THE NARRATIVE NOW RETURNS TO DESCRIBE HOW THE</small> Dwelling was built. This time, as was noted by the sages of the Talmud, the order follows the natural logic of construction (i.e., dwelling, tapestries, covering, boards, sockets, bars, etc., and then the ritual objects), rather than the earlier one of sanctity (i.e., coffer, purgation-cover, table, lampstand, etc., and then the structure itself). The most notable omission is the carrying out of priestly ordination; that is reserved for Lev. 8, perhaps so as not to interfere with the narrative momentum of the construction process, or else to focus more on the Dwelling itself and its divine resident. The only major interruption in this part is 38:21–31, which fits in with one of the important themes of these chapters: the extent of the Israelites’ contribution to the sanctuary."

"On Translating Leviticus",1,"T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> L<small>EVITICUS</small>, <small>ALONG WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE</small> T<small>ORAH THAT DEAL WITH</small> cultic and legal matters, presents particular problems for a translator who chooses to work in the Buber-Rosenzweig mode. There are a number of technical terms which, in addition to their constant repetition in the text, inviting overemphasis on strangeness, are difficult to render accurately into English. For their part, Buber and Rosenzweig translated what they understood as the meaning of these terms, even if it meant creating new words in German that made little sense to someone not familiar with the Hebrew concepts. Some examples are found below."
"On Translating Leviticus",2,"My initial inclination was to leave the names of sacrifices, etc., in Hebrew transcription, but I have come to feel that this places an undue burden on the English reader. With some reservations I have therefore opted for a mix of transcription and translation."
"On Translating Leviticus",3,"Buber saw the names of several sacrifices as suggesting movement between the human and the divine. Thus the names of the two most common sacrifices, <i>korban</i> and <i>ola</i>, were rendered “Nearbringing” and “Highbringing” in B-R. I have utilized “near-offering” and “offering-up”; in the case of the former, the intent of the text may simply have been to indicate what the worshiper “brings-near” to the altar, although the effect was certainly understood to bring humans closer to God. A third type of sacrifice, the <i>minha</i>, which B-R rendered as “leading-gift,” always indicates a “grain-gift” in cultic texts. My German predecessors would undoubtedly not have approved of my less radical approach to these terms; I have, however, followed them in retaining “bringing-near” as a verb, denoting variously “to bring,” “to sacrifice,” and “to officiate” (in the sanctuary), which I have indicated in the Notes."
"On Translating Leviticus",4,"As for <i>hattat</i> and <i>asham</i>, these two key sacrifices have a number of meanings in the text. I have chosen to retain them in transcription, providing occasional translations on location or explanations in the notes."
"On Translating Leviticus",5,"A most important term in the priestly material is the adjective <i>tamei</i> (along with its noun, <i>tum’a</i>). The word refers to a ritual state, the existence of which was understood in ancient Israel as a grave danger to the “purity” of the sanctuary. It is not, however, “uncleanness” in the physical sense, but a state akin perhaps to radioactivity: in this case, it drives away the divine presence from Israel (cf. Greenstein 1984a for another analogy). B-R used “stained/tainted” in their translation; most recent scholars use “polluted” and “pollution” to describe the phenomenon. I have accepted the latter in my discussions below but have chosen to stay with Hebrew transcription in the text itself, allowing for a wider and less overtly negative form of the term. Were I in a flippant mood brought on by political correctness, I might suggest “ritually challenged” for <i>tamei</i>."
"On Translating Leviticus",6,"One more problem in translating Leviticus is worthy of mention. A Buber-Rosenzweig type of rendition is fairly adaptable for narrative and even poetry; but in legal and cultic passages, such as we find in abundance in Leviticus, it imposes huge constraints on the translator. Recent English translations such as JPS and the New Revised Standard Version have conveyed the basic meaning of these passages in reasonably clear language. I, on the other hand, have not found it possible to avoid awkward English in this material. I hope nevertheless that, despite the difficulties involved for the reader, the rhetoric and structure—and sometimes the obscurity—of the Hebrew, which left the text open to later disagreement and interpretation, will still be visible and instructive."
"On Translating Leviticus",7,"A final note on translation practices. Buber and Rosenzweig did not always hold to the principle of one Hebrew root, one corresponding German root, if this was unimportant or simply an impossibility. I have similarly on occasion deviated from full consistency in translating certain words. So, for instance, I found that the many different uses of Heb. <i>shamor</i>—“guard,” “keep,” “take-care”—simply could not be standardized in translation. In the main, when I have found it possible to connect passages via their standardized language in the Hebrew, I have done so in English."

"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",2,"F<small>OR MOST LAY READERS</small>, <small>THE THIRD OF THE</small> F<small>IVE BOOKS OF</small> M<small>OSES PRESENTS FORMIDA</small>ble obstacles. Many people find it difficult to relate to the description of ritual slaughter of animals and the disposal of their blood and flesh in the opening section of the book, or to the detailed prescriptions regarding bodily functions, skin disease, and mold in Chapters 12–15. Others experience Leviticus as obscure: Why exactly do Aaron’s sons die in Chapter 10? How can one explain the ritual of the scapegoat in Chapter 16? A frequently encountered reaction to the book is the desire to get on to the book of Numbers—which at least has some intriguing narratives such as Moses’ sin and punishment, the faint-heartedness of the spies, and Balaam’s reversed prophecies."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",3,"Yet Leviticus, as it has been placed in the Torah, signals that something of singular importance is at work. The book, after all, occurs at the center of the overall five-book structure. Unlike the other four, it is set entirely around Mount Sinai, and so it forms, geographically as well as structurally, the heart of the Torah document. In addition, the priestly interests so clearly presented in Leviticus appear throughout the Torah: as genealogical lists (Genesis, Exodus, Numbers), descriptions of rituals (Exodus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), and details about the building of the desert “Dwelling” of God (Exodus). Indeed, the opening chapter of it all, Gen. 1 (the Creation story), has strong links in both its themes and terminology with the priestly law."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",4,"Leviticus in fact presents a significant strain, conventionally termed the “priestly” view, in biblical thought. Anthropologically considered, it sheds important light on the outlook of some of those who compiled and read the Hebrew Bible. And the process did not stop there. Many of the categories found in Leviticus were continued and expanded by later Judaism: regulations concerning sexuality and diet, concepts of separation and holiness, and how to deal with one’s fellow human beings in a variety of economic and social settings. These found expression in different but still recognizable form simultaneously in the development of Christianity."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",5,"In late antiquity Leviticus was known as <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, the Priestly Instruction (or simultaneously understood, as Levine suggests, as the Instruction of the Priests). Given both the concerns of the priestly writers and the wording they use to express those concerns, I see Leviticus as the Book of Separations, the book in which are set forth distinctions between a whole range of aspects of ancient Israelite experience and practice: holy and profane; ritual purity and pollution; permitted and forbidden in sexuality and diet; Israelites and others; and priests, Levites, and common folk among the Israelites. This near-obsession with drawing lines (or, as Douglas has presented it, concentric circles) may in some sense reflect the position of Israel in the ancient Near East as a small, beleaguered newcomer in a region of hoary empires, situated on land that was constantly invaded by both great powers and local foes. It may also be an echo of the larger Bronze Age and Iron Age process of change from the former, well-nigh universal worship of the Mother Goddess, to the later patriarchal societies with which the Western world still deals through its three monotheistic religions and their cultural outgrowths."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",6,"Overarching the theme of separations or distinctions, through much of the book, is the polarity of order/disorder, represented best in Leviticus by the problem of life and death. As many scholars have noted, regulations regarding sacrifice here connect up with symbolically offering up human life—through the substitution of an animal—to the deity; blood is avoided at all costs, due to its connoting life. Animals that may be used for food (as well as for sacrifice) are in the main those which do not consume other living creatures. Pollutants which endanger the purity of the sanctuary (“Dwelling”) include bodily emissions which the Israelites connected with death (e.g., menstrual blood and “wasted” semen). Finally, the complex system of purification from some kind of skin disease may well originate in the similarity between disease and death. In sum, then, it is no surprise that, two books later, the Deuteronomic Moses implores the people to “choose life” rather than the “death” engendered by improper behavior by both priests and commoners."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",7,"Interestingly, the strong urge to make order (ritual laws) out of disorder (the chaotic processes of human life, from killing animals for food to sexual relations) is reflected in other aspects of the Torah—most notably in the narrative portrayal of the descent lines from father Abraham. Here, the discontinuity represented by sibling rivalries and other threats to survival is countered by God’s establishing a kind of continuity through the choosing of younger brothers. In this case, the strong hand of ritual control is replaced by the somewhat hazardous element of surprise and close calls. But it does manage to provide for family continuity and, ultimately, the survival of the people. Whether this points to early or later experiences historically is the subject of ongoing and unresolved debate among biblical scholars. A widely accepted possibility is that the Torah as we have it was edited by priestly editors living in or shortly after the Babylonian Exile (6th–5th centuries <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>.), and that those editors took earlier material (which itself was already multilayered) and adapted it into an overall scheme expressing promise, disobedience, destruction, and survival/hope (cf. Fox 1993)."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",8,"In point of fact, Leviticus is best viewed as only a part, albeit the major one as a bloc, of a major thrust of the Torah. According to most biblical scholars, the “priestly” worldview, and the texts that may be attributed to it, makes its appearance with the very chapter with which the entire Torah begins, Gen. 1. Here distinctions and ordering are at the very heart of the text. God, immediately after his first creation-by-word (light), “separates” between light and darkness, then goes on to perform the same operation between heavenly waters (the storehouses of rain) and earthly ones. His remaining acts of creation involve putting heavenly bodies, vegetation, and animal life in order—each “according to its kind,” on specific days of creation. Animals are distinguished from plants through their receiving vocal divine blessing; humans from animals through the addition to the blessing of the phrase “have dominion over” the rest of living things. At the same time, humans are told that they may eat only what grows from the ground, implying that to do otherwise would be a violation of the order of things. Crowning the whole account is the poem (Gen. 2:1–4a) about God’s “finishing” of the “work” of creation, symbolized by his “hallowing” (making holy or separate-for-God) the seventh day. In Gen. 1, then, we are presented with a brief but complete vision of the cosmos as ordered in space, time, and life-forms, under the aegis of a metasexual, nonviolent, and benevolent deity."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",9,"As Genesis unfolds under priestly influence, humans are presented with basic rules and warned of the consequences if those rules are broken. The paradisical situation of Adam and Eve (no labor, vegetarianism, no danger from animals, and sexual innocence) is disrupted by human disobedience, resulting in banishment from Eden—a shattering of the previous wholeness and order. Cain’s murder of his brother leads to the same punishment: uprootedness and hard labor. The mixing of divine and human beings in Gen. 6:1–2 results in a clear distinction being established by God, that humans will henceforth be limited in age. Finally, the account of the universal flood in Chapters 6–9 presents a picture that uses a number of Leviticus motifs. The earth is to be destroyed because human wrongdoing has “ruined” it (or, in Levitical language, “polluted” it). Animal life is rescued by means of taking pairs of animals aboard the ark—with Leviticus’s distinctions of “pure” and impure dutifully mentioned. Noah’s three sons, who also come onto the ark, later become the forefathers of three great divisions of humanity, as laid out in detail in the genealogical lists of Chapters 10–11. Finally, the new beginning of the cosmos, with Noah as a second Adam (cf. the latter’s blessing in 1:28 with that of the former in 9:1–2), is accompanied by both animal sacrifices and dietary restrictions (the introduction of meat is new, accompanied by the caveat—as in Lev. 17—that blood is not to be consumed)."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",10,"A major part of the priestly scheme emerges with the detailed instructions concerning the construction of the Tabernacle (God’s place of “Dwelling” on earth) and the priestly vestments that are to be worn there, in Ex. 25–31 (with much of this material repeated in narrative form in Chapters 35–40). The details make sense as part of a larger picture, in which the closer one gets to the “Holiest Holy-Shrine” where God takes up dwelling, the more central the measurements of space and the more precious the materials used. This concentric sense of order is reflected also in the layout of the wilderness camp of the Israelites in Num. 2. Thus the Tabernacle functions as a minicosmos, a visible and ritual representation of the creation itself. Through the layout of curtains within and tribal encampments without, space is ordered; through the festivals (enumerated in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, with some mention in Exodus as well), time is ordered. And, thanks to the provisions laid out in Leviticus, through priest/lay hierarchy, dietary rules, and sacrificial regulations, life-forms are ordered. The result is an almost utopian scheme. It is a world in which everything and everyone are to take their place under the perfect worship of a perfect God, banishing or avoiding death, defect, and disorder. In the priestly view, the world is to be an echo of the divine order that is portrayed in the Creation story."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",11,"Viewed in the perspective of priestly concerns (only part of which we have just outlined), Leviticus is largely concerned with the potential disruption of this utopia. If Genesis chronicles threats to the fulfillment of God’s promises to Abraham, if Numbers recounts threats to his descendants’ survival on their march through the wilderness, then Leviticus concentrates on threats to Israel’s life with God. It presents a whole system of rules designed, first, to provide for purification and reconciliation with God through the sacrificial cult; second, to protect sanctuary, priests, land, and people from estrangement from God (via “pollution” of various kinds); and, finally, to establish a code of behavior that will ensure the perpetual enjoyment of God’s blessings on the land promised to Israel’s ancestors. From this it can readily be seen how Leviticus, far from being of interest to specialists and historians only, is in fact a crucial part of the Torah—perhaps its most crucial part, in that it supplies the ideological center of gravity for the whole. Once Leviticus is added to the narratives, poems, laws, and lists that comprise the rest of the Torah, a picture emerges that is more than literature and more than history. The five books become the multilayered and multifaceted monument that has been studied, puzzled over, and built upon for over two millennia."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",12,"In sum, the world of the priestly strain in the Torah is a realm of desired order and perfection, a realm in which wholeness is to reign, in which anomaly and undesired mixture are not permitted, and in which boundaries are zealously guarded. The human body becomes symbolic of the cosmos: its life/death boundary is marked, and troublesome flows from it are carefully regulated. The land of Israel becomes symbolic of the cosmos: too much evildoing pollutes it, to the point where it can do naught else but “vomit out” its settlers (as it vomited out the previous ones). The animal kingdom, from which humans are allowed to take life under carefully prescribed circumstances, becomes symbolic of cosmic values, through heightening awareness of predator and victim, and careful avoidance of blood, the symbol of life. Indeed, in the system of Leviticus, it is no wonder that death is the major pollutant, and that blood of acceptable animal sacrifice is the agent through which human beings find atonement for minor pollutants."

"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",33,Appendix: 27 Assessments for the Priests
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",34,Other commentators have of course seen it differently. Most follow the traditional scholarly approach of starting the “Holiness Code” with Chapter 17; Levine rightly parallels it to the beginnings of other law collections in the Torah (Ex. 20:19–23 and Deut. 12; the ending here in Chapter 26 also parallels the endings in the other two codes). Hallo understands the structure as 1–11: Rites of Consumption; 12–16: Rites of Purification; and 17–26: Holiness.
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",35,"Overshadowing the clear three-part structure, however one wants to divide it up, is the complex issue of two apparent documents or schools of thought. Biblical scholarship terms these P (“Priestly”) and H (“Holiness”), and roughly attributes the first part of the book (through Chap. 16) to P, with the rest to H. There has been detailed, ongoing debate about the approaches and dating of these sources. As of this writing, it is generally accepted that H is later than P, but there seem to be numerous interpolations of one source into the other, and it is difficult to place them historically with certainty. Here, as elsewhere in biblical literature, we have a layering effect rather than a clear-cut delineation of “authors.” As usual, that appears to have been intentional."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",36,"A word should be said about the relationship between law and narrative in the Torah. As Damrosch has noted, the legal and cultic texts in the five books might be seen by modern readers as intrusive. On the surface, they certainly seem to interrupt a good story. Genesis is largely unencumbered by nonaction (except for the genealogical lists—attributed to P!), but the gripping account of the redemption from Egypt in Exodus, and the drama of revelation on and apostasy beneath Mount Sinai, give way to the sober architectural details of the Tabernacle’s construction. Similarly, the narratives of the book of Numbers, which are among the most striking in the literature, are set off against a background of censuses, laws about suspected adultery and the taking of vows, Levitical duties in the Dwelling, and an enumeration of sacrificial gifts brought by the tribes, among other things."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",37,"The bulk of material in Leviticus, and its placement in the Torah, make it clear that the five books that we have convey their point precisely through the medium of narrative <i>plus</i> cult/law. In the Israelite worldview, these two rather distinct forms, which intermingle past, present, and future (Damrosch), fruitfully enrich and explain one another. It is as if a history of the American Revolution contained all of the debates on and drafts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, as well as accounts of battles and biographies of key personalities. That such an approach parallels neither Homeric epic nor ritual texts in their purity of form is exactly the point: we have here a new genre of great complexity and richness, in which narratives exemplify laws and laws follow narratives. The result is truly a torah, a “teaching” or “instruction.”"
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",38,"Finally, we might mention the issue of priests and laypeople. Scholars have often seen Leviticus as originating as a manual for priests. What is most fascinating, and perhaps most important (for later history), about this book is the way in which it takes priestly rules and transmutes at least some of them for use in the general populace of ancient Israel. This can be seen most dramatically in the dietary laws, which in other cultures often serve exclusively for priests, and in the area of sexual taboos, which do likewise. In postbiblical Judaism this shift becomes particularly evident: the Jew’s dinner table is termed a “sanctuary in miniature” (complete with loaves of bread and the use of salt—two elements found in the ancient sacrificial cult); dietary laws are expanded for the general population to provide for separation of milk and meat; and separation of husband and wife during menstruation, among traditional Jews, leaves the context of Sanctuary pollution and finds a home in the context of a philosophy of marriage. Many other examples could be brought of the widening of priestly laws to an entire people. Perhaps most dramatic—and most significant—is the eventual shift of the learning and interpretation of sacred texts away from the priests, who in most cultures served as the guardians of the text (and often the culture’s only literate body; cf. medieval Christian Europe). In Judaism of late antiquity, this monopoly was decisively broken; first the scribe and then the rabbi (“master”) took over, with learning extended at last to all those who might make the effort to acquire it. The great exception, at least in antiquity, was women—who, it will be noted, were also excluded from priestly functions in the Bible."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",39,"Three relatively recent developments make it possible to approach Leviticus as a significant, powerful, and interesting biblical text. The first is the explosion of both full-length and shorter studies of the book and its concerns that have appeared in recent years. The work of Milgrom (1991), Levine (1989), Wenham (1979), Eilberg-Schwartz (1990), and Bamberger (1981), to cite just a few of the English-language studies on aspects of Leviticus, now makes it possible to have a serious entry into the book based largely on advances in understanding the cultures of the ancient Near East. It also, admittedly, puts the translator and commentator in a bind: is it possible to add anything new, or will it suffice simply to summarize? My approach in this volume has been largely the latter, along with suggesting to the reader some fruitful directions for further study."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",40,"The second development helpful for approaching Leviticus, which also informs many of the studies just mentioned, is the using of anthropological insights to understand concepts and rituals found in the book. Such an approach places Leviticus in a broader human context, indicating what it does and does not share with other cultural and religious systems. For Leviticus is concerned with the same issues that plague all human societies: how to deal with the boundaries of life and death, how to comprehend and approach the transcendent in life, how to understand one’s (or one’s nation’s) place in the cosmic order, how to make for a just society. Viewed in this light, the book is a “Small Code” (cf. Northrop Frye’s designation of the Bible as “the Great Code”). That is, Leviticus need not remain a total mystery to us, to be unraveled only through detailed analysis and even change (Judaism) or substitution (Christianity), but can be understood on its own terms, if approached with care and in the spirit of seeking the larger picture in the details."
"On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure",41,"Finally, we should mention the aesthetic dimension. Like the other books of the Torah, Leviticus uses its own rhetoric to convey its message. Far from employing flat “priestly” style (whatever that may be), it uses formulas, refrains, and other rhythmical forms to impress its teaching (Heb. <i>tora</i>) upon its hearers. This aspect of the book has been the subject of recent study (cf. Paran), but was already echoed in the Buber-Rosenzweig translation. It is my hope that the present volume will contribute to an appreciation of the style of Leviticus."
"Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood",1,(1–10)
"Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood",2,"T<small>HE SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK OF</small> E<small>XODUS CONCERNED ITSELF WITH SETTING UP THE</small> sacrificial cult of Israel. It therefore set forth the prescriptions for and construction of a sanctuary and the priestly garments, and laid out a ceremony for the investiture of priests. But the description of how sacrifices were to be offered, and for what purpose, is not part of the book, which as edited seems more interested in contrasting the building of a sanctuary with building cities for the Pharaohs, as part of its portrayal of the victory of the biblical God over the gods of Egypt. Although at the end of the book the “Dwelling” is completed, we do not get to see the various sacral rites performed there."
"Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood",3,"Leviticus also delays the ordination of the priests, until Chapter 8, preferring instead to begin with a kind of manual on the offering and disposal of sacrifices. It then moves us from the details of sacrifice into the narrative of the sanctuary’s dedication and opening rites, providing a natural bridge for Part II, in which ritual pollution and purity, the province of priests, is dealt with."
"Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood",4,"The function of the sacrificial cult in ancient Israel will be discussed in “On Animal Sacrifice” below. In general it should be noted that the existence of a class or profession whose job it is to mediate between the divine and human realms is widespread in most older cultures, and the Israelite priesthood, whatever its origins and development, was but one of many such groups in the ancient Near East. It existed, to use the language of Exodus, to “serve” God, maintaining his holiness through ritual and helping to maintain the order of sacred culture which was supposed to mirror God’s ordering of the cosmos. Accordingly, as we will learn later in Leviticus, priests were to be set apart from the general population in a number of areas. There were strict rules about whom they could and could not marry, and they were barred from coming into any contact with the dead, for instance. Their functions extended beyond sacrifice; they could provide oracular advice in times of need, and taught the people “instructions” (Heb. <i>torot</i>) regarding various ritual matters."
"Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood",5,"As part of an overall scheme, there was a conscious parallel between priests as part of a select circle and sacrificial animals—as well as the people of Israel. That is, all three stood at the center of concentric circles dedicated to God; and as one moved out (toward Levite and commoner, animals permitted for eating and those forbidden, and neighbors and foreigners), one got further and further away from the divine. The hierarchy regarding the cult thus reinforced the theme of separation which we have noted above."
"Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood",6,"In the view of Milgrom, Israel’s cult was distinguished from those of its neighbors by its purposefully ignoring the complex web of rituals regarding demons. The sanctuary was to be purged of ritual pollution, not only by semimagical means (the sprinkling of sacrificial blood) but also and primarily by the confession of wrongdoing and the sincere desire to repent. Then, too, the sanctuary, while in most respects resembling shrines elsewhere in the ancient Near East, omitted certain crucial items, most notably statuary representing the gods and a bed for them to rest on. Finally, certain religious rituals were forbidden, such as mutilation of the priests’ bodies. In all these cases, Israel introduced something new into the area of worship."
"Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood",7,"For many decades there has been major and heated debate by scholars in favor of one or the other scheme for following the history of the priesthood and the cult. There are those who view these institutions as stretching back to Israel’s earliest history, while others see strong evidence of a late, possibly even exilic, reworking of the priestly material. Similar arguments dot the landscape of literary criticism of the Torah, in which scholars have tried to divine at what point priestly editors might have put their distinctive stamp on the literature. From Wellhausen in the nineteenth century to Knohl, Milgrom, and Levine in the late twentieth, there has been no lack of theorizing on these issues—and no definitive answers. For the moment we are left to read Leviticus as it is placed in the Torah, with an awareness that a variety of historical and ideological influences are imbedded, if not hidden, in our text."
"On Animal Sacrifice",1,"A<small>LTHOUGH IT APPEARS EARLIER IN THE</small> T<small>ORAH</small>, <small>ANIMAL SACRIFICE RECEIVES ITS FULL</small>est treatment in Leviticus. Besides the opening seven chapters, which are devoted to a relatively brief description of how sacrifices are to be offered and disposed of, many other chapters in the book talk about sacrificial rituals: the installation of the priests (8–9), rules about disposing of the <i>hattat</i> sacrifice (10), purification offerings brought in the event of such “polluting” states as childbirth and skin diseases (12–15), and finally the “scapegoat” ceremony of Chapter 16. They appear in most of the later chapters as well."
"On Animal Sacrifice",2,"What function did sacrifice, particularly of animals, play in the religion of ancient Israel? How could a God who proscribed the murder of human beings (Ex. 20:13, 21:12) countenance the taking of animal life for ritual purposes? To answer these questions, we must turn briefly to some of the commonly proposed theories surrounding sacrifice."
"On Animal Sacrifice",3,"The idea of offering up living creatures to the gods is one of hoary antiquity. Walter Burkert, on the basis of the study of Greek religion, suggests that sacrifice is a means of dealing with guilt over the taking of life. That is, the switch from gathering to hunting society, made possible by technology (the invention of tools), while it raised human accomplishment and consciousness to a new level, also brought with it the acute sense of having violated something essential in the cosmic order. Such guilt is not mitigated by the fact that early people hunted for food and not for pleasure. The way of dealing with the guilt, giving life back to the gods, is in a true sense restoration; life is given back for life taken, so that it may ultimately be renewed (contrast this to the profoundly unecological use of living and inorganic resources over the past “civilized” centuries). And it must be done via ritual. In Burkert’s view, ritual deals with human anxiety by “raising the ante”—by means of increasing anxiety, it is controlled. So guilt over life-taking is assuaged by making a ritual out of the killing, and the shared experience of trauma helps to create solidarity within the group. Despite the subsequent rise of agriculture, says Burkert, the hunting ritual played out in sacrifice could not be done away with, so ingrained had it become, and the rationale behind sacrifices was therefore transformed. Now domesticated animals could be used, giving greater control over the process."
"On Animal Sacrifice",4,"In another approach, De Vaux (1965) postulates three motives for sacrifice. In the first model, that of “gift,” the worshiper brings something of value to the deity. The animal is killed, setting it apart for sacred use; it is burned, turning it into an invisible substance which can rise to the gods. The gift may be for thanksgiving or, more likely, may be to assuage the demonic powers that many societies (especially Mesopotamia, Abraham’s homeland) felt controlled everyday life. Giving establishes reciprocal movement; altruism has no place here (Burkert). One is reminded of the elaborate giving ceremonies among many peoples on occasions such as weddings; giving establishes relationship and maintains the social order."
"On Animal Sacrifice",5,"In addition to gifts, another mode of sacrifice involves communion, as nineteenth-century scholars such as Robertson Smith observed. Here the model of the meal is crucial: humans and gods share a great repast, thereby cementing kinship as surely as the closing of business deals is celebrated by drinks and dinner. Passover, both in the Bible and subsequently (even when the sacrifice per se was no longer involved), may serve as a striking example of the effectiveness of such a paradigm."
"On Animal Sacrifice",6,"A final type or function of sacrifice is atonement or expiation. Here a sin, communal or individual, is purged away by the act of sacrifice; the gods receive life as a substitute for the sinner’s own, which is symbolized by the victim’s blood. The fact that the animals permitted in the Bible for sacrifice are pastoral and hence frequently used metaphorically for the Israelites themselves, is significant in this regard. This approach is further illustrated in the Bible by the end of the Flood story, where God accepts Noah’s sacrifice, implying that he accepts animal life (which now, simultaneous with properly offered sacrifice, is permissible for food) in place of that of humans (Eilberg-Schwartz). It should be noted that, in the Bible, sacrifice for the sake of atonement is almost always in reference to unintentional sins, whereas deliberate wrongdoing may not be atoned for through this system."
"On Animal Sacrifice",7,"Which of these rationales is truly at work in Levitical sacrifice? Actually, at various times one can find all of them—the texts present a variety of motives and occasions for sacrifice in biblical Israel, from thanksgiving to purification and reparation. But in general one may say of Israelite sacrifice, as one may say of much of the ritual in Leviticus, that it is designed primarily to maintain or repair the relationship between God and Israel. Such an understanding helps to explain the unity of the book, as we will see in our discussion of pollution: sacrifice was a crucial element in keeping the covenant, and hence God’s beneficent presence among the Israelites, intact."
"On Animal Sacrifice",8,"The fact that this reconciliation, as it were, takes place against a background of slaughter should not be as upsetting to moderns as it is usually felt to be. In ironic contrast to our mechanized and mass-produced society, where the killing of animals for food takes place at a remove from our consciousness and from our direct participation, the sacrificial system in fact involved worshiper and priest alike, and the symbolic value of the operation, whatever it may have been in specific cases, lay in its directness, in its consciousness of the taking of life. Some would even maintain that in societies where the practice and rationale for sacrifice has broken down, there is inevitably an increase in intrahuman violence (Girard)."

"Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification",1,(11–17)
"Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification",2,"A<small>S</small> I <small>HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTED</small>, L<small>EVITICUS IS LARGELY ABOUT HOW TO KEEP</small> G<small>OD</small>’<small>S</small> earthly realm, and hence his relationship with the people of Israel, viable and “pure” (cf. Greenstein 1985a). Once the book of Exodus ends, with the erection of the Tabernacle—a symbolic reflection of the cosmos in which God “takes up dwelling” among the Israelites—we are left with a structure that must be carefully guarded and its ritual purity maintained. To this end, Leviticus now turns to the issue of pollutants, largely of the body, that arise from what we might call territorial problems: the border of what goes into the body, expressed through animals permitted and forbidden for food; the border between life and death, as expressed through sexual functions and discharges; and the border of outer surfaces, as expressed through skin disease (<i>tzaraat</i>), mildew on clothing, and mold on houses. The system of avoidance and purification that is presented in Chapters 11–15 ensures that the “Holy-Area” will either not become polluted or, should that prove to be unavoidable, will be properly decontaminated, for such contamination has the potential of leading to God’s withdrawal from dwelling “in the midst” of the people of Israel."
"Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification",3,"The pollutants discussed in these chapters do not by and large carry with them punishments per se; that is, they are not regarded as violations of the moral order (although <i>tzaraat</i> in biblical stories often did carry the implication that the victim had in fact done something to deserve his or her condition). Nor do they pose an actual danger to the person—unless he or she comes in contact with holy objects, people, or space. Then it becomes clear that biblical pollution was considered contagious; hence the need for rituals. What was generally required was that the polluted person observe a period of separation from the sanctuary (or, in more extreme cases, from the camp), to be reintegrated after either time alone or with the addition of laundering their clothes and/or washing themselves. In the latter cases, water was seen as acting as a purifying agent, not as cleanser in the detergent sense (and so the word “unclean,” so often used in translating Heb. <i>tamei</i>, is misleading). As before, these processes applied to priests (cf. Chap. 22) and to laypeople alike (Chaps. 12–15). The major pollutant, death, was seen as so virulent that it received treatment in a separate setting, Num. 19."
"Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification",4,"A different category of pollution existed alongside the one we have just mentioned. It included human wrongdoing, which we might call immoral or unjust actions (e.g., incest, oppression of the poor), and also transgression of boundaries (e.g., between holy and profane, or breaching the fairly rigid system of classification in nature among animals, textiles, etc.). These types of pollution, then, involved behavior which can be seen to be disruptive or worse to the established social order. As a rule they could not be atoned for through sacrifice or other ritual forms, but lead to exile or death. They are dealt with mainly in the final section of Leviticus, Chapters 18–26."
"Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification",5,"For a full discussion of the issue of pollution in biblical Israel, see Frymer-Kensky (1983) and Greenstein (1984a)."
"On the Dietary Rules",1,"T<small>HE SUBJECT OF COUNTLESS INTERPRETATIONS OVER THE AGES</small>, <small>THE SYSTEM OF DI</small>etary laws laid down in Lev. 11 is best understood in the broader context of both the structure of the book and of the Levitical worldview. For the former, see the commentary to Chapter 11; for the latter, the following may be helpful."
"On the Dietary Rules",2,"It has long been recognized that seeing the dietary laws as resulting from consciousness of hygiene is a deeply inadequate way of understanding them. Nor can some of the later explanations adduced by Jewish tradition, however noble (for instance, that adhering to such a system teaches self-discipline), provide a satisfactory explanation for the rules in the context of Leviticus. What is more to the point is that the priestly worldview stressed boundaries and order. A hierarchy reigns in virtually every aspect of Israelite life as conceived in the Torah: people, land, animals, eligibility for the priesthood, the Tabernacle, and the calendar. There is a complex system of “graded holiness” (Jenson) informing Israelite life, with two basic messages: (1) God is to be approached in stages, and (2) the world is set up in a tight, ordered structure which reflects the distinctions between God and humans, Israel and the other peoples."
"On the Dietary Rules",3,"It is especially the latter that is at work in the dietary laws. The animals are discussed in categories that are reminiscent of the (priestly) creation story of Genesis 1; note the refrain in both passages of (each animal) “according to its kind.” Lev. 11 makes distinctions, and scholars have sought to understand them according to a number of possible criteria: ease/clarity of classification (anomalies, especially as regards locomotion, tend to be prohibited), whether or not the animal is carnivorous (those that are, are prohibited), and the wild or domestic status of the animal (the former are frequently prohibited). The message that emerges from the scheme is multifaceted. It would appear to hold that:"
"On the Dietary Rules",4,"1. Human activity is to reflect the inherent orderliness of creation, a kind of imitation of God (namely, as he kept things clear at the beginning, you should do the same with what enters your body)."
"On the Dietary Rules",5,"2. The ideal state, already portrayed in the Garden of Eden story, is vegetarianism—where no animal life need be taken by humans (this despite God’s command to Adam to “dominate [the earth]” in Gen. 1:28)."
"On the Dietary Rules",6,"3. Animals permitted for consumption, among them those fit for sacrifice, are by and large those which are familiar to the Israelites in daily life through domestication. They tend to be animals often used by the Bible to symbolize humans. Eilberg-Schwartz calls this phenomenon “Israel in the mirror of nature,” and gives numerous examples extending throughout Israelite culture. He concludes that “the dietary restrictions carve up the animal world along the same lines as Israelite thought … [they] specify what kinds of animals are ‘food for thought.’”"
"On the Dietary Rules",7,"It should be mentioned that Mary Douglas, who pioneered an anthropological approach to these laws three decades ago, has recently given them another go (1993b). In earlier studies, Douglas (1966) saw the system in Lev. 11 as we have indicated above—as a “cognitive ordering of the universe”; she also spoke of it as symbolizing the protection of boundaries in Israelite society. Her latest understanding focuses on the animals as reflective of the idea that (Israelite) culture is aimed at demonstrating God’s righteousness/justice in all areas of life, through laws regarding the body. Thus, priests, sacrificial animals, and food animals may not have any “blemish” (below, “defect”) in them; and animals prohibited for eating are either the perpetrators or victims of predation (symbolizing the human perpetrators or victims of injustice)."
"On the Dietary Rules",8,"A final point relates to a major theme in Leviticus and indeed in many of the priestly texts of the Torah: separateness. We have seen how a major function in God’s creation of the world—with which the Bible opens!—is “separating” aspects of the natural world. A parallel verb was used in the plague narratives of Exodus, “making a distinction” (between Israelites and Egyptians). With the dietary regulations, “separating” returns. Given these thematics, one can say that Chapter 11 is a linchpin of priestly thinking. Like sexual relations, the other area of intimacy in human affairs, eating in the Bible goes far beyond the confines of one’s home and comes to symbolize an entire approach to life."
"On the Ritual Pollution of the Body",1,"O<small>F SPECIAL CONCERN TO THE COMPILERS OF LEVITICUS WAS RITUAL POLLUTION ARIS</small>ing from certain physical conditions. To many people, this section is even less interesting than the opening chapters of the book, and seems impossibly bogged down in primitive conceptions of disease and hygiene. But despite the fact that they undoubtedly reflect some ancient conceptions in these areas, these conditions and the role of the priest in making rulings on them have less to do with hygiene and medicine than they do with maintaining the borders between life and death, and symbolically affirming life."
"On the Ritual Pollution of the Body",2,"It seems that the polluting discharges are primarily sexual in nature, and this is probably not accidental. The biblical priests, in their extreme concern with both procreation/genealogy (especially of men, since the priesthood was male-hereditary) and purity (in approaching the sanctuary), were presented with a major problem. God, who was to be served in purity, was also the One in whose image human beings were made (Gen. 1:26), yet as a being beyond sexuality, who had neither relationships with other deities nor even a body. He left it ambiguous as to just how humans were to work out their sexual relations. The answer to the dilemma is at least partly solved by the Torah’s regulations regarding pollution and purity, incest and marriage. It is here that the issue of control is most significant. Eilberg-Schwartz points out that control and boundaries apply not only to Israel and the nations, but also and especially to male and female. As a male hierarchy, the priests viewed women, with their closer connections to the life process (and maybe also to previous forms of paganism in the form of goddess worship), as potentially dangerous, or at least problematic, to their system of purity. The seeming “disorder” of women’s discharges (perhaps representing “nature”) threatened the imposition of order (“culture”) that is so central to priestly thinking. But as a group concerned with the perpetuation of both the priestly class and the people of Israel, the priestly class could not do without women altogether, and the inescapable conclusion was strict regulation (cf. also Wegner 1992). Such regulation—labeling certain states or acts “polluting”—had the added benefit of controlling private morality in a way that could not be done otherwise (Douglas 1966)."
"On the Ritual Pollution of the Body",3,"It is important to note that in classical Judaism after the year 70 (the date of the destruction of the Second Temple), the “purity” laws, while still assiduously studied, by and large ceased to operate except within the sphere of marriage. Thus, to this day, religious Jewish couples temporarily separate sexually during the wife’s period, but this by itself does not legally affect her participation in traditional ritual. The disease here termed <i>tzaraat</i>, translated for millennia as “leprosy,” is now recognized to be something different, perhaps several forms of skin disease involving scaling or flaking. These have nowhere near the frightening and fatal implications of classic leprosy (Hansen’s Disease). Leviticus nevertheless treats <i>tzaraat</i> at great length and in close detail. Here, perhaps more than anywhere else in the book, it is clear that at least parts of Leviticus were originally intended as manuals for priestly “instruction” (note, by the way, the sevenfold occurrence of the term in the pollution chapters, 11–15). It has been theorized that <i>tzaraat</i> is of such concern here because it was felt to resemble death/decay in a clear, outward fashion, and hence fits into these chapters, which deal so much with boundaries."
"On the Ritual Pollution of the Body",4,"An unexpected addition, from a contemporary point of view, to the <i>tzaraat</i> of the body is that which appears on textiles and on house walls (a fungus or mold or “dry rot”). The fact that the same word is used to apply to all these situations indicates that a wide concept is being applied here: how visible imperfection damages the utopia of the sacred society."
"On the Ritual Pollution of the Body",5,"Finally, the role of the priest in these chapters should be noted. He does not function to remove demons or perform magical rites, but rather to examine the one suspected of having the disease (note the repetition of “look” in the chapter). He is more teacher and guardian of purity than healer or intermediary."
"Part III; Holiness",1,(18–26)
"Part III; Holiness",2,"T<small>HE ADDITION OF</small> C<small>HAPTERS 18–26 CHANGES THE NATURE OF THE BOOK BEFORE US</small>. I<small>T</small> accomplishes this, not by introducing something entirely new into biblical thinking, but by broadening the base of God’s words to Moshe in Leviticus. In this book we have already encountered the “Holy-Shrine,” “holy-things,” “holy donations,” and the like; we have seen that Israel is to be “separate” from the nations around it in a variety of life areas. But now we move toward expansion of what was called for at the first moments at Sinai: for Israel to be a “[kingdom of priests and a] holy nation” (Ex. 19:6)."
"Part III; Holiness",3,"While the exact structure and setting of the Holiness Code, as these chapters were designated a century ago, are subject to scholarly debate, its thrust seems clear enough. Beginning with sexual relations, Israel is to be “holy,” “separate” from other nations. Holiness here has a connotation of wholeness and perfection; Wright (1992) has defined it as “that which is consistent with God and his character.”"
"Part III; Holiness",4,"<i>Imitatio dei</i>, the human urge to be godlike, is an ancient, undoubtedly prehistoric one. We long to be linked with the primal powers of existence, whose rush we feel at heightened moments of <i>perception</i>, but whose perfection is always out of reach in the flesh and blood world of human beings. The Torah, in contrast, presents the longing for perfection and wholeness as properly expressed through a discipline of <i>behavior</i> in all areas of life, personal and communal. The central lines “Holy are you to be, / for holy am I, YHWH your God” (19:2) are followed by line after line calling for holiness in worship, agriculture, interpersonal relations, business, the treatment of the disabled and the elderly, court procedure, and sexuality, to list some of the areas covered."
"Part III; Holiness",5,"Many communities of the “elect,” from Qumran at the Dead Sea to medieval monasteries, and many individuals, from biblical Nazirites (Num. 6) to Sufi mystics and St. Francis, have sought to create lives suffused with holiness; one could easily maintain that many of the mainstream forms and ideas in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have remained wedded to this approach. They all owe a debt, one way or the other, to Lev. 18–26, especially in the communal sphere. Rarely has the drive toward holiness found as full expression in a vision of “real life” society, grounded in the everyday world of people and institutions, as it does in the texts to be found in the following chapters."
"Part III; Holiness",6,"For many decades, debate has raged within the scholarly community as to the date and setting of H, the putative stratum of literature to which these chapters belong. As of this writing there is still not full agreement on (a) whether H was indeed a separate document or school, and (b) whether its origin and influence can be easily traced (cf., for instance, Knohl, and Milgrom 1993). These disagreements, however, should not and must not detract from the importance of what we have in these chapters: a significant statement of the ethical code of ancient Israel which continues to speak to contemporary problems."

"On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure",2,"T<small>HE READER WHO APPROACHES THE BOOK OF</small> N<small>UMBERS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ITS</small> common Hebrew name, <i>Bemidbar</i>, “In the Wilderness,” will logically expect a narrative account of the wanderings of the Israelites before they reach the Promised Land. But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations."
"On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure",3,"It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern)."
"On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure",4,"The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history."
"On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure",5,"Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:"

"On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure",46,"In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them."
"On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure",47,"With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival."
"On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure",48,"The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy."
"On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure",49,"Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part."
"On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure",50,"As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph."
"On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure",51,"The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25."
"On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure",52,"It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."
"Part I; The Wilderness Camp",1,(1–10)
"Part I; The Wilderness Camp",2,"T<small>O LIST IS TO DEMONSTRATE A SENSE OF ORDER AND CONTROL</small>. T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> Numbers commences with several lists that serve to arrange and catalog the Israelite camp in the wilderness: first, the “accountings” of the Israelites fit for battle; then, the symmetrical arrangement of the camp itself, around the Tabernacle; and finally, the special listing of the Levite population, accompanied by an enumeration of its special tasks in the camp. The first part of Numbers thus takes place as it were in the shadow of Mount Sinai—that is, under the aegis of the priestly school of thinking, in which order is everything."
"Part I; The Wilderness Camp",3,"There is a strong military bent to the arrangement. The census of Chapter 1 is not a head count of the entire Israelite population, but rather of those “twenty years of age and upward,” those eligible to serve in the army. The setup of the camp resembles that in ancient Egypt, with the sanctuary and ark (here “Dwelling” and “coffer”) in the center (in the Egypt of Raamses II—thought by some to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus—it was the king’s throne). The Levites, whom we have not encountered previously as a group with tasks distinct from those of the priests, emerge in this part of the book as caretakers and perhaps guardians of the sanctuary, in addition to their tasks of dismantling and transport of the “Holy-Shrine.” This military aspect reflects an ancient concept of Israel as the “forces of Y<small>HWH</small>,” surely a conquest image, which later becomes standardized in language in the phrase usually rendered “the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.”"
"Part I; The Wilderness Camp",4,"Some of the material in this section might well have been put elsewhere. Chapters 5–7 would have fit nicely in Leviticus; Chapter 7, the listing of the tribal gifts brought to the sanctuary upon its dedication, could even have followed Ex. 40, where Moshe completes the erection of the structure. That these chapters are here therefore must be the result of a conscious decision, either to include material that did not find its way into the other books, or out of a feeling that they were appropriately placed in the book about Israel’s wanderings in the wilderness."
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",1,(11–25)
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",2,"V<small>IRTUALLY THE FIRST THING THE</small> I<small>SRAELITES DO AFTER SETTING OUT ON THE SECOND</small> leg of their journey to the Promised Land is—rebel. This pattern was already seen in the book of Exodus, where, despite the climactic miracle of deliverance at the Sea of Reeds, the Israelites “grumbled against Moshe” at Mara because of lack of drinkable water. Although a strain in later biblical thinking remembered the wilderness period as a kind of honeymoon (cf. Jer. 2:2), the Torah itself chose to remember it as a severe time of testing which the ex-slaves ultimately failed to pass."
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",3,"The second part of Numbers is a remarkable collection of rebellion narratives that simultaneously display striking similarities and great and colorful differences. The section details six rebellions of the people, and two of the leaders themselves. They are united by a consistent vocabulary: verbs such as “grumble” and “assemble/gather/speak against” depict complaints against Moshe and Aharon and against God. These stories also display the recurring themes of dearth of food and water, and God’s anger at the rebellions, usually expressed in some form of plague (or, additionally, fire)."
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",4,"Rather than unfold in simple chronological order, one following another, these pieces of the text have been intensified by priestly editing, which has interspersed the stories with a number of cultic and legal passages (Chaps. 15, 18, and 19, all of which bear the theme word “law” [Heb. <i>hok</i> or <i>hukka</i>]), and which are somehow related to previous or succeeding narratives. The interruptions also allow each of the memorable rebellion narratives to “breathe,” giving the audience time to digest the images and the drama presented therein. The stories possess both in abundant measure; one thinks, for instance, of the “meat between the teeth” (11:33), of the grape clusters borne on a pole by two men (13:23); and of the great confrontation with Korah in Chapter 16 (not to mention its resolution), as well as Moshe’s dramatic failure in Chapter 20."
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",5,"As in any great literature, repetition of story type or type scene is here accomplished via variation of the most telling kind. In this case we observe once again an alternating pattern to the rebellions, a pattern which reveals not one theme but several:"
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",6,"The people, over lack of food (chapter 11)"
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",7,"Moshe’s siblings, over prophetic primacy (12)"
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",8,"The people, over the spies’ false report (14)"
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",9,"Levites, over Moshe and Aharon’s prerogatives (16)"
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",10,"The people, over the rebellious Levites’ sinister fate (17)"
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",11,"Moshe himself, over the burden of leading the people (20)"
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",12,"The people, over the lack of food and water (21)"
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",13,"The pattern observable here is broken, in true biblical rhetorical style (where the last in a sequence often serves by its oddness to reinforce the whole), in a final rebellion (Chap. 25), where the people’s actions involve neither the “complaining” vocabulary nor a revolt against human leadership, but rather comprise the greatest biblical crime of them all: worship of other gods. Viewed in this patterned fashion, the rebellion narratives emerge with a kind of crescendo effect."
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",14,"It is also possible, as I have done in “On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure,” above, to follow the scheme put forth by Mann—a three-part structure to the section, each with its internal logic and conclusions. These are treated below; for the moment, it will suffice to see in the first subsection (Chaps. 11–14) the inevitable result of wilderness rebellions: the divine decree that the slave generation must die out before entering the Promised Land; the second subsection (16–20) deals with the challenges to the leadership of Moshe and Aharon, and results in a similar decree, that they will die outside the land; and the third subsection (20–25) chronicles the encounter of the Israelites with neighboring nations, which initially goes in their favor but ends with the disastrous incident at Baal Pe’or (25)."
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",15,"The primary issue in these stories, to the biblical writer, is lack of trust in God. Each of the three sections mentions or implies that problem; 14:11 and 20:12 use the verb itself, and the narrative of Chapter 25 suggests it. The bottom line is that the Israelites could not keep faith with God—even after both staggering acts of divine intervention (i.e., rescue) and demonstrations of the force of divine wrath—and this lack of faith led ultimately to their dying out in the wilderness outside the Promised Land, in punishment. The stories clearly were meant to be understood as an unfortunate example for later generations, and were taken as such already in the biblical period (see, for example, the treatment in Psalm 78)."
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",16,"Read on another level, the rebellion narratives are largely concerned with the issue of human leadership, its qualifications, manifestations, and limitations (and even failures). Has there ever been a leader as beleaguered as Moshe? From the beginning of his career on the sands of Egypt, where he assumes the mantle of leadership in the matter of retaliating against the sadistic Egyptian taskmaster (Ex. 2:11–12), to its end at the plains of Moab, in stern address to the people he has struggled to lead (this is the setting of the entire next book, Deuteronomy), he must evoke trust in God, lead the people through an uncharted wilderness, and inspire confidence in his own leadership. His success is muted by the passing of the generation he initially leads, before it can enter Canaan; like them, he too must pass on—with merely a look beyond the Jordan, but no more. Later generations of Jewish readers wept on confronting Moshe’s seemingly premature death, and created heroic tales of his pleading before God to be let into the land he had so long sought to reach. In Numbers he fully deserves this stature, alternately interceding with and cajoling God, standing up for and then almost giving up on this people with whom his life has become so enmeshed. Our stories stress his gifts of prophecy and his pathos as a deeply human leader."
"Part II; The Rebellion Narratives",17,"A final, troubling issue is the character of God in this part of the book. It is a measure of the Bible’s artistry that the rebellion accounts are so varied in content and style; but the variations in punishment—from undetailed death to skin disease to stoning and the earth opening up, just to mention a few examples—create an impression, not of artistic richness but of unremitting severity. The Bible does not seem to have a problem with this kind of divine behavior, and other ancient cultures would have felt at home here, but already in late antiquity, and continuing down to our own day, Jews and Christians most often have preferred, and prayed to, a more forgiving, nurturing, and compassionate God. Dealing with these texts, in the end, raises the question of whether to understand them as the result of “historical necessity” or “literary conceit” (that is, the old generation simply had to die out) or as they stand in the text: a harsh portrayal of what happened when the covenant people violated the covenant."
"Part III; The Preparations for Conquest",1,(26–36)
"Part III; The Preparations for Conquest",2,"T<small>HE LAST PART OF</small> N<small>UMBERS IS WHAT THE READER MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED ALL ALONG</small>: a collection of materials that deal directly with the upcoming conquest of Canaan. It is concerned, then, with the transfer of leadership from Moshe to Yehoshua (Joshua); with provisions for two and a half tribes to remain on the east bank of the Jordan River, as long as they take part in the impending invasion; with listing the entire route of the Israelites, from Egypt to the plains of Moab; and with the borders of the land to be conquered."
"Part III; The Preparations for Conquest",3,"As has been the case earlier in the book, however, other material intervenes: a theme and variation doublet on the inheritance of land in a case where a man leaves daughters, not sons; two chapters on what sacrifices are to be brought on holy days; a section on vows taken by women; war with Midyan and the precise apportioning of spoils, both to warriors and to the sanctuary; and the law regarding accidental homicide, in which family vengeance is circumvented by the existence of “safe” Levite towns to which the manslayer may flee."
"Part III; The Preparations for Conquest",4,"The inconsistent thematics may again be explained by the intrusion of an editorial hand, again by priestly interests. In Levine’s view, most of Chapters 25–36 function to establish matters of importance in the priestly view, just as in Chapters 1–10. Here law takes precedence over narrative."
"Part III; The Preparations for Conquest",5,"Despite the varied subject matter of this section, it holds together structurally, via the common biblical technique of word (sound) repetition. The rather common verb <i>tzivvah</i>, “command,” weaves through every one of Chapters 26–36, except for 33. Sometimes it introduces what God wants the Israelites to do; sometimes it leads to the formula of fulfillment, “as YHWH commanded the Children of Israel, so they did”; still other times it refers to a command given by Moshe himself. The entire section begins with the verb (26:4), and ends with it as well (36:13). In addition, the chapters most far afield, 28–29 (taken as a unit) and 30, begin and end with it. Whether this was a conscious technique by redactors is hard to say, but its existence is striking."
"Part III; The Preparations for Conquest",6,"Another structural device, that of framing, also occurs in this part of the book: after the introductory census (Chap. 26), the rest is built between two brackets, each involving the daughters of Tzelofhad, and each opening with the verb “to come-near” (27:1 and 36:1). So despite the wide-ranging material, some sense of unity has been imposed upon it."
"Part III; The Preparations for Conquest",7,"Finally, there is the key occurrence, for the book of Numbers, of more lists, from census to holiday sacrifices, from stops along the journey to the precise borders of the Promised Land. We are in the presence of order once again."
"Part III; The Preparations for Conquest",8,"What remains lacking at the end of the book is exactly what Deuteronomy supplies: a final exhortation from Moshe, which includes reiteration and further clarification of the laws, a public covenant ceremony, Moshe’s long blessing of the people, and the account of his death and burial. If added here, these topics might have tipped the scales of Numbers, which has given us almost too much to digest as it is; as the Torah has come down to us, they are more appropriately treated in the expansive and majestic rhetorical setting of Deuteronomy."

"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",1,(1-34)
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",2,"D<small>EUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE</small> literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",3,"An ancient name for Deuteronomy, <i>mishne tora</i>—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.”"
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",4,"From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",5,"The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",6,"Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",7,"Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books)."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",8,"But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright,"
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",9,the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were.
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",10,"It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",11,"That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 <small>B.C.E.</small>) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",12,It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.”
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",13,"The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the L<small>ORD</small>.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the L<small>ORD</small> for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the L<small>ORD</small> … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version)"
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",14,"What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king"
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",15,"directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the L<small>ORD</small>. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the L<small>ORD</small>, to follow the L<small>ORD</small>, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3)"
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",16,"The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",17,"The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",18,"The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",19,"In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century <small>B.C.E.</small>, which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",20,"Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process)."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",21,"Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of <i>one God</i> for <i>one people</i> in <i>one land</i> observing <i>one cult</i>” (italics his)."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",22,"Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines:"

"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",37,D   The End (34)
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",38,"A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God."
"On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure",39,"It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
"Part I; Historical Overview",1,(1:1–4:43)
"Part I; Historical Overview",2,"I<small>N THIS INTRODUCTORY SECTION, WHICH SOME SCHOLARS HAVE VIEWED AS A LATER</small> addition to the core of the book, Moshe reviews the journey of the Israelites from Mount Sinai (“Horev”) into the Negev, and from there up east of the Dead Sea to a spot opposite Jericho. Two things make this more than a mere itinerary: First, Moshe confines himself to the most important moments—the choosing of leaders, the sending of the spies (with all its disastrous consequences), the encounters with various nations, and the provisions made for the soon-to-occur conquest. Second, the text characterizes itself, not as a narrative per se, but as an “explanation” (1:5) of the “Instruction.” In other words, history is made to function as lesson here. That the account ends with Bet (Baal) Pe’or in 3:29 is surely not accidental; as 4:3 reminds us, this was the site of Israel’s great apostasy, the final negative act by a wayward generation that was not to live to enter the land of Israel. By means of this introduction, the new generation is warned about the failings of the old, and begins to be prepared for “entering and taking-possession of the land” promised to their ancestors (4:1)."
"Part I; Historical Overview",3,"The first four chapters of the book establish its character as a link: by recounting key events in Israel’s wanderings, they summarize the narratives of Exodus and Numbers; by demonstrating that disaster resulted from the people’s rebellions, they set the ideology that will permeate the so-called Deuteronomistic History, namely the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings (Nelson)."
"Part I; Historical Overview",4,"It should be realized that these chapters are not merely previous narratives repeated verbatim. They are in fact reworkings of earlier material, often with changes. Thus, to use Brettler’s example, 1:9–18 retells Ex. 18:13–26, with the change that this time, as Moshe appoints lower-level leadership for the people, he does so without his father-in-law Yitro (who had helped in the Exodus version), and chooses them on the basis of their capabilities (“wisdom”), not their piety. Brettler also points to the frequent use of the phrase “at that time” as an indicator of later additions to the text. For a comprehensive discussion of how these opening chapters differ from earlier accounts, see Tigay."
"Part II; Opening Exhortation",1,(4:44–11:32)
"Part II; Opening Exhortation",2,"T<small>HIS SECTION OF</small> D<small>EUTERONOMY IS A LONG PERSONAL AND EMOTIONAL PLEA ON BE</small>-half of the leader. Its rhetoric has become famous, as have several passages noted below. It is in this section that Moshe appears in his most classic Deuteronomistic mode, urging the people on to follow God’s rules and warning them against violating the covenant."
"Part II; Opening Exhortation",3,"Recurring phrases in the section include “Hearken O Israel,” “And now, O Israel,” “When I bring you into the land …,” and “take-care.” In addition, the word “love,” which as noted above carries the connotation of “loyalty,” is important in these speeches."
"Part II; Opening Exhortation",4,"After a brief geographical introduction in vv.44–49, which parallels the opening of the book and which, in the eyes of many, once served as the book’s actual beginning, the section presents a version of the so-called Ten Commandments, and a short recapitulation of the circumstances surrounding their being given on Sinai. In that sense, Chapter 5 is a continuation of the historical overview of the beginning of the book."
"Part II; Opening Exhortation",5,"Another famous passage here is in Chapter 6, where Israel is enjoined to “love” God, warned about what will happen if they abandon him, and given a kind of script as answer to their children’s future question, “What (mean) the precepts, the laws and the regulations that Y<small>HWH</small> your God has commanded you?” (v.20)."
"Part II; Opening Exhortation",6,"Other important themes appear in these speeches. Israel is defined as a people that is not to intermarry with the indigenous peoples of Canaan; as a people chosen, not for its military power or large population, but because God “loved” them, and because he could not abide the Canaanites’ behavior. To prove his point that Israel possesses no inherent superiority, Moshe turns again to history, and retells the story of the Molten Calf (Ex. 32–34)."
"Part II; Opening Exhortation",7,"He ends (in Chap. 11) by reiterating the motif of God’s power and hence his ability to reward faithfulness with the gift of the good land. Israel is promised blessing and not curse, provided that they “take-care to observe” the laws which are now to be set before them."
"Part III; The Terms of the Covenant",1,(12–28)
"Part III; The Terms of the Covenant",2,"A<small>fter lengthy exhortation we are brought at last to the heart of Deu-</small> teronomy. Just as its corresponding Exodus section, Chapters 19–24, stands at the center of that book, and Gen. 22, Lev. 19, and Num. 19–20 place dramatic narratives or important laws at their core, the laws that we now encounter focus our attention on the object of Moshe’s main concern in Deut. 1–11 and 27–30: the “covenant” or pact between God and Israel. Israel is to demonstrate its love or loyalty to God by “taking-care to observe” the laws, and binds itself in a ceremony, at least in descriptive form, at the end of the section."
"Part III; The Terms of the Covenant",3,"The subject matter of this long collection forms an interesting contrast to both the Covenant Code of Exodus (in the chapters just referred to) and other law collections in the ancient Near East. The Exodus material contains much that deals with property and damages, whereas Deuteronomy appears to focus more heavily on criminal and moral issues. Although neighboring civilizations had legal literature that parallels many of the cases before us (cf. Hallo for a discussion), Deuteronomy’s particular emphases suggest a shift away from personal property as the central area of society’s concern (Greenberg 1970). In addition, the biblical text here (as previously in the book) is generally cast in the second person singular, giving it a highly personal edge, and there is a higher percentage of “motive clauses”—explanations or justifications for the laws—than in other Near Eastern law codes. Sonsino has noted a strong similarity between the language of these chapters and the thrust of biblical “wisdom literature” such as the book of Proverbs; thus a major function of the material may well be didactic and not legal per se. This, interestingly, puts Deuteronomy more squarely within its Near Eastern setting; Fishbane (1988) characterizes both sets of systems as “stylized collections of typical cases.”"
"Part III; The Terms of the Covenant",4,"Yet he also argues that whatever the original purpose of the laws in Chapters 12–26, they came already within the biblical period itself to be seen as actual “legislative texts,” and as such, subject to later interpretation much as any law code might spawn (this multiple function of the laws was noted by Weinfeld 1972a). In this connection it is clear that new attitudes have been adopted and changes made in specific cases. It is usually accepted that Deuteronomy has introduced a markedly humanistic tone into Israel’s legal system; in Weinfeld’s words (1993):"
"Part III; The Terms of the Covenant",5,"… the author’s purpose was not to produce a civil-law book like the book of the covenant, treating of pecuniary matters, but to set forth a code of laws securing the protection of the individual and particularly of those persons in need of protection."
"Part III; The Terms of the Covenant",6,Some of the changes from earlier laws are noted in the Commentary and Notes below.
"Part III; The Terms of the Covenant",7,"Nelson has divided the laws into the following sections: Purity in Worship (12:1–14:21); Life in the New Land (14:22–16:17); The Structures of Society (16:18–20:20); and Interpreting Traditional Laws (21:1–26:19). In his view, the changes introduced into Israel’s legal culture are responses to changes in Israelite society, whether economic, political, or religious—changes that may well reflect the monarchic period. The attempt to find a logical pattern to the structure of the laws, however, does not always succeed. Levinson has shown how a better understanding of the sequencing of the laws may be found in the principle of response to the centralization of worship, the event that historically may have accompanied Deuteronomy’s promulgation. In this scheme, 12:1–16:17 is above all a response to how centralization affected the cultic (sacrifical worship) sphere, and 16:18–17:13 to how judicial process was similarly affected. At the same time, these changes appear to be woven into older material."
"Part III; The Terms of the Covenant",8,"The phrase “And Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying: / Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them: …,” so common in the legal and cultic sections of Leviticus and Numbers, does not appear here. Neither does it appear in the Covenant Code; but in the context of Deuteronomy, the absence of the phrase supports the emphasis on Moshe as the central figure (in Exodus the legal portions are followed by the Tabernacle instructions, which indeed use the quoted formula)."
"Part III; The Terms of the Covenant",9,"Chapter 12 begins with “These are the laws and the regulations that you are to take-care to observe”; Chapter 28 ends with “These are the words of the covenant ….” As in Exodus, the laws are the terms of the covenant, not merely a set of rules to be followed. This is further supported by the framework into which these chapters have been placed. The first two parts of the book serve as a classic ancient Near Eastern introduction to a treaty, with their historical look back. In addition, the section ends with both a covenant ceremony (Chap. 27) and a series of blessings and curses (28), also typical in this genre. So far from being merely a dry list of laws, the core of Deuteronomy, with its reasoned tone and wide-ranging scope, serves both as a summing-up and as a basis for Israel’s life on the land. No wonder, then, that the exiles returning from Babylonia under Persian rule in the sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small> and later came to view the Torah as a real constitution."
"Part III; The Terms of the Covenant",10,"<img src=""images/Art_P11.jpg"" alt=""art""/>"
"Part III; The Terms of the Covenant",11,<i>Deut. 32:48–50</i> Now Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe … /Go up these heights … and see the land of Canaan…/You are to die on the mountain that you are going up …
"Part IV; Concluding Exhortation",1,(29–30)
"Part IV; Concluding Exhortation",2,"T<small>HE FIRST TWO PARTS OF</small> D<small>EUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE</small> third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity."
"Part IV; Concluding Exhortation",3,"This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
"Part V; Final Matters",1,(31–34)
"Part V; Final Matters",2,"A<small>S THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG</small> (E<small>XODUS THROUGH</small> D<small>euteronomy</small>) <small>ACCOUNT OF WAN</small>derings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping."
"Part V; Final Matters",3,"There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis."
"Part V; Final Matters",4,"This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36:"
"Part V; Final Matters",5,Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia:
"Part V; Final Matters",6,"Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth;"
