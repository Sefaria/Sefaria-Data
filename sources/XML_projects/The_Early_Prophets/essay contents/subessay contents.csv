 I: the Primeval History,Genesis 1:1-2:25,God as Creator,Genesis 1:1-2:4,1,"Three principal themes emerge from the great creation account with which Genesis opens. The first is the total and uncompromised power of God as creator; the second, the intrinsic order and balance of the created world; and the third, humankind’s key position in the scheme of creation. These themes are brought home as much by the form in which they are presented as by their actual mention."
 I: the Primeval History,Genesis 1:1-2:25,God as Creator,Genesis 1:1-2:4,2,"God (Heb. <i>elohim</i>, a generic term) is introduced into the narrative without any description of origins, sex, or limitations of power. As the only functioning character of the chapter, he occupies center stage. There is no opposition, no resistance to his acts of creation, which occur in perfect harmony with his express word."
 I: the Primeval History,Genesis 1:1-2:25,God as Creator,Genesis 1:1-2:4,3,"As a sign of both God’s total control and his intent, the world unfolds in symmetrical order. The division of God’s labor into six days, plus a seventh for rest, itself indicates a powerful meaningfulness at work, as well as providing the external structure for the narrative. Interpreters have tended to divide these into either three groups of two days or two groups of three, with always the same results: a balanced and harmonious whole. In addition, the number seven is significant (as it will be elsewhere in the Bible) as a symbol of perfection, not only in Israel but in the ancient world in general."
 I: the Primeval History,Genesis 1:1-2:25,God as Creator,Genesis 1:1-2:4,4,"The narrative uses several repeating words and phrases to both unify the story and underscore the theme of order. These include “God said,” “Let there be…,” “God saw that it was good,” “It was so,” and “There was setting, there was dawning. …”"
 I: the Primeval History,Genesis 1:1-2:25,God as Creator,Genesis 1:1-2:4,5,"<img src=""images/Art_P1.jpg"" alt=""art""/>"
 I: the Primeval History,Genesis 1:1-2:25,God as Creator,Genesis 1:1-2:4,6,"The text is so formed as to highlight the creation of humankind. Although in each previous day “God said” is the keynote, suggesting forethought as well as action, here (v.26) God fully spells out his intentions, as it were, thinking out loud. Humanity, created in the divine “image,” is to hold sway over the rest of creation. Only with the addition of humankind is God able to survey his newly formed world and to pronounce it “exceedingly good” (v.31)."
 I: the Primeval History,Genesis 1:1-2:25,God as Creator,Genesis 1:1-2:4,7,"At least two motifs appear in this chapter which will become important later in Genesis. The three occurrences of “blessing” (1:22, 1:28, 2:3) point to a central idea in the Patriarchal stories. In addition the concept of order and its logical conclusion—that history makes sense—figures prominently in the familial histories of the book. This is accomplished largely by the meaningful use of numbers, as above."
 I: the Primeval History,Genesis 1:1-2:25,God as Creator,Genesis 1:1-2:4,8,"The entire account concludes (2:1–3) with a tightly structured poem. “God,” “the seventh day,” “work,” and “made” are mentioned three times, “finished,” “ceased,” and “all” twice; and “created” returns, echoing 1:1, to round out the whole creation narrative."
 I: the Primeval History,Genesis 1:1-2:25,God as Creator,Genesis 1:1-2:4,9,"The postscript (2:4a; some scholars align it with what follows in Chap. 2 instead) introduces the key structural phrase of Genesis, “These are the begettings.…” It may also indicate the polemical intent of the creation story. Rosenzweig understood the verse to contrast “begetting,” i.e., sexual creation as it occurs in non-Israelite myths, with the “true” creation."
 I: the Primeval History,Genesis 1:1-2:25,God as Creator,Genesis 1:1-2:4,10,"In that vein, a final word needs to be said about extrabiblical evidence. As has often been pointed out, Gen. I is unmistakably reacting against prevailing Near Eastern cosmogonies of the time. Most of the cultures surrounding ancient Israel had elaborate creation stories, highlighting the birth, sexuality, and violent uprisings of the gods. As we indicated at the outset, the concept of God presented here militates against such ideas, arguing chiefly out of omission and silence. (It should also be noted that in poetic books such as Isaiah, Job, and Psalms, a tradition about violent conflict at creation has been preserved.) The Genesis narrative has taken such old mythological motifs as battles with the primeval (female) waters or with sea monsters and eliminated or neutralized them. What remains is both utterly simple and radical in its time."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Call and the Journey,Genesis 12:1-9,1,"The Avraham cycle begins decisively, with a command from God to leave the past behind and go to an unnamed land. Prominent in this speech, clearly, is the concept of blessing, which will be realized by the gifts of land (Canaan) and seed (Yitzhak, the son)."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Call and the Journey,Genesis 12:1-9,2,"The classic mythological motif of the journey, where the hero meets such dangers as monsters and giants, has here been avoided. All that the text wishes us to know about is God’s speech and Avram’s immediate obedience; as in Chap. 22, all other details of the actual trip have been omitted."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Wife—I,Genesis 12:10-20,1,Almost immediately upon his arrival in the promised land Avram is forced to leave it. It will be his son Yitzhak’s task to remain there on a more permanent basis.
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Wife—I,Genesis 12:10-20,2,This is the first of three such stories which are practically identical (see Chaps. 20 and 26). All pose a challenge for the interpreter. An honored man of God seeks to save his own skin by passing his wife off as his sister; in each case the Patriarch emerges safely and with increased wealth.
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Wife—I,Genesis 12:10-20,3,"Speiser has tried to use the analogy of Hurrian (i.e., from Harran) law in which a wife can be elevated to the status of “sister” as one element in the expansion of her status. The legal background, however, is unclear and may not be decisive here. Coming as it does after God’s promise to biologically found “a great nation” (v.2) through Avram, the story in its first version is probably best understood as an example of God’s protection not only of the key male figure, but of the Matriarch as well. Harming Sarai, or even the threat of violating her sexuality, brings with it divine punishment. In addition the story also enables Avram to expand his wealth—itself a sign of God’s favor and the Patriarch’s importance or “weightiness” (see Polzin 1975)."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,Lot; The Land,Genesis 13:1-18,1,"We return to the theme of the land. Not for the last time, Avram’s nephew Lot is used as a foil. Their “parting” shows how Lot makes a bad choice—the “wicked and sinful” area of Sedom and Amora—while Avram settles “in the land of Canaan,” which had been promised to him. From here (vv.14ff.), Avram is given God’s twofold promise again, with that of descendants being spelled out more vividly this time."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,Lot; The Land,Genesis 13:1-18,2,This section is linked to the previous one by the repetition of the phrase “he and his wife and all that was his.”
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,War and Rescue,Genesis 14:1-24,1,"Abruptly Avram is presented in a new light: that of successful warrior (see Muffs). Consistent with his character as we will come to know it, he stands by his kinsman, acts intrepidly, and refuses the spoils of war. Equally important, he is respected by foreigners, a theme that will return both in Genesis and later. Perhaps this very different story has been included here as part of the early sections of the cycle in order to establish Avram’s status and stature. He is no longer merely a wanderer but well on the road to becoming a powerful local figure."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,War and Rescue,Genesis 14:1-24,2,"Whether the events described in this chapter are historical or part of an elaborate symbolic or mythical scheme has been the subject of debate among biblical scholars. The issue, barring unexpected archeological finds, is likely to remain unsolved."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,War and Rescue,Genesis 14:1-24,3,"The story is constructed around a geographical framework, using the formula “—that is now <i>x</i>—” to identify older sites for a contemporary audience. The one place which is <i>not</i> identified, the “Shalem” of verse 18, may well be Jerusalem. If so, this would substantiate the city’s claim to holiness. Historically it was not conquered until King David’s reign in the tenth century <small>B.C.E.</small>"
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Covenant between the Pieces,Genesis 15:1-21,1,"Amid scenes of great drama and almost mystery, a number of significant motifs are presented: (1) Avram’s expressions of doubt that God will keep his promise about descendants (thus heightening the tension and final miracle of Yitzhak’s birth); (2) the linking of the Patriarch to the event of the Exodus centuries later; and (3) the “cutting” of a covenant, in a manner well known in the ancient world. This last motif, especially with its setting of “great darkness” and “night-blackness,” takes Avram far beyond the earlier figure of Noah into a special and fateful relationship with God."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Firstborn Son,Genesis 16:1-16,1,"In the face of Sarai’s inability to bear children, Avram is given the legitimate option of producing an heir through her maid, Hagar. Somewhat embarrassing to later interpreters, this practice was nevertheless common in the ancient Near East (see also 30:3ff., 30:9ff.). Hagar abuses her temporarily exalted position (as her son Yishmael apparently does in a parallel story, in Chap. 21), but is saved by God’s intervention. The motif of “affliction” is continued from Chap. 15 (here, in vv.6, 9, and 11); also mentioned three times is God’s “hearkening” (hence the name Yishmael/God Hearkens). Buber understood this vocabulary to allude to the Exodus story, which in its early chapters uses the same terms."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Firstborn Son,Genesis 16:1-16,2,"Although Yishmael is not ultimately the chosen heir, he is nonetheless protected by God (see 21:20) and is eventually made into “a great nation” (17:20), as befits a child of Avram."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Covenant of Circumcision,Genesis 17:1-27,1,"As Plaut notes, up to this point the covenant between God and Avram has been rather one-sided. In this chapter Avram is given a command to perform—not only of circumcision, but to be moral and upright (v.1, expanded in 18:19). Circumcision is but the symbol of the ongoing imperative to do “what is just.”"
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Covenant of Circumcision,Genesis 17:1-27,2,"In many societies circumcision has been connected directly to puberty and marriage, usually taking place (as it does here to Yishmael) at around the age of thirteen. Our passage’s moving back of the rite essentially to birth is a daring reinterpretation, at once defusing the act of exclusively sexual content while at the same time suggesting that the covenant, a lifelong commitment, is nevertheless passed down biologically through the generations. The males of the tribe are not simply made holy for marriage. They bear the mark upon their bodies as a sacred reminder of their mission."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Covenant of Circumcision,Genesis 17:1-27,3,"The chapter echoes with repetition: “exceedingly, exceedingly” (vv.6 and 20, referring to the fruitfulness of Avram’s descendants), “you and your seed after you” (vv.7, 10; see also v.19), “for the ages” (covenant and land, vv.7, 8, 13, 19), and “into your generations” (vv.7, 9, 12)."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Covenant of Circumcision,Genesis 17:1-27,4,"Preparatory to Avram’s assumption of fatherhood—of an individual and of a people—his name is changed (v.5), as is that of Sarai (v.15). This act is of the utmost significance in the biblical world. Since a person’s name was indicative of personality and fate, the receiving of a new one signified a new life or a new stage in life. Similarly, Yaakov (and in a sort of coronation, Yosef) will undergo a change of name. Such a practice still survives among kings and popes."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,Visit and Promise,Genesis 18:1-15,1,"The announcement of Sara’s impending child is set in the familiar ancient garb of a tale about divine travelers who visit an old couple. Central, as is usual in folklore, is the idea of hospitality, emphasized in the text by the threefold use of “pray” (please) (vv.3–4), “pass on/by” (vv.3–5), and by Avraham’s flurry of activity (he himself “runs” twice, “hastens” three times, and “fetches” four times in serving his guests)."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Great Intercession,Genesis 18:16-33,1,"With v.17 the narrative is interrupted, and there begins a remarkable scene in which man confronts God. As if to emphasize the importance of this encounter, the text presents God as thinking out loud, and using the intimate term “know” (see 4:1) to describe his relationship to Avraham. And Avraham, the man through whom the nations “will find blessing” (v.18; see 12:3), the progenitor of “a great … nation” (v.18; see 12:2) that will see injustice its great goal, is now confronted with an urgent question of justice. While Avraham seems to be testing God in this story, it may in fact be precisely the reverse that is intended. Perhaps here more than anywhere else in the entire cycle (with the possible exception of Chap. 22), Avraham appears as the worthy father of his people, the one who will “charge his sons and his household … to do what is right and just” (v.19). Without this story Avraham would be a man of faith but not a man of compassion and moral outrage, a model consistent with Moses and the Prophets of Israel."
 II: Avraham,Genesis 12:1-18:33,The Great Intercession,Genesis 18:16-33,2,"The tightly structured, almost formal dialogue allows us to focus totally on the issue at hand. Predominating as refrains are the words “innocent” and “guilty,” along with the expected versions of “just/justice” that pervade Avraham’s remarks."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Rivka’s Children,Genesis 25:19-34,1,"Two stories of sibling confrontation begin the Yaakov cycle. From the first, vv. 19–28, all the necessary conditions are introduced for what is to come: struggle in the womb (foreshadowing Yaakov’s wrestling match in Chap. 32, the structural resolution of this earlier one), God’s plan for the younger son to outdo the older one, the importance of names as clues to personalities, and parental preference. This last point seals the fate of the two boys."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Rivka’s Children,Genesis 25:19-34,2,"The second story (vv.29–34) is Yaakov’s first act of stealth, and sets the pattern for his whole life. Note at the same time the text’s emphasis on Esav’s role (v.34), “Thus did Esav despise the firstborn-right.”"
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Rivka’s Children,Genesis 25:19-34,3,"As before, these episodes point in two temporal directions. Esav resembles Yishmael, the man of the bow; and parental preference will launch the initially tragic action in the Yosef story (Chap. 37)."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,In the Land,Genesis 26:1-6,1,"As we have suggested, there is no true collection of stories about Yitzhak. That is, virtually nowhere does Yitzhak appear in a tale where, as a distinct individual, he is a central character. And unlike Yaakov and Yosef, Yitzhak never directly receives his father’s blessing. This is bestowed by God, and one gets the impression that even Avraham does not deal with his son as an individual. This is not surprising, given Yitzhak’s function in his father’s life."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,In the Land,Genesis 26:1-6,2,"For the narrative, his main purpose, as we have stressed above, is simply to remain in the land (note the repetition of the word “land” in this section). It is almost as if Avraham, the man who lives in the shadow of sacred trees, plants one in the person of his son. In this chapter Yitzhak is forbidden to go beyond the borders of Canaan. Even his death, so seemingly out of place in Chap. 35, occurs after Yaakov has returned home from his wanderings: only when it is assured that there will be continuity in the land is he allowed to die—despite the fact that as a result the text must leave him blind and dying for twenty years."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,The Wife—III,Genesis 26:7-11,1,"Here is the final “Yitzhak version” of the tale, constructed around the same king whom Avraham had encountered in Chap. 20. Its individual coloring is supplied by the “laughing-and-loving” of v.8, playing on Yitzhak’s name. Otherwise, just as in the following episode, he is merely repeating his father’s experience."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Blessing,Genesis 26:12-33,1,"Confirmation of Yitzhak’s status as heir comes in vv.12–14, in the form of material blessings (already referred to immediately after Avraham’s death, 25:11). It will be Yaakov’s task to reclaim and continue the spiritual side of the tradition."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Blessing,Genesis 26:12-33,2,"The first episode is centered around not Yitzhak but Avraham. The phrase “his father” reverberates; and Avimelekh returns. In the second episode, Avraham’s treaty with that king (Chap. 21) is replayed, with the same result as before: an explanation of the name Be’er-Sheva."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Deceit and Blessing,Genesis 26:34-28:9,1,"Of all the stories of Genesis, this is perhaps the most brilliantly staged. Nowhere is the narrative so vivid as here, and nowhere, even including Chap. 22, is the tension so masterfully drawn out."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Deceit and Blessing,Genesis 26:34-28:9,2,"Despite the fact that the story line is a simple one, involving deception and the “taking” of the blessing, the text is imbued with great subtlety. Most striking is the sensuality it invokes: seven times we hear of “game,” six of the “delicacy” (or “tasty-dish”), and three times Yitzhak “feels” Yaakov (who “comes close” four times). In fact the story makes use of all five of the senses. One sense—that of sight—is defective, and on that deficiency will turn the action of the story. Yet another level of meaning is apparent: “to see” in ancient Israel, as in many cultures, was a term connected to prophetic powers, as we observed regarding Avraham. So here, ironically, Yitzhak’s blindness leads to both deception and to the proper transferral of the blessing."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Deceit and Blessing,Genesis 26:34-28:9,3,"Structurally the story is framed by two references to Esav and his wives: 26:34–35 prepares the way for his loss of the blessing, by showing that he has alienated himself from his parents (and broken Avraham’s charge regarding Yitzhak in 24:3), and 28:6–9 finds Esav obeying his father and making a rather pathetic attempt to reassure himself of his love."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Deceit and Blessing,Genesis 26:34-28:9,4,Some of the story’s motifs will return later. The threefold “as he loves” looks to the crucial role that the theme of “love” will play later on in Genesis (as well as being a key to the story itself). The general theme of nonrecognition will return with an interesting twist in the Yosef novella (especially in Chaps. 42–44).
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Yaakov Sets Out,Genesis 28:10-22,1,"Yaakov’s journey takes him not only to a foreign land, but to the portals of adulthood. It begins fittingly with a dream vision, so that we will know from the start that God is with him. In fact Yaakov always encounters God at crucial life junctures, at the point of journeys (31:3—leaving Aram; 32:25ff.—meeting Esav; 35:1— returning to Bet-El; 35:9ff.—the homecoming; and 46:2ff.—on the way to Egypt)."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Yaakov Sets Out,Genesis 28:10-22,2,"The setting for this particular encounter is highly unusual, especially when compared to the generally nongeographical nature of the revelations to Avraham. The idea of a sacred site (“place,” a biblical word with these connotations, occurs three times) is strongly suggested. The notion of a ladder or ramp (or “gateway,” v.17) between the divine and human worlds is well known in ancient stories. A variation of the theme occurs in 32:2–3, where Yaakov sees “messengers” again in an “encounter”; these two stories frame the middle of the entire cycle."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Yaakov Sets Out,Genesis 28:10-22,3,"As Yaakov enters his adult life, he resembles both his grandfather Avraham, the visionary, and his son Yosef, the dreamer."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Arrival in Aram,Genesis 29:1-14,1,"As one might expect from the usual biblical pattern, Yaakov meets his bride-to-be at a well. As in other ancient stories (see also Ex. 2:15–17) the hero performs a feat of physical strength, this time with a large stone—continuing the use of stones as a motif in the Yaakov stories."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Arrival in Aram,Genesis 29:1-14,2,"Lavan is once again the chief representative of the family, as he was in the betrothal account of Chap. 24."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Deception Repaid,Genesis 29:15-30,1,"The language of the text here, as well as the tenor of the situation, suggest that the Bible has set up Yaakov’s punishment for having stolen Yitzhak’s blessing from his brother. “Deceived” (v.25) and “younger … firstborn” (v.26) echo the Chap. 27 narrative, and provide another example of biblical justice."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,"Love, Jealousy, and Children",Genesis 29:31-30:24,1,"The narrative now demonstrates (1) how Yaakov prospers in exile, increasing both in wealth and in progeny, and thus (2) how God fulfills his promise to the Patriarchs to “make them many.” Characteristically for the Bible, this takes place as a result of human emotions: the jealousy of two sisters who are married to the same man. The emotions, interestingly, are portrayed largely through the names given to Yaakov’s sons. In the end Lea seems to be the victor, at least in the terms of a culture that prizes the production of male children; she becomes the mother of fully half of the sons of Israel (Redak)."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Yaakov in Exile: Stealth and Prosperity,Genesis 30:25-32:1,1,"The long account of how Yaakov outwits Lavan rounds out the portrait of his personality: he is a man at once clever, successful, and harassed. The text goes to great lengths to describe both men in behavior and thought, and we are given enough dialogue to be able to understand their motivations. The repeating words point to major themes: “serve,” “wages,” “face” (which will become central to the whole cycle by Chap. 32), and a whole vocabulary of trickery: “steal” (with the variations “be stealthy” and “steal the wits”), “take away” (see Chap. 27), “snatch,” and “rob.”"
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Preparations for Esav,Genesis 32:2-24,1,"As if to portend something momentous, Yaakov’s first act upon setting out for home is an encounter with “messengers of God.” From this starting point everything is subsequently a matter of “two camps” (v.8) or two levels: the divine and the human. This is the key to understanding the meeting between Yaakov and his brother in its entirety: Yaakov will have to deal with God before he can resolve his problem with Esav."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Preparations for Esav,Genesis 32:2-24,2,"With an obsequiousness whose language reflects both the culture and the emotional setting, Yaakov prepares a gift for Esav, but finds to his dismay that his brother is “coming to meet him,” with seemingly hostile intent. Once again stealth (or at least extreme caution) is the rule, with Yaakov taking elaborate precautions."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,The Mysterious Stranger: Struggle at the Yabbok,Genesis 32:25-33,1,"Unexpectedly there is a break in the narrative. The stage has been set for something mysterious to happen with a nighttime backdrop and accented references to “crossing” (vv.23–24), which clearly refers to more than just the river."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,The Mysterious Stranger: Struggle at the Yabbok,Genesis 32:25-33,2,"The great wrestling scene at the Yabbok both symbolizes and resolves beforehand Yaakov’s meeting with Esav, much as Shakespeare’s prebattle dream scenes (e.g., <i>Julius Caesar, Richard III, Macbeth</i>) will do with his characters. Struggle, the motif already introduced in the mother’s womb (Chap. 25), returns here, but that is not the only consideration. At issue is Yaakov’s whole life and personality, which despite his recent material successes are still under the pall of Esav’s curse (27:36). Central, then, is the change of name in v.29, which suggests both a victorious struggle and the emergence of a new power. This is further supported by the Hebrew plays on sound: <i>Y’KB</i> (Yaakov), <i>YBK</i> (Yabbok), and <i>Y’BK</i> (wrestling)."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,The Mysterious Stranger: Struggle at the Yabbok,Genesis 32:25-33,3,"The story may have originated as the well-known tale of a hero fighting a river divinity, but it clearly has been transformed into something much broader by its position and vocabulary."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,The Mysterious Stranger: Struggle at the Yabbok,Genesis 32:25-33,4,"On the mysterious aspects of both the story and the name Israel, see Geller."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Resolution,Genesis 33:1-17,1,"Once the Yabbok crisis is past, there is hope for reconciliation of the brothers. Even so, Yaakov exercises caution, behaving like a man who is presenting tribute to a king. The narrative is brought full circle in vv.10 and 11, where “face” is once again highlighted and where Yaakov’s gift is termed a “token-of-blessing.” At last the tension of Yaakov’s early life seems resolved."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Home: Peace and Violence,Genesis 33:18-34:31,1,"“Yaakov came home in peace to the city of Shekhem” (33:18) continues the theme of resolution. Not only has Esav accepted his gift, but Yaakov has arrived home safely, in fulfillment of his prayer in 28:21. Like Avraham he purchases land; again like him he builds an altar."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Home: Peace and Violence,Genesis 33:18-34:31,2,"Chap. 34, however, shatters the newly created atmosphere of security and peace (“peaceably disposed” in v.21 is a bitter twist). Whereas Avraham and Yitzhak had been able to conclude treaties with the inhabitants of Canaan, Yaakov winds up in the opposite position. The text implies, as usual, that Canaanite sexual behavior is odious (v.7, “such [a thing] is not to be done!”), and this provides the spring for the action. Interestingly, Yaakov’s sons act somewhat like their father had, “with deceit” (v.13); and love once again leads to an unfortunate end."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Home: Peace and Violence,Genesis 33:18-34:31,3,"The vengefulness and brutality of Yaakov’s sons in this story anticipates their later behavior in the Yosef story (Chap. 37); surprisingly, it is for the present crime and not the sale of Yosef that their father condemns them on his deathbed (49:5–7)."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Home: Peace and Violence,Genesis 33:18-34:31,4,"The chapter is notable for the latitude it allows its characters to express their thoughts and emotions: Shekhem’s desire and love, the sons’ anger and cunning, the Hivvites’ gullibility and greed, and Yaakov’s fear. Like other stories in the Yaakov cycle, it presents us with a somewhat ambiguous situation, where right and wrong are not always simple and the putative heroes are not always heroic."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Home: Blessing and Death,Genesis 35:1-29,1,"Several brief notices round out Yaakov’s return to Canaan. First (vv.1–7) there is the return to Bet-El, where he builds an altar and has the “foreign” gods of his household people put away—thus fulfilling his promise in Chap. 28. This passage is built upon the Hebrew word <i>El,</i> God (related actually to an earlier Northwest Semitic name for a god)."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Home: Blessing and Death,Genesis 35:1-29,2,"Apparently a second version of Yaakov’s name change is recorded in vv.9–15. As in the case of Avraham, seed and land are promised by God. The land can be given to him and “to your seed after you” only upon his return."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Home: Blessing and Death,Genesis 35:1-29,3,"Finally, spread out through the chapter are the accounts of three deaths: Devora, Rivka’s nurse (v.8—a veiled reference to Rivka’s own death?), Rahel (vv.16–20), and finally Yitzhak (vv.28–29). Yaakov’s youth is over, with the dramatic break with those close to him in that period."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Re’uven,Genesis 35:21-22,1,"The following tiny fragment, concerning Re’uven’s usurping his father’s concubine, serves to presage his fall as firstborn later on. Such an act had symbolic value in biblical society; Avshalom (Absalom) sleeps with David’s concubines as a sign of rebellion and a desire to attain the crown (II Sam. 16:21–22)."
 III: Yaakov,Genesis 25:19-36:43,Esav’s Descendants,Genesis 36:1-43,1,"The complicated genealogies and dynasties of this chapter close out the first part of the Yaakov cycle, strictly speaking. Fitting in the context of a society which lay great store by kinship and thus by careful remembering of family names, it may also indicate the greatness of Yitzhak’s line, as Chap. 25 had earlier done for Avraham. Certainly the lists give evidence of a time when the Edomites were more than merely Israel’s neighbors, assuming great importance in historical recollection (Speiser)."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Young Yosef: Love and Hate,Genesis 37:1-36,1,"As has been the pattern with the Avraham and Yaakov cycles, the opening chapter here introduces the key themes of the entire story. These include the father’s love, the power of words, dreams, “ill” as a key word (here denoting evil intent but eventually encompassing misfortune, among other concepts), and of course, the brothers’ hatred, which at first glance is the motivating force behind the action."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Young Yosef: Love and Hate,Genesis 37:1-36,2,"But the initial blame for what happens clearly lies with the father (vv.3–4), and is made unbearable by Yosef’s own behavior. In point of fact he is largely responsible for his own downfall, bearing tales about his brothers (v.2) even before Yaakov’s preference for him is noted. His insistence on telling his dreams to his brothers must be galling, particularly the second time (v.9), coming as it does after the report that “they hated him still more for his dreams” (v.8)."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Young Yosef: Love and Hate,Genesis 37:1-36,3,"The key word of the chapter, not surprisingly, is “brother,” culminating in Yehuda’s ironic words (v.27): “let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother….” Shortly afterward Yosef, their “(own) flesh,” is sold into slavery and probable death."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yehuda and Tamar,Genesis 38:1-30,1,"Chap. 38 has been the subject of many discussions, for it seems to be out of place. It interrupts the story of Yosef at a crucial dramatic spot, and is not chronologically fully consistent with it (Yehuda ages considerably; then we return to Yosef as a seventeen-year-old). Some feel that the suspension in the drama helps to raise tension; others argue that this is the only possible place to put an important tradition about the important brother. While these and other arguments may have their merit, one may discern some significant thematic connections as well, both within the context of the Yosef story and of Genesis as a whole."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yehuda and Tamar,Genesis 38:1-30,2,"The episode first of all demonstrates the growth of Yehuda as a character who is central to the Yosef novella. Already in Chap. 37 he had demonstrated active leadership, albeit in a questionable cause. There he actually saved Yosef’s life, in contrast to Re’uven’s unsuccessful and ultimately self-centered rescue attempt. As the one who basically assumes responsibility, he will be made to undergo an inner development in the narrative, and again becomes the one to take charge of the youngest son (Binyamin, in Chaps. 43 and 44). The missing piece that begins to explain his nobility in this regard (Chap. 44) is the present chapter. Yehuda here learns what it is to lose sons, and to want desperately to protect his youngest. Although his failure to marry off Tamar to the youngest son leads to public humiliation (twice, actually), his response shows that he immediately accepts blame: “She is in-the-right more than I” (v.26). Such an interpretation is further confirmed by the restriction of the word “pledge” to here and 43:9. Yehuda has learned what it means to stake oneself for a principle."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yehuda and Tamar,Genesis 38:1-30,3,"Only after we have been informed of Yehuda’s change can the narrative resume with Chap. 39. True to biblical thinking, redemption may start only after the crime has been punished (e.g., the Samson story, where the hero’s hair begins to grow immediately after his imprisonment)."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yehuda and Tamar,Genesis 38:1-30,4,"Actually the chronology works out quite well. We are told via 41:46, 53–54, that about twenty years elapse between the sale of Yosef and his meetings with the brothers in Egypt; this often signifies a period in biblical parlance and could encompass a generation or a bit less. Since Yehuda was quite possibly a father already in Chap. 37, the present story could well end just before the events reported in Chap. 43—in other words, Yehuda reaches full inner maturity just in time."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yehuda and Tamar,Genesis 38:1-30,5,"The other function of this story seems to be to carry out the major theme of Genesis as we have presented it: continuity and discontinuity between the generations. What is at stake here is not merely the line of one of the brothers, but the line which (as the biblical audience must have been fully aware) will lead to royalty—King David was a descendant of Peretz of v.29. This should not be surprising in a book of origins; we noted the possible mention of Jerusalem in 14:18. Apparently a popular early theme, connected as we have noted to the power of God in history, continuity/discontinuity is repeated in somewhat similar circumstances in the book of Ruth (which contains the only other mention of “begettings” outside of Genesis and Num.3:1)."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yehuda and Tamar,Genesis 38:1-30,6,"The narrator has woven Chaps. 38 and 37 together with great skill. Again a man is asked to “recognize” objects, again the use of a kid, and again a brother (this time a dead one) is betrayed."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yosef: Rise and Fall,Genesis 39:1-23,1,"This chapter prefigures Yosef’s eventual rise to power and simultaneously chronicles his lowest point, literally and figuratively. The two strands of the plot are woven together into a pattern of success/authority → imprisonment → success/authority. This also mirrors the larger story, which progresses from favorite son → slavery → viceroy of Egypt. The integration takes place partly through the medium of a key word, “hand”—which also occurred four times at the end of Chap. 38 and thus acts as a further textual connector. Yosef’s success is tied six times to the phrase “in his hands” (vv.3, 4, 6, 8, 22, 23); he is thrown into prison because of the garments that he left in his mistress’s “hands” (vv.12, 13). Similarly, the movement of the chapter is mirrored in the word “eyes,” which is linked first to the theme of authority (v.4), then to the attempted seduction (v.7), and finally to authority again (v.21) (Alter)."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yosef: Rise and Fall,Genesis 39:1-23,2,"The chapter also repeats the phrase “And it was” (in one form or another) some twelve times, as a distinct stylistic pattern."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yosef: Rise and Fall,Genesis 39:1-23,3,"Yosef’s temporary downfall occurs here for reasons beyond literary balance or suspense. It is in a very real sense the punishment for the bratty behavior of his adolescence. Once again words (this time not his own) get him into trouble (vv.17, 19), as they did in 37:8. And once again a garment is displayed as proof of a fabricated crime."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,The Rise to Power: Dreams,Genesis 40:1-41:52,1,"Continued are the themes of Yosef’s success in adversity and skill in interpreting dreams (yet his father and brother, and not he, had done the interpreting in Chap. 37!). In Chap. 37 dreams had brought about his downfall; here (Chap. 40) they will help the cupbearer and in Chap. 41 ultimately save a country, his family, and himself. Yosef’s self-assurance and reliance on God, already evident in 39:9, here mean that it will not be long before he stands at the pinnacle."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,The Rise to Power: Dreams,Genesis 40:1-41:52,2,"Yosef’s dramatic rise to power is an old and favorite motif in folklore. The text colorfully presents Pharaoh’s dreams, in great detail, especially in his emotional retelling. All the more striking then is Yosef’s simple interpretation (41:23–27)."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Famine: The Brothers Come,Genesis 41:53-42:38,1,"Worldwide famine creates the backdrop for the family drama that is about to unfold. The ancients understood famine as sent by the gods, often as punishment; and the events of our text suggest that God is indeed the prime mover here. We are again presented with the characters of Chap. 37, all of whom have somehow changed. Yaakov emerges as more pitiful than ever (a shadow of the wrestler at the Yabbok), Yosef as powerful governor, not only of all Egypt but of his family’s destiny as well, and the brothers, remarkably, are repentant (42:21–22). We also see Yosef’s emotional side for the first time. He weeps in 42:24, as he will do three times again (43:30; 45:2, 14–15)."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,The Test,Genesis 43:1-44:34,1,"Yosef’s testing of his brothers is masterful, not only because of the plan itself, but also because of the depth of emotion that the text evokes in its characterizations. It demonstrates how well the whole story has been integrated into the Yaakov material, for here as well as there long conversations are used to reveal complex passions."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,The Test,Genesis 43:1-44:34,2,"Some have questioned the morality of Yosef’s actions, seeing that the aged Yaakov might well have died while the test was progressing, without ever finding out that Yosef had survived. But that is not the point of the story. What it <i>is</i> trying to teach (among other things) is a lesson about crime and repentance. Only by recreating something of the original situation—the brothers are again in control of the life and death of a son of Rahel—can Yosef be sure that they have changed. Once the brothers pass the test, life and covenant can then continue."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Reconciliation,Genesis 45:1-28,1,"In revealing his true identity at last, Yosef makes two points: first, that it was all part of God’s plan; and second, that the family must immediately prepare for migration to Egypt. Thus the personal story is intertwined with the national one, and the text therefore gives limited time and space to psychological details. The motif of God’s plan is stressed by the repetition of “God sent me” (vv.5, 7, 8), while the anticipated bounties of settling in Egypt are brought out by the threefold “good-things of Egypt” (vv.18, 20, 23) and by the repeated exhortation to “come” (vv.18, 19)."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Migration to Egypt,Genesis 45:16-47:12,1,"Yaakov’s descent to Egypt involves three meetings: with God, with Yosef, and with Pharaoh. The first is God’s final revelation to Yaakov. God had previously forbidden Yitzhak to go to Egypt during a famine (26:1–2), but his son may now go as part of the divine plan, his people’s destiny. The blessing given to Avraham’s children (particularly to Yishmael) is repeated in 46:3, and God will be “with” Yaakov (46:4) on this journey as he has been on others."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Migration to Egypt,Genesis 45:16-47:12,2,"The meeting between father and long-lost son is brief but powerful, returning as it does to the “face” motif (46:30). Immediately afterward Yosef gives the family advice on how to demonstrate their usefulness to the Egyptians, and one is struck by the precariousness of their situation in even this best of circumstances."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Migration to Egypt,Genesis 45:16-47:12,3,"Yaakov’s brief audience with Pharaoh is both moving and pathetic. The Patriarch sums up his life in depressing terms, and it becomes clear that long life (he believes his own to be short), in addition to wealth and fertility, is considered a sign of divine favor."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Migration to Egypt,Genesis 45:16-47:12,4,"The actual migration is sketched in a few brief strokes. The list of names in 46:8–27 has been constructed on patterned numbers, with a total of seventy."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yosef the Life-Giver,Genesis 47:13-26,1,"The events of this section are not attested historically in Egyptian records. Perhaps they have been included here to confirm Yosef’s stature as Rescuer, not only of his family but of all Egypt as well (see note to 42:2). The description of Yosef’s power is now complete: just as the brothers were ready to “become my lord’s servants” (44:9), so now are the Egyptians (47:25)."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yosef the Life-Giver,Genesis 47:13-26,2,"Some have seen the episode as an ironic reversal of what is to come in Exodus, with the Egyptians’ enslavement of the Israelites; if so, this interlude may have been an amusing one to ancient Israelite audiences."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yosef the Life-Giver,Genesis 47:13-26,3,The text uses the repetition of the phrase “to/for Pharaoh” to effectively paint the legal transaction.
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yosef’s Sons Blessed,Genesis 48:1-22,1,"Yaakov, near to death, blesses his grandsons (Rahel’s!) in moving terms, bringing full circle many of the motifs of his life. Elder and younger sons are switched by the blind Patriarch, who this time, though, is one who is fully aware of their identities. As in both literature and life, a dying man sees both past (here) and future (the next chapter) with great clarity, as in a vision."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yaakov’s Testament and Death,Genesis 49:1-33,1,"In this ancient piece of poetry, Yaakov addresses his sons, not as they are, but as they will be. There is little resemblance, for instance, between the Binyamin as the beloved and protected youngest son of the Yosef story and the preying wolf of v.27, but the Benjaminites were later to be known for their military skills. Scholars have therefore seen the entire poem as a retrojection of Israel as it came to be on the days of the Patriarchs."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yaakov’s Testament and Death,Genesis 49:1-33,2,"As in the fuller Yosef narrative, the first three sons are quickly disqualified from active leadership, paving the way for the rise of Yehuda (the tribe from which sprang David and the royal house of Israel). Despite this, Yosef still receives the richest blessing."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yaakov’s Testament and Death,Genesis 49:1-33,3,"The chapter is textually among the most difficult in the Torah. Many passages are simply obscure, leaving the translator to make at best educated guesses."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yaakov’s Burial,Genesis 50:1-14,1,"The funeral of Yaakov seems to presage the Exodus from Egypt—here with Pharaoh’s permission and a large royal escort (including “chariots and horsemen,” who in several generations will pursue Yaakov’s descendants into the sea)."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,Yaakov’s Burial,Genesis 50:1-14,2,"Interestingly, the <i>Iliad</i> also ends with an elaborate burial scene. The contrast is instructive: the Homeric epic celebrates the deeds and mourns the lost youth of a hero (Hector); Genesis reflects Yosef’s standing at court and the desire to bury Yaakov in the land of Canaan, in the family plot. Note too that Genesis has two more scenes, tending to lessen the impact of this impressive funeral sequence."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,The End of the Matter,Genesis 50:15-26,1,"Drawing out the tension inherent in the Patriarchs’ family relationships to the very end, the text repeats an earlier situation in Yaakov’s life—his brother’s feelings of “grudge” and threats to kill him—in the guise of his sons’ fears toward Yosef. Here, however, there can be no question of personal vengeance, since Yosef sees the brothers’ betrayal of him as but part of a larger purpose. In his words of v.20, “God planned-it-over for good … to keep many people alive,” the text resolves two of the great hanging issues that have persisted throughout Genesis: sibling hatred and the threat to generational continuity."
 IV: Yosef,Genesis 37:1-50:26,The End of the Matter,Genesis 50:15-26,2,"Left hanging, of course, is the issue of the promised land, since the narrative concludes “in Egypt,” but these final chapters lead to the assurance that God will “take account” (vv.24–25) of the Sons of Israel, as they are soon to be termed."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Prologue in Egypt,Exodus 1:1-22,1,"Rather than being presented as a totally separate story, the book of Exodus opens as a continuation of the Genesis saga. This is true both specifically and generally: the first five verses echo and compress the information about the descent of Yaakov’s family into Egypt that was given in Gen. 46:8–27, while “Now these are the names” (v.1) recalls the oft-repeated formula “Now these are the begettings,” which forms the structural background of Genesis. At the same time one might note that the main subject matter of our chapter, life and death (or, threatened continuity), is central to the thematic content of Genesis (see my <i>At the Beginning,</i> “On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure”)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Prologue in Egypt,Exodus 1:1-22,2,"Kikawada and Ackerman (1974) have shown that the opening chapters of Exodus reflect other Genesis material as well. For instance, the five verbs in v.7 mirror the language of creation (Gen. 1:28 and 9:1–2), where a similar vocabulary of fecundity signals the divine desire to “fill the earth.” It is as if Israel’s “becoming many” in Exodus fulfills the plan of history inaugurated at creation, at the same time reminding us of God’s promise to Avraham, to make his descendants as numerous “as the stars in the heavens and [as] the sand that is on the shore of the sea” (Gen. 22:17)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Prologue in Egypt,Exodus 1:1-22,3,"This leads to the predominant issue of Chap. 1: Pharaoh’s paranoid fears about Israel’s growth. What for God was a sign of blessing (cf. the “swarming” of creatures in Gen. 1:20f.) is for Pharaoh a sign of disaster, a feeling of being overwhelmed by what is alien. The birth of the Israelite nation is thus placed in a vivid context, completely physical in its description. And because birth, and not the economic aspects of slavery, is central, the actual description of the oppression of the Hebrews has been reduced to a bare minimum here. Contrary to DeMille’s spectacular and stereotyped portrayal of the Israelites’ sufferings, the Bible limits itself to a few brief verses in the early chapters of the book. The same holds true for parallel depictions of bondage in biblical literature, such as Psalms 78 and 105. It is the experience of being a stranger in Egypt that the Bible has chosen to focus on, rather than on the horrors of slave labor."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Prologue in Egypt,Exodus 1:1-22,4,"In Exodus, the Egyptians cannot stand having aliens among them (this theme has already appeared in Genesis regarding their eating habits—see Gen. 43:32); they dread their presence and fear their increase. A natural plan of attack, to stem the human tide, is genocide. Ironically, because of his fear of war Pharaoh concentrates his worries around the males, ignoring the true source of fecundity. And it is the women in these chapters, as many commentators have pointed out (see Exum), who play the major role in beginning the liberation process. The midwives accomplish a successful coverup; Moshe’s mother and sister, and Pharaoh’s daughter, save the future liberator’s life. “If she be a daughter, she may live” (v.16), along with four other occurrences of “live” in vv.17–22, underscore the irony and the certainty of Israelite survival. The use of women—a group that was often powerless in ancient societies—in these stories makes the eventual victory of the Israelites all the more striking from a traditional patriarchal point of view (see Ackerman 1982); the motif returns a number of times in Israelite literature, as with Jael and Judith."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Prologue in Egypt,Exodus 1:1-22,5,"Failing in his commissioning of special agents (midwives) to carry out his genocidal plan, Pharaoh finally must enlist “all his people” (v.22), and shift the scene to a cosmic setting, the Nile. The stage is thus set for the birth, endangering, and rescue of Moshe."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Prologue in Egypt,Exodus 1:1-22,6,"The historically minded reader may ask: Why would the ruler of a society that is (literally) built on slavery destroy his own workforce? Two answers are possible. First, the story is tied to Chap. 2, the survival of Moshe, and thus must be told to that end (a threat to males). Second, the story does not describe a rational fear, but paranoia—paralleling the situation in Nazi Germany of the 1930s and 1940s, where Jews were blamed for various economic and political catastrophes not of their own making and were eliminated from a society that could have used their resources and manpower."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Moshe’s Birth and Early Life,Exodus 2:1-22,1,"Picking up from the last phrase of Chap. 1, “let every daughter live,” Chap. 2 opens as a story of three daughters (the word occurs six times here), Moshe’s real and foster mothers, and his sister."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Moshe’s Birth and Early Life,Exodus 2:1-22,2,"It has long been maintained that the story of Moshe’s birth is a classic “birth of the hero” tale, sharing many features with other heroes of antiquity. (See p. 250.) The parallel most often drawn is that of Sargon of Akkad, whose birth story is set in an era before Moshe but was written down later; similar elements include being separated from the real parents through a death threat, and being set adrift on the river. Hallo cites other parallels in Hittite and Egyptian literature, noting at the same time that “none of them includes all of the elements of the Moses birth legend.”"
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Moshe’s Birth and Early Life,Exodus 2:1-22,3,"If, as I maintained in the introduction (“On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure”), most of this material has been collected for didactic and not for historical purposes, we are entitled to ask what this story was intended to teach. It cannot simply be written off as an attempt to explain away Moshe’s name and origins. Two elements seem crucial. First, the text as we have it centers around the activity of women—giving birth, hiding, watching and adopting Moshe. The female principle of life-giving triumphs over the male prerogatives of threatening and death-dealing; the Nile, source of all life in Egypt, births another child. Second, the story and its continuation to the end of the chapter set up Moshe as a man of two sides: Hebrew and Egyptian. He is at once archetypal victim (of Pharaoh’s death decree) and archetypal collaborator, growing up, as he apparently does, in Pharaoh’s palace. What are we to make of this two-sided fate and personality? It may well have been intended as a reflex of the people of Israel itself. Often in the Hebrew Bible the hero’s life mirrors that of Israel (see Greenstein 1981), and the case of Moshe is a good example. Moshe develops into a Hebrew—that is, he eventually recovers his full identity. This is accomplished, first, through his empathy with and actions on behalf of “his brothers” (vv.11, 12), then through his exile from Egypt, and finally through the purifying life in the wilderness as a shepherd. Thus Moshe’s personality changes are wrought by means of separations, and the same process will characterize the coming Plague Narrative (with its emphasis on “distinction” between Egypt and Israel) and the entire Israelite legal and ritual system, which stresses holiness and separation."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Moshe’s Birth and Early Life,Exodus 2:1-22,4,"The first section of the chapter (vv.1–10) uses a number of repeating words: “take” appears four times, indicative of divine protection; “child,” seven times (Greenberg 1969); and “see,” which as I have mentioned, will recur meaningfully in Chap. 3. There is also a threefold motif of death threat in the chapter: at birth, on the Nile, and at the hand of the avenging Pharaoh. Isbell notes several items of vocabulary (e.g., “deliver,” “feared,” “amid the reeds”) that return in the victory account at the Sea of Reeds (Chap. 14)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Moshe’s Birth and Early Life,Exodus 2:1-22,5,"From the other two accounts here (vv.11–14 and 15–22), we learn all we need to know about Moshe’s early personality: he is Hebrew-identifying but Egyptian-looking; concerned with justice, but impetuous and violent in pursuit of that goal. It is also ominous that his first contacts with the Israelites end in rejection, since that will so often be his experience with them later on. The doubly unsatisfactory situation of confused identity and impetuous means must be rectified, and it is exile that accomplishes it. The Midyanite wilderness transforms Moshe into shepherd, foreigner, father, and seer—in short, into a son of the Patriarchs (see also “On the Journey Motif,” above)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Moshe’s Birth and Early Life,Exodus 2:1-22,6,"Incredibly, the man whose activity is to span four whole books has, it seems, half his life (or, according to the chronology of 7:7, two-thirds of his life!) described in a single chapter. Typical of biblical storytelling, much has been compressed and left out, but enough is told to establish the person who is to come."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,God Takes Notice,Exodus 2:23-25,1,"Chap. 2 ends on a note that looks forward and backward simultaneously. The fourfold “God” plus verb (vv.24–25) echo the same structure at Creation’s first day (Gen. 1:3–5), and suggest that he puts his concern for the people of Israel on a par with his concern for creation of light (connoting “good” in folklore). In addition, the four verbs used here play a prominent role in the entire Deliverance Narrative, as Isbell has shown."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,God Takes Notice,Exodus 2:23-25,2,"and also he drew, yes, drew for us and watered the sheep!"
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Bush: The Call,Exodus 3:1-4:17,1,"The great revelation scene in these two chapters, so much a classic in the literature of the West, comes as somewhat of a surprise in the close context of our story. Nothing in Exodus so far has prepared us for such a religious, inward vision on the part of Moshe; and indeed, Genesis itself contains no meeting between God and a human being of such a dramatic character. Adam and Avraham converse with God; Yaakov experiences him, to be sure, in dreams and in the guise of a wrestler; but nowhere thus far does one find a biblical hero encountering God with such intensity and purity of vision."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Bush: The Call,Exodus 3:1-4:17,2,"The shepherd, now in the service of his father-in-law, the “priest,” comes upon the “mountain of God,” “behind the wilderness.” The results are those of an unintended or half-intended journey. Moshe, who had fled previously, finds himself at the utmost reaches of the wilderness, almost like Jonah in the bowels of the boat or of the great fish. The sight that Moshe is granted is of unclear nature, but it involves fire, with all its pregnant associations: passion, purity, light, mystery (Greenberg 1969), and here, inextinguishability."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Bush: The Call,Exodus 3:1-4:17,3,"God’s initial speech (vv.6–10) contains all the elements basic to the Deliverance Narrative: it identifies him as the ancestral deity, establishes his compassion for the oppressed people, demonstrates his resolve to rescue them, and ends with the commissioning of Moshe to be his emissary. Central here is the verb <i>see,</i> whose threefold occurrence (vv.7 and 9) ties together the threads of the previous parts of Moshe’s story (see above)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Bush: The Call,Exodus 3:1-4:17,4,"The entire scene is the model for the “call” of the biblical prophet, with its emphasis on God’s speaking to the fledgling prophet amid a vision and the motif of refusal; of the call scenes in the Bible, this is the longest and most memorable in its starkness. A man is called by God to return to society and serve as God’s spokesperson—despite any opposition he may encounter and despite his personal shortcomings. Moshe’s reluctance, indeed his almost obsessive need to turn down the commission, is as much indicative of the general nature of prophecy (cf. Elijah and Jeremiah) as it is of Moshe’s own personality. The prophet must be prepared “to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and plant” (Jer. 1:10), and to stand tall against kings if necessary (Jer. 1:13). So it comes as no surprise that the call is met with less than enthusiasm. And this refusal also teaches something about Israel’s political conceptions. With such a response as this, there can be no question of personal ambition or inner lust for power. The prophet does what he does out of compulsion: he is driven by forces that he perceives as external to him."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Bush: The Call,Exodus 3:1-4:17,5,"In our text, Moshe refuses the commission five times, and five times God counters. In four of these cases the assurance is given that God will “be-there” with him (3:12, 14; 4:12, 15), and the use of that verb carries in its essence one of the most significant motifs of the Bush Narrative: the interpretation of God’s name."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Bush: The Call,Exodus 3:1-4:17,6,"When Moshe asks God for his name in 3:13, he asks for more than a title (Buber and Rosenzweig 1994). In the context of Egyptian magic, knowing the true name of a person or a god meant that one could coerce him, or at the very least understand his true essence. Moshe foresees that the slaves will want to be able to call on this power that has promised to deliver them."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Bush: The Call,Exodus 3:1-4:17,7,"God’s answer is one of the most enigmatic and widely debated statements in the Hebrew Bible (the reader will want to consult Childs for a full bibliography). What does <i>ehyeh asher ehyeh</i> mean? One’s suspicions are aroused from the outset, for the answer is alliterative and hence already not easy to pin down; the poetics of the phrase indicate both importance and vagueness or mystery. There is some scholarly consensus that the name may mean “He who causes (things) to be” or perhaps “He who is.” Buber and Rosenzweig, taking an entirely different tack (of which one occasionally finds echoes in the scholarly literature), interpret the verb <i>hayoh</i> as signifying presence, “being-<i>there</i>,” and hence see God’s words as a real answer to the Israelites’ imagined question—an assurance of his presence. The B-R interpretation has been retained here, out of a desire to follow them on at least this significant point of theology, and out of my feeling that it also fits the smaller context. For of the several times that Moshe tries to wriggle out of his mission, God answers him all but once with the same verb, in the same meaning: “I will be-there with you” (note the parallel between Moshe and the people again)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Bush: The Call,Exodus 3:1-4:17,8,"It is, however, also possible that <i>ehyeh asher ehyeh</i> is a deliberately vague phrase, whose purpose is antimagical and an attempt to evade the question (Rosenzweig speaks of this as well), as if to suggest that possession of the true name cannot be used to coerce this God. In this interpretation, it would follow that, just as God is magicless (see v. 20), he is nameless, at least in the conventional sense of religion. On the other hand, the name Y<small>hwh</small>, however it may have been vocalized throughout the history of the text, did function as a name in ancient Israel (and possibly outside of Israel as well). It was used in oaths (e.g., Gen. 22:16, II Sam. 12:5), and later, in the Second Temple period, limited in public pronunciation to the high priest on the Day of Atonement. As happens frequently in the history of religion, if we follow a concept long enough it transforms back to the beginning, often in an opposite meaning, and so when the use of Y<small>hwh</small> is traced through the Middle Ages one finds it turned into a magical name at the hands of Jewish mystics."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Bush: The Call,Exodus 3:1-4:17,9,"To return to the Bush Narrative as a whole: these chapters introduce a number of important words that will recur throughout the enire Liberation Narrative. These include “trust,” “hearken to (my) voice,” “staff,” “heavy,” “go out,” “strong,” “send,” and “blood” (see Isbell). It should also be mentioned that several key words occur in multiples of 7 from 2:23 to 4:31 (Cassuto): “see” (7), “send” (7), “go” (14), “mouth” (7), “speak/word” (Heb. <i>dabber/davar;</i> 7). This vocabulary in particular focuses the story around major aspects of prophecy."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Bush: The Call,Exodus 3:1-4:17,10,"In the end, what does Moshe have with which to return from the mount of vision? In the DeMille film version his face and personality clearly change; in the biblical text, however, he comes back with a word—the divine promise—and a staff, “with which you shall do the signs” (4:17). He had previously been a man whose lack of tolerance for injustice produced violence; now he is armed with words and a wonder-working object—not a sword or a helmet, but a shepherd’s staff."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Journey Back,Exodus 4:18-31,1,"It is clear that something has been inserted into the normal course of our narrative. What follows v.20 should be v.27; Moshe, ready to go back to Egypt, is met by Aharon in the wilderness, and they subsequently announce their mission to the Children of Israel. However, the editor has prefaced the brothers’ meeting, first with a warning to Moshe that his mission will be strongly resisted by Pharaoh, and a warning that Moshe is to deliver to Pharaoh. Then follows a bizarre episode, which, like the Name passage discussed above, has provoked centuries of comment and attempts to explain it. What are we to make of the circumcision story here, especially the last scene, which is unclear not only in import but in details such as pronouns as well?"
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Journey Back,Exodus 4:18-31,2,"Buber (1988) explains it as an event that sometimes occurs in hero stories: the deity appears as “divine demon” and threatens the hero’s life. Perhaps this underlines the dangerous side of contact between the human and the divine. But there seem to be other reasons for the passage’s inclusion at this point in the text. First, it serves as an end bracket to Moshe’s sojourn in Midyan. As mentioned earlier, Moshe flees Egypt under pain of death (2:15); here, on his return, he is in mortal danger once more. Second, our passage seems to be an <i>inclusio</i> or bracketing passage for the entire Plague Narrative (Kosmala and others). This is confirmed by the use of vv.21–23 as an introduction. God, designating Israel his firstborn and alluding to the future killing of Pharaoh’s/Egypt’s firstborn sons, demonstrates his power as life-taker, to be pacified or turned away only by a ceremonial blood-smearing—parallel to the Israelites’ smearing of blood on their doorposts when their own firstborn are threatened by the Tenth Plague (12:12–13)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Journey Back,Exodus 4:18-31,3,"Two final points should be noted here. First, it is with the act of his son’s circumcision that Moshe finally becomes a true Israelite (that, after all, was the major term of God’s covenant with Abraham in Gen. 17). Similarly, Yehoshua (Joshua), Moshe’s successor, will circumcise the next generation of Israelites in the process of conquering the Promised Land (Josh. 5:2). And second, it is telling, again, that the person who saves Moshe’s life in adulthood is a woman. In a sense, Moshe’s early life is now over, having come full circle."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Before Pharaoh,Exodus 5:1-6:1,1,"Moshe and Aharon’s initial efforts to free the people—even temporarily for an act of worship—are unsuccessful, as foretold in the previous chapter. But even though God had predicted failure, we are still left with a portrait of clashing human wills: the liberators’, the king’s, and the reluctant people’s. The narrative appears to be a set-up for the second major revelation of God to Moshe (Chap. 6), which, preceded by expressions of doubt on both Moshe’s part and that of the people, harks back to the concerns voiced at the Burning Bush. There is also a forward-looking figure, Pharaoh, who is a prototype for other foreign rulers and enemies in the Bible who challenge God (Greenberg 1969)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Before Pharaoh,Exodus 5:1-6:1,2,"Chap. 5 contains the Bible’s most extended description of the conditions of Egyptian bondage. Not surprisingly, the root “serve” occurs seven times in vv.9 to 21 (Greenberg 1969), and sound variations on the Hebrew <i>ra’</i> (“ill/evil”) three times (vv.19–23)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Promise Renewed,Exodus 6:2-13,1,Greenberg (1969) and others have noted how this section in many respects recapitulates God’s speeches at the Bush. Once again God assures Moshe that he has “heard” and “recalled” the Israelites and their old covenant; once again he promises to act (“bring out” resounds four times); once again the promise is linked to an interpretation of God’s name; and once again Moshe expresses doubt as to whether he will be believed or listened to (v.12).
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Promise Renewed,Exodus 6:2-13,2,"Why the repetition? Perhaps here, as elsewhere, to double is to emphasize. Also, just as Moshe initially failed as a self-appointed liberator in Chap. 2, only to be sought out by God in the wilderness, he fails as a leader here as well, followed by God’s reassuring speech. There can be no question from whence the liberation comes."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Genealogy of Moshe and Aharon,Exodus 6:14-27,1,"At this tension-filled moment in the narrative, in the face of Moshe’s self-doubt and the possible collapse of his mission, there is an unlikely break, at least by Western storytelling standards. Apparently the genealogy has been inserted to buttress Moshe and Aharon’s claim to represent the people before the Egyptian crown, and to stress their Levite ancestry (which solidly establishes them within the priestly class in Israel). Significantly, the genealogy of Yaakov’s sons ends with the third, Levi, and the rest of the list enumerates the Levite clans. More significantly, the ages mentioned are composed of patterned numbers such as 3, 7, 30, and 100. As in Genesis, this betokens a concept of order and meaning in history."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Genealogy of Moshe and Aharon,Exodus 6:14-27,2,"Thus legitimated, Moshe and Aharon can return to the task at hand. It would seem, then, that the passage is speaking to the Israelites, both in Egypt and in the audience of later generations."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Mission Renewed,Exodus 6:28-7:13,1,"As preparation for the next meeting with Pharaoh, Moshe is once more reminded that the king will not listen to him. Taking a page from his speech at the Bush, God instructs Moshe and Aharon to use the “sign” that had previously served to convince the people: snake magic. Yet despite Aharon’s one-upping the Egyptian magicians in the warm-up for the plagues, Pharaoh remains unconvinced. This episode helps to prepare for what follows, and indeed contains a virtual glossary of Exodus words. Some of these are: “speak,” “send,” “harden,” “heart,” “sign/portent,” “hand,” “bring out,” “know,” “staff,” “hearken,” “midst.”"
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,First Blow,Exodus 7:14-25,1,"The first plague uses elements and words common to many subsequent plagues; in addition to those just mentioned, it introduces “refuse” and “reek” and “throughout all the land of Egypt.” More important is the choice of site and object for the curse: the Nile (a god in Egypt), water (source of life for the Egyptians but earlier source of death for the Hebrew babies), and blood (sign of life and death). No more effective choice could have been made for this first demonstration of the far-reaching power of the Israelite God."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,First Blow,Exodus 7:14-25,2,"As with the first six plagues, the threat is long and the actual carrying-out brief. Note the relationship, at the end of the episode, between the uncaring Pharaoh and his own people, who have to scratch for water."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Third Blow,Exodus 8:12-15,1,"With the third plague, the curse becomes more intimate, affecting the bodies of all living creatures in Egypt (cf. the refrain in vv.13–14, “on man and on beast”). The narrative uses the briefest plague formula here, without introduction or warning to Pharaoh. Yet it results in an Egyptian effort to end the siege, as the magicians term the plague “the finger of a god” (v.15)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Fourth Blow,Exodus 8:16-28,1,"Despite its similarity to the previous plague (insects), number four introduces a new and important element into the tale: the idea that God makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. It also involves protracted bargaining between Moshe and Pharaoh over the issue of allowing the Israelites to worship God."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Fifth Blow,Exodus 9:1-7,1,"Although this plague spares humans, it is nevertheless described as “heavy” (v.3). The narrative uses a play-on-words as well: the Hebrew for pestilence (<i>dever</i>) echoes that for thing (<i>davar</i>)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Sixth Blow,Exodus 9:8-12,1,"Just as in the previous “short” plague, number 3, the magicians come to the fore. No longer do they cry to Pharaoh; they cannot even take the stage!"
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Seventh Blow,Exodus 9:13-35,1,"Long like its corresponding predecessors (numbers 1 and 4), the seventh plague prefaces its occurrence with an emphatic introduction by God, and its warning gives God-fearing Egyptians a chance to save themselves (vv.19–21), something new. The description of the plague itself is fraught with spectacle, presaging Sinai with its use of thunder and fire. There is also the ominous note, twice in the text (vv.18, 24), that such a plague was unique in Egyptian annals. The plagues, at least for the Egyptians, now transcend the realms of normal, explainable experience, as well as of historical recollection."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Eighth Blow,Exodus 10:1-20,1,"Anticipating Pharaoh’s eventual capitulation, the Egyptians now urge their king to release the Israelites, before Egypt is truly “lost” (v.7). The request occurs before the plague does. This longest plague is in many ways the most devastating of all, affecting as it does the very soil itself. Here the last two plagues are anticipated (v.15, “the ground became dark”; and v.17, “this death”), and the previous one is echoed (vv.6, 14, with the reference to past history). Also foreshadowed, in the locusts’ removal, is the final victory at the Sea of Reeds (Chap. 14), through the mention of the location and the use of a powerful wind."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Ninth Blow,Exodus 10:21-29,1,"Little is new here; darkness foreshadows the final plague, death. Yet at the end of the brief episode, as well as in 11:8, we are given a glimpse into the human element, as Moshe and Pharaoh rage in anger against each other."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Final Warning,Exodus 11:1-10,1,"What seems to be the introduction to the last plague is made up of motifs common to several of the previous ones. It also reintroduces the idea of despoiling the Egyptians, which had been mentioned in Moshe’s original commission (3:21–22)—so we know that redemption is at hand. Artfully, the specification of what “one more blow” is, is delayed until v.5. In addition, there is the motif of Moshe’s greatness/fame among the Egyptians, which would appear to be a suppressed remnant of the story (in the face of the desire to glorify God as the hero). The section ends (vv.9–10) with a summary of the entire Plague Narrative—or at least of what is to be learned from it."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Passover Ritual,Exodus 12:1-28,1,"The festival depicted in this chapter is, in the opinion of many scholars, a combination of two ancient holy days: a shepherds’ festival, in which each spring a lamb was sacrificed to the deity in gratitude and for protection of the flock, and a celebration of the barley harvest, at which time all leaven/fermentation products were avoided (although see Ginsberg, who theorizes a shepherds’ festival with <i>matza</i>). Each has numerous parallels in other cultures (see Gaster 1949). What has apparently happened here is that the two days have been fused together and imbued with historical meaning. In addition, rites that were originally protective in function have been reinterpreted in the light of the Exodus story. But whatever its origin, Passover as described in our text bespeaks a strong sense of Israelite tribal community and of distinctiveness. And it is distinctiveness, which played such an important role in Israelite religion, that is singled out here, with the striking penalty for transgressing the boundaries of the festival—being “cut off” (probably death). One also notes the repetition of the phrase “a law for the ages” (vv.14, 17, 24). Passover, then, is central both to the Exodus story and to Israelite ideas as a whole (see Sarna 1986 for a detailed discussion)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Tenth Blow and Exodus,Exodus 12:29-42,1,"The final blow falls. This most horrifying of all the plagues, and the reaction to it, are described in only two verses, whereas the rest of the narrative concerns itself with preparations for and actual description of the exodus. Note how, as above, the narrative is surrounded by ritual concerns—trying to explain the subsequent reason for eating unleavened bread (which had not been done in v.15f., above). There also returns the important motif of despoiling (“stripping”) Egypt."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Tenth Blow and Exodus,Exodus 12:29-42,2,"The section ends (vv.40–42) with a dramatic summary of Israel’s sojourn in Egypt and the importance of the Passover festival, built on repetition (“thirty years and four hundred years,” “a night … for Y<small>hwh</small>,” “keeping-watch”). Again, a past event is made immediate for the audience. The powerful religious tones of story and ceremony are established by the threefold reference to night as the setting for both (vv.29–31)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Who May Make Passover,Exodus 12:43-50,1,"Continuing the immediacy of ritual, the narrative pauses where one would expect it to talk about the Israelites’ route, to specify carefully that partaking of the Passover meal, and indeed being a part of the community in general, requires circumcision on the part of the participant. In essence, it creates the new Israelite nation, on the heels of common participation in a historical event. This small passage has been inserted between two occurrences of the same phrase (“that same day”), an editorial device often used in biblical literature."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Passover and the Firstborn,Exodus 12:51-13:16,1,"To close out the text’s celebration of the exodus event, the editor includes a peroration on the firstborn. This too is a reinterpretation of earlier religious practices. Many ancient cultures selected the firstborn as an object for sacrifice to the gods—whether firstborn of fruit, of animals, or of human beings—the grounds for this being that the firstborn represents the best that nature has to offer (see Gen. 49:3, where Jacob’s firstborn is “beginning of my strength”). The idea of strength is played upon in the reinterpretation of sacrifice: four times, including at the end of the passage, we are told that the firstborn is to be consecrated, “for by strength of hand Y<small>hwh</small> brought you out of Egypt” (vv.3, 9, 14, 16)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Passover and the Firstborn,Exodus 12:51-13:16,2,"The chapter has a few notable characteristics. For one, the eating of <i>matzot</i> has been integrated into the firstborn material; for another, the language is unmistakably reminiscent of Deuteronomy (vv.5 and 11, “it shall be [a refrain here]/when Y<small>hwh</small> brings you to the land of the Canaanite …”; see Deut. 6:10, 7:1, etc.). This has led some scholars to point to a relatively late date for the material, supporting the idea that Israel in its sixth-century <small>b.c.e.</small> exile in Babylonia looked back to recast the past in its own image. At any rate, memory is clearly important here, with two passages stressing the continuity of commemoration through the following generations (vv.8–10 and 14–16)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Route and the Escort,Exodus 13:17-22,1,"The initial exit from Egypt highlights an ominous fact about the Israelites: God is well aware of their weaknesses and leads them by a detour, lest they “see war” and seek to recover the familiar security of being serfs. The section also explains what they are doing out of the way of the logical route to Canaan (the place names are difficult to identify, but the general stress is clear), and sets up the great final victory of the next chapter."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Route and the Escort,Exodus 13:17-22,2,"Two other elements of weight enter in this brief passage. One concerns Yosef’s bones, which leave Egypt with his descendants. The body of Yosef seems to anchor early Israelite history: its mummification brings the Genesis stories to a close, its journey here links up Israel’s patriarchal past with the radically new deliverance from bondage, and its final interment in the land of Israel formally closes out the conquest of the land under Yehoshua (Joshua) (Josh. 24:32)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Route and the Escort,Exodus 13:17-22,3,"Another unifying motif is that of God’s accompanying the journeying Israelites in the form of cloud and fire. This passage is the first of what I have called the “Presence Accounts” described in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Sea of Reeds,Exodus 14:1-31,1,"The liberation account ends with two literary masterpieces: the semipoetic story of Israel’s miraculous passage through the Sea of Reeds along with God’s smashing of the Egyptian war machine, and the song of triumph that follows in Chap. 15. Taken together, they form a natural conclusion to what has gone before and a bridge to what follows. Chap. 14 marks the Israelites’ last contact with the Egyptians, and the beginning of their desert journey."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Sea of Reeds,Exodus 14:1-31,2,"As if the actual exodus were not dramatic enough, the narrator or editor has included a battle scene at this point in the text. As before, the principal combatants are God and Pharaoh, and as before, we begin with God’s hardening the monarch’s heart (v.4) to teach him a final lesson (“I will be glorified”). In that vein, some of the plague motifs are repeated, making Chap. 14 a fitting conclusion to the Deliverance account stylistically and thematically (see also Isbell). At the same time the story includes a foreshadowing of Israel’s behavior in the wilderness for the next two years, with a detailed account of their complaints against Moshe (and God’s miraculous response)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Sea of Reeds,Exodus 14:1-31,3,"God appears in this story in his most warlike garb, and temporarily resembles many of the gods of antiquity (Cross uses the term “the divine warrior,” relating it to Northwest Semitic imagery). This is not unusual for the Bible, and seems appropriate here, given the climactic nature of the events and the general context of the Deliverance Narrative. Otherwise, the Hebrew God was conceived of as the originator of all things, good and evil, and was of course not compartmentalized into limited tasks as were other gods of neighboring cultures."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Sea of Reeds,Exodus 14:1-31,4,"From a formal point of view, the sea narrative is among the most formulaic in the Hebrew Bible. That is, it is built entirely upon several phrases that repeat throughout the text, stressing its major themes. These include: God’s “making Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed” (vv.4, 8, 17); God’s “being glorified” through what he does to the Egyptians (vv.4, 17, 18); Israel’s going “upon dry-land” (vv.16, 22, 29); the waters’ “returning” (vv.26, 27, 28); Israel’s marching “through/into the midst of the sea” (vv.16, 22, 23, 27, 29); Pharaoh’s “chariots and riders” (vv.17, 18, 23, 26, 28); and a description of the standing waters, “the waters a wall for them to their right and to their left” (vv.22, 29); see also the refrain, “before Pi ha-Hirot … before Baal-Tzefon” (v.4) and “by Pi ha-Hirot, before Baal-Tzefon” (v.9). The text is thus much more than a journalistic account of what happened: it is a rhythmic retelling of an experience, strongly conditioned by traditional (probably oral) Israelite forms of storytelling."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Sea of Reeds,Exodus 14:1-31,5,"The ending (vv.29–31) betrays the influence of Deuteronomy. Using language that mirrors the end of the entire Torah (Deut. 34), the text speaks of seeing, fearing, hand, eyes, and the unique-to-Deuteronomy phrase “Moshe his servant” (see Deut. 34:5). Significantly, then, the final narrative of Israel’s relationship to Egypt is cast as a classic ending in general."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,At the Sea of Reeds,Exodus 14:1-31,6,"What exactly happened at the sea? As I indicated in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above, such a point is unanswerable, and may not have a great bearing on the meaning of our text. Scholars have scrambled their brains for decades, trying either to reconstruct precisely what “natural” event this “really” was (e.g., tides, tidal wave), or to identify the exact location of the “Sea of Reeds.” While such matters are important to the historian, the Bible itself concentrates on the theme of the story. The narrator was concerned to demonstrate God’s final victory and to portray Israel’s escape in terms of a birthing (through a path, out of water), and these themes had the most influence both on later biblical tradition and on the generations of inspired Jews and Christians that heeded them."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Song of God as Triumphant King,Exodus 15:1-21,1,"Moshe’s famous Song at the Sea provides a natural boundary in the book of Exodus. It sets off the Egypt traditions from those of Sinai and the wilderness, and brings to a spectacular close the saga of liberation. This is borne out even in scribal tradition, still observed in the writing of Torah scrolls today, where the Song is written out with different spacing from the preceding and following narrative portions."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Song of God as Triumphant King,Exodus 15:1-21,2,"A poem is necessary at this point in the story, to provide emotional exultation and a needed break before the next phase of Israel’s journey in the book. The Song manages to focus the Israelites’ (the audience’s?) intense feelings in a way that neither the ritual of Chaps. 12–13 nor even the semipoetic description of God’s miraculous intervention in Chap. 14 can do. Only poetry is capable of expressing the full range of the people’s emotions about what has happened. This is similar to the effect of the great poems that occur toward the end of Genesis (Chap. 49, the Blessing of Yaakov) and Deuteronomy (Chaps. 32–33, the Song and Blessing of Moshe)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Song of God as Triumphant King,Exodus 15:1-21,3,"A major concern of the poet is God’s kingship, with which he ends the poem (a one-liner—“Let Y<small>hwh</small> be king for the ages, eternity!”—contrasting with the doublets and triplets in the body of the poem). This is no accident, nor is it inappropriate; since Chaps. 4 and 5 the story of Exodus has revolved around just who shall be king (God or Pharaoh) and just who shall be served. By the end of Chap. 14 this is no longer an issue. The victorious Y<small>hwh</small> can now be acclaimed as king, while we hear nothing further of Pharaoh. (Has he drowned or merely been written out of the story? Later generations of Jews enjoyed giving him a role in the world to come: he stands at the gate of Hell, admonishing evildoers as they enter; see Ginzberg.)"
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Song of God as Triumphant King,Exodus 15:1-21,4,"The attempts to recover what happened at the sea through the poem are doomed to failure, considering that the piece is constructed out of two traditional stories, the victory at the sea and the later conquest of Canaan (vv.1–12, 13–17). Further, it is set in cosmic terms. The words “Oceans” (Heb. <i>tehomot;</i> vv.5, 8) and ‘breath” (<i>ru’ah;</i> v.8) recall the primeval chaos at the beginning of Creation itself (Gen. 1:2). This technique is characteristic of much of ancient/religious literature: a great event is told in a way that reflects the beginnings of the gods and the world (this may include statements about the end of the world as well)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Song of God as Triumphant King,Exodus 15:1-21,5,"It should be noted that some scholars point out the close resemblance between God’s victory here and scenes in other ancient Near Eastern literatures that portray the triumph of a storm god over a sea god. So however historical the events in Chaps. 14–15 may have been, in their biblical retelling they have been patterned after antecedents in myth."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Song of God as Triumphant King,Exodus 15:1-21,6,"Much has been written concerning the structure of the Song (see, e.g., Cassuto, Cross, and Lichtenstein). I will mention only a few points here. The vocabulary of the poem is extremely concentrated. Major ideas are expressed by clusters of key verbs. Note, for instance, the grouping of “flung,” “hurled,” “plunged,” “shattered,” “smashed,” “consumed”—a veritable lexicon of military victory. A number of verbs describe divine leadership (“led,” “guided,” “brought”), and God’s establishment of the Israelites in Canaan (“planted,” “founded”). The fear of the Canaanites (of Israel and its God) is graphically expanded to “shuddered,” “seized with writhing,” “terrified,” “seized with trembling,” “melted away,” “… dread and anguish,” and “grew dumb.” Finally, there are a number of nouns that express weight (cf. Heb. <i>kaved,</i> previously discussed): “stone,” “dam,” and “lead.”"
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Song of God as Triumphant King,Exodus 15:1-21,7,"The overall effect of the poem is of fierce pride at God’s victory, and exultant description of the destruction and discomfort of enemies, whether Egyptian or Canaanite. This general tone parallels many ancient war poems; what is characteristically Israelite about it is God’s choosing and leading a people. Therefore the last verse goes far beyond the celebration of a single military victory. The Song constitutes the founding of a theocratic people."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Song of God as Triumphant King,Exodus 15:1-21,8,"Scholars have long noted the archaic style of the Song, which uses forms characteristic of early biblical Hebrew. Its tone is for this reason even more exalted than is usual in biblical poetry. An imaginative reflection of the effect can be found in Daiches, who paraphrases the Song in the style of early English epic poetry."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Song of God as Triumphant King,Exodus 15:1-21,9,"Two sections have been appended to the end of the poem. First there is the poetically remarkable summary of the narrative in v.19, notable for the fact that it is composed wholly from phrases used in Chap. 14. There follows a women’s repetition/performance of at least part of the Song complete with dance. Some scholars see this as the “original” form of the poem. Of equal interest is the characterization of Miryam as a “prophetess.” But there may be a structural reason for her appearance as well: the enterprise of deliverance from Egypt began with a little girl at the Nile, watching through the reeds to make sure her baby brother would survive; it ends with the same person, now an adult, a “prophetess” celebrating the final victory at the Sea of Reeds."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Grumbling I,Exodus 15:22-27,1,"The first of the wilderness narratives is linked to what has gone before via the theme of water. Fresh from their rescue from death at the sea, the Israelites look for water in the desert and find the discovery of unpotable water intolerable. The key word, especially for the many later wilderness traditions such as we find in Numbers, is “grumbled” (Heb. <i>lyn</i>), which leads to God’s nurturing of the people. Strangely, the theme of undrinkable water recalls the beginning of the plague sequence in Egypt (7:20–21)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Grumbling II,Exodus 16:1-36,1,"Moving now halfway (in terms of time) to their Sinai destination, the people encounter a new lack: food. This reintroduces the “testing” motif (V.4), with its built-in answer: God provides quails and <i>mahn</i> (trad. English “manna”). The story is full-blown, and its repeating vocabulary sets forth the issues clearly: “grumble” occurs seven times, and “command/commandments” four times, linked to the idea of testing. Indeed, this long story poses the question central to all the wilderness narratives: “… whether they will walk according to my instruction or not” (v.4)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Grumbling III,Exodus 17:1-7,1,"With the third wilderness story we return to the water theme. This time the element of “quarreling” with Moshe is added, in addition to the portrayal of Moshe’s eroding patience (v.4). Otherwise it is a variation on the basic theme (notice, for instance, the similarities between 16:3 and 17:3). The ending is ominous, reversing the previously held idea of God’s testing Israel."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,War with Amalek,Exodus 17:8-16,1,"In addition to testing/grumbling, conflict with foreigners is a significant wilderness theme (see Num. 20–24). It is perhaps for this reason that it has been included in the pre-Sinai traditions. Its placement here may depend on its use of Moshe’s staff; the previous narrative ended with the use of that object, and such linkage was a known form of composition in ancient literature."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The New Society: Yitro’s Visit,Exodus 18:1-27,1,"Israel finally reaches the “mountain of God,” but this, remarkably, is subordinated to the fact that Moshe and the people meet up with Yitro, whom we recall from Chaps. 2–4. The designation “father-in-law” recurs throughout this chapter (thirteen times), perhaps playing up the importance of the relationship in Israelite society. The real concern of the story, however, is Moshe’s early attempt to set up a functioning judicial system in Israel (hence the key word <i>davar,</i> ten times, translated here as “matter” in the sense of “legal matter”). The chapter thus serves as a good prelude to Sinai, which will include far-ranging legal material (despite the fact that some scholars see it as an insertion from a later period—cf. v.16, “God’s laws and his instructions”)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Meeting and the Covenant,Exodus 19:1-25,1,"The account of God’s revelation at Sinai, like the narrative of the tenth plague and exodus, is embedded in a wider setting. After the covenant has been elucidated, the people assent; preparations are made to meet God; and the brief initial meeting is followed by more preparations, including stern warnings against trespassing on the mountain’s sanctity. When one takes Chap. 20 into account, the effect of all this is anything but smooth, from a narrator’s point of view, and I would agree with Greenberg (1969) that this may be deliberate—stemming from a desire either to include every tradition about this key event that was available to the editor(s), or else to suggest that such things are impossible to describe in normal language and logical sequence (Buber [1981], in another context, once referred to the Creation story of Gen. 1 as a “stammering account”). In any event, the entire description of the fateful meeting between God and the Israelites at Sinai is confined to a mere four verses (19:16–19). This stands in blatant contrast to other ancient Near Eastern traditions, which would have treated such an event with epic length and poetic diction (see, for instance, Deut. 32, or Psalm 78). So here, as in the opening chapter of Genesis, all has been stripped down, focusing attention on the covenant rather than on the mysterious nature of God."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,The Ten Words (The Decalogue),Exodus 20:1-14,1,"This section, among the most famous and important in all of religious literature, is set in dramatic tone. Its rhetoric could hardly be more striking. In a form relatively rare in ancient Near Eastern legal documents, a god sets forth demands, with no punishments listed. This “apodictic” form seems to indicate that the Ten Words function as a preamble to the actual laws of Chaps. 21–23, by laying forth the major principles on which Israel’s relationship to God is to be based (as is to be expected, the secondary literature on Chap. 20 is enormous; see Childs for a bibliography)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Aftermath,Exodus 20:15-23,1,"The verses that follow the Decalogue highlight an important aspect of the Sinai tradition: its occurrence in a public setting. Vv. 15–18 could fit nicely after 19:20a; the Decalogue would then follow 20:18. Yet it seems to have been important for the narrator to stress (v.19) that God spoke to the people as a whole, not merely secretly in a revelation to a visionary or priest. To emphasize this point, the verb <i>ra’oh,</i> “see/perceive,” occurs seven times in vv.15–19. V.19 also serves as a framework for the entire Revelation episode, recalling as it does the language of 19:4. Israel now has two reasons for obeying God: he brought them out of Egyptian bondage and he talked to them “from the heavens” (v.19)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Laws Regarding Israelite Serfdom,Exodus 21:1-11,1,"Given the importance of the root “serve” in the book of Exodus, it is fitting that the Covenant Code open with this theme. In vv.1–6 the text considers the case of the native serf, a status rather like that of the indentured servant in early American history. Immediately, the act of releasing such an individual—providing for his “going out”—is stipulated. “For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt” (Lev. 25:42). While the institution of serfdom existed of necessity in ancient Israel, it could not be tolerated as a permanent and fully dehumanizing one (on the other hand, these regulations deal with natives, not with foreigners). Note the use of seven here, as the number of perfection and limit—the servant goes free after seven years, just as the land rests every seven years (23:10–11)."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Capital Crimes of Violence,Exodus 21:12-17,1,"Four situations involving grave crimes are cited in this section, each ending with the pronouncement of the death penalty in rhetorical form (Heb. <i>mot yumat,</i> “He is to be put-to-death, yes, death”): murder, striking one’s parents, kidnapping, and denigrating one’s parents. Our society has in general supported the first and third of these; but the regulations concerning father and mother do not accord with twentieth-century Western practice, and point up well the enormous importance of the parent-child relationship in ancient Israel (already suggested by “Honor your father and your mother” in the Ten Words). That relationship was often used to describe the one between God and Israel, and thus obedience is an important theme in the covenant as a whole."
 I: the Deliverance Narrative,Exodus 1:1-21:37,Injuries,Exodus 21:18-32,1,"The vocabulary of verbs in these verses outlines the subject at hand: “quarrel,” “strike,” “contend,” “harm,” “strike,” “break-off,” “give.” The text treats a number of extenuating circumstances, imposing penalties of varying degrees.

But it also sets up an emphasis on a more permanent institution in Israelite culture: the Sabbath. One notion that this passage may convey is the antiquity and importance of the Sabbath, preceding the laws of Sinai as it does here. Also at issue is whether the Israelites can follow simple rules laid down by God."

It also abounds in terms connoting warning and boundaries/separateness—the text contains three sets of warnings: vv.10–13, 21–22 (introducing the phrase “burst out,” which refers to God’s potential destructiveness if the boundaries are violated), and 24. This recalls Moshe’s own experience at Sinai earlier (cf. 3:5).

This division might be borne out by stylistic considerations, for the last five, of course, begin “You are not to …” and numbers 2–4 all use the Hebrew word <i>ki</i> (“for”) to express reasons or results of the initial stipulations (vv.5, 7, 11, with the substitution of “in order that” in verse 12)."

 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Property,Exodus 21:33-22:14,1,"These regulations cover various damages to property, commonly through negligence. The key word here is “pay” (Heb. <i>shallem,</i> denoting restitution); also repeated are “fellow” and “God’s-oracle.”"
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters,Exodus 22:15-23:19,1,"A great variety of offenses is covered in this section: rape, oppression, talebearing, unjust sentencing, and bribery, among others. Yet the category is not so neatly drawn; interspersed with these are laws concerning what we would consider religious affairs: sorcery, idolatry, blasphemy, and the sacred calendar. Once again the implication seems to be that all of these areas are of immediate concern to God, regardless of how they are labeled or pigeonholed."
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters,Exodus 22:15-23:19,2,"Stylistically there is also great variety, as categorical prohibitions (22:18) alternate with pleas (23:5–6) and positive commands (23:10–12). A number of times the justification for the law is given in the text itself (e.g. 22:20, 26; 23:7, 8, 9, 11, 12), with the operative word being “for.” (Such a verse is called a “motive clause,” and is characteristically although not exclusively biblical; see Sonsino.)"
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters,Exodus 22:15-23:19,3,"Most notable about this section is the full use that it makes of rhetoric. Several key laws are accompanied by an emotional appeal—e.g., “Oh, if you afflict, afflict them … !” (22:22); “for it is his only clothing … in what (else) shall he lie down?” (v.26); “for a Compassionate-One am I” (v.26); and “you yourselves know (well) the feelings of the sojourner” (23:9)."
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters,Exodus 22:15-23:19,4,"No passage in these chapters, and indeed throughout the entire Torah, can easily surpass vv.21–23 (as I have mentioned above), with their appeal to language and emotions alike. So at the core of the legal concerns here is the protection of the powerless."
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters,Exodus 22:15-23:19,5,"Toward the end (23:10–19), emphasis shifts to the festivals of Israel, with a special focus on the agricultural setting. As a result the general scholarly consensus is that these laws could not be wilderness regulations, but refer instead to life after the conquest of Canaan. Be that as it may, the fact that this section ends with ritual concerns provides a rounding-out of the entire body of Exodus legislation, which, as I noted above, began with worship as its subject (20:20ff.)."
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters,Exodus 22:15-23:19,6,"Finally, this ending passage is notable for its numerical layout—two sets of seven (years and days) and one of three (times a year)."
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Epilogue. The Future Conquest,Exodus 23:20-33,1,"It would not be suitable, given the grave nature of the covenant, to end the legal passages merely with a particular law, and so our narrator appends a long speech, in the style of Deuteronomy, warning the Israelites, first, to follow God’s messenger, and second, not to assimilate with the nations they are about to conquer. The Deuteronomic themes are classic: “taking care,” smashing Canaanite idols, God’s removing disease from the faithful Israelites, and the spelling-out of Israel’s future borders."
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Epilogue. The Future Conquest,Exodus 23:20-33,2,"Also to be remarked are the sevenfold repetition of “before you” as a stylistic unifying device, and the ending theme of serving YHWH as opposed to “their gods.”"
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Sealing the Covenant,Exodus 24:1-11,1,"To close out the account of covenant-making which began back in Chap. 19, the text recounts a formalized ceremony which has many points of contact with what was generally done throughout the ancient Near East when a covenant was “cut.” Twice Moshe reads God’s words to the people, and twice (vv.3, 7) they give their assent. This is no imposing of laws by a dictator, but a freely accepted, “signed, sealed, and delivered” agreement cemented by blood, the signifier of life itself."
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Sealing the Covenant,Exodus 24:1-11,2,"As representatives of the people, Moshe, Aharon, Aharon’s sons, and seventy elders ascend Mount Sinai, and, most remarkably, “see” God in some sort of vision—without, as one might expect, their being destroyed. They also eat and drink, as was customary in the sealing of the agreement (and often done in business to this day; see Gen. 31:44–54)."
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Moshe Ascends Alone,Exodus 24:12-18,1,"Finally, Moshe leaves the people, in order to receive the laws in permanent (stone) form. He “goes up” the mountain four times (or, most likely, is on his way up). In order to give his absence the weight it needs—so that the people will grow restless, setting up the situation that produces the Golden Calf in Chap. 32–the text will now turn to a completely different matter for fully seven chapters."
 III: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai,Exodus 19:1-24:18,Moshe Ascends Alone,Exodus 24:12-18,2,"The ending of this section anticipates the ending of the book of Exodus, with its mention of God’s “glory,” “dwelling,” “fire,” and “day/night.”"
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Coffer,Exodus 25:10-16,1,"The coffer or ark was a cult object of major importance in premonarchic and early monarchic Israel. In our text it contains the “Testimony” (i.e., the tablets with the Ten Words); in Josh. 3:14–15 it precedes the people into the Promised Land; in I Sam. 4:11–5:12 it is captured in battle but mysteriously wreaks havoc among the enemy (hence its cinematic offspring <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>). Finally, David’s transporting of it to Jerusalem (II Sam. 6) marks the formal establishment of that city as a holy one and as the capital of Israel."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Coffer,Exodus 25:10-16,2,"In Exodus the coffer literally plays a central role. It stands in the innermost recesses of the Tabernacle, at the sacred center. Considering what the coffer contained—tablets with God’s words on them rather than statues of gods—it addresses the primacy of divine word over divine representation in ancient Israelite thought."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Purgation-Cover,Exodus 25:17-22,1,"<i>Kapporet</i> here could indicate simply “cover,” yet its function goes beyond mere protection. The name of this central part of the above-cited central cult object may be a play on words. The Hebrew verb <i>kapper,</i> which occurs again later in these texts (see 29:33–37), often means “purge” or “purify”; earlier translators rendered it as “expiate” or even “propitiate,” and the <i>kapporet</i> as “mercy-seat” or “propitiatory.” The <i>kapporet</i> was apparently the holiest spot in the Israelite cult system, and it was there that God was said to speak his will to the people. This idea represents a remarkable shrinking and intimatizing process: the God who spoke to the assembled people, amid thunder, fire, and trembling earth at Sinai, now communicates with them from an area roughly the size of a small desk or table. In addition, there is a shift from a one-time event (Sinai) to the permanent fact of a sanctuary—a development which will later be repeated in Solomon’s Temple."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Table,Exodus 25:23-30,1,"The table and its implements, like some of the other features of the Tabernacle, are holdovers from a more blatantly pagan model, where the gods were seen to be in need of nourishment. By thus using conventions of worship common throughout the ancient Near East, Israel expressed its desire to serve God, even while it was aware that he was not the sort of deity who requires food and drink. It might also be mentioned that another common object found in ancient sanctuaries, a bed, has intentionally been omitted from our structure."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Lampstand,Exodus 25:31-40,1,"Despite the wealth of detail lavished on this striking symbol, its exact construction, like that of the Dwelling in general, remains unclear. The vocabulary used for its constituent parts comes from the realm of plants: shaft, stems, blossoms, almond shapes, etc. Indeed, the major latent symbol behind the lampstand is the tree—which appears in many forms and in almost all religions (Meyers). The tree as a symbol is to be found throughout human culture, in such diverse settings as Native American stories and Norse myths; in the ancient Near East it specifically connoted permanence, growth, and majesty—in other words, a reflection of the divine. If one adds to this range of meanings the function of the lampstand—illumination (which often implies not only the giving of physical light but also, as the English phrase has it, enlightenment)—the lampstand will be seen to emerge as an object with considerable evocative power. All these meanings may not have been immediately obvious and conscious to the ancient pilgrim or worshiper, but they periodically surfaced; the lampstand was ancient Judaism’s symbol of preference (judging from synagogue ruins) and not the “Star of David,” which, as Gershom Scholem has shown, was a medieval mystical addition."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Lampstand,Exodus 25:31-40,2,"The importance of the lampstand in our text is indicated by v.40, where the motif of God’s revealing the structure of a sacred object on the mountain is resumed. Its significance is also attested by its major material of construction: pure gold."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Dwelling Proper,Exodus 26:1-14,1,"The text describes the network of tapestries or curtains that comprise the structure itself, in two layers (vv.1–6 and 7–12), with two additional layers mentioned (v.14). The outer layers function to protect the inner ones from the elements, while the inner ones, true to the gradations of holiness previously mentioned, are more elaborate."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Framework,Exodus 26:15-30,1,"The rigid part of the Tabernacle structure, while described in some detail, leaves room for many questions about specifics (e.g., how exactly did the boards fit together? was there one corner board or two? is the text perhaps describing planks or frames?). What is most important, as mentioned above, is the sense of proportion and approach to the divine implied by symmetrical numbers."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Curtain and the Screen,Exodus 26:31-37,1,"Two hangings separate different parts of the Tabernacle: the curtain, which closes off the inner sanctum; and the screen, which separates tent and courtyard."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Altar,Exodus 27:1-8,1,"As Cassuto points out, Israelite worship, like that in surrounding cultures, would have been unthinkable without an altar for animal sacrifices. The one described here is a compromise between permanence and portability: it was hollow for transporting, to be filled in with earth at each encampment."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Altar,Exodus 27:1-8,2,"As with the lampstand, the exact construction of the object is to proceed along lines given to Moshe by God at Sinai."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Courtyard,Exodus 27:9-19,1,"Returning to the Tabernacle structure, the outer courtyard is laid out, composed of hangings and columns. Again, the numbers fit meaningfully together. Since we are dealing with the extremity of the Dwelling, the material used is the least precious: bronze."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Oil,Exodus 27:20-21,1,"The transition from structure to human institution (the priesthood) is accomplished by both the opening formula here, “Now you …,” and by the oil itself, which is here used for light but which will soon be spoken of (Chap. 29) as a major agent in the anointing of the priests."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Priestly Garments,Exodus 28:1-5,1,"As in the opening section on the Tabernacle itself (25:1–9), we are now given a listing of what is to come, the clothing in which the priests will perform their sacred functions. The purpose of the objects is mentioned again, this time at both the beginning and the end of the section."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Priestly Garments,Exodus 28:1-5,2,"In virtually all traditional religions such garments are of great importance, often signaling the status of the wearer as representative of the community (hence Aharon’s breastpiece in this chapter). An additional function, stressed in our account, is that the garments somehow reflect God himself, through the use of certain colors and/or materials. That the term “glory” is used to indicate their function—a key term in the book, and always applied to God, never to Moshe, for instance—signals what is at stake."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Efod,Exodus 28:6-14,1,"This garment, which here seems to be a kind of apron worn only by the high priest, is mentioned elsewhere in the Bible in connection with worship (e.g., Judg. 8:27), but with unclear meaning. Even here, the exact nature of the <i>efod</i> is not entirely certain; but what is cited is its function as the setting for the stones that symbolize the twelve tribes of Israel in God’s presence. This is followed by a description of chains, whose use is mentioned immediately thereafter."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Breastpiece,Exodus 28:15-30,1,"The central garment in this section is the breastpiece, which seems to be some sort of woven pouch or bag. On the outside it displays precious stones, each one engraved with the name of an Israelite tribe; inside, it holds the oracular objects known as <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tummin</i> (see the note to v.30, below). In this passage, which is cast in poetic form, the narrator appears to be drawing our attention to the specific function of the garments. Vv.29 and 30 repeat the phrase “over his/Aharon’s heart” (three times), “in the presence of Y<small>hwh</small>” (three times), and “regularly” (twice) to make clear their importance: Aharon represents the people whenever he officiates in the sanctuary, and bears the emblem of this office upon his very heart."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Tunic,Exodus 28:31-35,1,"Aharon’s tunic or shirt is notable for its design of bells and pomegranates, but even more for its protective function, supplied by actual bells, of maintaining the proper distance between Aharon and God in the sanctuary."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Head-Plate,Exodus 28:36-38,1,"Foremost among the symbols on Aharon’s garments is what he bears on his brow: a band with the words “Holiness for Y<small>hwh</small>.” It serves as a symbol of his efforts to obtain forgiveness on behalf of the Israelite people, one of his primary functions as priest. This function extends to cover even unintentional transgressions, such as accidents in the handling of sacred cultic objects."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,Other Priestly Garments,Exodus 28:39-43,1,"These include remaining vestments for Aharon and his sons, to the end that “they do not bear iniquity and die” (v.43)—a major concern of the priesthood, which viewed all impurities as ritually dangerous before God. Note the solemn ending of this passage: “—a law for the ages, for him and for his seed after him.”"
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Investiture Ceremony,Exodus 29:1-46,1,"Although the text still has a number of Tabernacle items to discuss, viz., the incense and its altar, other objects, and the commissioning of the artisans for the construction work, it naturally moves from describing the priestly garb to the ritual through which the priests are installed in their sacred office. First, sacrificial animals and bread are brought and prepared; then the priests are systematically clothed in their sacred vestments. After the first animal is slaughtered, its blood is dashed against the altar and the innards are burned as an offering; then the second ram is slain, and its blood is placed on the priests’ extremities, to purify them. Blood is sprinkled on the priests’ garments; then they hold up the fat-parts and breast of the ram, and follow by offering it up. Then the priests eat the cooked flesh of a special ram, the remains of which are to be burnt. Finally, the altar is purified."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Investiture Ceremony,Exodus 29:1-46,2,"After the regular sacrifice is specified (vv.38–41), the section ends with a powerful meditation on the purpose of the Tabernacle: “hallow” occurs three times, and “dwell” twice. In a word: by “meeting” with the Children of Israel at the Tent, God’s glory makes tent, altar, priests, and most important, the people of Israel, holy. Indeed, the root <i>kaddesh</i>, “holy,” occurs numerous times in the chapter, presaging its multiple use in the next book, Leviticus."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Incense Altar,Exodus 30:1-10,1,"This altar, which is not mentioned again, is seen by some as a later interpolation (DeVaux 1965): here it links up with what has gone before through the theme of purging (purification), in v. 10. For more on the incense itself, see vv. 22ff., below."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,Census and Ransom,Exodus 30:11-16,1,"Continuing the theme of purgation, divine command provides for a ransom to be given to the priests, in order to remove (“purge away”) sin incurred by census-taking."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,Census and Ransom,Exodus 30:11-16,2,"The idea that numbering the people could bring down the wrath of God is portrayed in most striking fashion in II Sam. 24:1–9, where David usurps God’s prerogative in numbering the men for military purposes, leading to a plague among the people. It seems that a census was viewed as a dangerous undertaking, perhaps analogous to the taking of photographs among certain peoples (which is felt to be threatening to one’s essence). One who can number, can control (Gaster 1969)."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Basin,Exodus 30:17-21,1,"Returning to the familiar stylistic pattern of the Tabernacle account, “You are to make …,” we are told of the basin in which the priests washed. Yet this brief aside links up with the motif of protection from death that was encountered earlier (see 28:35)."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Anointing Oil,Exodus 30:22-33,1,"“Holy” is once again heard as a key word, both in the sense of making something sacred and in the sense of being reserved for special use only. Oil was used in many ancient cultures for positive purposes; elsewhere in the Bible, of course, it played its role in the anointing of kings and prophets, as well as the courteous treatment of guests and after bathing. Oil, then, carried with it connotations of brightness (see Ps. 104:15) and life itself."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Incense,Exodus 30:34-38,1,"This particular incense, warns the text, was to be used only for the sanctuary and not for everyday purposes."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Incense,Exodus 30:34-38,2,"The offering-up of incense was a feature common to worship all over the ancient Near East. At least two reasons have been advanced for its use: purification, and a fragrance pleasing to the deity. It is also curious how our text speaks of God’s being with the Israelites as a column of cloud and of fire; the incense smoke might also then be reminiscent of this divine manifestation."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,Craftsmen,Exodus 31:1-11,1,"As the Tabernacle account opened with a summary description of what was to be constructed, so it ends, with some names added. The craftsmen for the task, Betzalel and Oholiav, are depicted as “wise” (Heb. <i>hakham</i>), that is, skilled; they will make what Moshe has been given to see."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Sabbath,Exodus 31:12-17,1,"<i>The Tablets</i> (31:18): As a reminder of the Sabbath’s importance amid all the anticipated construction activity, the Israelites are now commanded to observe the holy day. The section is also a prelude to the Golden Calf story, which will be concerned with improper “making”; and “make” appears in a variety of different contexts."
 IV: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult,Exodus 25:1-31:18,The Sabbath,Exodus 31:12-17,2,"A second prelude draws the initial Tabernacle section to a close. Moshe receives God’s word engraved in stone, by God himself; this will presumably be deposited in the “coffer” of which the text spoke in its opening chapter (25). But the section is forward-looking as well, in that the tablets will play a dramatic role in the story immediately following this passage."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,The Sin of the Molten Calf,Exodus 32:1-6,1,"We have spent twelve chapters—a major portion of the book of Exodus—dwelling on the heights of Sinai; we have witnessed revelation, law-giving, the command to build a shelter for the presence of God, and the establishment of a priestly cult. But now, as Moshe prepares to descend from the mountain, we are reminded of the other side of the coin: the real world of human frailty. This has occurred before, at the very same site: in Chaps. 19 and 20 we observed a fearfulness on the part of the people toward getting too close to the divine, as a power too awesome to deal with. Now the fear goes the other way, and, with the disappearance of Moshe, the intermediary, turns to despair. The very thing that had been warned against in the Decalogue (and hence, the first of the terms of the covenant)—the making of a “carved-image/or any figure/that is … on the earth beneath” (20:4), and bowing down to it (20:5)—takes place here, requested by the people in their hour of need. It is abetted by, of all people, their divine spokesman and priest, Aharon."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,The Sin of the Molten Calf,Exodus 32:1-6,2,"Some scholars have sought to soften the sin of the calf by claiming that the Israelites did not view it as an idol but rather merely as a representation of the divine. This does not seem to be borne out by the text, either in the Decalogue or later in the Jeroboam incident, which is often equated with the most heinous crimes (see I Kings 16:26)."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,Response: God’s Anger,Exodus 32:7-14,1,"Now that the people have committed what amounts to a capital crime, the issue at stake is what the punishment shall be. After informing the unsuspecting Moshe of what has taken place down below, with the words “<i>your</i> people [italics mine] … has wrought ruin” (v.7), God indicates his intent to destroy Israel, and to found a new nation beginning with Moshe. However, early Jewish tradition already sensed that something deeper might be happening here. The phrase “let me be” (Heb. <i>hanniha li</i>), it has been observed, suggests that God actually wishes Moshe to argue with him, and this is supported by his acquiescence in record time (v.14). Indeed, the text never says “God’s anger flared up,” reserving that key verb for Moshe (v.19). What we learn from this section is not only God’s forgiving nature but something significant about Moshe: faced with a dictator’s dream—the cloning of an entire nation from himself—he opts for staunchly defending the very people who have already caused him grief through their rebelling, and who will continually do so in the ensuing wanderings. And he does not even eschew blackmail to attain his goal. His argument in v.12, that the Egyptians will jeer at this God who liberated a people only to kill them in the wilderness, rings truer in a pagan context than in the Bible. But the next verse reveals Moshe’s vision: he knows that his task is to continue the foundation established by the Patriarchs and to assure the continuity that has been imperiled so many times before."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,Response: Moshe’s Anger,Exodus 32:15-29,1,"In a sense, the text backtracks chronologically here, to focus solely on Moshe. The first four verses are prefatory but important. Possibly to set the drama of the scene to follow, Moshe is described as carrying the “tablets of the Testimony,” which are dubbed the work of God. Yet another point is being made: the work of God is contrasted with the imperfect work of human beings, the law with its hope versus the idol with its underlying despair."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,Response: Moshe’s Anger,Exodus 32:15-29,2,"Sounds of revelry, implied as being worse than sounds of war, reach Moshe, and upon his descent into the Israelite camp he loses control. But smashing the tablets has implications beyond the emotional: it is a legal voiding of the covenant (as in the English “breaking an agreement”). Moshe deals with all concerned in swift succession: the calf is destroyed, Aharon is confronted, and the people are brutally purged."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,Response: Moshe’s Anger,Exodus 32:15-29,3,"It is possible that there are historical considerations behind this section. Some see the portrayal of Aharon, who certainly comes across as weak, as part of a strain in the political thinking of a later period. According to this view, the later decline of Aharon’s priestly line is reflected in his behavior here. Others see the “mandating” of the Levites (v.29) as a reflection of a later power struggle among the priestly classes in Israel. Childs finds Aharon’s role in the story to be a literary one: he is a foil for Moshe. Aharon is willing to capitulate to the people, seeing them (perhaps realistically) as “set-on-evil” (v.22). Moshe holds fast to his dream of a “kingdom of priests” (19:6) and thus demands of himself a type of leadership that cannot compromise. The Calf story, then, focuses not only on the great crime of idolatry but also on the nature of Moshe as leader. It is the resumption of the biblical portrait of Moshe, which will return again with greatest force throughout the book of Numbers."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,After the Purge,Exodus 32:30-33:6,1,"Although blood has been spilled to punish the guilty, Moshe must still expiate Israel’s sin. In this vein, he offers to be erased from God’s “record” if the people are not forgiven. Then commences God’s reply, couched in terms of who will lead the people to the Promised Land. He will not do it himself, as previously (see the glorious image of 13:21–22), but through the agency of a “messenger.” He will fulfill his promise to the Patriarchs, but not himself among his “hard-necked” people. Their “sin” (the word occurs eight times in vv.30–34) has destroyed that possibility."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,After the Purge,Exodus 32:30-33:6,2,"An interesting chord is struck at the end. Israel must strip themselves of their ornaments, the spoils of battle, as it were, from the Egyptians. Those ornaments had been used to build the Calf. The final note is ominous: God is yet to decide “what to do with you,” reminiscent perhaps of another scene with identical wording—2:4, where Moshe’s sister had followed the little-ark downstream, “to know what would be done to him.” In both cases, the people of Israel stand on the brink of disaster, saved only by divine intervention."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,Moshe at the Tent,Exodus 33:7-11,1,"This brief digression seems to function as support for Moshe’s role, so important in the book as a whole and in this story in particular. Only one who is accustomed to speaking to God face to face can effect forgiveness for Israel’s crime."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,Moshe’s Plea and God’s Answer,Exodus 33:12-34:3,1,"Continuing the dialogue with God from 32:34f., Moshe now pleads that what is necessary is nothing less than the personal assurance that God will lead the people. Six times the verb “know” echoes, along with repetitions of “pray” and “favor”—and so the issue at hand is intimacy and the bonded relationship of covenant. Significantly, also, Moshe refers to Israel three times as “your people,” trying to force God to acknowledge them as his own once more. Answering Moshe’s request for intimacy, God agrees to let him get close, but with limits, and we are reminded of Sinai once more (see the boundary-setting in 19:12–13, 21ff.). The earlier revelation scene is about to be replayed, in altered form—most notably, without the people themselves present."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,God Reveals Himself,Exodus 34:4-9,1,"This passage is another one of the climaxes of the book, of which I spoke in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above. In contrast to the scenes given in other ancient literatures, where, for instance, the texts speak of a physical brightness too great to bear, or of epic descriptions of the gods, our passage is remarkably brief and devoid of physical description. All that is ventured here is a statement of God’s essence, or, more precisely, of his essence for human beings: merciful but just. This image, which had such a great influence on the development of Christianity and Islam as well as Judaism, is of the highest importance in the understanding of the biblical God; it is almost as if the text is saying “This is all that can be known, intimately, of this God, and this is all one needs to know.” There is no shape, no natural manifestation (in contrast to the thunder and lightning approach at Sinai—but one should bear in mind what has just happened with the Calf): only words, which describe God’s relationship to human beings."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,God Reveals Himself,Exodus 34:4-9,2,"Moshe hastens, at the climactic moment, to plead on behalf of the people. Most curious is the fact that God does not seem to agree to “go in their midst,” nor does he ever give in and reinstate Israel with the term “my people” (see v.10). Nevertheless, it appears that the rift between deity and people has been satisfactorily repaired, given what comes next."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,The New Covenant,Exodus 34:10-28,1,"A preamble (vv.10–16) promises God’s continued “wonders” and warns emphatically against Israel’s mixing with the Canaanites upon its future possession of the land. Once the actual legislative content of the passage begins in v.17, one notes the continuation of the stylistic pattern which began with v.10: Deuteronomic language. The laws bespeak an agricultural society, not a nomadic one, and suggest that the warning against blending with Canaanite society may be from the perspective of a later period—an Israel long settled in the land. Although some scholars see Egypt as the origin of the Calf symbol, it also has a well-known existence in Canaanite mythology, as a symbol of Baal, god of fertility. Therefore the connection between our text and that of Kings may be close indeed, and the Calf story may have had a very contemporary ring to later audiences."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,The New Covenant,Exodus 34:10-28,2,"As is typical of the Calf narrative, our passage concludes, not only with wider issues—the formal writing-down of the covenant—but also with Moshe: that he neither ate nor drank during the encounter with God. We see the story both from its inception and its end concerned with the man whose task it must be to bring the divine word to the Israelite people."
 V: the Covenant Broken and Restored,Exodus 32:1-34:35,Moshe Radiant,Exodus 34:29-35,1,"As if to underscore the point just made, and like the Tent section in Chap. 33, the Calf account ends with a focus on Moshe’s leadership. Gone is any reference to the molten image; the central concern is the effect of God’s communication upon Moshe. Indeed, “speak” occurs seven times here, and the formula “the skin of Moshe’s face was radiating” three times. Putting this section at the end of the narrative leaves the reader with the sense that Moshe’s prayer for God’s closeness in Chap. 33 has at last been answered, and that his very body now bears the sign of divine favor (note the use of the rich symbol of light). Communication between God and Moshe, with Israel witnessing and therefore involved again (in contrast to its removal from this activity at the beginning of Chap. 32), may now proceed again without interruption, and it will now be possible and appropriate to resume construction of the structure whose purpose it is to embody God’s presence in the world of human beings."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,The Sabbath Restated,Exodus 35:1-3,1,"Bracketing the Calf Narrative, we return to the regulations concerning the Sabbath, which receive here a different explanation from what was given in 31:12–17. There the stress was on the symbolic nature of the Sabbath day, but in the present context no reason for observance is given. Cassuto understands this as a clarification of the rules of “making” as the Dwelling is about to be constructed."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,The Contribution Restated,Exodus 35:4-19,1,"The theme returns to that of the opening of the Tabernacle account in Chap. 25, with a list of what was to be brought for the “work of the Dwelling.”"
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Preparations for the Construction,Exodus 35:20-36:7,1,"The account of what the Israelites brought as contributions for the work, and the description of those who were to carry it out, is long and repetitive. This factor, with the addition of a refrainlike pattern of key words (e.g., “mind,” “willing,” “service,” “work,” “wise,” “design,” “brought”), strongly portrays the people’s enthusiasm for and participation in the sacred task. Note also the fourteenfold occurrence of “every/all/entire” (Heb. <i>kol</i>) in vv.20–29. Vv.3–7 push the narrative to a crescendo, with the people actually bringing much more than is needed (and may also be a contrast to their briefly stated surrendering of jewels in the Calf episode, 32:3)."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Dwelling II,Exodus 36:8-19,1,Missing here (cf. 26:1–14) is the description of how the tapestries were to be joined to the boards; the section pertains to the actual making of the tapestries.
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Boards II,Exodus 36:20-34,1,"In reference to 26:15–30, the present text has omitted the command to erect the entire structure. The passage is limited in a manner similar to the previous section."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Curtain and Screen II,Exodus 36:35-38,1,"Again (cf. 26:31–37), only the making of the objects themselves is described, not their positioning within the Tabernacle."

 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Altar II,Exodus 38:1-7,1,"Parallel to 27:1–8, the major omission is “to receive its ashes” (27:3), which does not relate to the actual construction."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Basin and Pedestal II,Exodus 38:8,1,"Only one line is used to record the making of the basin; the parallel account in 30:17–21 says much more about its function. There is a brief allusion in this verse about the “mirrors” which were the raw material for the basin; Cassuto (1967) sees this as a contemporary citing of what must have been a well-known tradition about the special contribution of the Israelite women, above and beyond the official contributions listed in Chap. 35."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Courtyard II,Exodus 38:9-20,1,"Corresponding to 27:9–19, there are a number of wording divergencies from the earlier passage, but none of these is particularly significant."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Accountings,Exodus 38:21-31,1,"A new section enters here, continuing to achieve the effect of impressing the audience. Previously the reader was to be struck by the Israelites’ zeal in piling up contributions for the new sanctuary (36:3–7); now, toward the end of the actual construction work, there is a full accounting of the considerable material that went into it. The list follows the standard order of value: gold, silver, and bronze."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Garments II,Exodus 39:1,1,"Although in scribal tradition this verse is connected to the previous section, it makes sense as the start of a new one, as it concludes with what will now be in one form or another the refrain to the end of the book: “as YHWH had commanded Moshe” (see also vv.5, 21, 26, 29, 31, 32, 42, 43; then 40:16, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and 32)."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Efod and Breastpiece II,Exodus 39:2-21,1,"Corresponding to 28:6–30, the account of how these garments were constructed conforms to the previous pattern: their function “for remembrance” and more, so movingly laid out in Chap. 28, is not mentioned."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Tunic II,Exodus 39:22-26,1,"Parallel to 28:31–35, this account leaves out the protective function of the tunic cited in 28:35."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Other Priestly Garments II,Exodus 39:27-29,1,"The parallel text is 28:39–43. This passage should come after the section on the head-plate, as was the case in the earlier passages; Cassuto (1967) explains the inversion as characteristic of the construction texts—all the weaving is to take place together."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Head-Plate II,Exodus 39:30-31,1,"Characteristically, the function of the plate is omitted (cf. 28:36–38)."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,The Completion of the Parts: Bringing Them to Moshe,Exodus 39:32-43,1,"The listing of all the elements of the Dwelling fittingly closes the account of their construction, with a certain grandeur, and, because of the pace, even a certain excitement. The key term “service (of construction)” occurs three times."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,The Completion of the Parts: Bringing Them to Moshe,Exodus 39:32-43,2,"More significant is what has long been noted: the literal parallels between our section and the initial creation story in Genesis (see, for instance, Leibowitz and Sarna 1986). The phrases “Thus was finished …” (v.32), “And Moshe saw all the work: and here, they had made it” (v.43), and “Then Moshe blessed them” (v.43), echo “Thus were finished …” (Gen. 2:1), “Now God saw all that he had made,/and here: it was exceedingly good” (Gen. 1:31), and “God gave the seventh day his blessing” (Gen. 2:3). At the end of the passage describing the erection of the Tabernacle, there is an additional parallel: “So Moshe finished the work” (40:33); cf. Gen. 2:2: “God had finished … his work.” The close parallels suggest what we find in the case of many cultures: human building, especially (but not exclusively) of sanctuaries, is to be viewed as an act of imitating God. The Israelites, at the close of the book chronicling their founding as a people, link up with God’s scheme in creating the world. The Dwelling is therefore a reflection of the perfection of the world and the divine hand that oversees it. Yet neither the people nor Moshe pronounces the Genesis words “it was (exceedingly) good” over the sanctuary; that would be human <i>hubris</i>."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Final Instructions: Setting Up,Exodus 40:1-16,1,"Most prominent in God’s commands to erect the Tabernacle are two related verbs: “hallow” and “anoint,” each of which occurs in one form or another eight times here. So the major theme here is not the actual building, but dedication for a purpose. Included in this section, as it was in Part IV, is the appointment of Aharon and his sons to “be-priests.”"
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,Final Instructions: Setting Up,Exodus 40:1-16,2,"The completion of the sanctuary takes place, appropriately, on the first day of what was the month of the exodus a year earlier; it is also ten months after the people reached Sinai. The dedication thus combines the ideas of sacred space and sacred time."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,The Implementation,Exodus 40:17-33,1,"Meaningfully, the formula “as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe” ends each of the seven paragraphs that describe the erection of the Dwelling."
 Vi: the Building of the Dwelling,Exodus 35:1-40:38,The End: God’s Glory,Exodus 40:34-38,1,"The book ends, not with a paean to the completed structure or its builders, but with a description of how its purpose was fulfilled. Central is the “cloud,” basically synonymous with God’s “Glory,” which now dwells among the people of Israel. At the end of the book of Exodus, which began with a people in servitude to an earthly god-king, we find a people that has completed one aspect of service to a divine king, ready to set forth on their journey to a Promised Land in the company of the king’s inextinguishable presence."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Varied Sacrificial Offerings I,Leviticus 1:1-17,1,"The first chapter begins with a description of the <i>ola</i>, the “offering-up,” which appears throughout the Bible as a standard sacrifice, frequently preceding others. It is characterized by being totally burned on the altar, and functions essentially to bring human beings to the attention of God and to win his acceptance. So the offering-up does not deal with sin, as later sacrifices do (Wenham)."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Varied Sacrificial Offerings I,Leviticus 1:1-17,2,"This opening chapter of the book sets the standard pattern for the first seven chapters concerned with sacrifices. It lays out general rules about the preparation and presentation of the offerings; from 7:38 on and throughout the rest of the Torah, specific applications and how they work will be explained (Anderson). Enumerated are the kind of animal to be sacrificed (in order of value, and hence indicating that rich and poor alike have access to the system); the personal participation of the worshiper; and the tasks of the priests. Many of the phrases recur throughout the opening chapters of the book, but the main refrain is the concluding “fire-offering of soothing savor for Y<small>HWH</small>.” Three kinds of animals appear here; they are, again, all domesticated."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Varied Sacrificial Offerings II,Leviticus 2:1-16,1,"The <i>minha</i>, understood earlier in the Bible as simply “tribute” or “gift” (cf. Gen. 4:3 and 32:14), comes in the priestly texts to indicate specifically an offering of grain. Using a three-part structure of grain cooked in an oven/griddle/pan, paralleling Chap, 1’s cattle/sheep/birds, the description of the <i>minha</i> focuses on the type of grain offered, what is added to it, the strictures against fermenting, and the “covenant of salt.” The chapter ends with the usual refrain, “a fire-offering for Y<small>HWH</small>.”"
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Varied Sacrificial Offerings III,Leviticus 3:1-17,1,"The purpose of the so-called <i>shalom</i> sacrifice has been debated. Levine, for one, sees it as a “sacred gift of greeting,” intended to address God in the fellowship of other laypeople and priests at a sacred meal. This communal, lay aspect of the sacrifice is significant. Some scholars have understood animal sacrifice to be essentially humanity’s way of bonding with the gods (as well as with dead ancestors), and would thus see in the present form, with its emphasis on the meat, an example of this idea."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Varied Sacrificial Offerings III,Leviticus 3:1-17,2,"Unlike the obligatory sacrifices, the shalom sacrifice accepts a variety of animals, and the rules regarding them are not as stringent. Some theorize that originally all meat-eating in ancient Israel was of this type."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Varied Sacrificial Offerings III,Leviticus 3:1-17,3,"Once again, we have the division into larger and smaller domestic animals. Notable is the descriptive refrain regarding the disposal of the animals’ innards."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings I,Leviticus 4:1-35,1,"The first of these, the <i>hattat</i>, is the subject of voluminous recent debate among scholars. Formerly translated as “sin-offering,” it is now (thanks to Milgrom) understood more accurately as a purification offering in a variety of settings. The <i>hattat</i> decontaminates the sanctuary, and apparently individuals as well, and so is extraordinarily important in Israelite cultic thinking and practice. B-R rendered it (as have others) as a “de-sin offering,” which, while inelegant, preserves the biblical connection between sin (moral pollution) and ritual pollution. Again the sacrifice involves a multiple structure, dealing with the different components of the community: priests, community as a whole, leaders, and individuals. The High Priest’s ritual is more elaborate than those that follow, as befits the representative of the community. Once his ritual is complete, we encounter for the other parties the refrain “and he/they shall be granted-pardon.”"
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings I,Leviticus 4:1-35,2,"Central to the <i>hattat</i>-offering is the use of its blood as a detergent to absorb and purify the pollution that has accrued in the sanctuary. As a prime signifier of life, it will have this function a number of times in the Torah."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings II,Leviticus 5:1-26,1,"The last sacrifice described in these opening chapters is the <i>asham</i>, variously translated as “guilt-offering” and (more recently) “reparation-offering.” Its use varies, but can involve financial restitution for wrongdoing. There is disagreement about whether the verb means “to feel guilt” (Milgrom) or “to realize guilt”; in any event, the sacrifice deals with the realm of blame/liability, especially in cases of unintentional wrongdoing. Notable in this chapter are several refrains: “and the priest is to effect-purgation for him from his sin,” “it is a <i>hattat</i>-offering” (which returns here), and “he shall be granted-pardon.”"
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Instructions on Disposing of Sacrifices I,Leviticus 6:1-23,1,"What happened to the sacrifices after their being offered belongs to the category of what Hallo calls “consumption”—that is, a complex system of either nonuse (burning), “payment” for the priests (eating), or permission for the worshiper to eat. Here again we encounter a threefold structure corresponding to groups of three sacrifices. This time, however, the order adopted depends on the frequency of the sacrifice, from daily to voluntary (Wenham). The chapter also introduces the important word <i>tora</i> (conventionally spelled <i>Torah</i>), “instruction,” which will recur at key points throughout the first half of Leviticus. It apparently originally meant “[priestly] rules/instructions,” but later came to connote portions of Moses’ teachings (especially Deuteronomy) and eventually the Five Books of Moses as a whole."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Instructions on Disposal of Sacrifices II,Leviticus 7:1-38,1,The first part of the chapter concerns the eating of three more categories of sacrifice. Vv.16–27 demonstrate the extreme caution regarding lay consumption. The ending (vv.37–38) provides a summary (which mentions a “mandate-offering” not described in this chapter!) and phraseology that usually occurs at the end of a book or major section in the Torah: “which Y<small>HWH</small> commanded Moshe at Mount Sinai … in the wilderness of Sinai.”
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Installing the Priests,Leviticus 8:1-36,1,"This chapter and the next, which might easily have followed the instructions for it in Ex. 29, has instead been placed here, perhaps as the logical conclusion to material about offering sacrifices. (Placing it at the end of Exodus might also have detracted from the impressive scene with which that book ends. For a discussion of the complex relationship between the Exodus and Leviticus texts, see Milgrom.) We now shift from a prescriptive mode to a descriptive, narrative one, which will prepare us for the brief but disastrous story of Aharon’s sons in Chap. 10."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Installing the Priests,Leviticus 8:1-36,2,"A refrain here is various forms of “as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe,” also a key phrase in the Exodus texts. In addition, one hears the constant use of the verb “make-holy,” appropriate in this context. Finally, one might point to the balance between Moshe’s sequence of action in Chap. 8 and Aharon’s parallel actions in Chap. 9."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Installing the Priests,Leviticus 8:1-36,3,"There is much in this chapter that is rhythmic. The description of Aharon’s being clothed in the holy vestments in vv.7–9 has the ring of ritual to it, as conveyed through its steady alternation of verb and garment."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Installation Continued: The System in Operation,Leviticus 9:1-24,1,"Until now, the description of sacrifices has been largely from the viewpoint of the worshiper. Now the perspective changes to narrative, and is from the viewpoint of the priests—with the recognition at the same time that it is a public ceremony. Again, as Milgrom has noted, there is no verbal component to the ceremony (although some have argued that it is inconceivable that sacrifices could have been offered in silence). The sacrifice of the <i>hattat</i>-offering, along with other types of offerings, once again suggests the importance of a purified, perfect system in the worship of God."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Installation Continued: The System in Operation,Leviticus 9:1-24,2,"The refrain in vv.4 and 6 concerns God’s “being-seen” by the Israelites; what is in fact seen is his “Glory” or “aura,” reminiscent of Mount Sinai and the completion of the Dwelling in the book of Exodus. The ending of the chapter also recalls the ending of Exodus, with the leaders blessing the people and fire proceeding from God."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Systems Failure,Leviticus 10:1-20,1,"As so often in the Torah, a brief narrative breaks in at this point, apparently to illustrate the dangers associated with the priests’ tasks that we have just celebrated in the previous chapter. Just as the sin of the Golden Calf followed scenes of revelation at Sinai, so here too we are taken from the pomp of the priests’ installation and set face to face with human failure. Alternatively, the story could be explained as a lead-in to the laws on priestly behavior in vv.9–11, just as the Golden Calf story precedes a remade covenant in Ex. 34."
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Systems Failure,Leviticus 10:1-20,2,"What exactly was Nadav and Avihu’s capital crime? Commentators over the ages have argued back and forth. Some see it as accidental: Nadav and Avihu somehow misconstrued what they were supposed to do—but divine service can brook no errors on the part of the people’s representatives. Other interpreters, taking their clue from v.9, feel that Nadav and Avihu were drunk and so not in full control of their ritual duties. Milgrom’s suggestion, that the story serves to warn the Israelite audience to stay away from offering their own incense (which often was connected to idolatry), makes historical sense; but the context of the tale here, after what has gone before, makes the specific crime less important than the idea that the priests must in general “get it right.”"
 I: the Cult and the Priesthood,Leviticus 1:1-10:20,Systems Failure,Leviticus 10:1-20,3,"The chapter has a three-part structure: crime/punishment/mourning; laws on drunkenness of priests and the proper disposal of the sacrifices; and a confrontation between Moshe and Aharon over ritual procedure, which is resolved, not by death but by reasoned discussion."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,The Dietary Rules,Leviticus 11:1-47,1,"After ten chapters devoted mainly to cultic rules, we move from the priestly altar to everyone’s table—a fine example of the dual concerns of Leviticus (later Judaism was in fact to dub the table an “altar in miniature,” taking literally the injunction in Exodus for Israel to become a “kingdom of priests”). The chapter, as mentioned in “On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure,” functions as a bridge between the first two parts of the book. As Hallo notes, it rounds out the question of consuming food, a major issue in sacrifices; it also introduces the motif of pollution in a systematic way (there were references to it in regard to sacrifices, but not in as full a manner). The use of “Instruction” in v.46 echoes the summaries of sacrifices in Chap. 7, while “you are to separate” in v.47 links the chapter with the previous one. Looking forward, “Instruction” is also used in the pollution chapters that follow, and the fivefold repetition of “hallow/holy” in vv.44–45 even points us toward the major section on Holiness in the third part of the book."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,The Dietary Rules,Leviticus 11:1-47,2,"It should be noted that, from vv.24–40, eating is not the issue, but rather coming into contact with the carcass of a <i>tamei</i> animal. The two areas are joined with the introduction of “swarming” creatures in vv.41–44, and the whole chapter concludes with a call to “separation.”"
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,The Dietary Rules,Leviticus 11:1-47,3,"Refrains are many, giving the chapter a more poetic structure than one would expect from such a list: “it is <i>tamei</i> for you,” “it is a detestable-thing for you,” “it is an abominable-thing,” “according to its kind,” “<i>tamei</i> until sunset.” The overwhelmingly negative character of the refrains serves to drum in caution and promote avoidance."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,The Dietary Rules,Leviticus 11:1-47,4,"Many of the animals on the lists of Lev. 11 are familiar, but it must be stressed that, as with plant and place-names in the Bible, a number of the precise identifications have been lost to us, and educated guesses are in order."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,Pollution from Childbirth,Leviticus 12:1-8,1,"This chapter, which is in chiastic relation to Chap. 15, designates a new mother as <i>tamei</i>, most likely due to her intimate contact with the life/death boundary during childbirth. Her separation from and reintegration into the community echo similar customs in many societies (see Bamberger); as often happens with life-cycle events, ritual here reflects what is happening psychologically. The doubling of the separation period when it is a girl that is born is best explained by the concept that a girl potentially doubles the “life-leak” that has taken place (Greenstein 1984a), since she will one day be a childbearing woman who will herself confront the life-death continuum."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,Pollution from Childbirth,Leviticus 12:1-8,2,"While men obviously do not contract ritual pollution through childbirth, the concept of pollution from bodily discharges applies to them as well, as in the case of an involuntary emission of semen (cf. Chap. 15)."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,Pollution from Childbirth,Leviticus 12:1-8,3,"<i>Pollution from</i> Tzaraat (13): Notable in this chapter is the role of the priest, who functions neither as medicine man nor as doctor, but simply as a religious official whose duty it is to check the afflicted person for signs of what is considered ritually polluting, and to act accordingly."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,Pollution from Childbirth,Leviticus 12:1-8,4,"Like other sections of Leviticus, this chapter and the next show signs of editing (for instance, the material in 13:47–59). Nevertheless, there is a clear structural pattern characterized by variations of “when … if … if” (Wenham)."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,Pollution from Childbirth,Leviticus 12:1-8,5,"The chapter’s character as “instruction manual” is brought out, according to Fishbane (1974), by its chiastic structure. It is built on three word-groups: (1) “swelling,” (2) “scab/spread,” (3) “shiny-spot” that recur in vv.4–38 (in the form: 3,2,1; 1,2,3; 3,2,1; 2,3). This “unexpected structure” (especially in a nonliterary text), he maintains, may have had the function of easing memorization for the priests, who needed to know this material for their “fieldwork.”"
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,Polluting Discharges,Leviticus 15:1-33,1,"This chapter concerns genital discharges—both those that arise from disease and those that are normal but involuntary. As Levine notes, sexual purity was crucial for approaching the Israelite sanctuary, as opposed to ancient Near Eastern rituals in general, where sexuality was frequently part and parcel of the worship of the gods."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,Polluting Discharges,Leviticus 15:1-33,2,"Such pollution was considered much more contagious than that we have encountered previously, which is not surprising, given the area in which it falls. Wenham has noted the chiastic structure here, with male and female interchanging with short-term and long-term events. The core (vv.16–24)—the normal flows of seminal emissions for men and menstrual discharge from women—contrasts with discharges resulting from disease (vv.2–12, 25–27). The former merely pollute until sunset (except for the case of a couple having intercourse during the wife’s period), and thus demonstrate the modesty and restraint in matters of divine worship more than pointing to some kind of stigma per se."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,The Day of Purgation/Atonement,Leviticus 16:1-34,1,"This chapter forms the climax of the section that began in Chap. 11. It is, along with Num. 19, the purification ritual par excellence, and has received much attention throughout the ages. As modern commentators have pointed out, two things are happening here: first, the sanctuary is being purged of the ritual pollution that has accumulated from both priests and laypeople; and second, the accumulated sins of the community are receiving atonement. It is not surprising, therefore, that the chapter is built on different uses of the verb <i>kipper</i>, which can denote covering, purging, atonement (expiation), or ransom; here the two meanings “purging” and “atoning” seem to fit the double context best. Probably the “purging” part is the earlier one, as many ancient Near Eastern cults utilized purification ceremonies for their sanctuaries."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,The Day of Purgation/Atonement,Leviticus 16:1-34,2,"Appropriately, the ritual includes two processes, outlined by Levine: riddance, which involves transferring sin to a living creature and driving it outside the community into the uninhabited wilderness, and purification, which utilizes the blood of a sacrifice (rather like the <i>hattat</i> encountered previously in the book). Both rituals are conducted largely by Aharon, who as High Priest acts on behalf of the entire community."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,The Day of Purgation/Atonement,Leviticus 16:1-34,3,"Later Judaism was fascinated by these rites; a detailed account of how they were to be conducted in postbiblical times has survived in the Mishnah (ed. c. 200), and a narrative version is still verbally reenacted by traditional Jews once a year on the Day of Atonement."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,The Day of Purgation/Atonement,Leviticus 16:1-34,4,"The chapter opens with direct mention of the deaths of Nadav and Avihu (Chap. 10). This serves at least two purposes: first, it creates a bracket into which the Leviticus texts on pollution occur; and second, it reminds the audience of the pressing need to purify the sanctuary, whose very first recorded defilement came about as a result of the illegitimate act of Aharon’s sons."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,On the Shedding of Animal Blood,Leviticus 17:1-16,1,"This chapter appears to be either an appendix to the first two parts of the book (sacrifices and purity) or a transition between them and the chapters on “holiness.” It must be said, however, that it does not use the standard wording of the holiness chapters. The text deals with the Israelites’ slaughtering of animals for food outside the sanctuary (“Dwelling”), insisting instead that such killing take place “at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.” In contrast, Deut. 12:20ff. permits the slaughtering of animals for meat without bringing them to the sanctuary—provided that their blood is poured out (since the consumption of blood is universally prohibited in the Torah). Scholars disagree about which practice came first; some (e.g., Wenham) argue for a wilderness setting here, while others see the chapter as reflecting the antipagan feelings of postexilic Israel (Bamberger; cf. v.7). Whatever the provenance, our chapter is clear about the extraordinary power of blood in Israelite thinking. As the life, which belongs to God, it must be returned to him, either actually, at the altar, or symbolically, on the ground (Greenstein 1984a). Here it is seen as effecting ransom; the life of the sacrificial animal substitutes for that of the sacrificer (cf. “On Sacrifice,” above). The upshot is that the taking of animal life is done with extreme awareness and care."
 II: Ritual Pollution and Purification,Leviticus 11:1-17:16,On the Shedding of Animal Blood,Leviticus 17:1-16,2,"The chapter is built at least partially on repeating sound patterns. A threefold refrain is “that man is to be cut off from his kinspeople,” stressing the seriousness of the prohibition. Four times we hear “any-man, any-man” (Heb. <i>ish ish</i>), reinforcing the unusually broad scope of the command indicated by the beginning of the chapter (“to Aharon and to his sons and to all the Children of Israel”). Finally, in v.10 through 15, the word <i>nefesh</i> occurs nine times, with the alternating meanings of “person” and “life” (the pattern is 1–3–1–3–1 in these meanings)."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Pollution from Forbidden Unions,Leviticus 18:1-30,1,"Now begin, thematically and stylistically, the chapters on holiness. Like much of this final section of the book, Chap. 18 is distinguished by its powerful use of rhetoric (cf. vv.3–5, similar in tone to much of Deuteronomy). Separation returns as a major theme, this time stressing the divide between Israel and the nations around (vv.3 and 27–30). The emphasis on sexuality mirrors that on food in Chap. 11; the two often reflect each other in culture, both in practice and in imagery Thus the wording here (“it is insidiousness,” “it is perversion”) parallels the rhetoric of Chap. 11 (“it is abomination,” “it is a detestable-thing”). Structurally, just as the laws on pollution began with categories of and distinctions between animals for the purpose of eating, so the holiness laws begin with categories of and distinctions between partners for the purposes of sexual relations (Eilberg-Schwartz, Goodman). The confusing of boundaries again becomes a grave matter."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Pollution from Forbidden Unions,Leviticus 18:1-30,2,"In Schwartz’s (1987) view, the list of forbidden women goes through a sequence from close relatives, to indirect ones, to women related to each other, and finally to other cases of “abomination.” In general, the list deals with women whose sexuality and reproductivity are controlled by males (Wegner 1992)—in other words, it reflects a highly patriarchal society."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Pollution from Forbidden Unions,Leviticus 18:1-30,3,"An odd omission of sexual prohibitions is the one between a man and his daughter; perhaps it was universally understood as the primary one, and hence did not require mentioning."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Pollution from Forbidden Unions,Leviticus 18:1-30,4,"Refrains in the chapter, which create its backbone, include “I am Y<small>HWH</small> your God” and the constant “the nakedness of X you are not to expose.” Late in the chapter, the words “abomination” and “<i>tum’a</i>” frequently recur."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,General Regulations on Holiness I,Leviticus 19:1-37,1,"As the key chapter of this part of Leviticus, Chap. 19 is wide-ranging and rhetorically powerful. It extends holiness to virtually all areas of life—family, calendar, cult, business, civil and criminal law, social relations, and sexuality. Most (but not all) of the laws deal with what we would term ethics, that is, relations between people (Wenham notes the alternation of the terms “fellow [citizen],” “kinsman,” and “neighbor”). As such, they have become an exemplar and a cornerstone, at least in idealized form, in Western thinking about these issues."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,General Regulations on Holiness I,Leviticus 19:1-37,2,"Structurally speaking, the chapter is not systematic. As Schwartz (1987)has noted, this is probably intentional, reflecting the desire to avoid categorization or compartmentalization of life before God. He lays out the structure of the core part of the chapter, vv.3–32, as discrete subsections, each ending with “I am Y<small>HWH</small> [your God],” with vv.33–36 as two appendices, and a summary in v.37."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,General Regulations on Holiness I,Leviticus 19:1-37,3,"The opening (v.2) is crucial, even though the word-root “holy” does not recur in the chapter (it does, however, reverberate within the next four chapters). The style is predominantly apodictic—“You are not to …,” as was Chap. 18, and concentrates mostly on the negating of certain kinds of behavior. At the same time, the chapter makes a moving positive plea for proper treatment of the elderly, the poor, and, in general, one’s “neighbor” (which is extended to the foreigner [“sojourner”] in vv.33–34)."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,General Regulations on Holiness II,Leviticus 20:1-27,1,"We move now into laws dealing with some of the more serious offenses against God in the biblical view: idolatry (including worship of the “Molekh” and consulting spirits), insulting parents, adultery, and sexual crimes. These are distinguished from the previous chapter by the inclusion of punishments; their seriousness is indicated by their capital nature. The reiteration of sexual laws forms a bracket with Chap. 18, thus highlighting the central position and rhetoric of 19. Another bracket, this time within the chapter, involves the chiasm of necromancy and the exhortation to be holy (vv.6–7 and 26–27). Finally, while the motifs of the Israelites avoiding pagan practices, and the land “vomiting out” its wrongdoers, return from Chap. 18, there is a further throwback (vv.24–26): to Chap. 11, where “separation” from the nations was a major issue in terms of diet."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Regulations Concerning Holiness: Priests I,Leviticus 21:1-24,1,"This chapter, and the one that follows, relate holiness to the suitability of priests to serve in the sanctuary. The laws are in the main negative ones, that is, they outline ways in which a priest may be disqualified. The first part of the chapter concentrates on how contact with death disqualifies a priest; in Levine’s view, this avoidance of the dead reflects the Bible’s abhorrence of pagan cults centered around death. The laws concerning soundness of body and sexuality confirm earlier passages on holiness as wholeness."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Regulations Concerning Holiness: Priests I,Leviticus 21:1-24,2,The central word-root is again “holy”; six times in Chaps. 21–22 we hear the refrain “I am Y<small>HWH</small> the one-who-hallows you/them.”
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Regulations Concerning Holiness: Priests II,Leviticus 22:1-33,1,"The priestly rules on holiness continue, with special attention given to the priest’s proper state when he eats of the “holy donations.” The second part of the chapter, from v.17 on, turns to the state of the sacrificial animals. They are to be without blemish, just as the priests must be (cf. Chap. 21). This correspondence between human and animal has been noted before; it is part of Leviticus’s general scheme of a perfect God requiring perfection in worship."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Holy Days,Leviticus 23:1-44,1,"Having dealt with holiness in such areas as worship, family life, ethics, priestly qualifications and behavior, and sacrificial animals and objects, the text now turns to holiness in time: the sacred calendar. While all ancient societies marked sacred time, in Judaism as it evolved out of the Bible the calendar took on particular significance, especially in the situation of exile. The centrality of time in Judaism has been articulately portrayed by Heschel; here we will limit discussion to the fullest of the biblical sacred calendars (others occur in Ex. 23 and 34, and Deut. 16), the one set forth in the present chapter."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Holy Days,Leviticus 23:1-44,2,"The scheme is characteristically Levitical—it focuses on order and perfection, expressing these qualities by the use of the number 7, which was used thus in a number of ancient Near Eastern cultures. A partial list in this regard would include: 7 days from sabbath to sabbath; 7 days of two major festivals, spring and fall; 7 weeks between the two pilgrimage festivals in the spring; and all the holy days falling within the first 7 months of the year, with a major cluster occurring in the seventh month. To this could be added material from other passages in the Torah: 7 years to every sabbatical year (Ex. 23:10–11, Lev. 25:2–7, Deut. 15:1–3); and 7-times-7 years (plus one) till each Jubilee year (Lev. 25:8–17). One could go further (cf. the discussion and lists in Jenson), but the thrust should be clear: time, as well as space and behavior, is to be ordered in a way that again reflects divine perfection. One might also mention the continuation of this kind of thinking in both later Judaism and Christianity, which looked upon history itself in a schematic way."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Holy Days,Leviticus 23:1-44,3,"As laid out in Leviticus, the sacred days of the seventh month follow a conventional ancient pattern described by Gaster (1961): the dying of the old year (“mortification” and “purgation,” as expressed in Rosh Ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur), followed by the birth of the new year (“invigoration” and “jubilation,” as expressed in Sukkot). The biblical calendar, then, evolved along dual tracks—lunar-solar (lunar months of 29 or 30 days, with an extra month added in late winter, 7 times every 19 years); and spring/fall new year (Passover falls in the “first month,” but the full new year pattern, as we have mentioned, is played out in the fall)."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Holy Days,Leviticus 23:1-44,4,"A final indication of a late provenance for Chap. 23’s calendar lies in the long treatment (vv.9–22, a third of the chapter) of Shavuot, the “Feast of Weeks.” The emphasis seems to be on land here, suggesting a resettlement motif that would be particularly appropriate after the exile in Babylonia."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Holy Days,Leviticus 23:1-44,5,"Theme words in the chapter include: “appointed-times,” “proclamation of holiness,” “throughout all your settlements,” “a fire-offering to YHWH,” and “anykind of servile work you are not to do.” V39–43, on the practice of and rationale behind Sukkot, seem to be another addition to the text, as they disrupt its natural flow."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Miscellany,Leviticus 24:1-23,1,"Two issues, unrelated to what has gone before, are treated here: certain ritual objects in the Dwelling (oil/lamps and “showbread”), and the story of a man who insulted God and therefore had to be executed (along with further rules about capital crimes). The function of this chapter is not clear; perhaps it serves as a breather between the important sections on sacred days (23) and land tenure (25). It is also possible (as Levine notes) that chapters such as this one and Num. 15 serve as a repository for various cultic laws that needed a location. There are two other places in the Torah where a brief passage on the lights in the sanctuary may originally have served to separate sections: the end of Ex. 27 and the beginning of Num. 8. If so, that function no longer is as major as it once might have been."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Miscellany,Leviticus 24:1-23,2,"The first two parts (2–4 and 5–9) are linked by their common vocabulary: “take,” “arrange,” “regularly,” and “before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>” (Wenham). The second section (vv. 10–23) is united by its chiastic structure (cf. Wenham here as well). It has points of contact with material in the Exodus laws, but here with the characteristic addition (v.22) of “I, Y<small>HWH</small>, am your God.”"
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Regulations Concerning Land and Slavery,Leviticus 25:1-55,1,"A final area of holiness that Leviticus discusses is that of ownership. The rules set forth in this chapter are based on the assumption that land, a most precious commodity in the ancient (and modern) Near East, and human beings, equally precious in the Bible, are not in fact the property of other human beings. The phrases “the land is not to be sold inharness, / for the land is mine” (v.23) and “For my servants are they … they are not to be sold as the sale of serfs” (v.42) express the main corollary: God is the sole owner of land and people. The chapter, then, sets out regulations that make perpetual human ownership of these impossible. In the case of land, not only is the soil to rest every seven years, but every fifty years (7 × 7 + 1), the land is to be “released” back to its original owner (who “redeems” it). Similarly, indentured servants—those who are forced into working for someone because of debts—are redeemable, if not by kin then by the occurrence of the Jubilee year."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Regulations Concerning Land and Slavery,Leviticus 25:1-55,2,"Several things about the chapter suggest a late date to Levine. Redemption focuses on the individual rather than on the clan; “at Mount Sinai” might indicate an editorial hand; and the passages here, unlike their counterparts in Ex. 21 and Deut. 15, concentrate less on eradicating poverty than on ensuring that property stays in the family over generations. Indeed, some of the conditions presupposed by the chapter suggest the situation portrayed in Neh. 5, after the Babylonian Exile."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Conclusion: Blessings and Curses,Leviticus 26:3-45,1,"The initial ending of Leviticus (Chap. 27 was added later) follows a pattern common to treaties in the ancient Near East: it provides blessings for remaining loyal to God (the suzerain) and curses for spurning him. A similar pattern, with greater rhetoric and emotional force, occurs in Deut. 28–30, with briefer examples in Ex. 23:25ff. and Josh. 24:20. The blessings center around peace and its attendant benefit, agricultural abundance; the curses detail, in increasing force, the calamities brought on by war: famine, defeat, and ultimately exile. That the curses take up much more room than the blessings is not surprising, given the didactic nature of the chapter; this is also characteristic of ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaty literature, where the major emphasis is placed on what will happen if the pact is violated. Later Jewish tradition dealt with the devastating tone and content of the curses by prescribing that, when read publicly as part of the weekly Torah cycle, they be chanted in an undertone."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Conclusion: Blessings and Curses,Leviticus 26:3-45,2,"The structure of the chapter gives strong indication that there has been considerable editorial work here, and that may explain some of the difficulties in the later parts of the chapter. The confusion may well reflect the passage of time during and after the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587 <small>B.C.E.</small>, and thus an evolving response to the catastrophe. The pattern (suggested by H. L. Ginsberg, who is quoted by Levine) moves from doom to hope, and then to an explanation of why restoration has been delayed. In any event, it should be noted (as Levine does) that the curses are not all doom; they do, at various points, leave the door open for Israel’s “turning,” a point much emphasized by the Prophets."
 III: Holiness,Leviticus 18:1-26:46,Conclusion: Blessings and Curses,Leviticus 26:3-45,3,"Lev. 26 is the first great monotheistic response to catastrophe, built on the idea that human beings have the capacity to influence their own fate by obeying or disobeying God. In Judaism, which was to experience numerous such catastrophes over the course of its history, literary response became an important mode of coping. Christianity took its own characteristic path in answering some of the same issues on a personal level."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Mustering of Israel,Numbers 1:1-54,1,"For the opening of the book about the Israelites’ wanderings in the wilderness, the editor has chosen a logical point of departure: a tally of males prepared for war, listed by tribe. It is in fact a double list—first, the names of the tribal representatives who are to assist Moshe, and second, the count itself. The chapter is the epitome of orderliness, proceeding from the date of the census to who is to be counted, on to the counters and the census itself, and finally a treatment of the special case of the Levites (who, as noncombatants, are not mustered). It utilizes a number of repeating phrases, especially in the central census section. In this sense, the opening chapters of the book are a fitting companion to Leviticus—which likewise opens with God speaking from the Tent of Appointment, still in the Wilderness of Sinai."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Mustering of Israel,Numbers 1:1-54,2,"The large numbers that appear here have been a major source of debate in modern as well as earlier interpretation. After all, extrapolating from 600,000 adult males (excluding the elderly), one certainly winds up with a population in the millions—a theoretically possible but extremely unlikely scenario. Some alternatives are: (a) to understand Hebrew <i>elef</i> as not “thousand,” but rather as “unit” or “division,” which would especially make sense in a military setting; and (b) to regard the numbers as simply exaggerated. One might also, following Olson, see the statistics here as an attempt to impress the audience with the size of Israel, and/or to demonstrate how God has blessed them (as in the promises to Avraham in Genesis and the account in Ex. 1). There may, finally, be a “numbers game” occurring here, that is, some kind of symbolism of figures that eludes us (cf. Sarna 1986)."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Layout of the Camp,Numbers 2:1-34,1,"Chap. 2 lays out a schematic diagram of the Israelite camp prepared for the desert march. The “Dwelling” naturally stands at the center, with four groups of three tribes each surrounding the structure on the outside, and three groupings of Levite clans guarding the inside of the rectangular sanctuary. Geographical pride of place, the eastern side, goes to the tribe of Yehuda (Judah) and two other tribes tracing their ancestry to sons of Lea (outside track), while Moshe and Aharon and their sons occupy the inside track."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,Levites I,Numbers 3:1-51,1,"Already introduced in 1:47–53, the issue of the Levites’ status and their tasks is an important subtheme in Numbers, and makes its central appearance in Chaps. 3 and 4. The present chapter opens with the genealogy of Moshe and Aharon (similarly, Chap. 6 of Exodus, which is a prologue to the Plague cycle, contains a genealogy of the two leaders)."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,Levites I,Numbers 3:1-51,2,"Notable is the concept that the Levites symbolically replace all the firstborn sons among the Israelites. In a more manageable way, then, the entire community participates in the sacred task of ministering in the sanctuary."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,Levites I,Numbers 3:1-51,3,"Theme words in the chapter, not surprisingly, are “charge,” “count/accountable,” and “serve/serving-tasks.” Milgrom has also noted the sevenfold “by order of Y<small>HWH</small>” that permeates this chapter and the next."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,Levites II,Numbers 4:1-49,1,"Here the tasks of the Levites are presented in great detail and listed according to clan. The jobs involve the guarding, dismantling, and transport of the “sancta” (holy objects). We are subsequently given a census of the Levites from ages 30 to 50, which fits here better than in Chap. 1. This age of service implies, perhaps, the physical strain associated with Levite tasks."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,Priestly Matters; The Wife Under Suspicion,Numbers 5:1-31,1,"Chaps. 5 and 6 are texts that seem most appropriate in a priestly setting. In both cases, the priest plays a central role in the ceremony described, administering the test and oath to the suspected adulteress and purifying the Nazirite (Milgrom)."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Nazirite,Numbers 6:1-21,1,"A “consecrated” or “separate” person, traditionally transcribed as “Nazirite” after the Hebrew <i>nazir</i>, was one who took upon himself or herself a special vow, exceeding the normal demands of the religious life. The urge to such behavior appears throughout the ages in many religious traditions, and doubtless reflects a deep-seated human desire. The motivation may stem from a joyous or tragic event, or simply from the need to serve God in what is felt to be a fuller way."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Nazirite,Numbers 6:1-21,2,"<i>The Priestly Blessing</i> (6:22–27) with which the chapter ends is striking and sufficiently beloved by Jews to have survived to this day in the synagogue liturgy. But why is it here? Perhaps the blessing of the people is yet another example of a priestly function that has not been preserved in Leviticus, since it relates neither to sacrifice nor to purification (although it should be pointed out that Moshe and Aharon give an unquoted blessing to the people in Lev. 9:23)."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Nazirite,Numbers 6:1-21,3,"The blessing itself makes wonderful use of ancient Hebrew rhythm, with a threefold structure of progressively longer lines that is reminiscent of a magical formula. The varied verbs give comfort and reassurance, as does the last word of the blessing: <i>shalom</i> (“well-being”). The benevolent “lifting” of God’s face is a known image in the ancient Near East (cf. the references in Fishbane 1988). Its devastating opposite, the “hiding” of his face, is found in the Psalms, and also in Deut. 31."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Nazirite,Numbers 6:1-21,4,"That this section was popular already in biblical times is indicated by its occurrence in a two-part version in Ps. 67:2, as well as its appearance, in various forms, on ancient Israelite amulets."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Gifts to the Sanctuary,Numbers 7:1-89,1,Chaps. 7–9 constitute a threefold conclusion to the Tabernacle texts that began in Ex. 25. The contribution of each chapter will be explained in sequence.
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Gifts to the Sanctuary,Numbers 7:1-89,2,"The longest chapter in the Torah in number of verses, and another one of the many lists in the book, Chap. 7 parallels what Levine calls “temple accounts” in the ancient Near East. These are inventory lists that were frequently written in columns. At the same time, it is a ritual text that focuses on description and not prescription, which is more usual. The chapter ends in v.89 with the first of our Tabernacle endings: a description of precisely where God would communicate with Moshe within the “Holiest Holy-Shrine.” The implication is that with the dedication of the structure, its purpose can now be fulfilled."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Gifts to the Sanctuary,Numbers 7:1-89,3,"The length of the chapter reinforces the importance and grandeur of the ceremony, and makes of the “Dwelling” an institution in which all participate, not only priests and Levites (Levine)."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,Purifying the Levites,Numbers 8:1-26,1,"A parallel to Lev. 8–9, where the dedication of the priests is the last act before the cult goes into operation, this chapter concludes the Levitical portions of Part I of Numbers—a distinctive contribution, as we have noted. Many scholars see the Levitical sections as reflections of later power struggles within the Israelite priesthood. In Levine’s view, this evolution (perhaps from family-based guilds into a full-fledged tribe) is an indication of a relatively late provenance for our text here."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,Purifying the Levites,Numbers 8:1-26,2,"Milgrom rightly makes the distinction between the “purification” of the Levites and the higher-level “hallowing” (i.e., sanctification) of the priests. It is also interesting to note the cultic rites used here: the offering of a <i>hattat</i> (the standard purificatory sacrifice), and mention of the Levites themselves being considered an “elevation-offering” (v.11)."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Second Passover; Cloud and Dwelling,Numbers 9:1-23,1,"It has been noted by Milgrom that, a number of times in the Bible, ceremonies dedicating a House of God are followed by the observance of one of the three pilgrimage festivals: Passover, Shavuot (Weeks), and Sukkot (Huts). Under Solomon, Hezekiah, Josiah, and Ezra/Nehemiah, respectively, we find a major celebration of Sukkot, Passover, Passover, and Sukkot. This linking of sacred space with sacred time is only natural. The account here echoes the first Passover as well, which similarly inaugurated a wilderness march (Milgrom). In contrast to the Exodus account, however, something new has been added with the inauguration of the Tabernacle/Dwelling. In Exodus (12:43–49), the major laws concerning Passover had to do with excluding non-Israelites and not breaking the bones of the sacrificial lamb; here, the bone motif returns, but the existence of the sanctuary raises the issue of ritual pollution."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,The Second Passover; Cloud and Dwelling,Numbers 9:1-23,2,"The second part of the chapter (vv. 15–23) parallels the ending of the book of Exodus (40:36–38), where, once the Tabernacle has been dedicated, the “Cloud” takes up residence there, to guide Israel “on all their marches.” Our passage here is longer and rather redundant, perhaps in order to set the chronological framework of the narrative straight."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,Setting Out,Numbers 10:1-36,1,"Once trumpets for signaling the march have been made, the Israelites at last begin their trek from Sinai to Canaan—nineteen days after the opening events and commandments of the book. True to the orderly character of Part I, which here draws to a close, the exact progression of the march is laid out, tribe by tribe and Levite subgroup by subgroup."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,Setting Out,Numbers 10:1-36,2,"A few other brief traditions have been included here: first, a renewed mention of Moshe’s father-in-law (cf. Ex. 18), who is exhorted to accompany the Israelites to Canaan. This text most likely continues the tradition recorded in the Bible of friendship between Israelites and Kenites, Hovav’s group."
 I: the Wilderness Camp,Numbers 1:1-10:36,Setting Out,Numbers 10:1-36,3,"The departure sequence ends, as sections in the Bible sometimes do, with a poem—in this case, the battle cry (similar to the one in Ps. 68:2) associated with the coffer (vv.35–36). These verses, now completely stripped of their military connotations, are universally used by Jews when Torah scrolls are taken out and put back in the synagogue ark on Sabbaths and holidays."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,First Rebellion,Numbers 11:1-35,1,"The mood of the book, which up until now has been orderly and celebratory, abruptly shifts. We move from a God who commands, leaders who lead, and a people that obeys, to a bitter triangle of constant complaining, questioning of leadership, and divine punishment."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,First Rebellion,Numbers 11:1-35,2,"The chapter that introduces the rebellion narratives is long and complex. Although it resembles Ex. 16 (the manna chapter) in some general respects, it has its own distinct vocabulary and concerns. It is stylistically held together by the repeating roots “eat,” “gather,” and “weep”; the “grumbling” of the Exodus story does not yet appear. The chapter combines the people’s complaints about the manna (and a concomitant craving for meat) with Moshe’s complaints about how difficult it is to lead this people; both receive answer from God, the people in the form of quails and Moshe through the dissemination of prophetic gifts to others in the camp."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,First Rebellion,Numbers 11:1-35,3,"It is in this chapter that Moshe—the dramatic and at times tragic Moshe of the Golden Calf story in Exodus—reappears as a character with deep emotions. Although his fate as a leader destined never to enter the Promised Land is not sealed until Chap. 20, one has the sense already here that the strain of his mission is beginning to tell. The vividness of the portrayal of Moshe is matched by that of the Children of Israel, whose words, usually complaints, include the picturesque description of Egyptian cuisine in v.5."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Sibling Rebellion,Numbers 12:1-16,1,"A challenge to Moshe’s leadership, which we had encountered both in Exodus and in the previous chapter, now comes from an unexpected source—Aharon and Miryam. Their complaint begins with some kind of objection to Moshe’s wife, but its core is quickly revealed in v.2: Does not God speak through them as well as through their stuttering brother? Milgrom speculates that it is the spreading of prophetic gifts in the previous chapter that gives them the idea. God’s response is to clarify Moshe’s uniqueness, and to punish Miryam—yet Aharon gets off easily here, possibly owing to a later editor who was highly sympathetic to the priesthood descended from Aharon, or because the latter, as High Priest, could not be tainted by <i>tzaraat</i> without damaging his priesthood, as Lev. 22:4ff. suggests (Sakenfeld)."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Sibling Rebellion,Numbers 12:1-16,2,"Chap. 12 is linked to the previous chapter by use of the words “eat” and “gather.” As its own unit, it is built on the ironic use of Heb. <i>dabber be</i>-, which can mean either “speak through” or “speak against.”"
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,The Spies in Canaan and Back,Numbers 13:1-33,1,"Here, as at the beginning of the book, we begin with a list—this time, of the men Moshe sends out to reconnoiter the land of Canaan. Order may also be perceived in the phraseology of Moshe’s questions to them (vv.18–20), and the mission goes well (witness the giant grape cluster in v.23). But everything falls apart in the middle of the report (vv.28ff.), and the ending of the chapter, in which the spies compare themselves (and, by extension, all the Israelites) to grasshoppers vis-a-vis the Canaanite natives of the land, is telling. It is a classic case of failure of nerve."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,The Spies in Canaan and Back,Numbers 13:1-33,2,"Scholars have detected a number of creative hands in this and the next chapter, based on the text’s alternating use of Calev and Calev/Yehoshua as the faithful spies, as well as other factors. The final result is a tug of war between sets of spies, the people, Moshe, and God. True to the new human tone of the narrative, so mundane a form as a reconnaissance mission has been here suffused with emotion, a trend that will continue throughout this part of the book."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Rebellion and Evil Decree,Numbers 14:1-45,1,"Another long and dramatic account, this chapter contains echoes of previous narratives. The “grumbling” of Ex. 16 finally returns, and God and Moshe talk to one another in a manner that recalls the Golden Calf incident of Ex. 32–34. God wishes to destroy the people and start all over again with Moshe; the prophet, for his part, reminds God of his essentially merciful nature, and basically blackmails him by pointing out what will happen to his reputation among the nations should he destroy the Israelites. Unlike the resolution in Exodus, this time the people—at least the older generation—are doomed to die out. After two years of both miraculous rescues and despair, it has become clear that the former slaves will not be able to accomplish the work of conquest—even with divine help. That is to be left to their children, whom Moshe will address in Deuteronomy."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Rebellion and Evil Decree,Numbers 14:1-45,2,"V.26 begins a section that seems to double the earlier part of the chapter. Perhaps it stems from a separate tradition concerning the incident. It leads to the people’s disastrous attempt to force the issue by invading Canaan without the Coffer and Moshe (hence, without God). Thus the spy story of 13–14, which began in orderly fashion, ends in disarray, with a crushing defeat."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Interlude,Numbers 15:1-41,1,"Chap. 15, which gives respite from the striking rebellion narratives of 11–14, and a breather before the Korah story in 16–17 (although Wenham notes verbal ties to 13–14, and Buber 1988 to 16–18), brings together five rather disparate pieces of material that seem wrenched out of other contexts. We can, however, make some sense of them. Vv.1–16 (on various sacrifices) and 17–21 (about a “contribution” for God) are commanded for the time “when you enter the land of your settling / that I am giving you” or “when you enter the land / that I am bringing you to,” connecting them to the potential entry into Canaan of the two previous chapters and thus providing a setting that is missing in most of Leviticus. Further, vv.1–16 and 22–31, which, like Lev. 4, deal with the unintentional sins of the Israelites, both make pointed reference to the “sojourner,” the resident alien who is to be treated in respect of the laws involved here exactly like a native. The final section, on the tassels (Heb. <i>tzitzit</i>), is interestingly connected to the spy narrative via the term “scout around” in v.39 (Milgrom); “scout” had occurred seven times in the earlier story. “Bear in mind” also recalls the many instances of “reminders” in the Torah—objects such as a portion of manna—that serve as a visual warning or memorial for the Israelites of later generations. This is especially important after the Israelites’ losing heart in Chaps. 13–14. Stylistically, the four sections just mentioned are drawn together by the use of the phrase “throughout your generations” (vv.15, 21, 23, 38)."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Interlude,Numbers 15:1-41,2,"This leaves the incident of the Sabbath violator in vv.32–36. It has clearly been placed in Numbers because it takes place “in the wilderness” (v.32); it has found its way into this specific chapter perhaps because it is, in its own way, a miniature rebellion story. Since it is so brief, it may well have been felt that it needed to be placed in a chapter already composed of short pieces. Stylistically it might have better appeared at the end of the chapter, but that position has been reserved for the rhetorically more dramatic section on the tassels."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Interlude,Numbers 15:1-41,3,"let us go up to (attack) the place that Y<small>HWH</small> promised,"
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Interlude,Numbers 15:1-41,4,for we have sinned!
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,The Great Revolt,Numbers 16:1-35,1,"In the two collections of wilderness rebellion traditions we have encountered thus far in the Torah, Ex. 15:22–17:7 and Num. 11–14, the rebels are a faceless “the people” or “the entire community.” An exception was Num. 12, where Aharon and Miryam complained against their brother; their personal example is now taken up by another relative, in a memorable narrative. The story of the revolt of Korah the Levite and Datan and Aviram the Reubenites, which may have stemmed from two different accounts, holds the common thread of the rebels’ feeling left out—Korah, as Moshe’s and Aharon’s first cousin, might well have headed the priestly line (his father was older than theirs), whereas Datan and Aviram’s tribe of Re’uven had lost some of its firstborn primacy, and was not even camped on the choice east side of the Dwelling. Moshe clearly sees the political motivation behind the revolt, and is indignant that anyone would impute greed (cf. v.15) or lust for power to him."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,The Great Revolt,Numbers 16:1-35,2,"As Buber (1988) points out, however, more is at stake here. The rebels’ contention that “the entire community, the entirety of them, are holy,” though it sounds at first blush like the ideal expressed in Ex. 19:6 (God’s offer to make of the Israelites “a kingdom of priests, / a holy nation”), is in reality a most dangerous claim. Holiness in the Bible is a trait that can be acquired, even transmitted to an extent, but it is not absolutely innate, except in the case of God; and the Torah sees as ope of its major goals developing the means whereby people can, with holy intent and preparation, properly serve the Holy. The fate of the rebels therefore bespeaks the seriousness of the threat they pose, and is unique in the Bible."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,The Great Revolt,Numbers 16:1-35,3,"The narrative hinges on a number of expressions. The conflict between Moshe and the rebels is nicely encapsulated by two pairs of identical charges and countercharges—“Too much (is) yours” (vv.3 and 7) and “Is it too little” (vv.9 and 13). The terms “community” and “assembly” are played upon, designating alternately the body of the people and the minicommunity of the rebels. More significantly, this chapter and those around it—15, 17, and 18—are meaningfully linked together by variations on the Hebrew root <i>k-r-b</i> (Buber 1994). The thread of meaning runs from “bringing near-offerings near,” to God “declaring [Moshe and Ahron] near” to him, to the fact that he has “brought-near” the Levites in terms of their duties, to Korah and his band being asked to “bring-near” the incense, whose fire-pans later become holy because they were “brought-near,” and finally, to the repeated warning to outsiders not to “come-near” the sancta. At issue is what Buber calls “authorized” and “unauthorized nearing,” which is mentioned frequently in Leviticus but is used in the present text with the full artistic resources at the narrator’s command. Viewed in this light, order is restored to the blurring of lines threatened by Korah."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,The Great Revolt,Numbers 16:1-35,4,"for it was an error,"
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,The Great Revolt,Numbers 16:1-35,5,"but they have brought their near-offering,"
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,The Great Revolt,Numbers 16:1-35,6,"a fire-offering of soothing savor for Y<small>HWH</small>,"
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,The Great Revolt,Numbers 16:1-35,7,"and their <i>hattat</i>-offering before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, on account of their error."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Aftermath,Numbers 17:1-28,1,"The revolt of Korah, with its macabre ending, has made it clear that Levites must not “come-near” the priestly domains, physically or professionally. Accordingly, the incense pans of the dead rebels become plating for the altar, as a warning for the future. The “fire-pan” becomes instrumental immediately thereafter, as Aharon must obtain forgiveness for the people, who understand the deaths of Korah and his followers as a political purge by the two brothers. Aharon’s action, it should be noted, cannot prevent the initial round of deaths by divine plague."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Aftermath,Numbers 17:1-28,2,"Upon hearing the “grumbling” of the Israelites (a word that did not, interestingly, appear in the Korah story), God now deems it necessary to provide another sign: proof that it is the Sons of Aharon that he has chosen (cf. 16:5)—as if the earth opening up were not enough! This is Aharon’s flowering rod, a stick that, though long-severed from its original tree, still manages to produce flowers and fruit. The motif is noted in many other cultures (cf. Gaster 1969 for references); Wagner made use of it to provide the climactic moment in his opera <i>Tannhäuser</i>."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Death and the Red Cow,Numbers 19:1-22,1,"Apparently to close out the Korah story, the text turns to a mysterious and powerful ritual, one designed to remove the contaminating pollution of death. It is important to note that the revolt in Chap. 16 led, not only to the deaths of the rebels and their households, but also to the perishing of 14,700 people in the subsequent plague (17:12–14). So despite the fact that priests and Levites now have their tasks straight, thanks to Chap. 18, there remains the serious matter of purification."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Death and the Red Cow,Numbers 19:1-22,2,"Levine notes the typical priestly pattern at work: first the remedy is prescribed, and then the actual circumstances that call for it are enumerated. He also sees the chapter as essentially a protest against the widespread cult of the dead in the ancient Near East, from which the Israelites notably separated themselves."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Death and the Red Cow,Numbers 19:1-22,3,"Milgrom has illuminated a number of aspects of the Red Cow ritual, notably by characterizing it as a sort of <i>hattat</i> ceremony. That ritual, it may be recalled, enabled the priests to decontaminate the sanctuary of ritual pollution, chiefly through the sprinkling of blood against the altar. Milgrom points to the unusual nature of the ritual here, in that the purifying agent (in this case, water that has been mixed with the special cow’s ashes, which came partly from burned blood) is sprinkled on persons, not objects."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites,Numbers 20:1-29,1,"The first part of this chapter contains a story that has deeply troubled readers for over two millennia. Its length belies its weight; in only thirteen verses, Moshe and Aharon have lost their most cherished dream—the privilege of entering the Promised Land."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites,Numbers 20:1-29,2,"The brevity here may result from the fact that, for the narrator, this story was a variant of, or constructed from, a similar one in Ex. 17, to explain more fully why the leaders shared the fate of their generation. In other words, their deaths may affect us more than the text meant it to. Nonetheless, the question of why exactly Moshe and Aharon received such a terrible punishment for a moment of indiscretion will not go away. Can it really be that the towering figure of Moshe, liberator and lawgiver, parent and prophet, is to be done away with in the blink of an eye, over a fit of justifiable temper? But it is a public moment, and there the answer may lie. The Bible consistently takes a stringent view of leadership: that leaders must be above reproach, and that they must not lose sight of the fact that it is God whom they represent. A similar impulse led to the strict standards to which the writer of Samuel-Kings, the so-called Deuteronomistic historian, held such revered personalities as David and Solomon."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites,Numbers 20:1-29,3,"From v.14 to v.21, the text gives us a moment to digest what has just happened, at the same time managing to introduce the major theme of the next several chapters: encountering other peoples and tribes as the Israelites near Canaan. First is Edom, in the territory to the east roughly between Eilat and the Dead Sea. The sequence begins tentatively, not with an Israelite victory, but not with a defeat either: they are forced to reroute their approach."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites,Numbers 20:1-29,4,"So as to keep the memory of Merivat-Kadesh close, the chapter ends with the death of Aharon, “before the eyes of the entire community” (v.27). For the first time in all the rebellion texts, the word “rebel” itself is used (v.24). On a positive note, leadership is seamlessly passed to the next generation; when Moshe returns from witnessing Aharon’s death, he is accompanied by the latter’s son El’azar, who is tellingly dressed in Aharon’s garments."

 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,First Victory: Rebellion Again; Traveling; Sihon and Og,Numbers 21:1-35,1,"A miscellany of wilderness traditions, Chap. 21 begins with a military victory—perhaps a sign that Israel’s terrible trials are coming to an end. Not insignificantly, the victory comes after the Israelites have properly vowed to allot booty to God (v.2), a far cry from their willful attempt at conquest at the end of Chap. 14. This brief account may in fact be a reworking or different account of the Horma incident in that passage."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,First Victory: Rebellion Again; Traveling; Sihon and Og,Numbers 21:1-35,2,"The strange events surrounding the “viper of copper” that follow provide a reminder, even amid the progress of the march and military successes, of the Israelites’ usual waywardness. As usual, the problem is food; several things, however, make this brief story unusual amid the rebellion narratives. For one, the punishment is unique; for another, the people call upon Moshe to remove the plague—in a manner that is more reminiscent of Pharaoh of Egypt, with the Plagues, than of previous Israelite behavior. Finally, there is the Bible’s record of what happened to the copper object: it was preserved in the cult and worshiped by the people, until it was smashed during the large-scale religious reform under King Hezekiah of Judah (late eighth century <small>B.C.E.</small>). One might note that the divine punishment for sin, once accomplished, clears the way for the Israelite victories that follow immediately."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,First Victory: Rebellion Again; Traveling; Sihon and Og,Numbers 21:1-35,3,"Of additional interest in this chapter is the inclusion of three ancient poems (vv. 14–15, 17–18, and 27–30), whose origins and language are both obscure. Preceded by a brief itinerary of the Israelites’ travels up to Moabite territory, soon to be the scene of the Bil’am narratives (Chaps. 22–24), the chapter ends with two successful clashes against local kings, Sihon and Og. While the accounts here are brief, postbiblical Jewish tradition took delight in spinning fantastic tales about these two kings (cf. Ginzberg)."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,The Hiring of Bil’am,Numbers 22:1-41,1,"Faced with overwhelming evidence of Israelite superiority, especially as evinced in the previous chapter, the Moabite king Balak tries to vanquish the invaders via a means more powerful than force of arms: a sorcerer’s curse. The first part of the story is memorable in its vivid characterization, use of theme words, and comic thrust. The central personalities have suggestive names: Balak sounds like a verb that means “to destroy,” Bil’am suggests “swallower” (hence destroyer), and Be’or, present only as the name of the sorcerer’s father, also connotes “destroying.” The text uses two different words for “curse,” soon to be joined by a third. The chapter introduces key themes of the story: “honor,” which Bil’am will refuse in the overwhelming face of God’s truth; “once again,” through which it becomes clear that, for God, “once [refusal of permission for Bil’am to go] is once-and-for-all,” and God’s blessing, once given, will not be rescinded (Rosenzweig 1994); and the emphatic refrain that, as noted above, in one form or another will echo throughout the story, “whatever God tells me, that (alone) must I speak/do.” Most memorable, of course, is the sequence about the talking donkey, which must have been more than a little amusing to ancient audiences. For here we have a dumb animal who sees divine messengers and possesses the divine gift of speech, contrasting with a prophet—who in Israelite thinking was supposed to be distinguished by his abilities as “seer” and mouthpiece of God—who sees nothing and raises his voice only to complain."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Bil’am’s First Visions,Numbers 23:1-30,1,"Having been granted permission to hire himself out to Balak, but with the caveat that he may speak only God’s word, Bil’am prepares to curse Israel. But his “encounters” with God leave not the slightest doubt of the outcome; curse is turned to blessing, despite all the correct ritual preparations and previous promises of payment for services rendered. One almost has the impression of a seance gone wrong. And, professionally speaking, hired prophets are supposed to tell kings what they want to hear."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Bil’am the Prophet,Numbers 24:1-25,1,"Few moments in the Torah, to my thinking, can compare with what now happens in this story. The description of Bil’am’s transformation in the opening verses is matched and even surpassed by what happens to the poetry of this section. From v.3 on, we are treated to an elevation and intensification of poetic language, beginning with the rhythmic opening lines and continuing through the pregnant Middle Eastern imagery of trees and water."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Final Rebellion: Apostasy,Numbers 25:1-18,1,"A tale ostensibly meant to establish the permanent status of the Aaronide priesthood, this chapter has another important structural function. As the last section of Part II (at least as I have laid out the book’s structure), it prevents the wilderness traditions from ending on an up note. The Bil’am cycle with its exalted poetry would have made a positive conclusion, but the editor does not wish us to forget the basic facts of Israel’s wilderness experience: dissatisfaction, complaint, and rebellion. Here we end with the ultimate rebellion, the moment of serious unfaithfulness in the “marriage” between God and Israel."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Final Rebellion: Apostasy,Numbers 25:1-18,2,"Like his grandfather Aharon in Chap. 17, Pin’has is able to stay the plague from God, albeit not through peaceful means. His action here recalls the killing spree of the Levites at the Golden Calf incident, another major apostasy (Wenham). The text goes out of its way to name also specific offenders; the Moabite woman who is remembered for evil is, in fact, the daughter of a chieftain."
 II: the Rebellion Narratives,Numbers 11:1-25:18,Final Rebellion: Apostasy,Numbers 25:1-18,3,"The horrifying details of Pin’has’s act remind the reader once again that, for the biblical writers, idolatry was the worst of all crimes. The books to follow, starting with Deuteronomy, will make this abundantly clear."
"On Bil’am",Numbers 22:2-25:9,Bil’am’s First Visions,Numbers 23:1-30,1,"Having been granted permission to hire himself out to Balak, but with the caveat that he may speak only God’s word, Bil’am prepares to curse Israel. But his “encounters” with God leave not the slightest doubt of the outcome; curse is turned to blessing, despite all the correct ritual preparations and previous promises of payment for services rendered.

"On Bil’am",Numbers 22:2-25:9,Bil’am’s First Visions,Numbers 23:1-30,2,"The poetry in this chapter is powerful and striking. We move from the hopeful king’s lofty “mountains of Kedem,” whence Bil’am was hired, to the disturbing image of the king of beasts feasting on his prey. What began as an attack from above has ended in a blood-feast by the enemy."
"On Bil’am",Numbers 22:2-25:9,Bil’am the Prophet,Numbers 24:1-25,1,"Few moments in the Torah, to my thinking, can compare with what now happens in this story.

"On Bil’am",Numbers 22:2-25:9,Bil’am the Prophet,Numbers 24:1-25,2,"With the suggestion of the blessing given to Avraham in v.9, and with Bil’am’s vision of the future political triumphs of Israel vis-à-vis the surrounding nations, all that Balak can do is to “go on his way” (v.25). The king who is used to paying for what he wants, and to having enemies cursed, has no recourse left to him."

 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,New Census,Numbers 26:1-65,1,"Out of the chaos of the wilderness, the element of order is reintroduced as we meet the new generation—which will conquer at least part of the land of Canaan. These children of slaves are now mustered, in the same tribal order as the census in Chap. 1. The purpose of the counting is set forth in vv.52–56: so that the Promised Land may be properly divided up, according to population. True to the scheme of Chap. 1, the Levites go through their own census (vv.57–62)—since they receive designated towns but not a large mass of land. The ending verses assure us that the census in this chapter does not include anyone of the Exodus generation, excluding Calev and Yehoshua. Thus we are on new ground."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,A Case of Inheritance: Daughters of Tzelofhad I; The Passing of Leadership,Numbers 27:1-23,1,"If the land is to be apportioned by tribe, the question of inheritance becomes a major one for the future. In that vein, the text, in almost Talmudic fashion, brings a case with some difficulties: What if a father dies without sons but does leave daughters—may they inherit the ancestral land, given the context of a patriarchal society? Moshe is unable to solve the problem, but must leave it up to God, who rules that not only daughters but other relations as well may serve to keep the land in the family (an attendant question, how to keep land within a tribe’s territory, will be answered in Chap. 36). This section of the chapter is a good example of a law embedded in a narrative, or a narrative created for the sake of a law. It also has the effect of showing that the divine promise of land is about to be fulfilled, that all tribes must be included in the process, and that the growing biblical tradition allows for reinterpretation (Olson)."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,A Case of Inheritance: Daughters of Tzelofhad I; The Passing of Leadership,Numbers 27:1-23,2,"From v.12 on, we are reminded that Moshe is about to die. In an expansive speech (vv.18–21), God designates Yehoshua as Moshe’s successor, and publicly the aging leader transfers authority to him. Given the structure of Part III of the book, which is bracketed by daughters of Tzelofhad sections, we might expect Moshe’s death to parallel the passage here, and thus come at the end of Chap. 36. But that will not be the case; his death is left for the end of the entire Torah, in Deuteronomy."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,Festival Offerings,Numbers 28:1-29:39,1,"With Chaps. 28–30 we return to a recurring phenomenon in the book of Numbers: the intrusion of priestly material. We would expect 28 and 29, which form a logical unit and enumerate the sacrifices brought on holy days, to be properly placed in Leviticus. In fact, Lev. 23 does set out a sacred calendar. The purpose of that passage, however, was to indicate the overlay of the holy on the cycle of the year; the material here neither creates the calendar itself nor has anything to do with either voluntary offerings or those brought for expiation of sin. It may have been inserted at this point, in this book, because in its drawn-out, formulaic rhetoric, it has the character of a list such as we often find in Numbers. Part III of the book is a logical setting for it, given that it concentrates on the “pilgrimage-festivals” that fit a settled, agricultural context, and these chapters deal with various issues arising from Israel’s immanent possession of the land."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,Festival Offerings,Numbers 28:1-29:39,2,"Interesting is the addition of the New Moon festival (vv.11ff.), not mentioned in Lev. 23. It was apparently a serious holy day, although the Bible does not forbid work on it. The New Moon fits in the general layout of the chapter, which is, first, according to frequency of sacrifice and then to calendar (Milgrom)."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,Vows and Women,Numbers 30:1-17,1,"Taking its verbal cue from 29:39, this chapter focuses on the binding nature of vows, especially as regards women, whose legal status was typically bound up with that of their fathers or husbands (unless they were widows or otherwise adult and single; cf. Wegner 1988). In this respect it continues the priestly concern with women, who do not always fit the priestly categories as neatly as that class might have wished. The length of the chapter signals the importance, or rather the sacredness, of an oath in ancient Israel; it stood as uttered unless an annulment procedure was followed. Human words, and not only divine ones, were seen as having effects in the real world."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,Vows and Women,Numbers 30:1-17,2,"The chapter is built around repeating words, such as “vow,” “bind,” “establish,” “annul,” and “silent.”"
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,War against Midyan,Numbers 31:1-54,1,"We return to preconquest war traditions, such as we encountered in Chap. 21. It is as if God permits Moshe a taste of conquest before he is to be “gathered to [his] kinspeople” (v.2). And it is unfinished business that he takes up here, since the Midyanites had been identified as the ones who lured the Israelites to sin at Baal Pe’or (25:16–18). Also notable in this long chapter is the detailed account of dividing the spoils (vv.25–54); this is both characteristic of Numbers, as a list, and an indication of an important issue that will need attention once the conquest proper proceeds. It also may be an indication of a later tradition; Levine sees in the allotment of spoils for sanctuary income a characteristic royal policy."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,War against Midyan,Numbers 31:1-54,2,"The cruel aspect of this war, while not unusual by ancient standards, feels jarring to modern Jewish and Christian readers, who perhaps expect the Bible to be more peace-oriented. It is not, although it often “seeks peace,” and there are passages (e.g., Deut. 20 and 21:10–14) where an attempt is made to mute some of the harsh realities of ancient warfare."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,War against Midyan,Numbers 31:1-54,3,"Niditch has pointed out that this chapter presents an ideology of war slightly different from some other biblical accounts. The term “devote-to-destruction” is not used; virgin girls, who are not yet of the status of “the enemy,” are spared; and war is seen as a ritually defiling activity, i.e., contact with death. In other words, the text exhibits some ambiguity about war, which must then be dealt with via purifying rituals."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,War against Midyan,Numbers 31:1-54,4,"as well as the rash-statement of her lips by which she has bound herself,"

 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,The Two and a Half Tribes,Numbers 32:1-42,1,"Although most biblical traditions place the Promised Land west of the Jordan River, Numbers includes an unusual request by the tribes of Reu’ven, Gad, and half of the tribe of Menashe: Since they are shepherds, and have heard of the fertile grazing area east of the river, they wish to remain on the east bank. Moshe accedes to their wish, provided that they assist their fellow Israelites in conquering Canaan proper. The historical result of this settlement—which gives us a taste of settlement before the larger conquest in the book of Joshua—seems to have been a checkered one, with Moabites and Ammonites reclaiming land at various subsequent periods."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,The Two and a Half Tribes,Numbers 32:1-42,2,"Milgrom has demonstrated how the chapter is built by a select vocabulary of words repeated seven times; the whole may be summarized by the composite statement “If Gad and Reuben cross over as vanguard [Heb. <i>h-l-tz;</i> see below) before Y<small>HWH</small>, they will receive the land holdings (they desire).” The sevenfold “before Y<small>HWH</small>” of the chapter drums in the participation of the divine in the conquest (Milgrom also brings up the possibility that it suggests the Coffer’s presence at the battle)."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,The Wilderness Marches,Numbers 33:1-56,1,"Another list in the book of Numbers traces the full journey of the Israelites from Egypt—as the Egyptians are still burying their firstborn dead!—to a spot opposite Jericho by the Jordan. It would of course be ideal if we could map out the route, but the location of most of the places mentioned in the chapter has been lost over time. We are left with the rhythm of the place-names rather than a viable historical record."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,The Wilderness Marches,Numbers 33:1-56,2,"Vv.50ff. introduce a new note, appropriate in view of the preconquest situation. Before Moshe lays out the future borders of Israelite Canaan in the next chapter, he must warn his charges about the dangers of leaving the conquered peoples (and their religious culture) settled in the land. This concern is typical of Deuteronomy, and figures in later history (cf. Judg. 1), where the apparent failure to do what is demanded here is understood as having led to idol-worship in Israel."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,Parceling Out the Land,Numbers 34:1-29,1,"Again appropriate in the context, the postconquest borders of the Promised Land are laid out here. Milgrom, following Mazar, characterizes these boundaries as matching no historically verifiable Israelite territories, but rather the map of Canaan as an Egyptian province before the conquest. Be that as it may, the chapter ends with a list of representatives who will parcel out the land—another one of Numbers’s leadership lists."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,Levitical Towns of Asylum,Numbers 35:1-34,1,"As a kind of appendix to the previous chapter, and for a last mention of the Levites in Numbers, we are given what the Torah regards as an important innovation: the institution of the Towns of Asylum (or Refuge), whereby an accidental manslayer could avoid the expected blood vengeance of the dead person’s family. Greenberg (1959) has claimed that the specified towns probably were a substitute for what in other ancient Near Eastern societies was banishment; in his view, the idea of internal banishment presented here affirms the high and nonnegotiable value put on human life in the Bible—even when it is ended by accident. Be that as it may, the law in this chapter puts a brake on a reality of ancient life."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,Levitical Towns of Asylum,Numbers 35:1-34,2,"It is likely that the towns in question were previously sacred Canaanite towns, and Frick has raised the interesting possibility that from that special character or status may have evolved the concept of citywide asylum (and not just at the altar, a temporary measure)."
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,A Case of Inheritance: Daughters of Tzelofhad II,Numbers 36:1-13,1,"To round out both Part III and the entire book, the text returns to issues of inheritance, brought up first in Chap. 27. The decision rendered here (that the daughters of Tzelofhad may inherit their father’s holdings, but that they must agree to marry within their tribe) ties the final loose end relating to the land, and so we are able to leave the wilderness narratives and laws with a sense that the future in the Promised Land is both assured and orderly. All that remains is for Moshe to die—but first he has a series of speeches to deliver to his charges of half a lifetime. These will be introduced by the opening verse of the next book, “These are the words/speeches ….”"
 III: the Preparations For Conquest,Numbers 26:1-36:13,A Case of Inheritance: Daughters of Tzelofhad II,Numbers 36:1-13,2,"Fishbane (1988) terms this chapter a “responsum,” that is, an authoritative answer to a legal question, and notes how the original intent of the law in Chap. 27—to allow women to inherit property in certain circumstances—has been “subverted” by the ruling here. That is, male relatives ultimately inherit the land, as though there were no daughters! Thus the process of “inner-biblical interpretation,” whereby already in the Bible itself passages are subject to later scrutiny and recasting, makes its appearance; it will be exemplified by much of the material in the next book, Deuteronomy."

 I: Historical Overview,Deuteronomy 1:1-4:43,Setting Out,Deuteronomy 1:1-46,1,"After the narrator’s brief introduction, which places the Israelites at the very borders of the Promised Land, Moshe’s words bring the Israelites from Sinai to Kadesh, in the southern part of the land. He begins with his own problem, the burden of leadership; but the bulk of the chapter functions to explain why the Israelites that came out of Egypt were not privileged to enter the land itself. Stylistically interesting is Moshe’s constant use of quotations—he cites God, himself, and the Israelites. The effect is to make the narrative vivid and also authoritative in tone (cf. Polzin 1980)."
 I: Historical Overview,Deuteronomy 1:1-4:43,Encountering the Nations,Deuteronomy 2:1-3:22,1,"Moshe’s narrative moves the people toward their present location, east of Jericho, detailing their disappointments and triumphs in meetings with the indigenous peoples of the area. The account begins tentatively, with Israel warned not to antagonize their “cousins,” the Children of Esav, but ends with a foreshadowing of the conquest of Canaan—the successful war-making of the two and a half tribes (cf. Num. 32) that received land east of the Jordan."
 I: Historical Overview,Deuteronomy 1:1-4:43,Moshe’s Personal Plea,Deuteronomy 3:23-29,1,"Before Moshe begins his appeal to the people of Israel to keep the covenant, he recalls his fervent prayer to God to be allowed into the land himself, a prayer that is, of course, answered in the negative. This recollection raises the emotional stakes of what is to come; the bulk of the book is now established as Moshe’s last words."
 I: Historical Overview,Deuteronomy 1:1-4:43,Transition,Deuteronomy 4:1-40,1,"Moshe, having narrated Israel’s wilderness travels up to the spot where they are standing, now launches into the main set of speeches that characterize Deuteronomy’s style, a series of exhortations to the people to follow God’s laws. This section is connected to the previous material by its evocation of past events (the sin at Baal Pe’or and the revelation at Sinai/Horev), but it also points to the future, by means of its vision of exile and return. Not surprisingly, the words “hear/hearken,” “see,” “laws (and regulations),” and “command” are all key expressions; these become increasingly important in the chapters to follow."
 I: Historical Overview,Deuteronomy 1:1-4:43,Transition,Deuteronomy 4:1-40,2,"Ironic is the repeated warning, which appears here for the first time, not to add anything to the Instruction. Yet Deuteronomy itself does just that. But, as we have noted above, by closing the Torah after the end of the book, Deuteronomy is able to introduce innovations with the force of tradition, and seemingly guard against further overt revision."
 I: Historical Overview,Deuteronomy 1:1-4:43,Transition,Deuteronomy 4:1-40,3,"Levenson (1975) sees this section, along with material in chapters 28–32, as providing a framework for the book for the Israelite community in exile, suggesting that return to God is still possible through keeping the commandments laid out within the framework."
 I: Historical Overview,Deuteronomy 1:1-4:43,Towns of Asylum,Deuteronomy 4:41-43,1,"In a brief passage that seems utterly out of place amid the deep rhetoric of this section, Moshe carries out a command he had received in Num. 35:9–34 to make sure that an accidental manslayer has a special place(s) to flee to from an avenging family. Perhaps this has been placed here because it is one of the few “laws and regulations” in the Torah whose observance is mandated on the east bank of the Jordan River—and hence is one of the few that Moshe personally gets to carry out."
 II: Opening Exhortation,Deuteronomy 4:44-11:32,The Basic Rules,Deuteronomy 4:44-5:30,1,"After a brief introduction, the text appears to begin the sequence of “laws and regulations” with the Ten Commandments. The latter, however, are quoted from Sinai (albeit in slightly altered form), and we are justified in viewing them, just as their counterpart in Ex. 20, as a kind of preamble to the laws themselves. They may even function as a narrated piece amid the pleas of Moshe. At any event, Chap. 5 uses key words we have previously encountered—“speak,” “command,” “hear”—but puts major emphasis on variations of the root “live.” The message would seem to be that those who heard God speaking at Sinai miraculously survived, and now will survive into the long term if they keep God’s covenant which he presented at the mountain."
 II: Opening Exhortation,Deuteronomy 4:44-11:32,The Basic Rules,Deuteronomy 4:44-5:30,2,"The Ten Commandments, of course, form a cornerstone of Western civilization—although a glance at them will reveal that they have not been very well followed over the past two millennia. But their language and their message remain an ideal. They served for a time as part of Jewish liturgy, but were ultimately removed from the Prayer Book out of fear that it would be thought that ten rules were the limit of one’s obligations to God."
 II: Opening Exhortation,Deuteronomy 4:44-11:32,The Basic Rules,Deuteronomy 4:44-5:30,3,"As in Chap. 4, where the audience is warned not to add anything to the revealed Instruction, Chap. 5 also reminds them that nothing was added at Sinai."
 II: Opening Exhortation,Deuteronomy 4:44-11:32,The Centrality of Education,Deuteronomy 6:1-25,1,"Deuteronomy places particular emphasis on transmitting the meaning and practice of the laws. Crucial here is the concept that constant recital of key ideas and experiences, and making sure to pass them on to new generations, will insure the observance of the commandments and hence Israel’s good life on the promised soil. “Command” is the frequently used key word; the central passage is the so-called <i>Shema</i> (“Hearken [O Israel]”), already used in ancient times as both the core prayer in daily Jewish liturgy and the cry of martyrs (it is used as well as a prayer for retiring at night and as the core of the deathbed confession). Here memory is the key: the experience of slavery in Egypt, Israel’s trying behavior in the wilderness, and, above all, the constant rescuing grace of God. The idea that there should be constant reminders of the covenant became a staple of Jewish ritual practice, from the early education of children in the biblical text, to the <i>tefillin</i> (see below) worn in daily prayer, to the <i>mezuza</i> (a small box containing passages from Deuteronomy) on the doorpost. All three are mentioned in vv.7–9."
 II: Opening Exhortation,Deuteronomy 4:44-11:32,The Centrality of Education,Deuteronomy 6:1-25,2,"Vv. 5–9 have an oral, liturgical ring to them, with the tenfold repetition of the sound <i>ekha</i> (“your”). A good many sections of Deuteronomy in fact utilize this style, providing the book, despite its emphasis on the phenomenon of writing, with a distinctive sound."
 II: Opening Exhortation,Deuteronomy 4:44-11:32,Israel and the Canaanites,Deuteronomy 7:1-26,1,"An important part of Israel’s self-understanding in Deuteronomy, as elsewhere in the Torah, is separation from other peoples—particularly from the inhabitants of the land they are to conquer. This chapter emphasizes the absolute avoidance of the Canaanites which the Israelites are to practice (it begins and ends with “devotion-to-destruction,” a kind of ritual ban or confiscation). The violence on the part of Israel spoken of in the opening verses, and the destruction wrought by God in the closing lines, frame a middle section that speaks of God’s “love” and “loyalty” toward Israel—again, in the mode of an ancient Near Eastern overlord. The emotional tone of the chapter strongly suggests a period of intense nationalism."
 II: Opening Exhortation,Deuteronomy 4:44-11:32,The Land,Deuteronomy 8:1-20,1,"Moshe now recounts the past—God’s care of Israel in the wilderness (the opening chapters stressed other aspects), in order to set up expectations for the future life of the people in the Promised Land. The reference to the past is to insure that Israel not attribute its success and happiness in the land to their own prowess; otherwise they will disappear like the peoples they are replacing."
 II: Opening Exhortation,Deuteronomy 4:44-11:32,The Land,Deuteronomy 8:1-20,2,"Appearing here, as it does frequently elsewhere in the Bible, is the idea of the “merit of the Fathers”—the concept that God is beneficent and forgiving toward the Israelites chiefly owing to the deeds of their ancestors. It survived as a key idea in classical Judaism."
 II: Opening Exhortation,Deuteronomy 4:44-11:32,The Calf Incident,Deuteronomy 9:1-11:32,1,"Continuing the argument of the last chapter—that Israel should take great care to remember who it was that led them—Moshe makes pointed reference to the great rebellion that took place at the foot of Sinai itself: the incident of the Golden (“Molten”) Calf in Ex. 32–34. In this he is recapitulating the rhetoric of the opening chapters of the book, as well as of the great poem in Chap. 32, which utilize the past to inform the future. The calf incident, in fact, paves the way for the passages that immediately follow."
 II: Opening Exhortation,Deuteronomy 4:44-11:32,Concluding Exhortation,Deuteronomy 10:12-11:32,1,"To conclude his long introduction to the laws, Moshe returns to the theme of Y<small>HWH</small>’s love for Israel, expanding it to include Israel’s duty to love the stranger and also to love God. Once again the past is invoked, especially those parts of it that focus on God’s might. The intimate connection between people and land is stressed through Moshe’s wonderful description of Canaan (vv.11–12), and the polarity of blessing and curse rounds out his plea—just as a long blessing/curse cycle will round out the whole book in Chaps. 29 and 30. In fact, Chap. 11, both in its beginning (“you are to keep his charge, his laws, his regulations and his commandments”) and its ending (“you are to take-care to observe all the laws and the regulations that I place before you today”), form a fitting lead-in to the long sequence of laws that is about to commence."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,On Worship and Meat-Eating,Deuteronomy 12:2-31,1,"The extended section on laws begins with what sounds like a reference to Josiah’s reform—the smashing of idols, the abolition of the “high-places” (the pagan shrines which dotted the ancient landscape of Canaan), and the centralization of the cult in the place that “God chooses to have his name dwell.” Since this emphasis is central to the program of Deuteronomy in its final form, it is not surprising that it appears first in the legal section of the book—rather like the opening of the laws in Exodus 21–23, which centers around the situation of one of its central concerns and images, the slave (Levinson). A logical result of the centralization of the cult is the need to permit the eating of meat in local sites; previously it had been permitted only at the Dwelling (cf. Lev. 17), the portable sanctuary. But the old prohibition against eating blood, as symbolic of the life, is upheld."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,On Worship and Meat-Eating,Deuteronomy 12:2-31,2,"Vv.29–31, which mark a transition to the next chapter, round out Chap. 12’s stern proscription of improper worship—“indeed, even their sons and daughters they burn with fire to their gods!” (31)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,On Worship and Meat-Eating,Deuteronomy 12:2-31,3,"Christensen (1986) notes a stylistic peculiarity of this chapter which is typical of Deuteronomy: a shift between second person plural and singular. While others have tried to use this phenomenon to point to evidence of editing, he sees it as a stylistic way of marking metrical sections of the chapter."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Leading the People Astray,Deuteronomy 13:1-19,1,"The subject is various scenarios under which Israelites might be lured to worship other gods; it has first been broached in Ex. 22:19, and will return in Deut. 17:2–7. Vv.2–6 deal with a religious visionary, 7–12 with a relative (both of whom seek to turn the Israelites to idols), and 13–19 with a whole town that has abandoned the covenant in favor of other gods. In all three cases, the penalty is death, with the chapter building up the sentences into a crescendo of destruction in vv.16–19. The opening verse of the chapter forms a fitting superscript for the bulk of the laws, and hints that Deuteronomy is a kind of final, closed, “canonical” dispensation."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Holiness,Deuteronomy 14:1-29,1,"Chap. 14 looks back to a major priestly concern. Indeed, the word “holy” appears in v.2, just as it did in conjunction with Israel the “special treasure” (mentioned here as well) in Ex. 19:5–6. Holiness includes banning Canaanite practices regarding the dead, distinguishing between pure and impure animals, avoiding carcasses as a major source of ritual pollution, and following the rules concerning tithes. In regard to the latter, what seems to matter most in the text is not precisely what is due God—a narrowly religious concern—but rather the care one must take that the powerless members of society (sojourner, widow, orphan) are provided for—a much broader one."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Number Seven and the Matter of Debt,Deuteronomy 15:1-18,1,"In Lev. 25, the Sabbatical year was explained in great detail, principally in regard to letting the land lie fallow. Similarly, the cycle of seven-times-seven years (plus one), the Jubilee (“Homebringing”) Year, was characterized as a time of land returning to its original owners. While the Leviticus text talks a good deal about poverty from v.35 on, most of it is about land and money. In Deuteronomy, on the other hand, the issue of the needy jumps to the fore from the beginning of the chapter, and remains central throughout. The result of such care is “blessing” from God, a theme word in the chapter."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Number Seven and the Matter of Debt,Deuteronomy 15:1-18,2,"Vv.12–18 parallel Ex. 21:2–6, but utilize a more rational argument. They also include the freeing of female slaves, in effect recognizing their personhood in a way the Exodus passage does not (Weinfeld 1992)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Firstling,Deuteronomy 15:19-23,1,"Linking up with the Passover passage that follows, this law combines the idea of the consecrated firstborn of animals with Deuteronomy’s new rules about eating sacrificial meat at home."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Firstling,Deuteronomy 15:19-23,2,"Vv. 1–7, which deal with Passover, make clear how Deuteronomy reinterprets tradition in the light of its new program of centralization. As Levinson points out, this holiday, whose origin is clearly in the setting of the clan, is here broadened away from exclusive home observance and toward the sanctuary. To that end, animals other than lambs are now allowed to be sacrificed, and they may be boiled, not just roasted. In addition, the protective aspect of the animal’s blood, which was so central to the Exodus account, is de-emphasized."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Pilgrimage Festivals,Deuteronomy 16:1-17,1,"To the other sacred calendars in Ex. 23:14–17, Ex. 34:18, 22–24, and Lev. 23, our passage adds the stipulation that the three harvest/pilgrimage festivals be observed exclusively “in the place that Y<small>HWH</small> chooses / to have his name dwell” (v.2). “Blessing” and the individual’s capacity for giving are other important points."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Justice,Deuteronomy 16:18-20,1,"This aspect of communal life has been treated before (e.g., Ex. 23:2–3, 6–9), but not with quite the impassioned edge found in v.20."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Against Canaanite Cult Objects,Deuteronomy 16:21-22,1,"The destruction of pagan shrines is once again demanded. Both the <i>Ashera</i> and the “standing-stone” were connected to the theme of fertility, which in Canaanite worship was related to the gods’ generative power. Israelite thought, on the other hand, attributed fertility to a non- or meta-sexual God."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Improper Sacrifice,Deuteronomy 17:1,1,"Related to 15:21, the text reiterates that Y<small>HWH</small> must be worshiped only in perfection—meaning that a sacrificial animal must be free of defects."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Process of Judgment,Deuteronomy 17:2-13,1,"Ancient Israel’s judicial process involved, not judge and jury, but elders or priests. In this setting, proper “inquiry” was crucial; the testimony of eyewitnesses was required in multiple; and priests provided a sort of appeals court, with their “instruction” serving as the final word on the case—on pain of death."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Process of Judgment,Deuteronomy 17:2-13,2,"As part of the Deuteronomic program of centralizing authority, it should be noted that elders are replaced here by state officials in various matters of judgment (vv.8–11; see also 16:18) (Levinson)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Laws of Kingship,Deuteronomy 17:14-20,1,"Deuteronomy here introduces a new note into the Torah, one which becomes familiar from I and II Samuel on. Ancient Israel had an interesting and at times ambivalent attitude toward monarchy: on the one hand, it viewed God as the sole king (cf. Judg. 8:22–23), and could roundly condemn monarchy’s excesses (cf. I Sam. 8:10–18). On the other hand, popular support for this common human institution was widespread in the face of the constant military threat, especially from the coast-dwelling and technologically superior Philistines. Once established, the monarchy was permanent."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Laws of Kingship,Deuteronomy 17:14-20,2,"Our passage clearly demonstrates the controls on the institution desired by the biblical writers: limits on wealth and the stipulation that the king study God’s Instruction. The latter expectation, in varying forms, is found all over the ancient Near East (Weinfeld)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Levites’ Share,Deuteronomy 18:1-8,1,"Their role established fully in the book of Numbers, the Levites functioned as assistants to their kinsmen, the priests, in a variety of capacities. In Deuteronomy, however, the Levite-priest distinction is not sharply drawn. As elsewhere, the Levites owned no land, and hence were supported by portions of various sacrifices and tithes."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Sorcery and False Prophecy,Deuteronomy 18:9-22,1,"Picking up the theme of avoiding the magical practices of the Canaanites (cf. the briefer Ex. 22:17), the text continues into the topic of prophecy, which is viewed as the proper way to know the will of God. The safeguard against false prophecy, though—noting the nonfulfillment of the “prophet’s” word—was too shaky a basis for a stable system. Deuteronomy as a whole has a better overall answer than the one it gives here: it establishes the text as the authority, a process that the book appears to have inaugurated and that became central to the three Western religions."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Sorcery and False Prophecy,Deuteronomy 18:9-22,2,"The passage on sorcery (vv.9–12) repeats “abomination” three times, to emphasize the Bible’s abhorrence of the practices enumerated here. This is not to imply that the Israelites did not believe in the efficacy of such phenomena; they simply viewed them as an unacceptable way of learning the divine will."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Towns of Asylum,Deuteronomy 19:1-13,1,"Num. 35 dealt at length with the same problem, the fate of the accidental murderer. There, however, the manslayer was confined to particular locations until the death of the High Priest, as a kind of atonement for the polluting of the land through bloodshed, whereas here it is primarily to escape family vengeance."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Moving of Borders,Deuteronomy 19:14,1,"A society that put great store by land, as many still in the region today, ancient Israel saw family holdings and borders as basically sacred (in this text as in others, the “inheritance” comes from God)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Witnesses,Deuteronomy 19:15-21,1,"The need for multiple witnesses and proper inquiry establishes the seriousness of what is at stake in the justice system. In keeping with the biblical idea of “equity” (Heb. <i>tzedek</i>), that is, fairness and balance in judgment, a false witness suffers the same punishment as would have befallen the innocent person whom he accused. The “eye for an eye” punishment is thus to serve as a deterrent for a most abhorrent crime."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Laws of War,Deuteronomy 20:1-20,1,"As an example of Deuteronomy’s thinking and often humane approach, the rules of war have a reasoned tone compared even to the contemporary world. Many of them occur elsewhere in the ancient Near East. The first four verses stress the frequently appearing idea that God fights on the Israelites’ behalf. From there vv.5–7 help to maintain the values of an agricultural society by keeping new builders, new planters, and newlyweds at home for a while. Added to this are considerations of troop morale (vv.8–9), offers of peaceful surrender terms (10–11), and the end results of siege as commonly portrayed in the ancient world (12–14). A different outcome is to be striven for in the case of the native Canaanites, who are to be wiped out, that Israel not be led astray into their “abominable” practices (16–18). The latter passage, especially since it is followed by an ecologically compassionate one about fruit trees, seems genocidal and hence morally unacceptable today. Clearly it stems from a zealous time and strong feelings; whether it was carried out as described we do not know. Medieval Jews solved the problem of moral sensibilities for themselves by defining the Canaanites as long dead with no contemporary successors. But the troubling nature of the text remains."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Unsolved Murder,Deuteronomy 21:1-9,1,"Another memorable addition to Israel’s law corpus, the case described here stands in stark contrast to the way things are done in contemporary society For us, an unsolved murder is a matter of intellectual curiosity, a puzzle to be unraveled on a television screen; in biblical Israel, innocent blood had to be atoned for by the entire group when the perpetrator went unfound. In the biblical view (as in that of other ancient societies), crime or wrongdoing was seen as completely disruptive, a threat to the well-being of the very cosmos. Here atonement is made via a public confession and the death of an animal—not with the usual “decontaminating” use of sacrificial blood but with a death that symbolically atones for the death of the murder victim."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Fair Captive,Deuteronomy 21:10-14,1,"The situation of the female captive recalls the opening chapters of the <i>Iliad</i>, where it forms a key motif. Here, though, rather than the pride and anger of great warriors being at stake, it is the woman’s humanity that is central. She is allowed to mourn her family, and retains her dignity to the extent that she cannot be sold as a slave if her husband eventually rejects her."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Wives and Sons,Deuteronomy 21:15-17,1,"A tension that is played out in the Jacob and Joseph stories in Genesis, the conflict between two wives and their sons must have been a troubling reality in the polygamous ancient Near East. This could be conventionally solved by a father’s selection of the “firstborn,” but note the brake put on the father’s absolute control (Frymer-Kensky 1992a)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Rebellious Son,Deuteronomy 21:18-21,1,"Part of creating any ordered society involves continuity between the generations. Even so, this law seems to us to be “cruel and unusual punishment.” It becomes more understandable in the context of Deuteronomy’s transfer of power from parents (who have a choice here to report their son) to elders, that is, to society at large (see Marcus). The behavior of this son is regarded as a threat, not only to his family, but to the entire community (Frymer-Kensky 1992a). The law may also be, in its intensity, a reflection of the God-Israel relationship (see Psalms 78:8, Jer. 5:23) (Greenstein, personal communication)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Dignity of the Corpse,Deuteronomy 21:22-23,1,"Not burying the corpse of an executed criminal results in the pollution of the land and eventual expulsion, as set forth graphically in Lev. 18:24–30."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Dignity of the Corpse,Deuteronomy 21:22-23,2,"for he is the firstfruit of his vigor,"
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Dignity of the Corpse,Deuteronomy 21:22-23,3,for him is the regulation of the firstborn-right.
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Wandering Animal,Deuteronomy 22:1-4,1,"Ex. 23:4–5 exhorted people to attend to their enemy’s lost or overburdened animal. Here the law is expanded (and applied to one’s neighbor’s animal) to include taking care of the animal, and indeed of any lost object, until the owner makes inquiry. At issue is loss of work for the owner."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Mixed Clothing,Deuteronomy 22:5,1,This prohibition touches on a frequent theme in Leviticus: the improper mixing of categories.
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Mother Bird and Child Bird,Deuteronomy 22:6-7,1,Another indicator of the humane concerns of Deuteronomy. There is an obvious parallel between the language here and that of the Fifth Commandment (honoring parents): “prolonging days” and “going-well” as a result of following these laws.
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Safe Roof,Deuteronomy 22:8,1,"Deuteronomy, with its concern for human life, prevents the shedding of innocent blood once again."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,More Forbidden Mixtures,Deuteronomy 22:9-11,1,"As Greenstein (1984a) explains, hybrids in various areas were understood as appropriate only for God (or, in the case of clothing, the priests)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Fringes,Deuteronomy 22:12,1,"Paralleling Num. 15:37–41—but this time with no rationale. In Numbers, the “tassels” were to serve as a constant reminder of the divine commandments."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The “Damaged” Wife,Deuteronomy 22:13-21,1,"A law that alternately upholds a woman’s dignity (making her husband pay if he has baselessly accused her) and may lead to taking her life (if the accusation is true). In the former case, they must remain married, and the husband has no possibility of divorcing her."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The “Damaged” Wife,Deuteronomy 22:13-21,2,"Virginity for women at marriage was an important value in ancient Israel as elsewhere. Frymer-Kensky (1992a) notes that this case parallels the one of the rebellious son above: the parents’ status and welfare is jeopardized; the parents can bring about the child’s death; and the elders have the authority to make a ruling, while the public has the power to put the offender to death."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Adultery,Deuteronomy 22:22,1,"The definition used here is the classic biblical one: a married woman and a man, married or not. In Mesopotamia it was possible to pay off the aggrieved husband, but not in ancient Israel, where adultery was seen as attacking the moral foundations of society and perhaps also the symbolism of the close relationship between God and Israel."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Rape—or Not,Deuteronomy 22:23-27,1,"In this case a woman is all but married, yet a distinction is made between an urban and a rural setting in terms of her fate. Note that her consent is not an issue here; as a betrothed woman, she had no right to give it (Frymer-Kensky 1992a)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Rape of an Unattached Woman,Deuteronomy 22:28-29,1,"The difference here, of course, is that the woman does not “belong” to a man. The rape must result in marriage, but since no husband’s privilege has been violated, the crime is neither a capital one nor even a criminal one. It is, however, seen as a “disgrace” (see Gen. 34:7)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,An Improper Union,Deuteronomy 23:1,1,"Instead of the long lists in Lev. 18 and 20, we are given only what is a paradigmatic case of people who must not have sexual relations."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Those Disqualified from the Community,Deuteronomy 23:2-9,1,"A curious list of those not counted as part of the “holy people”: one who cannot reproduce, one born of a forbidden union, and a descendant of two of Israel’s traditional enemies to the east. In contrast, the Edomites, Israel’s “cousins,” are permitted into the community after a waiting period. While scholars have tried to date these passages on the basis of specific historical events, such attempts are probably fruitless."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Purity of the Camp,Deuteronomy 23:10-15,1,"The matter of bodily wastes, interestingly, did not enter the list of ritually “polluting” emissions enumerated in Lev. 12 and 15. Unlike blood and semen, they did not carry the connotation of life-death boundaries. At the same time, it is recognized here that a lapse in personal cleanliness on the part ot the Israelites will violate the purity of the camp, in which God “dwells.”"
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Fugitive Slave,Deuteronomy 23:16-17,1,"Despite the accepted existence of slavery in Israelite society, Deuteronomy deemed it cruel to return fugitive slaves. This contrasts not only with ancient Near Eastern practice but also with some cases in the Bible (e.g., I Sam. 30:15, I Kings 2:39–40) (Greenstein 1985a)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Prostitution,Deuteronomy 23:18-19,1,"Earlier scholarship understood the reference here as “cultic prostitution,” in which pagan worshippers were supposed to have had intercourse with a temple functionary in order to induce the fertility of the earth. Most scholars presently discount this theory, for which there is little or no support, either in the Bible or elsewhere."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Prostitution,Deuteronomy 23:18-19,2,"Our passage may simply demonstrate that another aspect of Deuteronomy’s reform was to condemn prostitution, and to further stipulate that money so obtained could not be used to pay off a religious vow. Israelite women may have occasionally found themselves in the latter situation, which is also attested in the ancient Near East. See the discussion in Tigay, 1996."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Charging Interest,Deuteronomy 23:20-21,1,"The law prohibits taking interest within the community as a damaging practice. The society in question, of course, was not predominantly a commercial one, and hence later interpretations, such as that of medieval Christians and Jews, were to attempt to read other things into it."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Making Vows,Deuteronomy 23:22-24,1,"The issue of taking vows is treated extensively in the book of Numbers (cf. Chaps. 6 and 30), and was of major concern in the religious life of ancient Israel as an opportunity to make a more personal contribution to religious practice. The law also demonstrates the significance of the spoken word (through the use of “lips” and “mouth”), common to ancient societies and to many later ones as well."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Reasonable Use,Deuteronomy 23:25-26,1,"Establishing a boundary for farms and their produce, the law steers a path between a human need (food) and theft."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Laws of Remarriage,Deuteronomy 24:1-4,1,"Continuing the concern for holiness in the area of sexuality, Deuteronomy prohibits what occasionally happens in Western society—a woman remarries her first husband after her divorce from another man. Such behavior was considered ritually polluting in ancient Israel. It may also have been connected to the fact that the first husband, if the woman remarried him, would thus be receiving property from another man’s wealth (the second husband’s)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The New Wife,Deuteronomy 24:5,1,"This humane military rule may stem from a tradition separate from the one in 20:7. In any event, it appears to acknowledge sexuality as a part of marriage separate from procreation."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Pledge I,Deuteronomy 24:6,1,Even debt is a situation that must be handled sensitively; unfair collateral is not to be taken.
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Kidnapping,Deuteronomy 24:7,1,The capital crime here would appear to be the sale of specifically an Israelite as a slave.
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,A Reminder about Skin Disease,Deuteronomy 24:8-9,1,"As detailed in Lev. 13–15, <i>tzaraat</i> was some kind of skin condition that rendered a person temporarily unfit to be in the sacred camp. It was formerly identified with, and translated as, leprosy, but that is now felt to be incorrect by virtually all scholars. The law recurs here, among examples of injustice, because the disease was often viewed as the result of a person’s wrongful behaviors."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Pledge II,Deuteronomy 24:10-13,1,"A parallel to Ex. 22:24–26, which, in contrast to other cases of comparison between the two legal collections, has the more emotional tone. On the other hand, our passage emphasizes the dignity due even a debtor."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Timely Payment,Deuteronomy 24:14-15,1,"“Oppression” here consists of delaying the payment of a worker’s wages. The “calling out” to Y<small>HWH</small> recalls a similar cry of the oppressed in Ex. 22:22, 26. Overall, the rhetoric of the passage far exceeds that found in a parallel text in the Holiness Code (Lev. 19:13)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Fathers and Children,Deuteronomy 24:16,1,"An issue of deep concern to the exiles in Babylonia, this questioning of free will is raised a number of times in the Bible. In Ex. 22:23, God was to punish oppressors by making their “wives widows, and [their] children orphans”; Deuteronomy has toned this down by punishing the evildoer and not his or her children. Cf. Fishbane (1988) for discussion."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Oppressed Again,Deuteronomy 24:17-22,1,"The three classic powerless groups in Israel and elsewhere have been mentioned before, but now receive help based on a particularly Israelite rationale: the people’s historical experience of having been oppressed in Egypt. For a parallel passage, cf. Ex. 22:23–24."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Corporal Punishment,Deuteronomy 25:1-3,1,"Despite the predominance of “guilt” and “stroke/strike” in this passage, what is stressed in the end is more humanity than punishment."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Laboring Ox,Deuteronomy 25:4,1,Parallel to the respect due human beings is that due a working animal. This may also reflect the Israelites’ identification with certain animals in symbolic settings (cf. Eilberg-Schwartz).
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Keeping a Man’s Name Alive,Deuteronomy 25:5-10,1,"A number of stories and laws in the Bible clarify how important the continuity of the generations, as represented by carrying on a man’s name, was considered in ancient Israel. Here the law provides for the widow of a man who dies without heirs to provide one, through the institution of “levirate marriage”—whereby the man’s brother marries her, and the subsequent offspring bears the deceased brother’s name. This institution, applied to a more distant relative, vividly appears in the book of Ruth, which in fact contains a ceremony scene (4:1–11) of the kind set forth here."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Improper Intervention in a Struggle,Deuteronomy 25:11-12,1,"In a law literally protecting maleness, a wife loses her hand over an act understood by a patriarchal society to be completely intolerable. Not even the close ties of a woman to the males of her family may overrule this (Frymer-Kensky 1992a). But also at issue may be the idea that the convenant is passed on biologically, and hence damaging the genitals damages the covenant (Greenstein, personal communication)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,True Weights,Deuteronomy 25:13-16,1,"Not only violating “purity” in diet and worship are adjudged “abominations,” but also the practice of falsifying weights and measures. Ethics in business is thus an aspect of serving God properly (as it is in other ancient Near Eastern cultures)."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Amalek,Deuteronomy 25:17-19,1,"Hearkening back to Ex. 17:8–16, this passage clarifies the crime of the Amalekites against the newly freed Israelites. The attack on the rear was remembered bitterly in the Bible; cf. I Sam. 15 and the book of Esther, where the villain, Haman, is portrayed as a descendant of the Amalekite king Agag."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Declaration of the Farmer,Deuteronomy 26:1-15,1,"In a climactic set of ceremonies, those who work the land are to acknowledge God’s ownership of the soil. Through the offering of firstfruits, the memory of the Exodus and the gift of the land are kept immediate—“I have entered the land” (v.3). The descendants’ rootedness in “a land flowing with milk and honey” (9) is made to contrast with the ancestors’ wandering. This characterization of the land, and thanksgiving for its produce, is reiterated in the brief section about tithes (12–15). Thus the land is not taken for granted, and Israel celebrates, not the sexuality of the gods as the source of the soil’s fertility, but rather the gift of a God who has intervened in human history."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Declaration of the Farmer,Deuteronomy 26:1-15,2,"This chapter is a fitting end to the sequence of laws in Deuteronomy; emphasizing the gift of the land (as Buber 1982 points out, “give” in various permutations occurs seven times) suggests that the gift may be revoked if the society does not uphold the covenant. Also notable is the sixfold use of the Hebrew root b-w-’(<i>bo</i>’), appearing here variously as “enter,” “produce,” “bring.”"
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,Summary,Deuteronomy 26:16-19,1,"The chapter, and the laws proper, end with the general observation that a two-way covenant has been made, as in Ex. 19:5–6. The result takes a high nationalistic turn in v.19, which once again seems to fit primarily an age of monarchy."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Covenant Ceremony,Deuteronomy 27:1-26,1,"As if to dramatize what has just concluded, the text at this point interpolates a ceremony that in location (Shechem) and theme anticipates what we find at the end of the book of Joshua (Chap. 24). It also encourages viewing Deuteronomy as a Northern document. Here the core is the series of curses uttered on Mount Eval in vv.15–26 (the blessings, curiously, do not appear). The curses, which do not introduce any new material as such, reflect the community’s fear that someone will sin in secret and not be found out, and the entire community will suffer as a result (Bellefontaine). The public pronouncement of threats was not unusual at the sealing of an agreement in the ancient Near East. As in previous legal sections, we are presented with a mixture of areas—criminal, sexual, and ritual—ending with the general provision that the “words of this Instruction” are to be carefully observed."
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Consequences,Deuteronomy 28:1-69,1,"Following the dramatic ceremony of Chap. 27, which, as an event placed in the future, feels somewhat artificial, is the more conventional listing of blessings and curses, parallel to Lev. 26. The latter functionally ends the book of Leviticus (Chap. 27 is obviously a kind of appendix), and our chapter here ends the long legal portion of Deuteronomy. A further parallel is the summary verses in each; Lev. 26 ends with “These are the laws, the regulations and the instructions that Y<small>HWH</small> gave / between himself and the Children of Israel at Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moshe,” while v.69 of our chapter is “These are the words of the covenant / that Y<small>HWH</small> commanded Moshe to cut with the Children of Israel / in the land of Moav, / aside from the covenant that he cut with them at Horev.”"
 III: the Terms of the Covenant,Deuteronomy 12:1-28:69,The Consequences,Deuteronomy 28:1-69,2,"As is typical of this kind of literature, the curses seem to outweigh the blessings, not only in verse count (55 to 14) but in color of description as well. While later generations of Jews, horrified by the warnings of disaster, stipulated that this chapter be read in an undertone when it is a weekly public synagogue reading, it is fairly standard stuff in the context of ancient Near Eastern treaties."
 IV: Concluding Exhortation,Deuteronomy 29:1-30:20,Renewed Exhortation,Deuteronomy 29:1-28,1,"Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come."
 IV: Concluding Exhortation,Deuteronomy 29:1-30:20,Renewed Exhortation,Deuteronomy 29:1-28,2,"Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
 IV: Concluding Exhortation,Deuteronomy 29:1-30:20,Exile and Return,Deuteronomy 30:1-20,1,"A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. <i>shuv</i> (“return / restore”)."
 V: Final Matters,Deuteronomy 31:1-34:12,Preparing for the Future,Deuteronomy 31:1-30,1,"Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior."
 V: Final Matters,Deuteronomy 31:1-34:12,Preparing for the Future,Deuteronomy 31:1-30,2,"It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
 V: Final Matters,Deuteronomy 31:1-34:12,The Song of Moshe,Deuteronomy 32:1-43,1,"Especially in the ancient and medieval world, the death accounts of heroes tend to end with inspired visions. The inclusion of an ancient poem here is made to fit further into the context of Moshe’s exhortations in Deuteronomy—as a final warning to and witness against the people whom he has led. The “song” emphasizes the power and caring nature of God, which is contrasted with Israel’s pathetic response of unfaithfulness. God is likened to a nurturing parent and a protecting eagle; when Israel responds with idolatry, he turns into a destroyer. Much of this poem reminds one of other biblical literature, such as Psalm 78—also a reprise of Israel’s history. That poem is recited as a proof of God’s choosing the (southern) House of David; the political motivation behind Deut. 32, if there was one, is no longer clear to us."
 V: Final Matters,Deuteronomy 31:1-34:12,The Song of Moshe,Deuteronomy 32:1-43,2,"Skehan notes that the number of verses in the song, 69, equals the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet (23) times three. Similar or related schemes appear elsewhere in the Bible, often in the form of acrostics (cf. Lamentations)."
 V: Final Matters,Deuteronomy 31:1-34:12,The Song of Moshe,Deuteronomy 32:1-43,3,"The song, which may predate Deuteronomy, may have been placed here as a traditional poem that meaningfully deals with catastrophe (Tigay). Despite the obscurity of some of its phrases, it stands as a witness to Israel’s self-understanding, albeit a negative one."
 V: Final Matters,Deuteronomy 31:1-34:12,Some Final Words,Deuteronomy 32:44-52,1,"Moshe’s last regular words to the people reiterate the theme of “life” noted earlier. On the other hand, God, at the end of Moshe’s life, cannot refrain from reminding him (and us) of the reason that the great leader may not enter the Promised Land (v.51)."
 V: Final Matters,Deuteronomy 31:1-34:12,The Blessing of Moshe,Deuteronomy 33:1-29,1,"As if to balance Yaakov’s deathbed blessing of his sons at the end (Chap. 49) of Genesis, Moshe doubles his poetic vision and blesses Israel, tribe by tribe. The weighting of tribes is very different here from what it was in Genesis: Levi is quite strong, Shim’on has disappeared, and Yehuda, the tribe of David’s royal lineage, has a reduced role. Some scholars are therefore inclined to see a background of Northern ascendancy behind this poem, perhaps the days of Jeroboam II (early eighth century <small>B.C.E.</small>)."
 V: Final Matters,Deuteronomy 31:1-34:12,The Blessing of Moshe,Deuteronomy 33:1-29,2,"For a useful comparison of this chapter with other tribal blessings in the Bible, see Plaut; for discussion of textual problems, Tigay is clear and helpful."
 V: Final Matters,Deuteronomy 31:1-34:12,The End,Deuteronomy 34:1-12,1,"Genesis concluded with the death of Yosef; Joshua will end with the death of the victorious general. Moshe’s passing provides the natural ending for the Torah; like that other great work of the first millennium <small>B.C.E.</small>, the <i>Iliad</i>, a funeral marks the end of the old generation and old circumstances.
