<i>Pollution from</i> Tzaraat (13): Notable in this chapter is the role of the priest, who functions neither as medicine man nor as doctor, but simply as a religious official whose duty it is to check the afflicted person for signs of what is considered ritually polluting, and to act accordingly.

Like other sections of Leviticus, this chapter and the next show signs of editing (for instance, the material in 13:47–59). Nevertheless, there is a clear structural pattern characterized by variations of “when … if … if” (Wenham).

The chapter’s character as “instruction manual” is brought out, according to Fishbane (1974), by its chiastic structure. It is built on three word-groups: (1) “swelling,” (2) “scab/spread,” (3) “shiny-spot” that recur in vv.4–38 (in the form: 3,2,1; 1,2,3; 3,2,1; 2,3). This “unexpected structure” (especially in a nonliterary text), he maintains, may have had the function of easing memorization for the priests, who needed to know this material for their “fieldwork.”
