Numbers 22:2-25:9

N<small>OW EMBEDDED WITHIN THE SECOND PART OF THE BOOK OF</small> N<small>UMBERS, THE STORIES</small> and exalted poetry connected with the name of the pagan prophet Bil'am (Balaam) in many ways point to the final section of the book. They provide a welcome relief from the depressing and at times exasperating narratives of rebellion. Israel in Bil'am’s vision is the realization of the patriarchal dream, a sea of people (and tents) without number, upright in conduct and victorious in battle. In its focusing on the theme of reversal—curses turned to blessings, ass turned seer/prophet, and prophet turned fool—the Bil'am section suggests that, as we leave the old generation to die out in the wilderness, God’s own “cursing” of the people because of their rebelliousness will somehow, ultimately, be turned into blessing. No wonder that Buber (1988) felt the hidden presence of Moses and his vision of Israel in these chapters.

Recent archaeological finds have placed Bil'am as a figure known to extrabiblical traditions located in the lands east of the Jordan. The Torah uses him (as the Bible may have used Job and other such personalities) for its own purposes, picking up a theme it has utilized earlier: the acknowledgment of God’s power and Israel’s glory by a wise or inspired pagan (cf., for instance, the figure of Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, in Ex. 18; or, to use later examples, Jericho’s Rahab in Josh. 2 and the Queen of Sheba in I Kings 10). Just as the Pharaoh is made to acknowledge God’s power and Israel’s glory toward the beginning of the Exodus sequence, so the nations or tribes surrounding Israel are portrayed as coming to the same realization at its end. Bil'am, as it were, provides religious legitimacy for these ideas in the non-Israelite domain.

The narrative is built, not only on obvious theme words such as “word,” “speak,” and “curse/revile/doom,” but also on repeating phrases. Central to them, in variation, is “only the word that I [God] speak to you, / that (alone) may speak” (22:20, 35, 38; 23:12, 36). The episode with the she-ass, one of the most unusual in the Bible, revolves around the threefold “And the she-ass saw YHWH’s messenger” (22:23, 2.5, 27), suggesting, of course, that Bil'am, the reputed holy man, does not see him. The story also offers an illustration of the Bible’s balanced sense of justice: Balak “once again” sends emissaries, Bil'am “once again” beats the she-ass, but these actions are thwarted by the divine messenger’s “once again” blocking the path (and, symbolically, the curse).

While some scholars have suggested that the she-ass section has origins independent from the main body of the story, it is verbally linked to Bil'am’s speeches later in the story by a single device. The refrain of “these three times,” describing Bil'am’s beating of the she-ass and her refusal to continue, is matched by the threefold refusal of God to allow anything but blessing to publicly issue forth from the prophet’s mouth (“[on] these three occasions,” 24:10).

The poetic sections of the story are built on the basis of a stock scene: Bil'am has Balak build seven altars and prepare seven bulls and seven rams; the prophet sacrifices the animals, and has the king stand alongside the altars while he, Bil'am, goes off to encounter God. When he returns, he “takes up his parable,” stressing twice how God blesses, not curses, Israel, and how he will under no circumstances revoke that blessing. The full version of the blessing, beginning in 24:3, is distinguished by its lofty tone (clearly suggesting the infusion of the “spirit of God” [24:2]). The tripled “Utters …” signals an abrupt change in mood and inspiration; the word, more properly “the utterance of …,” is frequently used by the later Prophets to open their speeches.

A word should be said about the “oracles to the nations” that begin in 24:17. These are reminiscent of many Prophetic passages, in which the seer turns outside Israel and addresses the neighboring peoples (e.g., Amos 1–2:3). Their inclusion in Numbers helps to link the Bil'am story with what has immediately preceded it, the account of Israel’s militarily successful encounter with its historical neighbors.

Similarly, the Bil'am episode is linked to the chapter that follows it, the apostasy at Baal-Peor. A tradition reported in 31:8 informs us that Bil'am was among those killed by Pin’has in his “zeal” or “indignation” (Fishbane 1974) for Y<small>HWH</small>.
