"The Early Prophets, The Kings of Israel in the Book of Kings",1,"T<small>HE EXACT CHRONOLOGY OF KINGS IN THE</small> B<small>IBLE IS NOT CERTAIN</small>. T<small>HERE HAVE</small> been many detailed attempts to square the numbers of southern and northern rulers and fix their dates; these typically deal with such issues as when in a given year a king’s reign began. Problems with the overall chronology of the kings have not been fully resolved, but a recent study by Hughes posits that this is due to there being essentially two kinds of chronologies in Kings: an earlier, fairly accurate one, based on existing chronicles, and later editorial reworkings, which may be termed “schematic.” The latter, rather than attempting to reconstruct facts, present Israel’s history as part of a divine plan, demonstrating through ordered chronology that history is meaningful. This mixture of chronologies reflects the complicated process through which the book came into being."

"The Early Prophets, Ii; the Split: Kings North and South",1,(I 12:1–16:22)
"The Early Prophets, Ii; the Split: Kings North and South",2,"S<small>HELOMO’S DEATH IS FOLLOWED BY AN EVENT THAT FLOWED FROM THE NATURAL</small> geographical and economic conditions of the land of Israel: the splitting of his little empire into two independent kingdoms. While the Bible’s overall explanation for this fateful event is Shelomo’s idolatry in old age, the immediate impetus for the political fracture is his son Rehav’am’s shortcomings as a ruler, following hard on the rigors of Shelomo’s extensive building program. But the writers are also at pains to make clear that the new king of the north, Yorov’am, commits a grave act of rebellion against Y<small>HWH</small> by establishing rival sanctuaries to the Jerusalem Temple and constructing molten calves of gold. Scholars note that, from the perspective of northern practice, these and other cultic acts of Yorov’am do not actually constitute idol worship, but the text is written from a southern point of view, and hence Yorov’am emerges as a kind of model sinner. From this point on in chronicling events in the north, the text will compare every one of its kings to this first one, emphasizing how virtually all of them continued in his nefarious tradition. And, as Cogan (2001) points out, only two of them will die a peaceful death: Omri and Yehu, both of whom will found dynasties. It is as if the Northern Kingdom is doomed from the start because of Yorov’am’s deeds."
"The Early Prophets, Ii; the Split: Kings North and South",3,"With the rift accomplished, the bulk of Israel’s history on the land is presented in the form of two parallel accounts which alternate but are at the same time interwoven. As background it should be noted that the Northern Kingdom of Israel, large, fertile, and prosperous, lay closer to the eastern lands of the Fertile Crescent, and thus was involved in greater economic and cultural interaction with other civilizations. In contrast, the Southern Kingdom of Judah, with its rocky hills and relative isolation, was, at least corresponding to this point in the narrative, less prominent in both text and historical record."
"The Early Prophets, Ii; the Split: Kings North and South",4,"The dynastic history of Israel recounted in Kings is a troubled one, marked by frequent changes in rulership brought about through coups and assassinations. While the standard Assyrian reference to the north by the name Bit Humri, “The House of Omri,” does not reflect the complex picture that emerges from biblical texts, it does demonstrate the prominence of that particular dynasty, and Kings is at pains to describe its rise and fall."
"The Early Prophets, Ii; the Split: Kings North and South",5,"This long middle section of the book, here encompassing Parts II–IV, is punctuated by so-called regnal formulas, the descriptions of kings’ accessions and deaths by means of standardized expressions. Thus a typical king of Israel is said to come to the throne in Year X of a corresponding king of Judah’s reign, and vice versa. We are given his age on accession, the length of his reign, and often his mother’s name—an important element in a society where kings, at least, could be polygamous. More important, from the Bible’s point of view, is the evaluation that usually follows: “He did what was evil/good in the eyes of Y<small>HWH”</small> (always with either Yorov’am or David as the measuring rod), a phrase which lets us know up front how the text wishes us to evaluate the king’s tenure. At the other end of a typical reign, three things are usually noted: first, mention is made of a mysterious “Record of Yearly Events (or Annals) of the Kings of ____” for any further information we may require; second, the king’s death, if peaceful, is described in the phrase “he lay beside his fathers”; and third, the name of his successor, usually his son, is noted. These formulaic phrases provide coherence to a long series of narratives, and also enable the text to occasionally moderate its black-and-white stance by deviating slightly from the standard phrasing. So, for example, there are passages such as II 14:3–4, where"
"The Early Prophets, Ii; the Split: Kings North and South",6,He [Amatzyahu] did what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>—
"The Early Prophets, Ii; the Split: Kings North and South",7,"however, not like David his father;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii; the Split: Kings North and South",8,"exactly as Yoash his father had done, he did."
"The Early Prophets, Ii; the Split: Kings North and South",9,"However, the sanctuaries were not removed;"
"The Early Prophets, Ii; the Split: Kings North and South",10,the people still were offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke at the sanctuaries.
"The Early Prophets, Iv; Southern and Northern Kings: Destruction I",1,(II 14–17)
"The Early Prophets, Iv; Southern and Northern Kings: Destruction I",2,"W<small>ITH THE DEATH OF</small> E<small>LISHA AND THE FALL OF THE</small> O<small>MRIDE DYNASTY, THE TEXT</small> settles into narrating a depressing succession of rulers in both kingdoms, culminating with the fall of the Northern Kingdom after a revolt against Assyria in 722. Prominently featured are the formulas mentioned previously—dates, age at accession, length of reign, mother’s name, and, most important, whether or not the king did “what was good in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>.” The chief events reported are military ones, with occasional forays into palace coups. But there is not much material on the actual lives of the Israelites, or even of the kings themselves. This is striking, considering that for the first half of the eighth century, both Israel and Judah were ruled over for long periods of time by a single king apiece, Azarya in the south and Yorov’am II in the north. At the beginning of Chap. 15, the account of Azarya’s fifty-two-year reign mentions only two facts: that he did not remove the oft-condemned local sanctuaries, and that, as a result, he was stricken with a plague and confined to the royal palace for an untold period of time. Regarding Yorov’am as well, a king whose reign witnessed economic prosperity (for the rich, at any rate), there are only a few verses, mentioning his military exploits but, more important, condemning him for doing evil in God’s sight."
"The Early Prophets, Iv; Southern and Northern Kings: Destruction I",3,"The pattern of synchronic, alternating histories such as we find in these chapters has a parallel in Assyrian records; just as there, Assyria takes primacy over Babylonia, so here Judah predominates over Israel (Cogan/Tadmor). And the events reported in this part of Kings are for the most part corroborated by other ancient Near Eastern sources."
"The Early Prophets, Iv; Southern and Northern Kings: Destruction I",4,"The bulk of this section is devoted to Chap. 17, which, after a cursory description of the fall of Shomeron, goes on at great length about the meaning and aftermath of the Northern Kingdom’s demise (see Commentary to that chapter)."
"The Early Prophets, Iv; Southern and Northern Kings: Destruction I",5,"Historically speaking, for several decades preceding the middle of the eighth century, Assyria had been in decline, but beginning with the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III in 742, there was a resumption of its military aggressiveness. As Hallo/Simpson note, it was not unusual for a revolt to follow a change of rulers, and this may have provided some impetus for the king’s western campaigns. The result would have been destruction of much of the Israelite Northern Kingdom before Tiglath-Pileser’s final act, the siege of Shomeron (Samaria)."
"The Early Prophets, On Three Kings of Judah",1,"A<small>LTHOUGH THE BOOK OF</small> K<small>INGS COVERS THE REIGNS OF THIRTY-NINE KINGS AND</small> one queen, three of Judah’s rulers who appear toward the end of the book occupy disproportionate space and thus have particular importance: Hizkiyyahu (Hezekiah), Menashe (Manasseh), and Yoshiyyahu (Josiah). While recovering precise historical information about these kings is difficult, given the ideological thrust of the biblical text and the vagueness of some passages, the way in which the Bible presents them has great interest for the overall narrative. Their portrayal in Kings posits that, despite the extensive reforms (especially the eradication of idol worship) enacted by Hizkiyyahu in the late eighth century and Yoshiyyahu in the late seventh, it is Menashe’s evil deeds which ultimately could not be overlooked or overcome, and Judah inevitably met its horrible fate of destruction and exile. In these texts one can feel a later historian, if not the wider culture itself, attempting to grapple with the question, “If Hizkiyyahu and Yoshiyyahu were so faithful and zealous in their observance of the covenant, why was Jerusalem destroyed in 587?”"
"The Early Prophets, On Three Kings of Judah",2,"Historically, things may well not have been this cut and dried. Scholars note that the presentation of the three kings might be said to follow a classic ancient Near Eastern literary pattern, where good kings alternate with bad. Then, too, it is unclear how much the first reform under Hizkiyyahu has influenced the telling of the second under Yoshiyyahu, and possibly vice versa. We are thus left with, as usual, a series of memories that have been processed. The book of Chronicles, written later and perhaps using other sources, sees the history differently. It gives many more details on Hizkiyyahu’s reform, and presents a startling view of Menashe, absent in Kings, as an evildoer who, after being exiled, repented and restored his father’s covenantal loyalty."
"The Early Prophets, On Three Kings of Judah",3,"The reign of Hizkiyyahu, dated by many scholars from c. 715 to 687, encompasses at least two events of major importance to the biblical text: his attempt at wide- ranging religious reform and his rebellion against Assyria, which Jerusalem survived but which decimated much of the rest of Judah."
"The Early Prophets, On Three Kings of Judah",4,"The reform, outlined briefly at the beginning of Chap. 18, is described as involving the destruction of pagan altars around the country and the concentration of the sacrificial cult in the Jerusalem Temple. Since these ideas are central to the book of Deuteronomy, some scholars have been inclined to identify the period of Hizkiyyahu’s reign as the time of origin of much of the Deuteronomistic History (DH), which, as the reader will recall, is often bunched together with that fifth book of the Torah. This conclusion is buttressed by the undoubted emigration of northern refugees from the destruction of Israel in 722, a population which might well have brought with them the kind of northern-based traditions found in both Deuteronomy and portions of DH. In any event, it is not clear how successful Hizkiyyahu’s policy was; its accomplishments may have been played down by Josianic editors a century later, who sought to claim greater credit for their own reformer king, Yoshiyyahu (Rosenbaum)."
"The Early Prophets, On Three Kings of Judah",5,"Hizkiyyahu revolted against Assyria, as did some other sections of the empire such as Babylonia after the death of Sargon II in 705. This led to a ruthless campaign by the new king of Assyria, Sennacherib, who destroyed numerous Judean towns, as enduringly attested to in an astounding frieze, now displayed in the British Museum, which portrays the successful siege of the fortress city of Lachish. Assyrian texts compare Hizkiyyahu’s subsequent entrapment in a besieged Jerusalem to the situation of “a bird in a cage.” That the king and the city unexpectedly survived this potentially catastrophic situation seems to have been taken as a sign of divine favor, and may have contributed to Jerusalem’s false sense of security a century later under similarly trying circumstances."
"The Early Prophets, On Three Kings of Judah",6,"Another archaeological remnant of Hizkiyyahu’s kingship comprises many storage jars stamped <i>Imlk</i>, “belonging to the king,” which have been recovered at the northern and western borders of ancient Judah and dated to this period. They give evidence of preparations for the Assyrian invasion, as well as supporting the extent of the king’s control of the country, an element necessary for a major reform."
"The Early Prophets, On Three Kings of Judah",7,"Most intriguing, and historically valuable, are the two major material remains of the period: the Siloam water tunnel with its famous inscription describing the two teams of workers finally meeting (although some scholars have now dated this to Menashe’s reign), and the remnant of the so-called Broad Wall of Jerusalem, over twenty feet wide. It is clear that the defense preparation and expansion of the capital city are among the truly enduring of Hizkiyyahu’s accomplishments. Jerusalem as we come to know it in the Bible, substantially expanded up the western hill from the small city of David and Solomon, is basically Hizkiyyahu’s city."
"The Early Prophets, On Three Kings of Judah",8,"As indicated above, in Menashe the writers of Kings found their last great villain (earlier ones in the book had been Yorov’am and Ah’av). His reign encompasses most of the first half of the seventh century, in a time of relative quiet in the Assyrian Empire (the destruction of Babylon in 689 notwithstanding). Our book goes to great lengths to excoriate Menashe’s restoration of pagan worship in Jerusalem. This was undoubtedly a return to earlier popular forms of religion in Judah and not an attempt to curry favor with the Assyrians, who normally did not impose their religion on their foreign subjects. Whatever the historical realities, Menashe as we encounter him in Kings is, covenantally speaking, a monster; the fact that he also “filledjerusalem with blood” seems almost to be an afterthought. From DH’s standpoint, he is the inheritor of the heretical mantle of Ah’av, and seals Jerusalem’s fate, which will not be played out until over a half century after his death, just as Ah’av’s punishment was postponed onto the next generation. In both cases, one senses a writer or writers struggling to understand the meaning of historical events. The destruction of Jerusalem in 587 urgently needed an explanation, especially after Yoshiyyahu’s striking reform, and the memory of Menashe, sandwiched between that of the two great reformer kings, provided a focus. As mentioned above, the later book of Chronicles, with its own agenda, presents Menashe in a much better light, and lays the blame for the fall of Jerusalem on the generation of the destruction (see II Chron. 36:14–16)."
"The Early Prophets, On Three Kings of Judah",9,"With Yoshiyyahu, we encounter a figure whose importance in Israelite thought and history transcends his own time. The text has him come to the throne as a child, around 640; although he does not reach the age of forty, his reign witnesses a momentous historical shift in the entire region, including the fall of the Assyrian capital Nineveh and the rise of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. But the biblical text is most interested in Yoshiyyahu’s reform, which is described as sweeping and is studded with dramatic events: the destruction of pagan shrines, the observance of Passover after a centuries-long hiatus, and the cleaning up of the Temple, which includes the finding of the document termed “the Record of the Instruction of Moshe.”"
"The Early Prophets, On Three Kings of Judah",10,"The reform itself seems ultimately to have failed; in any case, the great hopes pinned on Yoshiyyahu as the revived David were cut short by his ill-advised military move up to Megiddo, where the book of Kings reports that he was slain by the Egyptian king in an attempt to inject himself into international power politics."
"The Early Prophets, On Three Kings of Judah",11,"In Kings, Yoshiyyahu is the Last Great Hope of Judah. The praise heaped on him may reflect a new and strongly nationalistic energy in the wake of Assyria’s decline and fall, a development which has led many scholars to view his reign as the occasion for compiling the book of Joshua. Seen by the text as the incomparable echo of David, Yoshiyyahu is faithful to Y<small>HWH</small> in the extreme, in fulfillment of a prophecy which we encountered earlier (I Kings 13:2); his ruthless purging of non-Y<small>HWH</small> sanctuaries as the text describes it made a lasting impression on later Western culture as well. Equally important, the “discovery” of what may well have been the core of Deuteronomy (22:8ff.) suggests for many scholars that a good deal of what came to be the Early Prophets was written or edited during his reign. The debate rages on as to whether the writing/editing began under Hizkiyyahu, as I hinted at above, but the general circumstances favorable to the production of much of the text appears, in the mind of many scholars, to fit well in the waning days of monarchic Judah. Assessing the later contribution of the exilic period in this regard remains a matter of vigorous discussion among scholars."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1",1,"Chapter 1. The Birth of Shemuel: “There was a man,” the folktale-type wording with which Samuel opens, immediately establishes continuity with the book of Judges, as it was the same phrase that introduced several stories there (Chaps. 13, 17, and 19). But here it is a woman, Hanna, who will be the central character. As was the case with Sara, Rivka, and Rahel in Genesis, as well as with Shimshon’s mother in Judges, her barrenness is a signal of something momentous to come. Yet the text takes its time, painting an intimate picture of a family and dwelling in detail on personalities in a way that sets the tone for the character-driven book of Samuel. Here are vivid portraits of a tender but clueless husband, an insensitive priest, and, above all, a woman whose desire for a child is so intense that she is willing to surrender him to the service of God well before he has grown up. This pattern of wish, fulfillment, and partial loss is also emblematic of the experience that Israel will have in the coming narratives, beginning with a new monarchy, political splendor, and military victory in Samuel but ending with the near snuffing out of the Davidic dynasty at the end of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1",2,"It may seem surprising that this book, which is so much about male leadership, begins by focusing on a woman. But as I suggested previously, throughout both Judges and Samuel, the characterization of women often helps to clarify issues of leadership. Additionally, Hanna’s experiences and her voice set the personal tone through which these issues will be subsequently played out. And once again, a classic biblical pattern appears, as a person or type from whom we might not expect success—here a barren wife, elsewhere a younger brother—comes to prevail in the end."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1",3,"The way in which Eli the priest is portrayed is also worthy of comment. While his heart seems to be in the right place, his failure to distinguish in this opening chapter between the true prayer of the heart and drunken babbling is already a sign of inner shortcomings. As the story progresses, we will note his failure as father and leader (the narrator equates the two), culminating in his literal blindness and his dramatic death."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 1",4,"The key word in this chapter is “request,” which occurs seven times; it will return, doubled, in 2:20, to round out the story. Many scholars have taken this to mean that the book originally began with material about the birth of Sha’ul, the “requested one,” and that something has been confused in the editing process. Others, myself included, note in the final text a deliberate and profound connection between the two men (see the discussion in Garsiel 1985). In addition, Hanna’s request for a son foreshadows Israel’s request for a king seven chapters hence (Polzin 1989)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2",1,"Chapter 2. The Song of Hanna; Eli and His Sons: Hanna’s prayer occurs earlier in Samuel than any other poem in a biblical narrative book. As mentioned above, it introduces the idea that God may reverse the expected course of events. It thus carries the repetition of an oft-rehearsed biblical theme which undoubtedly points to the people of Israel itself, in its status as a latecomer and a frequently subordinate group in the ancient Near East."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2",2,"Not surprisingly, the poem is shot through with vocabulary reflecting both ends of the social spectrum. “Mighty … sated … rich … noble … might” alternate with “those who stumble … those once hungry … the barren one … the needy … the destitute,” and the like. The line “The barren one has given birth to seven” (v.5) is perhaps the immediate reason for its having been chosen for the mouth of the previously childless Hanna; such verbal connections between texts, which often hinge on a single word or phrase, are fairly typical in ancient literature. But above all, it is the triumphant ending on a monarchical note, with the exalting of God’s “anointed,” that not so subtly indicates what we are reading: a book about the choosing of a king."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2",3,"When the narrative resumes, even before we learn anything about Shemuel as Eli’s successor, the text makes sure that we are aware of the state of deterioration into which the worship of Y<small>HWH</small> has fallen. As a prelude to the actions of Eli’s sons, we are told at some length how even the servants of the priests make a mockery of the sacrifices in their zeal to extract the priests’ due. Only in v.22 do we learn of the exact nature of the sons’ sin, the serious act of sleeping with the serving-women at the very entrance to the shrine. Despite Eli’s entreaties, his sons ignore him because Y<small>HWH</small> has other plans."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 2",4,"The long condemnation of Eli by Y<small>HWH</small> through an anonymous “man of God” that ends the chapter in vv.27–36 leaves no doubt about the fate of the priest and his descendants. It mirrors what will happen to Sha’ul, Israel’s first king, later in the book."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1",1,"Chapters 3:1–4:1. The Call of Shemuel: There are numerous other “call” scenes in the Bible, where a prophet or leader such as Moshe (Moses) or Yesha’yahu (Isaiah) is chosen, but the present story is unique in both its location and cast of characters. At a time when the word of God is rare (V.1), Shemuel, who is either a child or a teenager, hears the voice of God in the very sanctuary at Shilo. Both he and the aging priest mistake what is happening, but Eli finally realizes that it is God himself speaking, and so he prepares the lad for the inevitable revelation. The divine message confirms what we saw in the previous chapter: Eli, who has failed as a father of priests, is rejected by God, and his sons will not succeed him. No future sacrifices or rituals can change that. Strikingly, nevertheless, his reaction to this news is to humbly accept God’s will."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 3:1–4:1",2,"The reader will note that God’s words to Shemuel do not, as so often in biblical “call” narratives, require answer and dialogue. Young Shemuel appears in this chapter as one through whom God speaks, and is thus a prophet, but there is none of the usual tension between the one called and the burden he is asked to carry—at least for the moment—that we find elsewhere in the Bible."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22",1,"Chapter 4:2–22. Defeat, Disaster, and the Death of Eli: The course of the last two books, Joshua and Judges, made clear that victory in battle would depend solely on Israel’s faithfulness to YHWH. Given that Chaps. 2–3 have convincingly demonstrated that leadership is failing badly, the outcome of the brewing battle in Chap. 4 is a foregone conclusion. The military encounter itself takes only one verse, and the defeat causes the Israelites to believe that they have only one recourse. As Hamilton notes, they do not even think of consulting Shemuel. Instead, as in many cultures, they decide to bring their great national and religious symbol, in this case the Coffer (Ark) of the Covenant, with them into battle, to afford protection and victory. Initially, the Philistines are overcome by fear of YHWH, but they rally themselves to “be men” (v.9) and the Israelites are defeated once again. This time a triple catastrophe occurs: military defeat, the capture of the Coffer, and the death of Eli’s sons."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22",2,"Beginning in v.12, a classic scene unfolds. Accounts of ancient battles always include the bringing of the news to wives, mothers, and fathers; one need only recall the pathos of the Greek story of Jason’s father, Aegeus, awaiting his son’s return from Colchis. The present text contains interesting variations on the old theme. Eli anxiously awaits word of the fate of the Coffer, having apparently written off his sons, but unexpectedly, the text gives new bits of information about him: he is ninety-eight, blind, and heavy. All these seemingly superfluous details come together in the vivid description of his death that follows, where his life comes crashing down as he sits in his seat of power. It is the literal downfall of an aged leader who lacks vision, whose office weighs him down, and who cannot survive the loss of the cult object whose purpose he has served his whole life."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22",3,"As if to reinforce the negative message, the chapter ends with an ill-boding birth, that of Eli’s grandson. In the mother’s dying moments, she is compelled to give her child the fateful name of “Where-is-Glory,” which betokens the capture of the Coffer."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22",4,"Thus in the overall opening section of the book of Samuel the normal course of events is reversed, and a shadow is temporarily cast over the future. But we also know that with Shemuel, future leadership is in place, and it appears to be of a higher quality than what preceded it."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22",5,"This chapter witnesses the introduction of the Philistines into biblical narrative. In Judges and Samuel, the Philistines are the archenemies of Israel, a powerful people resident mostly on or around the country’s southern coast, and technologically superior through their possession of iron. Their portrayal in the Bible is entirely negative, and almost no useful cultural details are given about them except for their being uncircumcised. Similarly, the archaeological record about the Philistines is spotty, but thanks to the work of the Dothans and others, we can now piece together a tentative picture. This group may well have been one of the “Sea Peoples” who invaded the Middle East in the twelfth century. The Bible gives Crete (or possibly Cyprus) as their point of origin, but they may have come from Asia Minor or the Aegean. Some Canaanite element is also possible. The visual records from Egypt, which successfully repulsed their attack, show warriors with plumed helmets, although they were not the only group to be so attired. In those texts, the Philistines are referred to as Peleshet or Tjekker. Distinctive cultural elements include the coloring and decoration of pottery, which was red and black with birds and other figures, a double ax of bronze, and a floor plan of temples which is closer to that of Aegean models than of Canaanite ones. Nevertheless, the Philistines appear to have been extremely adaptable, quickly absorbing Canaanite language and gods (including the aforementioned Dagon). Sadly, none of their texts has survived."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22",6,"The Philistines are portrayed as having settled in five coastal or near-coastal cities: Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, Gat, and Gaza. Their reach, however, was greater. There is evidence of Philistine presence in Bet-She’an, just west of the Jordan River, and battles with them as reported in the Bible range throughout the central and northern parts of the land. David is credited with ending their dominance in the area."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 4:2–22",7,"It is ironic that Israel’s classic enemy ultimately gave their name to the country itself. The Greeks and Romans dubbed it Palestine, the Land of the Philistines, and the name has been used for centuries as a neutral term by scholars, but the past few decades of Middle Eastern politics have given it a more charged connotation."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5",1,"Chapter 5. The Philistines and the Coffer: As if to stress that the Philistines’ victory in the previous chapter was the doing of God and not strictly the result of their own military prowess, the text follows the Coffer to the Philistine town of Ashdod, where it becomes clear that possessing it brings danger. In passages that express the Bible’s usual contempt for pagan culture, the very statue of the Philistine god Dagon is mysteriously destroyed by the Coffer’s presence, and the inhabitants, first, of Ashdod, and then of Gat, are stricken with hemorrhoids to the point that their “cry-for-help went up to the heavens” (v.12). Clearly, the Coffer will have to be returned to Israel."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5",2,concerning the taking of the Coffer of God
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 5",3,and concerning her father-in-law and her husband.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6",1,"Chapters 6.Following the Coffer: The theme of the Coffer’s potency continues, with the Philistines making elaborate preparations, including sacrifices and reparations consisting (somewhat humorously, perhaps) of five golden hemorrhoids/tumors and five golden mice. The “priests and diviners” seem not entirely convinced that the disasters that have befallen them are the work of YHWH, and so devise a test: if the cart bearing the Coffer and the payment goes straight into Israelite territory, to Bet-Shemesh, it will confirm the intervention of the divine hand."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 6",2,"That same hand, however, guards the Coffer from being profaned even among the Israelites, and following a peeking incident in v.19, a great plague comes upon them. This theme of what Hamilton calls “the high voltage of the supersancta,” the dangerous parameters of a divine object, will return in II Sam. 6:6–7, where it will lead to a man’s immediate death. Here, the Coffer has to move from Bet-Shemesh to Kiryat-Ye’arim, a border town some miles to the northeast, where it will be guarded by a man “hallowed” for the purpose."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 7:2–17",1,"Chapter 7:2–17. Beating Back the Philistine Threat: The Philistine plague is only the beginning of Israel’s restoration. If that is to happen properly, however, two things need to occur: Israel has to “put away the foreign gods” from their midst, and Shemuel has to intercede with God. The order is significant as, once again, military victory depends on the people’s faithfulness to God, and not solely on effective leadership. It is likewise telling that the site of the victory is the same at which defeat had occurred in 4:1 and 5:1 (Willis). So a narrative that began with “sighing” (v.2) ends with a restoration of territory, peace (v.14), and a description of Shemuel’s judgeship. All would seem to be well."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8",1,"Chapter 8. “Give Us a King!” : It is a consistent pattern in world literature that when a great leader grows old, he either makes a long final public speech or deals with the appointment of a successor. Sometimes it is both. Like his mentor Eli, however, Shemuel is stymied in his desire for continuity in leadership by the fact that his own sons do not “walk in his ways” (vv.3 and 5). In addition to the sons’ corrupt behavior as judges, violating rules stated already in Exod. 23:8, the real need of the moment is for a strong military leader, as it was earlier in the book of Judges. So the Israelites request a king who will fight their wars (v.20) and thus enable them to be a self-respecting entity (vv.5 and 20, “like all the nations”)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8",2,"Shemuel takes their plea as a personal rejection, but God has to remind him in v.7 that it is really a rejection of God himself as Israel’s only king. Up to this point in the narratives of the Bible, the concept of divine kingship had been implied, through wilderness wanderings, conquest, and settlement. Now it appears that this cannot continue, at least not without an earthly stand-in. But to make clear the writer’s opinion that monarchy must be controlled, Shemuel delivers a pointed warning to the people (vv.11–18). It unmistakably implies that kings are takers—that verb punctuates the speech four times—who will disrupt the time-honored practices of village life and spend their own time accumulating personal power and wealth. The ominous warning at the end of the speech, that God will not listen to the Israelites’ predictable outcry when they are oppressed by future kings, goes unheeded, as the people refuse (Heb. root <i>m-’-n</i>) to be swayed from their obsession with security, and in essence reject (<i>m-’-s</i>) God."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 8",3,"In many ways this chapter is a transitional one, and could either be grouped with the stories about Shemuel alone, as some scholars have done, or placed as the introduction to what follows, as here. It may be another example of the Bible’s tendency, at least in its final form, to display overlapping structures."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10",1,"Chapters 9–10. The Choosing of Sha’ul: Israel’s first king stems from the tribe of Binyamin, whose territory straddled the north-south border region of the country but which was understood to be of northern provenance. Barely have we heard of Sha’ul’s qualifications for the job—solid lineage and notable physical stature—when we are introduced to him in person as, of all things, a seeker of lost she-asses. Some, such as Sweeney (2012), would see this as having a “fairy-tale” quality; others, myself included, sense something more negative: a foreshadowing of the later, “lost” Sha’ul. The meandering tale brings the young man unwittingly into the orbit of Shemuel, who, to Sha’ul’s utter surprise, hails him in v.20. Indeed, geographically, Sha’ul’s wanderings form an oval that partly intersects the circle of Shemuel’s activities in the book—another indication of the closeness of the two characters."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10",2,"The text plays out the selection of the new king, lingering on scenes of searching, asking, and, finally, declaring God’s will through the prophet. Whereas in the first part of the narrative Sha’ul wanders seemingly in vain, his journey ultimately bears out Shemuel’s predictions (10:2–7) of signs from God and the leader-elect’s transformation (note that the key verb “find” occurs some thirteen times in eighteen of the chapter’s verses). Despite all of this, however, Sha’ul does not reveal the earthshaking result of his encounter with Shemuel to his family, much like Shimshon (Judg. 14) before him. That remains, for the moment, both God’s secret and a sign of Sha’ul’s modesty. Likewise, when Israel is summoned to Mitzpa, the new king, who is chosen publicly by lots, is initially nowhere to be found, and is discovered only eventually amid the gear. When he is finally acclaimed by the people in v.24, what follows is a note of doubt on their part (v.27). Sha’ul weathers this little storm, in contrast to his later capitulations, but we are left to wonder why the first Israelite monarch arises under such clouded circumstances and with such hesitation. It feels less like the classic prophetic rejection of God’s mission, where a figure such as Moshe at least argues with God, and more like a hint of flawed character. This may be symbolically indicated by Shemuel’s use of a flask of oil to anoint the new king, as opposed to the more usual horn (Miscall)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 9–10",3,"Sha’ul’s strange experience of behaving like a prophet, which is predicted in vv.5–6 and recounted in 10–11, is unique in ancient Israel’s description of its kings. The “mantic” form of prophecy referred to here, comprising extreme forms of behavior, is attested throughout the ages (see the cult of Dionysus in ancient Greece, and “speaking in tongues” still today). The experiences of “later prophets” such as Yesha’yahu (Isaiah) and Yirmeyahu (Jeremiah) tend to focus (although not exclusively) on the divine word, which is usually not obscure but, on the contrary, all too intelligible. In our chapter, one may wonder whether Sha’ul’s gift indicates chosenness, as in the earlier cases of judges who are seized by God’s spirit, or the possession of qualities that indicate a kind of instability that may not be appropriate for the sober needs of governing (Brueggemann 1990)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11",1,"Chapter 11. Sha’ul the Victorious: Immediately after Sha’ul’s acclamation, his leadership is put to the test. A fierce Ammonite commander threatens an Israelite town lying to the north of his territory. While in our text his words seem ominous enough, the chapter as it appears in one of the Dead Sea Scroll manuscripts of Samuel—4QSa, probably an earlier and fuller version than MT—shows that he is a man of his word. The restored passage reads,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11",2,"Now Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the Gadites and the Re’uvenites."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11",3,"He would gouge out the right eye of each of them, and would not grant Israel a deliverer."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11",4,"No one was left of the Israelites across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had not gouged out."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11",5,But there were seven thousand men who had escaped from the Ammonites and had entered Yavesh-Gil’ad.
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11",6,"In MT that has come down to us, apparently a scribe’s eye wandered from the original first “Yavesh-Gil’ad” to the second, skipping several sentences."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11",7,"Upon hearing the news of the Ammonite danger, Sha’ul, in contrast to his weeping countrymen, is seized with the spirit of God and, in a reminder of the horrifying concubine story of Judg. 19–20, cuts up his oxen and sends their pieces around the country. The tribes rise up “as one man,” themselves gripped by a “terror of God” (an emotional state which elsewhere is usually viewed as a negative), and vanquish the brutal enemy."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 11",8,"Sha’ul is gracious in victory, refusing to kill those of his countrymen who had earlier doubted his abilities. In a passage that may come from an alternate source, his leadership is celebrated (“renewed”) at Gilgal as the chapter draws to a close. What began with a threat of mutilation ends with “joy” (v.15) over the strength of the newfound leader."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 12",1,"Chapter 12. Shemuel’s Summation: In Chap. 8 we observed God, through Shemuel, expressing considerable reservations about the institution of kingship. Here, after the victory against the Ammonites, God reaffirms the monarchy, but in the broader context of Israelite history from Egypt to the present. After Shemuel establishes his own credibility by demonstrating that he, unlike future kings, has “taken” nothing from any Israelite, he launches into a long public oration which sounds rather like one of the farewell speeches we have come to expect at the end of biblical books (see the final chapters of both Deuteronomy and Joshua). The message is a simple one, thematically reminiscent of those earlier texts: if the Israelites will serve YHWH alone, forsaking the local gods, then all will be well; but if they “revolt,” both they and their king will be lost. The speech, despite its length, is able to remain on focus by sprinkling a specific vocabulary throughout. Four words occur in varying repetitions: “sin,” “evil,” and “request,” which denote Israel’s need for a king out of weakness, and “serve,” which comes to indicate their desired loyalty to YHWH. As in Chap. 8, the speech ends with a warning."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 13",1,"Chapter 13. Sha’ul Rejected I: The narrative has given us almost no time to savor Sha’ul’s victory in Chap. 11. It immediately provides an example of exactly what Shemuel had just warned against. In the midst of a back-and-forth struggle, with the Israelites attacking the Philistines in vv.2–4 and the Philistines retaliating from v.5 on, Sha’ul seeks to rally the troops again, with help anticipated from Shemuel. When the prophet is late in arriving, the king jumps the gun and offers the requisite sacrifices himself. He apparently is worried that he cannot win the battle without placating God, and he is additionally concerned about the bleeding away of the soldiers. When Shemuel finally shows up, his response to Sha’ul’s behavior is to in essence fire the king and indicate that another will take his place. Curiously, we get no reaction from Sha’ul, who goes back to mustering the troops, and the text sees fit to concentrate on details regarding the Philistines’ technological superiority."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 13",2,for we have added evil to all our sins
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 13",3,by requesting ourselves a king!
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14",1,"Chapter 14. Yonatan the Hero; Sha’ul Errs Again: In strange contrast to the rejection of Sha’ul and his dynasty that has just occurred, Yonatan (full name: Yehonatan), the heir to the throne, proves his mettle by single-handedly killing twenty Philistines. This leads to what looks to be a general rout of the Philistines by his father. In the heat of battle, Sha’ul prohibits any eating until sunset, an oath which, however, is not heard by Yonatan, who unwittingly violates it. To this is added the Israelites’ own breaking of rules, as they eat the animals they have slain along with the blood (a universal, not only Israelite, prohibition according to Gen. 9:4). All is forgiven with the subsequent sacrifice, but Yonatan has to be rescued from his father’s wrath by the Israelites. Once again, Sha’ul has somehow misfired as king, this time within his own family."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 14",2,"The chapter ends with two summaries of Sha’ul’s reign. Vv.47–48 describe him as the great warrior who rescued Israel from six different enemies. Vv.49–52 contain a typical summary list, in this case of Sha’ul’s immediate family members and the name of his commanding general (Avner), along with a note of the ongoing struggle against the Philistines."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15",1,"Chapter 15. Sha’ul Rejected II: Chap. 13 and the present one appear to be separate accounts of Sha’ul’s rejection. This is buttressed by the opening of Chap. 15, which seems oblivious to the previous events. God commands the king to utterly wipe out the Amalekites, in revenge for their treacherous actions against the Israelite ancestors at the time of the Exodus (see Exod. 17:8–16). Sha’ul is scrupulous here in one regard, making sure that the Israel-friendly Kenites who live among the enemy are not caught up in the destruction, but in the end he chooses to preserve both the best of the spoils and Agag, the Amalekite king, thus violating God’s instructions."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15",2,"When confronted by Shemuel, Sha’ul claims to have done God’s will, and to have saved the best animals for sacrifice to him. Further rebuke from the prophet reveals the truth: Sha’ul was afraid of his own soldiers, fearing that they, following usual practice, would not fight without promise of a reward in the form of spoils. Such a disregard of God’s honor in favor of human considerations means that Sha’ul must now forfeit his role as the founder of a dynasty, expressed through the fourfold use of “reject” in vv.23 and 26."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 15",3,"Despite the condemnation directed at Sha’ul, the text strikingly portrays Shemuel as feeling for the king; when God first expresses regret over having made Sha’ul king, Shemuel “cried out … all night” (v.11), while at the end of the chapter (vv.30–31) he accedes to Sha’ul’s request to at least accompany him as he worships in the people’s presence. Shemuel, of course, does not extend this kind of humanity to Agag and, as far as we can tell, executes him with his own hands. But the close association between king and prophet, which had begun in the long-ago days of running after lost donkeys, would seem to have come to an end."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16",1,"Chapter 16. David Chosen and at Court: With Sha’ul now rejected and destined to be the last of his own dynasty to rule, the text turns to the anointing of his successor, the Judean David. Compared to the convoluted accounts of Sha’ul’s accession to the throne in Chaps. 9–10, the story in which David makes his first appearance is almost an idyll. It also fits a classic folklore pattern which we first encountered in multiple manifestations in Genesis: the choosing or triumph of the younger brother. Here, as in many fairy tales, the youngest appears last, and, like Sha’ul, he is initially hidden."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16",2,"The text makes the event a journey of discovery for Shemuel. God does not reveal the new king’s name to the prophet in advance, nor is it mentioned until the very end of the chapter, after the anointing. Shemuel, like us, will have to learn the criteria for divine choice. Perhaps he is blinded by Sha’ul’s failures, which he himself has taken to heart (note God’s question in v.1: “Until when will you keep on mourning for Sha’ul?”). In any event, God’s speech in v.7 centers around the idea of “seeing,” a verb and an activity that are typically associated with prophecy in the Bible (as in 9:9, above). It is used ten times in eighteen verses of the text. So the little tale incorporates both physical and figurative aspects of seeing: appearance, foresight, and insight."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16",3,"The fact that David is a shepherd resonates strongly in ancient culture. Moshe, of course, had followed the same vocation as an adult. The poetry of the Bible frequently contains shepherd imagery, most famously in Ps. 23 and the Song of Songs, and the figure of the Shepherd King, so beloved in the ancient Near East, easily survived to become a central motif in early Christianity."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16",4,"David starts on his biblical path with formidable tools. He is physically attractive and possessed of the “spirit of Y<small>HWH</small>,” like some of the leaders before him in the book of Judges. In addition, the end of our chapter reveals him as a string musician, a skill sometimes also associated with prophecy in the Bible (see II Kings 3:15). At the same time that this talent of David is described, we also learn of his reputation as a warrior. Clearly this is no ordinary shepherd boy."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 16",5,"The section already begins what will develop into an epic struggle, not only between the two men, but between two dynastic houses. Its echo was to endure long after their own deaths."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17",1,"Chapter 17. David and Golyat: Perhaps the most famous story about David, this narrative appears to have its own independent history, which, however, is difficult to untangle. Unlike most other instances, here MT is much longer than LXX. Sections exclusive to the Hebrew version are vv.12–31 (the introduction of David and his reaction to Golyat’s taunting), 41 and 48b (minor variations), 50, and 55–58 (Sha’ul inexplicably asking about David’s identity as if he had never met him previously, Chap. 16 notwithstanding). Most scholars have concluded from this that there are two traditions at work in some form, or that an “original” has given birth to one or two later versions through expansion or contraction. Given that the LXX version reads coherently on its own, many infer that MT here is in fact an expansion. Following the model of the Sinai account in Exod. 19 (see Greenberg), our present text might be viewed as a composite, a gathering of different traditions in a manner that makes for richness and completeness, despite our Western need for total coherence (Alter 1998). In a wider sense, it reflects the Bible’s general aspect of textual inclusiveness—what I would call multivocality, in which competing and even contradictory accounts are allowed to coexist for the sake of fullness."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17",2,"In addition to the textual issues, a battle account near the end of the book, in II Sam. 21:19, mentions how “Elhanan son of Yaarei-Oregim the Bet-Lehemite struck down Golyat the Gittite / —now the shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam,” and the same hero is identified as having killed Golyat’s brother in I Chron. 20:5. This suggests that we are dealing with an independent story which has been placed on David’s shoulders, for obvious reasons."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17",3,"Regardless of its various permutations, the long, leisurely David/Golyat narrative reads much like a fairy tale, and is in many respects quite accessible to many cultures. It has never lost its popularity, and the phrase “David and Goliath,” used to describe everything from business competition to sporting events, is still very much in common use. The setup is classic: a huge warrior with a reputation as a champion—“the Man of the Space-Between [the armies]” (v.4)—strides forth, mocking his enemies and challenging them to a one-on-one duel. The detailed description of Golyat’s armor is a departure from the usually sparse biblical landscape, but it is certainly psychologically appropriate here, as are the other rare biblical descriptions of a person’s attire (Hamilton)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17",4,"Of course, neither Sha’ul nor any of his soldiers dares fight the Philistine. It is left to a teenager untried in standard weaponry to face him. The text is clear about David’s inexperience in formal battle, but it needs to be pointed out that, although he is not a professional warrior, he is also no slouch. His description of fighting off lions and bears in his shepherd days (vv.34–36) is not a vain or irrelevant boast; in addition, v.51 describes him deftly unsheathing Golyat’s sword and finishing off the Philistine with it. Further, David’s wielding of a sling to defeat Golyat should not be trivialized. In ancient warfare, a division of slingers could be quite lethal (see the Greek account in Xenophon’s <i>Anabasis,</i> or, previously in the Bible, Judg. 20:16)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17",5,"In addition to the detailed military descriptions, which sound more like Homer than the Bible, the story focuses on memorable confrontations between pairs of characters: Golyat and the Israelites (vv.8–11); David and his brother Eli’av (28–29); David and Sha’ul (32–39); and, finally, David and Golyat (42–47). The last and most significant one will vault David’s prowess and fame beyond that of regular warriors, his family, and Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17",6,"The most surprising aspect of this tale is that it is not only, as popularly understood, a case of the weak against the strong, the small against the large. Its vocabulary in fact leads in a different direction. Only here, of all the biblical texts concerning war, does the word “ranks” occur repeatedly (twelve times); the other recurring word is the verb “mock.” This leads naturally to the conclusion that what is really at stake is the fact that “this foreskinned Philistine” has “mock[ed] the ranks of the Living God” (v.26). In other words, the story, splendidly illustrating the rise of David, centers around the perceived insult to Y<small>HWH</small> and his earthly armies, which must be properly avenged. Golyat’s literal downfall accomplishes this; his posture of falling “on his face to the ground” (v.49) is more reminiscent of proper respect and worship than the simple act of keeling over."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 17",7,"There is one other biblical text that takes up the issue of “mocking” God using this language: II Kings 18, where the Assyrian king’s representatives taunt King Hezekiah and Y<small>HWH</small> in full hearing of the Judean troops. It is thus quite plausible that an old story has here been retold in terms and vocabulary that address the needs of a later audience."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18",1,"Chapter 18. The Rise of David in Sha’ul’s House I: As if the Golyat story were not dramatic enough, the artistry of the text continues unabated in the chapters that follow. The present one highlights “love,” its chief theme word: the love borne David by Yehonatan, Sha’ul’s heir; by the Israelites, who are dazzled by David’s military exploits; and by Sha’ul’s daughter Mikhal, who not surprisingly falls for the young hero. Contrasted to this and to David’s “prospering” (vv.5, 14, 15, 30) is the jealous rage into which Sha’ul’s emotions propel him. Whether the “evil spirit from YHWH” (v.10, and see 16:14) is related to Sha’ul’s depression over having been rejected by God, or is due to a previously existing psychological state, the rise of his young rival only magnifies it. Whereas in Chap. 16 David’s lyre playing had been able to soothe the ailing king, it now spawns elaborate scheming and an outbreak of personal violence."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18",2,"The precise nature of the love between David and Yehonatan has been a prime subject of speculation in recent interpretations of this text. In today’s terms, the language appears strongly suggestive of a sexual relationship, although the text does not elaborate on this. Alternatively, if one reads the story in a nonsexual way, it may be reflecting a warrior society, in which male bonding has always been central. A further possibility is that the relationship is playing an ironic role in the text: the person about whom each cares the most is the one with whom he has the greatest potential political conflict."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18",3,"The David-Yehonatan relationship has been explicated by Ackerman in a book-length study (2005). She notes that the text, while not explicit, does utilize vocabulary that elsewhere in the Bible is clearly sexual, and that in general Yehonatan occupies a role that is emotionally and politically subordinate to David (see I Sam. 18:4, 28:13–15, and 23:17). If one accepts these arguments, the text may be putting forward a striking, if symbolic, example of how David will triumph over the House of Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 18",4,"In any event, as with all biblical texts, readers will find multiple ways to read the same passage."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19",1,"Chapter 19. The Rise of David in Sha’ul’s House II: Having been entranced by David in the previous chapter, Sha’ul’s children now actively take his side against their father. At first, Yehonatan’s intercession works, and his friend is restored to his position at the king’s side. But the “evil spirit” in Sha’ul cannot be denied, especially after another report of David’s successes in battle (v.8), and he once again hurls his spear at the young musician. David’s subsequent flight is the beginning of a long period of running which will end only with Sha’ul’s death. He is aided in his escape by his wife, Mikhal, who, in a scene of deception that vaguely recalls Rahel’s tricking of her father in Gen. 31:34–35, makes use of what are apparently household idols to fool the king’s messengers."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 19",2,"But such help is not sufficient. David needs divine protection from Sha’ul, and the king’s messengers are disoriented by “ranting-in-prophecy,” followed by Sha’ul himself. While in Chap. 10 above, such behavior might have suggested the king’s special gifts and hence leadership capabilities, here, in what is perhaps originally an alternate tradition, it reduces him to a helpless babbler, and David goes unharmed. Curiously, Shemuel never feels Sha’ul’s wrath for accompanying David here."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20",1,"Chapter 20. Final Break; The Covenant of the Friends: In a last-ditch attempt to save his friend’s life, Yehonatan offers to intercede with Sha’ul. David proposes a simple test: if Sha’ul can accept David’s absence on a family matter, it will be a sign that he is once again in the king’s good graces, but if Sha’ul is unconvinced and agitated by the explanation given to him, the two friends will have to concede that there is no chance to mend the rift. The story makes use of an additional character through whom David and Yehonatan can communicate, an unsuspecting young servant who is sent to fetch arrows that Yehonatan shoots. Depending on the instructions given him, he is to (unwittingly) signal to David that all is either well or ill. Appropriately, the narrative echoes with repetitions of “good” and “evil,” referring to David’s fate."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20",2,"The scene in which the prince sets out to determine his father’s attitude toward David (vv.27–33) is nicely constructed around the word “son.” David is referred to derisively (by omitting his given name), as the “son of Yishai”; Sha’ul insults Yehonatan by calling him the “son of a twisted rebellion”; and then Sha’ul pronounces the death sentence on his young rival by literally terming him a “son of death.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 20",3,"The most significant repeating word in the story, however, is “know,” occurring nine times, which highlights a central concern in the text: David wishes to convince Yehonatan that there is no hope for any kind of reconciliation. That is, through the scenes of confrontation with Sha’ul, Yehonatan finally becomes convinced of what the audience “knew” all along. The story ends with a heartfelt covenant between the two young men, which is all the more ironic given that later events in the book will witness tension and death as the chief currencies between the House of David and the House of Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21",1,"Chapter 21. David at Nov and Gat: David the fugitive has two pressing needs, food and weapons, as he flees from Sha’ul. Arriving at Nov, his solitary presence arouses suspicions, but he is able to allay these through his cunning (note the recurrence of the related word “know” in v.3). We, of course, know that the “matter of the king” is no secret message, but rather refers to the fact that David is on the lam from Sha’ul. In any event, he is able to obtain bread and a sword—not just any weapon, but precisely the great sword of Golyat, which symbolically suggests David’s ability to prevail in the most difficult of circumstances."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 21",2,"Thus armed, David meets his third challenge of the chapter. He flees to the heart of enemy country, one of the Philistine towns, and is apparently recognized, exposing himself to immediate danger. In a final example of quick thinking, and perhaps an ironic reference to Sha’ul’s erstwhile ranting, he pretends to be crazy, dispelling the fears of the Philistines as to his identity."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 22",1,"Chapter 22. David in Flight; Sha’ul’s Revenge: From Gat, David moves southeast into the Judean hill-country. Here he becomes a kind of Robin Hood figure, attracting the disenfranchised (who are described as a class in other ancient Near Eastern texts) and serving as their chief. Sha’ul, meanwhile, vents his frustration on the priests of Nov, who are aghast to learn that the David to whom they gave food and weaponry in the previous chapter, and who had hitherto been a trusted key member of the royal household, is now accounted the king’s “ambusher” (v.13). Sha’ul’s command to kill the priests is resisted by his servants, but as so often in literature and in life, a volunteer comes forward, in this case Do’eg the Edomite. And, true to type, there is a survivor, Evyatar, who finds secure refuge with David. Together with his son, he will later become one of David’s priests (II Sam. 8:17, 20:25)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1",1,"Chapters 23:1–24:1. Cat and Mouse: In the wilds of Judah, David zigs and zags, consulting God as to his moves (vv.2, 4, and 10–12) and staging a successful raid against the Philistines. His future is affirmed in another meeting with Yehonatan, with the latter’s phrase “Even … my father knows this” (v. 17) recalling Chap. 20. Sha’ul continues his dogged pursuit, and at one point the two men are actually on either side of the same hill (v.26). They will in fact have contact, both intimate and distant, in the next chapter."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 23:1–24:1",2,"As JPS points out, David’s exact movements in this chapter and the next are not always clear, and are partially duplicated in Chap. 26."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1",1,"Chapters 24:2–25:1. David Holds Back from Killing Sha’ul I: In the midst of the stories of flight and pursuit, David has the opportunity to rid himself of his enemy once and for all. By good fortune, the king is literally exposed, vulnerable in a private moment. David’s response, though short of assassination, is the still significant act of cutting off the corner of Sha’ul’s cloak, equivalent in the ancient Near East to the filching of a person’s wallet or passport. After the fact, David is portrayed in the text as remorseful, feeling that he has tarnished the office of the monarchy."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1",2,"For the first time since Chap. 18, the two men meet and exchange words. But what a conversation it is! From a distance, David admits his originally murderous intent, but then focuses on his compassion and his innocence (vv.11–12). He does this in a speech which seven times (vv.11–16) features “hand,” a word that usually denotes power and personal responsibility in the Bible. Sha’ul is forced to acknowledge his own culpability, and can only confirm David’s future ascension to the throne. His one request of his successor is full of pathos and reflects good Israelite ideology: he asks that in the inevitable struggle for power, his children and grandchildren may be spared, so that his name will survive. The verb utilized, “[not] to cut off,” nicely dovetails with its earlier use in the chapter, describing David’s actions (Hamilton)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, Chapters 24:2–25:1",3,"A final section (25:1) seals Sha’ul’s fate. Shemuel, who had anointed him in the first place, finally dies. Now the king, who had already felt deserted by both his courtiers and his children, is truly alone, although he will turn to his old friend again in Chap. 28, despite the fact that at that point they occupy the separate worlds of the living and the dead."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",1,"Chapter 25:2–44. David Held Back from Killing Naval: The reader, like David, could use a break from Sha’ul’s relentless manhunt, but instead of some sort of humorous diversion such as we might expect in Shakespeare, we are presented with a story relating to David’s wilderness years that makes some important points about his personality, romantic aspects aside. With its fairy-tale beginning (again, “[there was] a man …”), it features a hero with a problem, a bad-tempered villain, and a beautiful and wise problem-solver who, of course, marries the hero at the end of the story."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",2,"As he had done in Chap. 20, David requests food on his arrival in a new place, going to great lengths to demonstrate his worthiness by pointing out the exemplary behavior of his whole band. The churlish Naval’s answer (vv.10–11) is not only negative but deeply offensive, with the tone equivalent to “Who do these runaway slaves think they are?!” For David the warrior and man of action there can be only one possible response: to strap on his sword and have his followers do the same. By v.22 he is vowing to wipe out Naval and his household like dogs, using a particularly colorful biblical expression."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",3,"Violence is averted only by the wisdom and timely intervention of the fair Avigayil. In a long and masterful speech (vv.24–31), she stresses how David must not act alone in this matter, “shed[ding] blood for nothing” (v.31), for that would taint his future status as the founder of a dynasty. Instead, she suggests, God will take care of the matter. Her plea and David’s response bespeak prevention and restraint, and suffice to preserve his integrity and public innocence. The text draws a nice contrast between the threefold “peace” and the threefold “sword” (Hamilton). It also has Avigayil use “my lord” no less than fourteen times, a repetition that may seem overly groveling to modern ears but which serves to accomplish her purpose."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",4,"Naval’s fate is sealed, and is played out in a striking way. It requires only the words of his wife, reporting her conversation with David, to induce something like a stroke in the drunken husband; he is thus killed not by the hotheaded David but by the proper judgment of God."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",5,"Only at the very end of the tale (vv.43–44) are we informed that part of its raison d’être, David’s need for women, is that Sha’ul had taken away David’s wife (and the king’s daughter) Mikhal and given her to another."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",6,"The placement of this story precisely at this point in the larger narrative warrants some thought, bracketed as it is by the two accounts of David’s opportunity to kill Sha’ul. From one point of view, the text goes out of its way to declare David’s innocence in both of those chapters:"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",7,[Heaven] forbid for me from Y<small>HWH</small>
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",8,"if I should do this thing to my lord, to Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",9,"to stretch out my hand against him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",10,for he is Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed! (24:7)
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",11,….
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",12,"[Heaven] forbid for me, by Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",13,from stretching out my hand against Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one! (26:11)
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",14,"But Chap. 25 strongly suggests that David is not as pure-hearted and in control of himself as one might think, as he comes within a hair of taking a brutal revenge upon Naval. The bracketing chapters, in other words, may be protesting too much. These kinds of doubts will accompany many of the narratives about David and Sha’ul, extending to the untimely ends of Sha’ul’s descendants and generals subsequent to the death of the king himself."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",15,"Sha’ul looked behind him,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 25:2–44",16,"and David prostrated himself, nostrils to the earth, and bowed low,"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26",1,"Chapter 26. David Holds Back from Killing Sha’ul II: An alternative tradition to the one in Chap. 24 is more expansive. It is marked by multiple conversations (between David and Avishai, David and Avner, and Sha’ul and David) and more psychological detail. David’s actions here are also more risk-filled than they were in Chap. 24, with Sha’ul’s generals and soldiers immediately present, yet he is also clearly protected by YHWH (see v.12). The motif word “hand” returns (vv.8, 9, 11, 18, 23) to link the two accounts. Of greatest interest is the verbal connection with the Naval story of the previous chapter: David has learned his lesson—YHWH will “smite” Sha’ul, either naturally or in battle (v.10), just as he “smote” Naval in 25:38, and David will not have to bear either the guilt or the political consequences."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 26",2,"The abiding question is whether David acts here out of true piety and regard for the “divine right of kings” or whether he is simply politically astute. The text leaves it for the reader to decide (for a strong vote for the former, see Borgman; most recent commentators are highly skeptical of David’s motives)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 27",1,"Chapter 27. David as Mercenary: In what feels like an unlikely turn, David, at last freed from pursuit by Sha’ul (v.4), distances himself from his Israelite compatriots by becoming a vassal of the enemy (Philistine) king, Akhish of Gat. In his desire to secure the king’s trust, he exercises ruthlessness toward captured populations, cleverly intimating that these include his fellow Judeans. The scenario is reminiscent of typical undercover stories."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28",1,"Chapter 28. Sha’ul and Shemuel at En Dor: Of all the dramatic moments in Sha’ul’s life—and there are many—nothing quite matches the eerie mood of this brief story, which takes place at night and involves the spirit of a dead man. It feels as if it might have been the inspiration for moments in Hamlet or Macbeth. In its devastating finality, it comprises the emotional end of the Sha’ul narratives. The account of the king’s actual death, which is reported in Chap. 31, only reports the inevitable."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28",2,"The story expands on the theme of God’s abandonment of Sha’ul, opening with a reminder that Shemuel is gone (see 25:1) and the observation that all of the conventional means by which a king might divine God’s will have proved futile (v.6). Sha’ul, who for once had followed God’s law in v.2, now must break it in secret, out of desperation. In order to do so, he must circumvent the Philistine lines, disguised in “other garments” (ironically echoing his transformation into “another man” with “another heart” when he was anointed as king in 10:6 and 9), thus concealing his identity from the medium."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28",3,"The consulting of spirits to learn the future was a well-known practice in the premodern world, but its appearance here is unique in the Hebrew Bible. While raising the dead and other aspects of sorcery were banned in the Bible, they were not viewed as ineffective; nevertheless, the text passes over any description of exactly how the woman works her magic and goes right to the unorthodox meeting between the two old friends. As usual, it is the face-to-face confrontation that interests the Bible rather than the background details, and so we must do without the dramatic lighting, special effects, and sinister music that would mark the presentation of such a scene in today’s media."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28",4,"A number of enigmatic points emerge in this narrative. First, how does Sha’ul know from the woman’s laconic description of the ghost that it is indeed that of the old prophet? “An old man … wrapped in a cloak” would seem to reveal little in the way of identity. But we may recall that it was Shemuel’s cloak that was the physical focal point of Sha’ul’s rejection as king (15:27), as the ghost implies with its reuse of “torn” in v.17. Second, there is Shemuel’s tantalizing suggestion about the nature of the Underworld in v.15, “Why have you disturbed me?” This tells us only that, in the biblical view, our state after death is akin to rest or sleep, and does not involve the elaborate construction of Heaven and Hell with which we are so familiar in the Western world. Finally, Shemuel’s reply to the “distressed” king does not address the question asked of him until he has rehashed God’s rejection of Sha’ul. His answer, in v.19, contains one of the most chilling lines in the Bible. The text could simply have said, “Tomorrow, you and your sons will die,” but instead intones the memorable “tomorrow, you and your sons are with me.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28",5,"What could have been the story’s ending is striking enough: Sha’ul does not merely collapse, an understandable reaction to the bad news he has just received; he falls “his full stature to the ground” (v.20), providing a purposeful contrast to one of the reasons Sha’ul had been chosen king in the first place. We recall that initially he had been described as “taller than all the people” (9:2), and had been rejected with the words “Do not look at … the tallness of his stature” (16:7). Sha’ul has farther to fall than most."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 28",6,"It is at this point in the story, in a narrative that has already provided some surprises, that the unexpected happens again. If the Bible’s purpose had been solely to portray Sha’ul as a villain, he might simply have slunk back to the Israelite camp and wept, or experienced a night of uneasy dreams in the manner of Shakespeare’s Richard III. Instead, both king and reader are given a compassionate moment of respite. Literature abounds in less than reputable characters who demonstrate their humanity (see, for instance, Rahav, the classic “good-hearted prostitute” of Josh. 2). In this case, it is the medium who acts as a kind of stand-in for God, offering the stricken king nourishment and thus confirming his humanity. Moving from ground to bed (v.23), Sha’ul for the moment staves off his death and, instead of receiving the promised “bit of bread” (v.22), is given a more substantial meal, as befits a king. Thus the Sha’ul who exits his shattering meeting with the dead Shemuel is fortified for his heroic ordeal of the next day, when he will die leading the troops one last time against Israel’s enemies. From the beginning of the story, where the king had denied both his identity and his values as upholder of divine law, he emerges at the end, thanks to the medium’s act, as ruler and commander in chief, prepared to die if necessary at the head of “Y<small>HWH</small>’s armies” (see Simon 1997)."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 29",1,"Chapter 29. Philistine Suspicions About David: As the Philistines prepare for battle against the Israelites, David accompanies them, but his loyalty is immediately questioned, despite all his efforts to prove himself in Chap. 27. The Philistine overlords are rightly concerned about the possibility that David, their former tormentor, will return to his roots and go over to the Israelite side. King Akhish is forced to reluctantly order David to head back to Philistia, forbidding him to participate in the coming battle against Sha’ul. Once again, as so often, David will be absent when his enemies are done away with."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30",1,"Chapter 30. David as Rescuer: In the course of his journey away from direct confrontation in battle with Sha’ul, David discovers that the Philistine-occupied town of Tziklag has been devastated, and all its women, including his own wives Ahinoam and Avigayil, have been taken captive. A chance encounter with an Egyptian man reveals that the raiders were Amalekites, and David is subsequently able to crush them as they revel among the spoils."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30",2,"The story appears to have several functions. It puts David in a similar light to the patriarch Avraham, who had rescued his nephew and family from wartime captivity (see Gen. 14); it provides a contrast to Sha’ul, who had previously failed in his battle dealings with the Amalekites (Chap. 15); it links David to a current (in the writer’s time) practice of parceling out spoils even to parts of the army that have not participated in the battle proper; and, in the final verses, it gives David a means through which to eventually win back the good graces of his fellow Judeans."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 30",3,"As Fokkelman (1993) has carefully worked out, timewise the action of this chapter is simultaneous to Sha’ul’s defeat in the next one. Thus, David’s victory fittingly coincides with Sha’ul’s end."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31",1,"Chapter 31. The Death of Sha’ul: The final episode in Sha’ul’s tragedy, stunningly portrayed in Pieter Brueghel’s famous large painting, is reported in a chapter of great compactness. The battle scene itself is typically brief; what interests the writer is only the outcome—the death of the king and his sons."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31",2,"Sha’ul dies heroically. His decision to commit suicide stems not from depression or despair but from the desire to die with dignity and escape the humiliation which he fears would be his lot if the Philistines were to find him alive. As it is, his corpse is mutilated, with armor and torso taken as trophies for Philistine sites. In the end, however, the body and those of his sons are rescued by the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad, the very ones whom Sha’ul had saved from the Ammonites at the beginning of his career, and given proper burial."
"The Early Prophets, I Samuel, 31",3,"At the same time as Sha’ul dies heroically, there is a sobering note. His suicide in battle recalls the death of a previous king, actually a usurper, Avimelekh, in Judg. 9. As with other foreshadowings of the reign of Sha’ul (see Judg. 19), the parallel does not do him honor."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1",1,"Chapter 1. David’s Reaction to Sha’ul’s Death: The news from the battle reaches David, though we wait to see how he will react. An Amalekite messenger, bringing some of Sha’ul’s royal ornaments with him, reports a version of Sha’ul’s death which some interpreters take at face value but which may well be a fabrication. In the latter case, his motive is likely greed or some other form of self-interest; as an Amalekite, he belongs to the group that David had defeated in the town of Tziklag where the present conversation takes place, and he may be seeking mercy. In any event, the ruse does not work, and the messenger is put to death. David’s condemnation and execution of the man may serve to further support David’s claim that he had no evil designs against Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1",2,"What follows (vv.17–27) is one of the most famous poems in the Bible, whose key line, “How have (or: how are [KJV]) the mighty fallen,” occurring three times in the poem, is still quoted when public figures fall from grace. It is the first example of David as poet in the Bible. At the end of his life, he will recite two longer ones (II Sam. 22 and 23), and many of the Psalms will be attributed to him, either by the Bible itself (if indeed that is what “a Psalm of David” means) or by later tradition. This poem is also at the center of Samuel, usually an indication of an important moment in a chapter or a book."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 1",3,"Notably, Yehonatan’s name appears here as much as does Sha’ul’s. Much has been made of the words “… my brother Yehonatan, / you were very delightful to me; / more wonderful was your love to me / than the love of women” (v.26). Once again, is this deep friendship or something more? In any case, the bond with Yehonatan seems to be the most deeply felt of all of David’s human relationships, a phenomenon which, as we noted earlier, is not unusual in a warrior culture."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 2",1,"Chapter 2. Unresolved Political Tensions: The Death of Sha’ul and several of his sons in battle does not assure David of an easy transition to the throne. While his fellow Judahites anoint him as king, the bulk of the country, to both the north and the northeast, throws in its lot with Sha’ul’s son Ish-Boshet, who is backed by the powerful military commander Avner. A fierce battle ensues between soldiers loyal"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3",1,"Chapter 3. Civil War; the Death of Avner: The report on the ongoing civil war is interrupted by the birth notice of David’s sons, six by six different wives. Indeed, sexual politics begins the chapter, with Avner sleeping with Sha’ul’s concubine Ritzpa, to the chagrin of Sha’ul’s son Ish-Boshet. This classic demonstration of political power enables Avner to negotiate with David, which obviously needs to be done, but the king will agree to a treaty only if his own former wife Mikhal, Sha’ul’s daughter, is returned to him. So, sandwiched in between the violence of the last chapter and the violence that is to come, the first half of this chapter is punctuated by strong words and strong emotions, from Ish-Boshet’s complaints, Avner’s retort and negotiating statements, to the weeping of Paltiel, Mikhal’s second husband, who helplessly walks behind her as she is returned to David. The result of the negotiations is a carefully wrought agreement that the northern region, Israel, will acknowledge David as king, and that Ish-Boshet’s life will not be threatened."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3",2,"The “peace” described in v.21 cannot last, however, because Yoav, as we will continuously encounter him in these stories, is a “rough” man (v.39) who does not forgive and who constantly looks out for and unhesitatingly acts on David’s interests. He cannot permit the man who killed his brother to live, even though we saw in the previous chapter that Avner tried his best to avoid killing Asa’el. And it does not seem coincidental that Avner’s death would obviously have the effect of quashing David’s northern opposition."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 3",3,"At this point, from v.28 on, the text goes to great lengths to clear David of Avner’s brutal murder. Not only does he put a curse on the house of Yoav, but he gets the entire people to mourn over Avner, composing a brief dirge for the occasion (vv.33–34)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 4",1,"Chapter 4. The Death of Ish-Boshet: In the course of the ongoing civil war, another assassination is committed. This time the victim is Sha’ul’s son Ish-Boshet (or, in uncensored form, Ish-Baal). The chapter begins with several brief notes: Sha’ul’s son is terrified to hear about Avner’s recent death; we are introduced to two of his chieftains; and we are informed that a grandson scion of Sha’ul is alive, albeit a lame young man. The story proper starts in v.5, where Ish-Boshet is killed, Mafia-style, in his bed. Initially, no motive is given, especially as the assassins are from Ish-Boshet’s own circle, but it soon becomes clear that the two men are seeking compensation from David. He, however, reacts the same way he had to the Amalekite messenger in Chap. 1, even referring back to that incident himself, and the culprits are executed. In addition, they are mutilated, with their bodies put on public display. Much as in the classic period of sixteenth-century England, “treason” gets its very public reward. And once again, David is portrayed as indignant at the commission of violent deeds from which, however, he ultimately profits."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5",1,"Chapter 5. Major Victories for David: A number of episodes are strung together here, all demonstrating David’s ascendancy as king and as military leader. First (vv.1–5) he receives the throne of all Israel, at the request of the northern tribes. Following on the heels of Ish-Boshet’s assassination, this seems both surprising and logical."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5",2,"In vv.6–9, David conquers Jerusalem, which had thus far resisted takeover by the Israelites (despite Judg. 1:8). The text is incredibly brief, despite the great importance of the deed. We are not initially told why David decides to attack the Jebusite enclave, but the subsequent chapters make clear that he desires to make it the new capital of a united Israel, a politically ingenious move, since the city was quite defensible and situated close to the border between the northern and southern sections of the country."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5",3,"The text continues at v.10, with several passages befitting a king: vv.10–11 trace the beginnings of an important alliance, with King Hiram of Tyre in Phoenicia, resulting in the building of a palace for David—a step beyond Sha’ul’s chieftain-style rule. This seems to produce proof of divine favor (v.12), a theme which will be at the forefront of Chap. 7. Then (vv.13–16) we are given a list of children born to David in Jerusalem. In summary, we now have a king over all Israel, with a major alliance, a palace, and numerous heirs—a good recipe for political stability."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 5",4,"The chapter concludes with a larger story (vv.17–25) in which it is clear that having become king has not softened David the warrior. He is able to decisively defeat the Philistines, with the assistance of God. The victory cements his military accomplishments, as it was the long-lasting superiority of the Philistines that had led to the people’s request for a king in I Sam. 8 in the first place."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6",1,"Chapter 6. Jerusalem Taken; the Coffer’s Journey: The account of how Jerusalem is consecrated, and its preeminent political status assured, by the bringing of the Coffer (others, “Ark”) to reside there, has some unexpected twists. From David’s point of view, this momentous religious and political act should be filled with joy, and the text (vv.5 and 13–14) indeed stresses the unfettered jubilation of the occasion through music and David’s leaping and dancing. But the positive emotions of the moment are marred by two incidents, one public and one private. As the Coffer initially travels by wagon, it begins to slip, and the Israelite who tries to steady it is struck dead by God. This “carelessness” of physical contact, which might baffle modern readers since its intention is pure, nevertheless violates the sanctity of the object, and we are reminded that the Coffer represents God and is thus separated from normal human contact. It is a boundary that, in ancient cultures, must not be breached. At the same time, Uzza’s death leads David to despair of ever attaining his royal goals."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 6",2,"The second incident in the chapter is colorful and very telling. Mikhal, the nouveau princess, is unable to stomach the mundane and, to her, undignified sight of her husband jumping and dancing for joy at the Coffer’s entry to the city. She seems not to understand his strong emotions—or, possibly, his near nakedness reminds her of her father’s prophetic moments, which had caused people to whisper (see I Sam. 19:24). At any rate, David counters her accusation that he is acting lewdly with a sexual threat of his own (v.22, “with the serving-maids of whom you spoke … I’ll get honor!”). After several chapters that have contained two long lists of David’s progeny, this one ends with the sober notice that Mikhal remained childless to the end of her days. So for multiple reasons, there will ultimately be no merging of the houses of Sha’ul and David. Biologically as well as militarily and politically, David’s victory is now complete. We can now proceed to God’s long and firm promises to the new king."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7",1,"Chapter 7. The Davidic Covenant: Now that David’s throne is secure (God has “given-him-rest,” v.1), he logically seeks to build the one thing that his kingdom lacks: a temple. In the ancient Near East, such a desire would have been prompted not merely by piety; temples were political statements as well, symbolizing a god’s approval and protection of the regime. The king’s plea prompts a new character, Natan the court prophet, to encourage him, only to be overruled by YHWH: his son Shelomo (Solomon), not David, will get to build it. In the process, the text switches to a Deuteronomistic style, and we encounter what many would characterize as a masterpiece of royal propaganda. It is distinguished by, among other traits, wordiness, both in YHWH’s promises and in David’s grateful response."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 7",2,"The basic message of the chapter is that Y<small>HWH</small> will be with David, and that he will establish both “my people” and the Davidic throne in perpetuity. The speeches are punctuated by several key words, first of all “name,” here referring most often to God, whose fame will be augmented by what he does with Israel and by the future temple. “House,” in the multiple senses of Temple and dynasty, appears fifteen times, and the encouraging “for the ages” eight times. Not surprisingly, the verb meaning “to make firm” appears five times, to stress God’s commitment. And David’s response to divine generosity contains the formal marker of submission: ten times in vv.19–29 he uses the expression “your servant” in speaking to God."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8",1,"Chapter 8. Warrior King; Bureaucracy: Resuming the activities reported at the end of Chap. 5, David makes short order of Philistines, Moabites, and Arameans, with the result that he acquires a large amount of gold, silver, and bronze. These are “hallowed to YHWH” (v.11), in line with the portrayal of the king as faithful servant in the mode of Deuteronomy. And the text emphasizes how David’s victories are attributable to YHWH’s presence “wherever he went” (vv.6 and 14). This theological thrust, however, is accompanied by a more secular note about political strategy: Israelite garrisons are established throughout conquered Aramean territory."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 8",2,"The chapter ends with the initial part of a textual bracket (as noted by Brettler 1995), a list of David’s officials, which will recur at the end of Chap. 20. Their functions include such royal, military, and religious duties as would have been found in many ancient Near Eastern states—proof either of David’s historical power or of a later generation’s desire to see him in their own terms."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9",1,"Chapter 9. Mefiboshet: David’s consolidation of power now makes it feasible for him to be magnanimous. As was noted previously in II 4, a descendant of Sha’ul has survived the civil war. As a man who is lame, Mefiboshet poses no threat to David, since such a condition would naturally have made it impossible for him to lead troops against the king, and so David allows him to both maintain a large laboring household and have a regular seat at the royal table. This arrangement recurs at the end of Kings, and hence at the end of the entire four-book sequence of the Early Prophets, where the surviving Davidic king, Yehoiakhin, is released from captivity in Babylon and boarded at state expense. His status as a favored but impotent royal figure is as telling there as Mefiboshet’s is here."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 9",2,"The House of Sha’ul seems to have survived for centuries, at least in memory; inclusion of passages sympathetic to Sha’ul indicate a later desire to be sensitive to ongoing northern traditions. This kind of attachment to past loyalties can still be seen in many countries and cultures, as witnessed in the ethnic and religious conflicts of recent times."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 10",1,"Chapter 10. War with Ammonites and Arameans: At the start of Sha’ul’s reign, he had rescued a town from the Ammonite king Nahash (I Sam. 11). Seeking now to cement ties with the Ammonites, David is met with suspicion and bad behavior—the humiliation of his emissaries—by the son of this same Nahash. David’s subsequent attack overcomes mainly Arameans who had been hired as mercenaries by the Ammonites. The latter now realize their mistake. By the end of the chapter it is clear that the Ammonites’ days as an effective enemy of Israel are numbered. Before their defeat at the hands of the Israelites can occur, however, the text turns to a contemporary incident which will reverberate far beyond the context of a local war."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12",1,"Chapters 11–12. David’s Double Crime and God’s Response: After a slew of political successes—eliminating his rivals, unifying the country, establishing a new centralized capital and bringing the Coffer there, and subduing foreign enemies—David makes a fateful and fatal error. He behaves as kings throughout the ages have done, taking what is not his and overstepping the bounds of both private morality and Israel’s covenant with God. That later generations were uncomfortable with this story is clear already in the Bible: the book of Chronicles, wishing to focus on David as the ideal king (out of hope, perhaps, for restoration of the monarchy in the Persian period), simply omitted it and the troubling Avshalom episodes that follow. Equally, later Jewish tradition as represented in the Talmud (Ketubot 9b) sought to exonerate David at least from adultery, on the grounds that warriors of the time were required to give their wives conditional divorces."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12",2,"The book of Samuel, however, will have none of such whitewashing, and features this tale as the root of subsequent events in David’s life, lavishing a considerable amount of artistic skill upon it. Like so many central biblical tales, it is constructed on a foundation of leading words—in this case, “lie” and “send.” Rather than functioning as mere signposts, however, these words undergo what Trible suggestively calls a “pilgrimage”; they are transformed within the story, and bring us along on the journey. From the initially neutral “lying-place,” David’s rooftop couch, we are taken to the crime itself, where he “lies” with Bat-Sheva (11:4). The verb next appears in Uriyya’s righteous refusal to go back home in the midst of the war: “and I, I should come into my house / to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife?” (11:11). It subsequently becomes part of David’s punishment: “I will take away your women … your fellow … will lie with your women” (12:11). The concluding scenes of the story trace David’s movement back into the realm of forgiveness and resolution, with his “lying on the ground” (12:16), pleading for his newborn son’s life, and then his final, legitimate “lying” with Bat-Sheva, which results in the conception of the promised heir, Shelomo. Thus an initially neutral term becomes the vehicle for a well-trodden biblical journey of sin and repentance."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, Chapters 11–12",3,"The other key word, “send,” has a parallel function. Eleven times in twenty-six verses, messages and people are sent, almost always by David, the master manipulator. The long arm of royal power reaches into the home of a private citizen and abroad to the public arena of the battlefield, with the king seemingly able to move his subjects around like chess pieces. Much of his sending is successful, but it is dramatically countered by the divine hand in 12:1 (“and Y<small>HWH</small> sent Natan to David”). Despite David’s well-thought-out plans, in the end he cannot stand up to God’s sending—a verb that in the Bible is almost always used in connection with prophets. And the prophet Natan’s mission is a classic one, with the man of God pitted against the king. It will be structurally repeated, along with parallel circumstances, in the great encounter between Eliyyahu (Elijah) and Ah’av (Ahab) in I Kings 21. In the present story, it is only when David’s repentance is accepted, and his punishment doled out, that we encounter the last “sending” of the sequence, in which God approves of the new son (12:25)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13",1,"Chapter 13. Amnon and Tamar: If the previous story constituted the great divide in David’s life as king, the next one immediately launches into its consequences. David’s desire for a woman, culminating in a tale of adultery and murder, is followed by his son Amnon’s obsession with his own half sister, which leads him to rape and then spurn Tamar. He is subsequently cut down in an act of revenge by her full brother Avshalom. The fact that Amnon is the heir to the throne well illustrates the fateful mixing of private and public spheres that is characteristic of many narratives on biblical leadership."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13",2,"In further emphasizing the connection between the two texts, several words recur here. The story picks up on the “nourishment” that David had refused in Chap. 12 and makes it into a major motif, resounding six times in six verses. “Lying/lying down” also returns, understandably. What is new, though, is the intensity of speech between the central characters. Not only do terrible things occur, but they are haggled over, and we are brought into the realm of extreme emotions: obsession, desperation, shame, rejection, and vengefulness."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13",3,"Amid the personal details, this narrative also opens the Avshalom cycle, as noted in the Introduction to Samuel above, with the repetition of the theme word “heart.” In addition to its use as a descriptor of Tamar’s prepared food, it appears in Avshalom’s ironic statement to his sister in v.20, “Don’t take this thing to heart!”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13",4,"The sequence of events leading to the murder of Amnon is telling. In a move that suggests elements of the opening of the Yosef story in Genesis, a father sends his son into a situation of certain conflict (note too Amnon’s “Have everyone go out from me” in v.9, recalling the moment before Yosef reveals himself to his brothers in Gen. 45:1, and the mention of Tamar’s “ornamented tunic,” a phrase used to describe Yosef’s famous article of clothing in Gen. 37:3). The fact that the king at first believes the rumor that all of his sons have been murdered (vv.30–31) is perhaps indicative of a suddenly fragile state of mind. The first part of God’s recent statement of punishment for David’s crimes, “So-now— / the sword shall not depart from your house for the ages” (12:10), has received its first fulfillment."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 13",5,"This part of the chapter structurally balances the earlier rape scene, encompassing refusal, the appearance of Yonadav, eating, and grief marked by the usual tearing of clothing (Polzin 1989). It also suggests what will be more fully developed subsequently, namely, Avshalom’s reprising of some of his father’s traits and experiences. Here, he flees for a time, as David had fled from Sha’ul."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14",1,"Chapter 14. The Wise Woman of Tekoa; Avshalom Returns: After some time passes, David’s commander Yoav, who throughout II Samuel acts in what he believes are the king’s best interests, now perceives that David is ripe for Avshalom to return to Jerusalem. But knowing David as he does, he apparently feels that the reconciliation cannot occur without some kind of subterfuge, or at least teaching the king a lesson. So, like Natan had done in Chap. 12, he concocts a story to draw David into the emotional heart of the situation. Enlisting a “worldly-wise woman,” Yoav lays out the fictional case of a sole surviving son, who, should he die at the hand of an angry family member, will by his death eradicate his father’s name and line from the world. David of course promises to protect the helpless woman and her son, but eventually comes to realize that the story is really about himself—as he had not perceived in the case of Natan’s little parable in Chap. 12."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 14",2,"The ultimate irony of the narrative is that father and son are brought together by the hardened warrior Yoav, yet it is he who will ultimately separate them forever, four chapters hence."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15",1,"Chapter 15. David Driven from the Throne: With Chap. 13, the narrative came full circle from the violence of Judges, as that book’s chaos in a sense reappeared in the family sphere of David’s house (Fishbane). Yet now it will expand again to the nation as a whole, with Avshalom’s revolt against his father."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15",2,"As frequently occurs in biblical narrative, this chapter is connected to the previous one by means of reprised words: “call,” “come,” “bow down,” and “kiss,” all in the first five verses (Bar-Efrat). More important, from the outset of the chapter it becomes clear that at this point Avshalom is seeking the throne itself. His strategy is the personal touch: he intercepts those people who come to Jerusalem for justice, assuring them of his personal concern, which he contrasts to David’s supposed disinterest. Thus he begins the process of “[stealing] away the heart of the men of Israel” (v.6). He does this cleverly, without vocally laying claim to the throne (see Ehrlich)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15",3,"A second stage in Avshalom’s plan is to go, on a pretext, to Hevron, the original stronghold of David’s political power. Here he is able to marshal his public relations machine by sending “spy-runners” throughout the land to proclaim his accession to the throne, by successfully recruiting David’s adviser Ahitofel, and by increasing the number of his followers."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15",4,"From here the chapter switches its focus to David. He is shown leading the flight from Jerusalem, and, rather pathetically, leaving ten of his concubines to symbolically guard the palace. Moreover, throughout this part of the story, David expresses an unusual tone of resignation. To his friend Ittai he describes his fate as “I am going wherever I am going” (v.20), and he has the precious Coffer returned to Jerusalem, not knowing whether he will ever see it and the city again."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 15",5,"Yet amid all the weeping for the king’s fate (vv.23 and 30), David the crafty politician reemerges, plotting to win back his throne. He prays to Y<small>HWH</small> to bring Ahitofel’s advice to naught, and instructs Hushai how to frustrate the evil designs of Ahitofel and his master."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16",1,"Chapter 16. David in Exile; Avshalom and the Concubines: As David crosses a natural border, reaching the far side of the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem, he is met by two men whose behavior demonstrates the king’s vulnerability. The first, Mefiboshet’s servant Tziva, uses a lie—that his master is supporting the rebellion out of the hopes of regaining the throne for his family—to try to obtain wealth for himself. The second, another relative of Sha’ul, Shim’i son of Gera, both curses and throws stones at David, yet the king’s response is to accept the abuse, as if to suggest that he has reached a nadir of power and self-respect."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 16",2,"At the same time, David’s plans for a return to power are bearing fruit, with the acceptance of his counselor Hushai by Avshalom toward the end of the chapter. This occurs amid Avshalom’s symbolic act of sleeping with his father’s concubines, always a sign of attempted or actual succession in biblical Israel (see Re’uven’s actions in Gen. 35:22 and Avner’s in II Sam. 3:7). But as Clines has noted, Avshalom’s move, given that it involves multiple women, may additionally be an exaggerated act of masculine bravado, beyond the merely symbolic political aspect."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17",1,"Chapter 17. Hushai’s Advice; the Worm Turns: Avshalom now seeks counsel as to the right move in the burgeoning rebellion. The first opinion he solicits is that of Ahitofel, of whose reputation for solid advice in the past we have just learned (16:23). The plan is a sound one: to isolate and kill David, thus avoiding mass bloodshed and providing for a quick restoration of the peace. Inexplicably, however, the usurper instead accepts the advice of Hushai, which is to be wary of the experienced and tough old king and to amass an army and attack the town where he is to be found. Only at the end of Hushai’s proposal do we learn that Avshalom’s acceptance of the old man’s advice is actually YHWH’s doing (v.14). In practical terms, it gives David time to solidify his own plans and marshal his forces (Sweeney 2007)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17",2,"David must be informed of the possibilities, and this is accomplished by means of two messengers, whose escape from Avshalom’s men in vv.18–21 is reminiscent of the story of Yehoshua’s spies slipping away in Josh. 2. The king subsequently decides to cross to the east bank of the Jordan to assure his safety."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 17",3,"The upshot of this episode is that Ahitofel kills himself, a rather rare event for the Bible, at least in a nonmilitary setting, and David begins to prepare for the coming battle by feeding his troops."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18",1,"Chapter 18. Avshalom’s Death: As the rebellion narrative moves toward its inevitable conclusion, David will not be present at the climactic moment, just as he was not present at the moment of Sha’ul’s death. His exclusion from the battle by his own soldiers, while couched in concern for his welfare, also suggests that he is no longer perceived as an effective military leader. It has the added effect of setting up the dramatic scene in which David learns the news about his son’s death, which in fact comprises the bulk of this chapter."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18",2,"The battle scene itself, as usual, is brief, with the striking note that the forest swallowed up the rebels (v.8). More significant is the mode of Avshalom’s death, with its unforgettable image of the prince accidentally hanging from a tree. The two great theme words of the whole cycle, “head” and “heart,” come into play once again: he who had sought to become head of Israel, during his royal father’s lifetime, winds up hanging from his head, totally vulnerable to attack; and from having initially swayed the hearts of the people, he is struck “in the heart” as he hangs “in the heart” of a tree. Once again it is a son of Tzeruya, Yoav, who acts decisively and violently, to resecure the throne for David."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18",3,"V.18 stands alone, perhaps as a postscript to Avshalom’s death, to at least provide a tangible memory of the charismatic prince. The monument mentioned here, known to the writer or final editor of Samuel, should not be confused with the “Absalom’s Tomb” that still stands in Jerusalem, in the valley east of the Old City. That structure dates from the much later Hellenistic period (second to first century <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>.)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 18",4,"For the narrator, the portrayal of how the bad news is brought to David is almost of equal weight to the relating of Avshalom’s actual death. In the Bible we have previously encountered a number of imagined and real battle messenger scenes, most notably with Sisera’s mother (Judg. 5) and Eli (I Sam. 4). Here, however, the drama is even more extreme. The king has repeatedly ordered his commanders and soldiers not to harm Avshalom, but we know that “the lad” is already dead. After some jockeying for the privilege of delivering the news—Ahimaatz, the usual messenger, is rejected by Yoav—the narrative speaks through the king’s perspective. Three pieces of information are passed by the watchman to David, who sits anxiously awaiting news of his son: the existence of one runner, then two, and then the identification of Ahimaatz. We know, but the king initially does not, that this time Ahimaatz will pass, and the fateful message will be delivered by the unnamed Cushite (foreigners have previously delivered bad news to David in I Sam. 30:1ff. and II Sam. 1:2ff.). Note that David’s only concern is for his son, not for his troops or the disposition of the rebellion. The actual news is delivered elliptically; unlike the earlier “also your servant Uriyya the Hittite is dead” (II 11:24), the messenger sees fit to say what he needs to by a circumlocution, although an obvious one: “May they be like that lad, my lord king’s enemies …” (v.32)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19",1,"Chapter 19. David Shaken and Restored to Power: Few scenes of grief in literature are as affecting as the one with which this chapter opens. The king’s emotions are conveyed largely through the use of sound (see note to v.1); the multiple repetitions of “my son” ring true, since grieving is by nature an obsessive process. While the reader’s sympathy is with the king, Yoav brings us back to brutal reality by emphasizing that this is no time for David to appear weak. With stinging words he reprimands the king for putting his own emotions above those of political necessity; in Yoav’s view, by excessively mourning his (unworthy) son, David is compromising his leadership and indeed ignoring his subjects’ own needs."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19",2,"After finally composing himself, David attempts to repair the fractures in his kingdom. In order to placate the northerners, he appoints Avshalom’s erstwhile commander Amasa to replace Yoav. There may well be other motives at play here, given the troubled history between king and general; David must be aware that Yoav had dealt the initial blows to Avshalom as he hung from the tree. He assures Shim’i ben Gera, who had cursed him as a “bloodguilty man” in Chap. 16, that he will not be executed. Sha’ul’s grandson Mefiboshet appears, unkempt, and excuses his absence during the rebellion by pointing to his servant Tziva’s deception (see 16:1–4); subsequently, David reverses his earlier decision and restores to Mefiboshet at least some of his property. And a last piece of resolution takes place when Barzillai, the king’s faithful friend who had supported him materially during his flight, elects to remain at home rather than come to Jerusalem, citing his advanced age. His fatigue perhaps reflects the king’s own."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 19",3,"Yet the chapter still ends with conflict, at least of a verbal kind. The northerners are miffed at not being the ones to conduct David back across the Jordan. As the majority of Israel’s population, they feel entitled, but in the end, the Judahites’ “rougher” words prevail."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20",1,"Chapter 20. Second Rebellion: Avshalom’s revolt has once again exposed the historic rift between north and south, a divide which does not end with his death. A Binyaminite named Sheva starts another rebellion; when David asks his new commander Amasa to call the Judahites together to respond, he acts slowly, which is enough to convince his predecessor Yoav that he is betraying the king. Yoav’s brutal murder of Amasa dominates this chapter: the picture of the general wallowing in his blood by the side of the road is the first of two graphic images here strongly making the point that rebellion against David will not be countenanced, at least not by Yoav. The second example made of a rebel begins in v.14, and finds Sheva taking refuge up north in the town of Avel of Bet-Maakha. As Avshalom’s return to Jerusalem, and hence the seeds of the revolt, had begun with a story about a “wise woman” (Chap. 14), so the cycle of rebellion ends with one. Here the woman is able to fend off Yoav’s destructive urges and save her town by killing the rebel. What originated as an assault on the head of Israel draws to a close with the sight of a head flying off the ramparts of an Israelite town."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 20",2,"As the chapter ends, there is a second list of David’s officials (the first had capped Chap. 8). This time, in addition to a new Herald, we have a brand-new office: “[The One] Over the Labor-Gangs.” With the introduction of large-scale planning, Israel is moving from a fledgling state to something closer to the real thing, with institutions of centralized control. And with this “bureaucratic bookend” (Hamilton), we come to the end of the central account of David’s tenure as king."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21",1,"Chapter 21. Revenge on the House of Sha’ul; Battles with the Philistines: After all the bloodshed that has occurred in Samuel, one piece of unfinished business remains. The text chooses this point to recount a symbolic execution—that of seven sons of Sha’ul—and uses the men of Giv’on (Gibeon) as the means to that end. In a story that does not appear elsewhere in the Bible, we are informed that Sha’ul, in contravention of the treaty with the Giv’onites that had been concluded in Josh. 9:15, had sought to destroy them. Now they demand a kind of blood vengeance, which David permits in order to stay the famine that is ravaging the land. One must again wonder at bloody deeds which benefit David but in which he does not wield the sword, and at the fact that he uses an oracle to shift the responsibility."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21",2,"In an opposite vein, a final demonstration of David’s magnanimity concerns the bodies of the executed men. The action of Sha’ul’s concubine Ritzpa, who protects the corpses of both her own two sons and those of Sha’ul’s daughter Merav, is a deed of compassion and heroism, stretching as it does from spring to fall in the heart of the hot, dry season, and is met by David’s realization that all of Sha’ul’s family should be interred together in the family plot. This provides a closure which had been lacking since Sha’ul’s death, since he and the sons who had fallen in battle with him had remained buried under a tree in Yavesh-Gil’ad since I Sam. 31. But in truth, the burial is the final nail in the Saulide coffin."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 21",3,"The chapter concludes with four brief accounts of battle with the Philistines which appear to look back chronologically. In the first, David is actually taken captive, only to be rescued by Yoav’s brother Avishai. This episode is followed by Israelite victories over various foes—huge warriors with sometimes unusual physical characteristics (see v.20). Golyat is mentioned again; in this version he is slain not by the youthful David but by a certain Elhanan (see the Comments to I Sam. 17, above)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 22",1,"Chapter 22. David’s Song of Deliverance: The placement of poetry toward the end of a long section or book occurs a number of times in the Bible (see, for instance, Gen. 49 and Exod. 15). This chapter also serves as a bracket for the entire book, as noted in the Comments to II 1, above. In fact, it echoes both vocabulary and themes from the earlier Song of Hanna (Fokkelman 1999), down to the detail that both conclude with mention of “his anointed one” (v.51 and 2:10) (Fishbane)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 22",2,"Additionally, this “song” is a virtual compendium of Israelite poetic ideas. The writer takes the time to build up the impressive manifestation of God in a manner that would have been familiar to many groups in the region; David’s God thunders in much the same manner as the Canaanite/Phoenician Baal. The divine appearance is in response to a beleaguered and despairing protagonist, who is so often the focus of biblical poetry from Jeremiah, Psalms, Lamentations, and Job, to cite just a few outstanding examples. Whether David was the writer or not, the poem’s imagery seems to fit him and his struggles nicely: from a state of being surrounded by enemies, he is able to triumph, especially militarily; he keeps faith with God in wholeness of heart (conveniently, the Bat-Sheva incident is ignored); and he is assured of God’s perpetual favor in the end."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 22",3,"Fishbane rightly stresses the “rock” imagery used here for God, and notes that, while it is used frequently in the Psalms, its appearance in this chapter focuses on hope rather than on a desperate plea for rescue."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 23",1,"Chapter 23. David’s “Last Words”; His Warriors: A much briefer poem opens this chapter (vv.1–7). Strikingly, its initial words recall the prophet Bil’am’s inspired vision of a peaceful, secure Israel in Num. 22–24. The poem touts the theme of God’s reassurance, presenting mainly the natural imagery of light and growth for David himself, and concluding with a fiery portrayal of his enemies’ demise. The latter is a frequent theme in the book of Psalms."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 23",2,"The rest of the chapter concentrates on the names and exploits of David’s choice warriors, returning as it were to the end of Chap. 21. Some of the passages are difficult to interpret, but the intent is apparently to celebrate David as warrior king. The whole section would logically fit much earlier in the book, but it has probably been placed here because these final chapters of Samuel function to collect various traditions about David which are best served in isolation from the main narrative flow. They also have the effect of recovering some of David’s earlier heroic stature: he is a selfless military leader who refuses to profit from his soldiers’ fanatical loyalty (vv.13–17), and he heads a formidable group of warriors (vv.18–38) who are, significantly, remembered by name."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24",1,"Chapter 24. Plague and Purchase: The final chapter of Samuel begins on a puzzling note. We are not told why YHWH is angry at Israel, but David becomes an unwitting accomplice in a new sin, that of taking a census. What precisely is wrong with this act is not made explicit. Guesses range from some kind of ancient reluctance to count, at least outside of a religious context (see Exod. 30, where the counted Israelites must be monetarily “redeemed”), to a feeling that taking a military census shows a lack of trust in God. Already in ancient times interpreters were uncomfortable with the passage, and in the later book of Chronicles (I 21), the idea of the census is portrayed as stemming not from God but from a shadowy figure called “the satan,” whose literal meaning is “adversary” (and not the Devil figure of later times)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24",2,"Be that as it may, by the midpoint of the chapter, it appears that the whole episode is functioning as an opportunity for David to exercise renewed leadership. First he gets to choose the form of punishment that Israel must undergo, and then he alone accepts blame for the plague, imploring God to have compassion on Israel. In that sense, both David and the very concept of kingship are at least partially redeemed as the book of Samuel draws to a close."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24",3,"There is, however, a further reason for the existence of this narrative. In order to properly atone for the taking of a census, David is to purchase some property up the hill from his palace, so that he may build an altar. The location is none other than the future site of the Temple, which David had been desperate to build in Chap. 7 and which will be erected by his son Shelomo. The book of Samuel thus concludes on a note that looks forward to the establishing of a permanent dynasty, with its presence firmly anchored in the royal complex of Jerusalem, and draws attention away from David’s decline, which had been the narrative focus since Chap. 13. The indignities of his old age are left for the next two chapters, at the beginning of the book of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24",4,but he went down at him with [only] a staff;
"The Early Prophets, Ii Samuel, 24",5,"he snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1",1,"Chapter 1. Shelomo as Heir to the Throne: Although many commentators such as Alter (1999) see Chaps. 1 and 2 as a continuation of the “Succession Narrative” that began in II Sam. 11, and thus as the natural conclusion to the David story, one could equally argue that these chapters have a life of their own. As the book of Kings opens, they form the beginning of the account of Shelomo’s accession to the throne. Their link to what has gone before fits the pattern of “overlapping structures” that I noted in the General Introduction, but these chapters also have their own vocabulary and point of view."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1",2,"In Chap. 1, several repeating phrases point the reader/hearer toward the central themes: “sit/seated on the/my throne” and “after” (denoting succeeding one’s father as king, used similarly in Samuel). “Bowed low” graphically highlights both court etiquette and the desperate situation of Natan and Bat-Sheva advocating for Shelomo, who is not the firstborn, and also, at chapter’s end, for reducing the status of the ambitious heir to the throne, Adoniyyahu. Above all, the repetition of the word “know,” beginning with David’s impotence in v.2, suggests that, while David may not be fully aware of what is going on around him, <i>we</i> surely are: Shelomo, and no other, will be the next king."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1",3,"The older principals in the chapter are especially fascinating to watch. David is obviously a shadow of his former self, unable to navigate very well either sexually or politically; Walsh points out that there are no active verbs that accompany his name in this chapter. But when the time comes, he is able to summon some strength of will, and at least nominally ensure that Shelomo will be “firmly-established.” We have not encountered either the prophet Natan or David’s great love Bat-Sheva since the moral catastrophe of II Sam. 11–12, but both play key roles here in engineering Shelomo’s ascent to power. Their interplay around persuading the king is a kind of strategic dance."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 1",4,"In general, the story laid out in Chap. 1 is a replaying of the national split that was in evidence already during Sha’ul’s (Saul’s) succession, as well as later in Avshalom’s (Absalom’s) revolt. These conflicts are a constant reminder of what will become an essential fact of life in the book of Kings, the great schism between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2",1,"Chapter 2. Settling Scores, Securing the Throne: For a brief moment—the first part of this chapter—the old David returns, although he is not the hero and Psalmist beloved by tradition or the chastened monarch with which the book of Samuel ended. It is the canny and ruthless politician who makes his appearance here. His opening words to his son (vv.2–4) use classic Deuteronomistic language (“be strong,” “keep the keeping of YHWH,” “the teaching,” “prosper,” “with all their heart/being”), and are seen by many as a passage inserted later to soften what follows. For David proceeds to use the word “know,” which appeared in Chap. 1, as a prelude to political assassination. Even Yoav, David’s trusted but violent commander in chief, is not to be spared, for the new king must settle scores and begin afresh. That this advice and behavior sound like those of a Mafia don should not surprise us, given the violent period in which they are set and the literature, succeeding the books of Judges and Samuel, in which they appear. In the end, in contrast to his victims, David simply “lay beside his fathers” (v.10)—but this description is rather pale compared to the deaths of patriarchs (Avraham) and prophets (Moshe), figures with whom one might expect David to be grouped. There is, notably, no public mourning mentioned; thus ends the life of Israel’s greatest king and the measuring rod for all the Judean kings to come. In essence, the cheering we witnessed in I Sam. 18:7 has stopped. The only truly positive note in this chapter is that the dynasty will continue."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2",2,"David’s successor Shelomo now sheds his passive image from Chap. 1 and emerges as a powerful force on his own. His brother Adoniyyahu, who had expected to be king and had been acting accordingly, finds himself at a disadvantage, but instead of cleverly countering the palace intrigue, he walks into a trap of his own making. In a move reminiscent of a previous usurper, Avshalom, he seeks to sleep with a royal concubine, a move which in the Bible is less of purely sexual import and more an indication that a son seeks to replace his father in power."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2",3,"In the subsequent action, Bat-Sheva once again appears, and, as Walsh notes, we may wonder about her motivations in interceding for Adoniyyahu. Is she trying to bring about reconciliation between the brothers, or is she, like the audience, fully aware of how Shelomo will react to his brother’s request?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2",4,"Shelomo’s rule is “firmly-established” at both the beginning (v.12) and end (v.46) of this sequence, but it is disturbing that in the middle, such extreme violence has to take place. Like the stereotyped violence of assassination in Samuel (four uses of the rare word “abdomen” to specify where the victims are stabbed), the murders here are described by means of a single verb, “attack.” Another key word provides one answer to the troubling question of whether the killing is justified: the bloodguilt and other crimes of Yoav and Shim’i “<i>return</i> [on their heads]” (vv.33 and 44; italics mine). And Adoniyyahu’s death as well is a kind of payback for his acts of usurpation. So by the end of the chapter all the loose ends have been tied up, albeit that the new king, whose name suggests “peace,” has achieved it through the usual and not very peaceful methods practiced by kings."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 2",5,"A nonviolent resolution of conflicts does occur in vv.26–27, where the last of the line of Eli the priest (see the opening chapters of Samuel) is relieved of a future priestly role. Thus the text has God’s word in history fulfilled, beginning a major pattern in the book of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3",1,"Chapter 3. Shelomo the Wise: The bulk of this chapter deals with Shelomo’s acquisition of wisdom—the practical wisdom needed to govern—and a memorable demonstration of this quality (vv. 16–28). Yet these accounts are preceded by three verses of a Deuteronomistic kind, in which two discordant themes are introduced: marriage to a foreigner (in this case, the Egyptian king’s daughter) and Israel’s continuing use of local sanctuaries. Since at the end of Shelomo’s reign the worship of foreign gods and use of these local holy places are held to be responsible for the kingdom’s permanent split, this chapter, which also introduces some of the glories of the king’s rule, could be understood as yet another example of the Bible’s complex feelings about kingship."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3",2,"Similarly, the site of the story produces complex reactions. Giv’on, according to I Chron. 16:39 and 21:29, housed the altar and Tent used in Israelite worship, and so is appropriate for a scene of sacrifice. But it is also associated with two tales of violence in Samuel: the military contest between Yoav’s and Avner’s troops in II 2 and the killing of Sha’ul’s remaining descendants in II 21 as revenge for his massacre of the Giv’onites. So it may reflect the dual image of Shelomo and his kingship that is presented in the book."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3",3,"The dream sequence in vv.5–14 draws on well-established traditions in ancient lore: dreams as revelations of the divine and the folklore motif of the supernatural offering to grant a mortal’s wish. As usual, the offer functions as a kind of test, and in this case the hero passes it with flying colors. Seven times we hear the word “request,” which not only makes sense in context, but also harks back to the story of Israel’s clamoring for a king in I Sam. 8. The general vocabulary of the dialogue between God and Shelomo lays out the idealized role of the monarch: he should be a man of “understanding,” “wisdom,” and “discernment,” with “justice” as the ultimate goal."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 3",4,"The story of the two prostitutes and the contested baby follows immediately, a deeply human tale set amid a celebratory feast. It has become famous in Western art; the combination of a presumably opulent setting, the contrasting emotions of the two women, a baby (typically portrayed by artists as naked), and a fearsome sword have proven irresistible. That the women are prostitutes should not be surprising. In the ancient Near East, it was understood that ordinary folk should have access to the throne to air their grievances, and so the tale is the perfeet test case for Shelomo’s ability to govern his entire people wisely. He emerges as an astute assessor of human behavior, a ruler with “an understanding heart” (v.9) who, despite his inexperience, is now able “to discern between good and evil” (v.9) in people’s actions and motivations. The story is also our first encounter in Kings with anonymous women, who will play a major role in the book by throwing issues of power and character into sharp relief."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 4",1,"Chapter 4. Shelomo’s Bureaucracy: This short chapter mirrors II Sam. 8:15–18, which enumerated the officials of King David’s court. While it is impossible to verify the names historically (and, as Walsh says, they may be here simply to give the narrative a plausible flavor), the text does present both rulers as presiding over a developed bureaucracy, and thus suggests at least the beginnings of a centralized state. As we have noted above, the tensions that normally grow out of such a transition from a tribal to a cosmopolitan society are reflected throughout Samuel and Kings. In both this and the Samuel passage, “all Israel” is stressed, although the mention of “Judah and Israel” at the end here (v.20) does not allow us to forget that the strong identity of the two separate regions was the prevailing reality throughout most of Israelite history."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5",1,"Chapter 5. Shelomo’s Wealth, Wisdom, and Fame; Preparations for Building the Temple: The splendor of Shelomo’s court now unfolds. The chapter is awash with details about the extent of the king’s territory, his provisions for a single day, and his horses, interspersed with a note of peace and security such as we rarely hear in this part of the Bible. Vv.9–14 describe Shelomo’s wisdom in glowing terms, so that in this account he surpasses other ancient sages and is universally admired."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 5",2,"From the sevenfold sounding of the root “wise/wisdom,” which in its appearance above meant the ability to govern well, the text moves toward the central aspect of Shelomo’s reign, the building of the Temple, which must also be done with wisdom of the practical kind—that is, with skill and craftsmanship. For the initial stages, the king contacts his father’s old northern ally, Hiram of Tyre, from whom he will procure the needed building materials. But the on-site work will be done by Israelites, who are now impressed into labor gangs. This massive organization of men, which would have been the only possible way to accomplish such a project, well symbolizes the concept of a burgeoning state, with all its attendant disruption, for thousands of men must be drawn from the fields where they normally toil. The text makes no direct complaints here, however. Its primary goal is no doubt to impress the audience."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6",1,"Chapter 6. Building the Temple I: The first chapter on the construction of the Temple concentrates initially on its outer dimensions and ends with a description of the walls and sacred “Rear-Chamber,” along with their decorations. In between (vv.11–13) has been inserted a Deuteronomistic pledge by God that, contingent on Israel keeping the stipulations of the covenant, he will maintain his presence among the Israelites and not abandon them. The Bible understands this as a key goal of the Temple, which mimics the role of the Tabernacle (“Dwelling”) in the presettlement period, as described especially in Exodus."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 6",2,A more detailed description of the inner furnishings of the Temple has been left to the next chapter.
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 7",1,"Chapter 7. The Palace; Building the Temple II: Shelomo’s palace, whose construction takes almost twice as long as that of the Temple, includes five structures, most notably the “House of the Forest of Levanon,” an apt metaphor for a stunning, multicolumned structure. From v.13 on, the text returns to the Temple, beginning with an identification of Hiram, the chief craftsman—-just as the account of the Tabernacle (“Dwelling”) in Exodus had identified its own, Betzalel. It proceeds to provide descriptions of architectural features (such as the two great columns in front of the Temple, along with their capitals), ritual appurtenances (for example, the huge basin known as the “Sea,” and the washing-stands for the priests), and the elaborate wall decorations."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 7",2,"As the chapter moves toward the completion of these buildings (vv.40–50), the pace quickens, again resembling the final chapters of Exodus. Significantly, the whole account ends with an emphasis on silver, gold, and vessels—which, as explained in the Introduction to Kings, will be systematically looted at moments throughout the book, culminating in the final despoiling in the last chapter of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 7",3,"so that the wing of the one touched the wall,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 7",4,"and the wing of the second sphinx was touching the second wall,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 7",5,"while their wings toward the middle of the house were touching, wing to wing."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8",1,"Chapter 8. Shelomo’s Prayer of Dedication: This long speech, beginning with a statement about Shelomo’s intent to build a Temple and culminating in a remarkable series of prayers, appears to have a complicated textual history. Some of it presupposes exile, while other parts hint at a later return; however, the bulk seems to belong to a time after the destruction of the Northern Kingdom in 722 (Sweeney 2007). Its wordiness is almost ceremonial, reminiscent of II Sam. 7, where God had made dramatic promises to David about his dynasty. And the opening fits well into an ancient Near Eastern pattern: a king solidifies his rule by dedicating or rededicating a temple in the name of the god who put him on the throne."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8",2,"Beginning with v.31, the chapter enumerates seven cases in which people may petition God in the Temple. They involve mainly internal crises, but also shift, after v.44, to situations outside the land of Israel, such as war and captivity. These do not necessarily put this part of the chapter in a Babylonian Exile setting, although they undoubtedly came to be read that way. All square nicely with the Deuteronomistic view that Israel’s security and prosperity come from keeping the covenant with Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 8",3,"As Sweeney (2007) points out, the blessing uttered by Shelomo (vv.54–60) likewise encapsulates Deuteronomistic ideas, including divine promises to the ancestors and emphasis on the covenant, encompassing both Y<small>HWH</small>’s faithfulness and Israel’s need to obey. Indeed, the verb “promise” (literally, “speak”) occurs eight times in the chapter, six in vv. 15–26 and then twice at the end (v.56)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 9",1,"Chapter 9. The Warning; Labor; Shelomo’s Accomplishments: Just as the building of the Temple was preceded by a description of forced labor and accompanying dealings with Hiram king of Tyre, these return in Chap. 9, with some subtle variations. Hiram is not fully content with his payment of twenty Galilee towns in vv.11–14, though in vv.26–28 he does give Shelomo gold from Ofir. In between we are told how Shelomo impressed into service remnants of the Canaanites, whom the Israelites had not been able to totally drive out (see both Joshua and Judges); this, combined with mention of his wife, Pharaoh’s daughter, imparts to the chapter a slightly ominous tone, given that in the Bible Canaanite presence and intermarriage most often bring with them the danger of idolatry."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 9",2,"This feeling is further amplified by the opening section of the chapter (vv.2–9), in which the king, in a second dream at Giv’on, is given a classic Deuteronomistic warning: following in the faithful ways of David will lead to a permanent dynasty, but failing to do so will lead to destruction and exile, with the Temple, so central over the previous four chapters, in ruins. After the glorious description and prayer of Chaps. 6–8, it is a sobering ending—written, perhaps, from the perspective of Israel in exile."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 10",1,"Chapter 10. The Queen’s Visit; Shelomo’s Opulence: In an encounter made famous through legend and art, Shelomo is now visited by the exotic Queen of Sheba. Interpreters have spent centuries speculating on the nature of their relationship, and the last emperor of Ethiopia, the colorful Haile Selassie (ruled 1930–1974), claimed descent from their union. But the text gives no hint of a romantic relationship, and focuses instead on how overwhelmed the queen is by the magnificence of Shelomo and his court. While the meeting (vv.4–9) cites “wisdom” as the thing that makes the greatest impression upon her, it is in fact “gold,” mentioned ten times in vv. 14–25, which dominates the chapter once she has departed. Thus material splendor threatens to overcome the wisdom motif. And the chapter ends with a description of Shelomo’s holdings in horses, exactly the item whose acquisition was warned against in Deut. 17:16, along with a prohibition against amassing too much gold in the very next verse. What we may well have here, then, is a good example of how a tradition originally intended to be a positive one (Shelomo’s splendor) comes, in the context of the next chapter and Deuteronomistic History (DH) overall, to take on a negative tone. The text has its own life, as it were."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 10",2,"The chapter abounds in numbers—not surprising, given that it seeks to impress both the royal visitor and the reader—and makes use mostly of multiples of three and six, beginning with 666 in v.14. Such patterned numbers in many ancient cultures point to the ideas of abundance and perfection. Also notable throughout the chapter is the repetition, from the very first verse, of the Hebrew letter <i>shin</i>; the <i>sh</i>-sounds punctuate the text, as if to echo the queen’s feeling of being overwhelmed by King <i>Sh</i>elomo and his accomplishments."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11",1,"Chapter 11. Shelomo’s Last Years: Foreign Wives and the Beginnings of Revolt: Despite all the previous emphasis on the king’s wisdom, the Temple, and the glory of the court, the biblical traditions about Shelomo end on an unabashedly negative note. As is usual in Deuteronomistic texts, the eventual collapse of Shelomo’s unified kingdom is attributed to idolatry, brought on by his marriage to foreign women. This is in keeping with the warnings registered in Deut. 7 and 17."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11",2,"Several motifs which will recur in Kings appear for the first time in this chapter. One is the postponement of punishment until the next generation (v.12), while another is the prophet’s reporting of God’s word to a king (although in this case it is a king-to-be, Yorov’am). That speech, in vv.31–39, is typical of the Deuteronomistic passages in Kings, concentrating as it does on the reason for specific future events."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 11",3,"So Shelomo dies, with his great accomplishments overshadowed for the moment by the imminent dissolution of his kingdom. The rebel Yorov’am waits in the wings, and Shelomo is powerless to eliminate him before his death, unlike the ruthless successes against potential rivals that had marked the beginning of his reign."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12",1,"Chapter 12. Rehav’am and the Split; Yorov’am and the Calves: The division of the kingdom is recounted, not by a humdrum description of events, but by a dramatic narrative. We are presented with the age-old clash between the old, to whom experience has taught political wisdom, and the young, who think they know better. The text raises the issue of “serving,” but the real problem is ironically posed here by the ten-time repetition of the word “return”: Will the kingdom be returned to its previous state of wholeness?"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 12",2,"In order to prevent the restoration of the newly independent north to the control of Jerusalem, Yorov’am takes the fateful step of constructing two golden calves, in a move that textually echoes the Israelites’ apostasy in Exod. 32. While it is possible, as mentioned above, that this action did not constitute idolatry—the calves, in this view, would have served simply as Y<small>HWH’s</small> symbolic footstool—it certainly was seen that way by subsequent biblical writers/editors, who trace all of the kingdom of Israel’s troubles back to this moment. Thus every northern king will be compared to Yorov’am, “who made Israel to sin.” To compound his central crime in the eyes of southern writers, Yorov’am makes priests of non-Levites and establishes a new holy day on the calendar. In Walsh’s words, “he celebrates at the wrong time, in the wrong place, on the wrong altar, in honor of the wrong gods.”"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13",1,"Chapter 13. The North: Prophets and Predictions: The Yorov’am story continues in an unprecedented and directly Deuteronomistic way: a prophet, here termed a “man of God,” predicts that a purge conducted by King Yoshiyyahu (Josiah), fully three centuries hence, will undo the results of Yorov’am’s terrible idolatry. When the king stretches out his hand against the prophet, it withers, and is restored (lit. “returned”) only after the king requests the prophet’s intercession. And the recurrence of the verb “return” is once again the key here. The man of God is told by God to go home by another route, and he refuses hospitality from both Yorov’am and another prophet living in Bet-El. But eventually he relents, eating and drinking with the old prophet, and the result is his death, seen as a punishment from God. The end (and, to my mind, the main point) of the matter is that Yorov’am does not “return” from his wicked path, but instead “returns” to the appointing of illegitimate priests. Things will not go back to the way they were. The north and the south have split forever."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13",2,"Simon (1997) focuses on the other main theme in this chapter, which is a significant one in the Early Prophets: the divine word will be fulfilled, even if the messenger (the “man of God”) does not obey as he is told. It may take centuries, but the “signs” and “portents” will come to pass. In v.26, the old prophet understands his colleague’s death as fulfilling God’s word; v.32 equally points ahead to Yoshiyyahu’s time, when the earlier prophecy regarding the altar will also come to fruition."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13",3,"The enduring image in the last section is reminiscent of fairy tales. We are treated to the sight of the man of God’s corpse, the lion who has killed him, and his unharmed donkey standing in the road. Walsh sees the animals as a kind of “honor guard,” and indeed, the whole story has a kind of tragic nobility. The old prophet recognizes the truth of the man of God’s word, and seeks fellowship with his colleague (Walsh notes the play on <i>shuv</i>, “return,” accomplished through multiple occurrences of <i>yashov</i>, “sit/settle”) in death just as he had, with disastrous results, in life. For Walsh, the fate of the two prophets who have gone astray mirrors the eventual fate of the two kingdoms from which they hail."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 13",4,"and he had them stand at Bet-El [to officiate], the priests of the sanctuaries that he had made."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14",1,"Chapter 14. Yorov’am and Rehav’am: Instead of merely focusing on events and policies of the kings’ reigns, the narrative now keeps the events on a personal level. As with the story of the “Wise Woman of Tekoa” in II Sam. 14, a deception is initially practiced through a female messenger, but the truth manages to come out. Ahiyya the prophet, using strident, colorful language that will recur in reference to King Ah’av (Ahab), foretells the downfall of Yorov’am’s dynasty and the eventual exile of Israel. It is jarring to hear this so early in the book, but it has the effect of setting up a pattern of prophecy and fulfillment that is very much at the ideological center of the book of Kings (Walsh)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 14",2,"Almost nothing is attributed to Rehav’am’s reign except for Judah’s idolatrous practices. The Egyptian invasion that follows in vv.25ff. therefore feels not merely political but punitive. And Rehav’am’s death notice departs from the usual formula in that his mother is mentioned again (see v.21), perhaps because she is an Ammonite—emphasizing Shelomo’s sin of intermarriage once more."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 15",1,"Chapter 15. North and South: Warring Kings: A uniformly depressing chapter, this text describes two kings for each kingdom, and is anchored in the center by a military intervention on the part of Aram (Syria). The accession of a relatively “good” king in the south, Asa, whose religious reforms mildly foreshadow the notable ones of later Judean kings, is tempered by his failure to remove the “sanctuaries,” a serious shortcoming from the Deuteronomistic point of view, which advocates centralized worship in Jerusalem."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 15",2,"Two important messages come through by the end of the chapter: the introduction of assassination as a normal means of succession in the Northern Kingdom, and the concomitant end of Yorov’am’s dynasty. We also hear, ominously, of a second siphoning off of Temple treasures, hard on the heels of the first one in the previous chapter."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 16",1,"Chapter 16. Northern Kings: Continuing the instability manifest in the last chapter, there are two coups subsequent to Ba’sha’s twenty-four-year rule, a reign about which the text again reports next to nothing. The result is the accession of Omri, whose dynasty will last for four decades and will appear by name in Assyrian records. Ominously, v.25 characterizes him as the most evil king to date, but the same will later be said of his son Ah’av (twice, in vv.30 and 34). The latter’s great offense consists in his marrying a Phoenician princess and thus greatly furthering the worship of the fertility god Baal in Israel."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 17",1,"Chapter 17. Eliyyahu Makes His Appearance: Once we have been introduced to the arch northern king, Ah’av, the great prophetic figure of Eliyyahu appears, as if from nowhere. This suddenness will characterize his persona throughout. Unlike previous prophets, he is thoroughly associated with the miraculous from the very beginning: ravens feed him, he produces an abundance of food from a skimpy amount, and he brings a child who has died back to life. In the larger context, it is the phrase and concept of the “word of God” that echoes here, and the chapter ends with the widow’s ringing affirmation that Eliyyahu possesses it."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 18",1,"Chapter 18. Eliyyahu and Ovadyahu; The Contest at Mount Carmel: The transition of Eliyyahu from a mysterious, isolated prophet to a significant public figure is facilitated by the introduction of a secondary character, Ovadyahu, literally “Servant of YHWH,” who in an earlier persecution of YHWH’s prophets had heroically hidden them. By v.17, Eliyyahu confronts the king, and sets up the famous contest between himself and the prophets of Baal—or, more properly, between YHWH and Baal. The setting is striking: the great promontory overlooking the Mediterranean, the upper part of today’s Haifa, still called the Carmel. Down the coast from Sidon, it continues to serve as the backdrop for Eliyyahu’s mission in Baal country, so to speak. The contest itself is as theatrical as anything in the Bible. At the center are contrasts: the lone Eliyyahu against the 450 prophets of Baal; Eliyyahu’s dialoguing with the people versus the purely ritual behavior of his opponents; and, most notably, his calm demeanor, contrasted with their “ranting” and self-mutilation. The latter, of course, produces no results, whereas Eliyyahu’s heart-felt words in vv.36–37, punctuated by a twofold “know” (the motif of the public acknowledgment of God), lead to the miraculous descent of fire onto the altar. The special effects are spectacular: the fire consumes not only the sacrifice but the altar itself, and the stones and dust, and the water which Eliyyahu had previously poured over the altar. Moreover, the behavior of the prophets of Baal is mocked, mirroring a treatment of other religious systems that appears frequently in the Bible. In the end, therefore, after the slaughter of those prophets, we should not be surprised that the rains, which had been hitherto withheld, burst out of the sky. Their suddenness is not only reflective of Middle Eastern reality, but is also an indication of where the power really lies. Baal was worshipped in the region chiefly as a storm god, so the polemic is unmistakable."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19",1,"Chapter 19. Eliyyahu’s Flight to Sinai; Elisha Appointed: At the moment of his greatest triumph, Eliyyahu has to take to flight. God’s stunning victory over the prophets of Baal, while it wins over the hearts of the people for the moment, cannot prevent the pagan queen Izevel from forcing the prophet into a long journey. It takes place in miraculously quick fashion, and he winds up where he began in Chap. 17: alone in the wilderness, fed at divine command. But this time there is a sense of deep despair which we have not seen previously. The theme of death echoes through Eliyyahu’s multiple negative references to the Hebrew term nefesh, here meaning “life” (Fishbane). In the midst of his torment, the prophet finds himself at Sinai, in “the cave,” perhaps the site where Moshe had communed with God in Exod. 33. In one of the Bible’s greatest revelation scenes, God speaks to Eliyyahu, but not by means of the usual Sinai pyrotechnics which were so characteristic of the Exodus stories, and which in Ugaritic literature are often connected to the god Baal. Instead, after wind, earthquake, and fire, God addresses the prophet in a “still small voice.” The message is both consoling (he is to be relieved of duty, so to speak) and concentrated: he must go back into the world and set up future events, by appointing his successor and anointing not only the next king of Israel but the king of Aram as well."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19",2,"The portrait of a prophet as an isolated, persecuted, and self-doubting figure is characteristic of the Hebrew Bible’s understanding of the role. Moshe begins the pattern in his initial refusal to serve (Exod. 3) and continues in the many moments when he alone stands between an angry God and the erring people. But the pattern continues elsewhere, especially in the person of Yirmeyahu (Jeremiah) (see, for instance, Jer. 1 and 20). The nature of the prophet’s role is to stand against “nations and kingdoms: / to uproot and to pull down, / to destroy and to overthrow, / to build and to plant” (Jer. 1:10). Despite the terrible personal price to be paid by the prophet in his personal and communal life, however, he is exhorted, “Do not break down before them, / lest I break you before them… . They will attack you, / but they shall not overcome you; / for I am with you—declares Y<small>HWH</small>—to save you” (Jer. 1:17,19)."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19",3,"There is pathos in Eliyyahu’s loneliness, which stands out in contrast to his mastery of the miraculous elsewhere; the wonder-worker cannot overcome his destiny. And so it is that he finds one over whom he can literally throw his mantle, a successor (Elisha) who will surpass his master in textual space and miraculous deeds, but not in force of personality."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19",4,"Go up, say to Ah’av:"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19",5,"Get harnessed and go down,"
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 19",6,so that the showers do not stop you!
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20",1,"Chapter 20. Ah’av/Israel and Aram: The book of Kings is highly interested in neighboring nations, as in Aram here; but typically that interest stems less from a desire to report detailed historical events and more from a need to teach about God, kings, and prophets. And so this chapter presents Ah’av as defiant of the Aramean king—a stance that is supported by God through a prophet—but he also releases the defeated Ben-Hadad following the battle, much to the chagrin of YHWH. This last is perhaps a hint of the historical record as found outside the Bible; Assyrian sources characterize Israel and Aram as close allies in the Battle of Qarqar in 853 B.C.E."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20",2,"Aram covers the large area to the northeast of Israel, substantially today’s Syria. It thus became, in the early centuries of the first millennium <small>B.C.E</small>., a border or buffer state between Assyria and those peoples living on the Mediterranean coast. Aram was not destined to become a great empire like those to the east and southeast, although it attained some prominence in the ninth century; throughout much of its history it was in fact disunified, never possessing a central government. Its chief contributions to the world were, first, its adaptation of Phoenician writing into a more functional alphabet, with the innovation of several letters coming to serve as vowels; and, second, its status as the birthplace of the Aramaic language, which first served as a major diplomatic language in the ancient Near East and later became the daily tongue of Jews for well over a thousand years, including of Jesus and of the Roman-period Rabbis."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 20",3,"From the vantage point of narrative continuity, this chapter would be most fruitfully paired with Chap. 22, and indeed, in LXX the chapter order is 21–20–22."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21",1,"Chapter 21. Navot’s Vineyard: This story, which might be titled “The Framing of Navot,” appears to have been inserted in the middle of two accounts of Israel’s relationship with Aram. It has been made to connect to the first by means of an aural association: the description of Ah’av’s mood in 20:43 as “sullen and enraged” is repeated verbatim in v.4. The story is a high point in the biblical narrator’s art, and tells us more about a situation and an ideology than it does about the prophet himself. Eliyyahu’s ringing condemnation of Ah’av is a classic prophetic trope, rather removed from his usual miracle-working behavior. Indeed, structurally the story is almost a clone of the David and Bat-Sheva tale of II Sam. 11–12. In both instances, a king takes what is rightfully another’s; he has the owner murdered; as he is about to get away with the dual crime, a prophet confronts and condemns him; the king immediately repents; and aspects of the punishment are deflected or put off until the next generation. A message beyond specific historical circumstances is presented here, namely, that the king may not trespass on certain sacred rights, especially regarding the family inheritance of land. And Mann notes that the king and queen even break most of the Ten Commandments in this brief story. In a broader sense, then, the story exposes the unresolved tension between small community and monarchy, a tension which applies not only to Eliyyahu’s era but probably to an extended period of change, whenever it may have occurred historically. It is all the more ironic that Izevel makes use of the social mechanisms of small community, a council of elders and freemen, to bring about Navot’s murder."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21",2,"Of particular interest are the portraits of Izevel and Ah’av painted in the text. The Phoenician princess who becomes queen of Israel is the epitome of connivance and control, more paralleling the David of the Bat-Sheva story than her husband does. Upon hearing Ah’av’s complaint, without missing a beat she uses her power to get what he cannot, as if she has a plan already drawn up. He, on the other hand, appears utterly tentative—whether out of weakness of character or respect for ancient institutions, we are not told. But when confronted by Eliyyahu, Ah’av is transformed into the model sinner, repenting even more strongly than did his predecessor David."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21",3,"The chapter gives the writer the opportunity to include a Deuteronomistic note (vv.24–26) about how terrible Ah’av was, and sets up the next major section of Kings, which will recount how the Omride dynasty (and Izevel) meets its downfall. The narrative will take its time getting there; the prophecy’s fulfillment will occur only during the career of Eliyyahu’s successor Elisha. The fact that this chapter seems to be modeled on the earlier story from Samuel may indicate that the writers/editors felt so strongly about the theme of kingly usurpation that they made sure to include a separate parallel story about the north, whenever our chapter was actually written."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 21",4,"The narrator makes use of several key words in repetition. Five times in vv.13–16 we hear the root “die,” which hammers in the seriousness of the crime (just as both David’s murder of Uriyya and the finality of David’s punishment, the death of his newborn child, are stressed through the same root in II Sam. 11:17–24 and 12:18–19). The fourfold “take possession” later in the story turns our attention to the second stage of Ah’av’s crime. Above all, however, is the signal use of the commonplace verb “give,” occurring fully nine times in the first seven verses of the story. If the David/Bat-Sheva narrative was about “sending,” the present story is about who has the power to give over what is not theirs. And the dynasty is condemned in just those terms—v.22’s “I will give your house to be” like the other defunct dynasties of the Northern Kingdom. While the Hebrew verb <i>n-t-n</i> in such passages usually signifies “make” or “place,” here it may be meant to echo the earlier theme word “give.” The same verb can also connote “to sell,” so we have here a rich use of language."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22",1,"Chapter 22. War with Aram and the Death of Ah’av: In an earlier stage of the development of Kings, this chapter undoubtedly followed Chap. 20. In addition, the use of the term “king of Israel” instead of “Ah’av” or “King Ah’av” has led some scholars to theorize that the figure described here originally referred to another monarch. This is further supported by v.40’s description of Ah’av’s death in normal terms, as opposed to his falling in battle."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22",2,"In our discussion of the structure of Kings above (p. 551), we noted that this section of the book is concerned with the relationship between kings and prophets. Chap. 22 introduces a whole new cast of the latter, both in plural and in singular, and poses a question that is raised a number of times in the Bible: How does one know if a prophet is a “true” one or a false one? The Judahite king Yehoshafat’s initial query about the outcome of the imminent battle meets with enthusiastic predictions from a large group of professional prophets, but their answer somehow does not satisfy the king; perhaps he understands their function as “yes men.” He summons instead a prophet known to be contrary—not Eliyyahu, but a certain Mikhayhu—who proceeds first to lie, but finally reveals that Ah’av will die in the battle. The result of this revelation is Mikhayhu’s receiving a slap from one of the onlooking court prophets, and then his imprisonment."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22",3,"In the second part of the chapter (vv.29ff.), Ah’av meets his fate. Despite a desperate attempt to outwit the enemy by discarding his royal garb while encouraging his Judahite ally not to do so, he is hit by an Aramean arrow. Propped up in the chariot in the heat of the battle, he bleeds to death."
"The Early Prophets, I Kings, 22",4,"The Ah’av who may be teased from history appears to have been more accomplished than the Bible gives him credit for. While the text hints at some building projects (v.39), archaeology credits him with more, including probably the so-called stables at Megiddo. Of equal significance is the fact that he was a participant in the important battle at Qarqar, where the burgeoning Assyrian Empire apparently suffered a temporary setback. For the book of Kings, however, the account of Navot’s framing is of much greater import, and there is no hint there of Qarqar, in an excellent example of the Bible’s attitude toward what we call history. Thus Ah’av is judged by standards other than political ones, and, regardless of his actual accomplishments, he has been effectively frozen for all time as the Baal-tolerating king of Israel, Izevel’s husband, and Eliyyahu’s opponent. It is intriguing, but not entirely unexpected, that Melville appropriated his name for the captain of the <i>Pequod</i>, who makes a virtual idol of his desire for revenge."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1",1,"Chapter 1.Eliyyahu and Ahazyahu: The text returns to Eliyyahu and his marvelous powers. It begins with a king who is ill and thus in need of an oracle; quickly the issue becomes, as previously in Chap. 18, whether to rely upon YHWH or upon Baal. King Ahazyahu unhesitatingly turns to the pagan god, and as a result he is condemned to die on his sickbed."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1",2,"Beyond the prophetic word, we are given another demonstration of Eliyyahu’s ability to call down fire from heaven. In this case, the “sacrifice” is two army commanders and their bands of fifty soldiers (tellingly, we recall that Eliyyahu serves “Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High”); the third commander, like Ovadyahu in Chap. 17 above, successfully pleads with the prophet. It is all a continuation of Eliyyahu’s (really, God’s) power over life and death, a theme that permeates the entire cycle of stories."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1",3,"The repetition of refrains relating to the king (“Is it because there is no God in Israel whose word [one] can consult?”; “the bed into which you climbed up,” etc.) serves to underscore the prophet’s condemnation of idolatry, which even more than the folktale/miraculous aspect is the key to the stories here."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 1",4,"Interestingly, in v.8 we are given one of the few physical descriptions of a central biblical character: Eliyyahu is “a hairy man, / with a girded-belt of leather girded about his loins.” The description befits his folkloristic character. He is an elemental figure who in his very appearance brings out the struggle between the powerless and those who rule."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2",1,"Chapter 2. Eliyyahu’s Ascent and Elisha’s Succession: With a majesty that foreshadows such legendary heroes as King Arthur (Gaster), Eliyyahu’s end is one of the most memorable in the Bible. It is fully fitting for one whose life has been consistently mysterious and majestic."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2",2,"In a somewhat surprising narrative move, the manner of his death is revealed in the chapter’s opening verse. This has the effect of shifting the reader’s focus from the fantastic to what the text regards as key: first, the relationship between the prophet and his forerunner Moshe, and second, the one between him and his suecessor Elisha. The former has already been strongly suggested by Eliyyahu’s Sinai experience in Chap. 19 above, and is strengthened in our chapter by his splitting of the waters of the Jordan and his disappearance. (Cohn [2000] notes how the site of Moshe’s grave is unknown as well.) Eliyyahu’s relationship to Elisha—in particular, his passing of the literal mantle of authority—takes up most of the chapter. And this is the only place in the Hebrew Bible where a prophet gets to appoint his successor. As Cohn points out, the narrative is arranged chiastically, with Eliyyahu’s ascent at the center, but with Elisha prominent on either side. The reader is thus assured (along with Elisha’s immediate performing of Eliyyahu-like miracles) that the younger man will be the worthy successor to the older one. This is further supported by the final episode, where the prophet brings down a terrible curse on his young tormentors, parallel to what Eliyyahu had done to King Ahazyahu’s soldiers. Burnett has suggested that the traditional understanding of the taunters as little children may well be wrong, sadly for artists over the centuries; instead, he argues, they are like the “youngsters” in I Kings 12, Rehav’am’s immature counselors, in this case probably young men attached to the royal or even religious establishment at the previously delegitimized shrine at Bet-El. In this reading, the taunt “Go up … Go up!” might also be reflecting Eliyyahu’s death, suggesting that Elisha should go the way of his master. So the episode demonstrates not only that the prophet possesses or at least represents powers that are not to be tampered with, but also sets him against the powers that be, a scenario that was central to the Eliyyahu stories and which occurs frequently in the Hebrew Bible."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 2",3,"Regardless of the age of the victims, however, already in Roman times Jews and Christians found this story troubling."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3",1,"Chapter 3. Israel and Moav: This is a classic Kings text, with international events—in this case, the political and military interactions of three territories—understood in the light of prophecy. As if three kings were not enough participants in the events, the prophet serves as mediator, and is (in v.11) immediately identified as Eliyyahu’s disciple. We are even given insight into the prophetic process, at least in one manifestation: it is induced by string music (v.15). As in the Eliyyahu stories, water also plays a role here, but with the striking twist that, through the illusion of the rising sun’s reflection, the water is taken to be blood."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 3",2,"It has long been noted that while the prophet predicts Moav’s defeat, this did not happen historically. Modern commentators therefore see in the chapter’s strange and ambiguous end an attempt to square the discrepancy."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4",1,"Chapter 4. Tales of Elisha: Elisha’s status is further enhanced by a series of stories, long and short, that typify miracle tales and directly parallel his master Eliyyahu’s deeds. The text starts with another food multiplication story (see I 17). The variation is that this time the food is to be used not to feed the hungry but to pay off a debt. The “revival of the son” account that follows (vv.8–37) includes the familiar motif of a childless couple and an unexpected birth. Like Yitzhak (Isaac) in Genesis, the son is immediately in peril, and in fact dies. The story here is a much fuller one than the parallel episode involving Eliyyahu in I Kings 17; we get a sense of extended interaction between the woman and the prophet, and the addition of his servant (who, somewhat unexpectedly, is named). This time, when the child is brought back to life, there is no need for the woman to verbally confirm that Elisha is a man of God, for that, by now, is obvious to characters and readers alike. Amid the human interactions, however, it should not be forgotten that Elisha, through his life-giving actions in this story, continues the polemic against Baal that had begun with the tales of his master (Sweeney 2007)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4",2,"Returning to the theme of food, the next story (vv.38–41) utilizes a motif found previously with Moshe (Exod. 16:22–26) and Elisha himself (2:19–22), with the variation that here it is stew which is “healed,” whereas previously it had been naturally occurring water."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4",3,"As usual, the different episodes are not strung together randomly. As Fishbane notes, they are linked by means of props, personae, and the child and by actions: shutting the door and the fulfillment of the prophet’s request, “What can I/we do for you?” He also points out a series of untranslatable puns, such as <i>mi-neshei</i> (“from the wives”) and <i>ha-nosheh</i> (“a creditor”) in v.1. All this is evidence of possible oral folk composition, and the chapter simultaneously presents aspects of what scholars term “popular religion,” such as the consulting of a holy man on matters of bodily or economic well-being."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 4",4,"The chapter ends much as it began, with another account of “stretching” food, this time to feed not only a family but a large group."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5",1,"Chapter 5. Elisha and Naaman: The Bible revels in stories in which a foreigner acknowledges or comes to acknowledge the God of Israel (for example, Bil’am [Balaam] in Num. 22–24 and Rahav in Josh. 2:6), and the present chapter is another example. Elisha’s initial motive in curing Naaman’s disease is “that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel” (v.8), but here, as elsewhere in these stories, recognizing the prophet’s power is basically the same as acknowledging God’s, as Naaman confirms in vv.15 and 17."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 5",2,"The second part of the story, in which Elisha’s servant Gehazi attempts to obtain for himself Naaman’s present of gratitude, which the prophet had refused, again demonstrates Elisha’s power. The prophet somehow knows what Gehazi has done, despite the latter’s denial, and the disease that had been removed from Naaman now cleaves to Gehazi—not temporarily, as is usual in the Bible (see Lev. 13), but, ominously, “for the ages,” down through the family line."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7",1,"Chapters 6–7. More Elisha Tales; Israel and Aram: The text continues with the usual pattern of a combination of long and short episodes (Cohn 2000). In the first, Elisha solves a mundane problem, the loss of an ax head in the river, by means of what feels like magic—throwing something (in this case, a piece of wood) into the water."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7",2,"In the next, longer episode, the miraculous becomes more full-blown, with Elisha able to divine the king of Aram’s private conversations, and subsequently his revealing, in v.17, a mountain “full of horses and chariots of fire.” We are reminded, of course, of Eliyyahu’s end, but equally significant is the image of the prophet as one who, countering the armies of nations, can summon up an army of his own. In fact, all throughout the Elisha cycle, the stories, which are ostensibly about kings, tend to magnify the prophet’s role (see Cohn 2000)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7",3,"V.24 introduces a more complex narrative, which ominously introduces a note of familial cannibalism in the midst of a siege. The king of Israel reacts by threatening the life of Elisha, who had previously advised him on military matters concerning Aram. Through a long story within a story, a strange tale of four diseased men and the empty camp of Aram, God saves Israel, and the king’s officer, who had doubted Elisha’s promise of relief, is trampled in the rush for food by the townspeople of the besieged Shomeron. Once again, things happen “as the man of God had spoken” (7:17)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, Chapters 6–7",4,"All of the above stories are visually vivid (as Cohn 2000 points out, both “seeing” and blindness are prominent), and one can easily imagine them as subjects in classical art, as indeed some of them have been. I can only fantasize about what Pieter Brueghel the Elder, painter of the memorable <i>Parable of the Blind</i>, might have done with the incident concerning the men stricken with <i>tzaraat</i> (7:3–10)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8",1,"Chapter 8. Elisha, Past and Present; On the Regional Stage: The opening of this chapter is a summing up, “as if the prophet were already dead” (Cohn 2000). Elisha’s act of reviving the child in Chap. 4 is recalled, and then the mother shows up; the king of Israel and the servant Gehazi, who previously had been vilified, here appear in a positive light: Gehazi is truthful, while the king carries out proper justice for the mother."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8",2,"With v.7 the scene shifts to Aram and another sick king. While Elisha seems to be lying to the king about his recovery (he tells Hazael that the monarch will, in fact, die), Cohn (2000) notes that Ben-Hadad asks for Elisha’s own opinion and does not make inquiry through the proper oracular channels. He also points out the way in which the story shows how Elisha’s wide influence is not confined to Israel alone. Additionally, Elisha’s anointing of Hazael foreshadows the rise of Yehu in the next chapter."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8",3,"V.20 introduces an important historical note. The Edomites, inhabiting the territory east of the Negev, now achieve independence from Judah (see Gen. 27:40 for the patriarch Yitzhak’s prophecy regarding these events). This is a serious blow to Judah’s control of southern trade."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 8",4,"A last point, of considerable significance, is the lineage of King Ahazyahu of Judah, who makes his appearance in v.25. His mother, Atalyahu, is the granddaughter of King Omri of Israel. Thus, as Sweeney (2007) notes, every Davidic king from this point forward will also be a descendant of the house of Omri. While this might be diplomatically savvy, from the text’s point of view it is yet another fact pointing toward the inevitable fall of both houses."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9",1,"Chapter 9. Yeku’s Coup: A memorable and bloody account of how Ah’av’s son and wife meet their deaths, this chapter introduces the figure of Yehu, who carries out divine vengeance on the House of Ah’av for its crimes. Both of the deaths are gruesome in their details (note the similarity between Ah’av’s demise in a chariot and his son’s death). While Homer routinely describes such matters in cinematic detail, the Bible is usually reticent, unless it is trying to make a point, as here, in “a tale of conspiracy, deception, irony, and murder …” (Cohn 2000). The greatest irony is the repetition of the word shalom (vv.17–19, 22), here rendered “peace,” in a story that is shot through with violence. By the end, Eliyyahu and Navot’s vineyard are recalled, and the double crime of that story in I Kings 21 is well on the way to being expiated."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9",2,"Yehu dominates Chaps. 9 and 10. His personality (which centers on his zeal for Y<small>HWH</small>) is hinted at by his driving a chariot “like-a-madman” (9:20). Unlike many northern kings, he establishes a dynasty which lasts for several generations. But the text also notes (10:29 and 31) how he does not remove Yorov’am’s golden calves, and thus the Bible’s final judgment on him is decidedly mixed."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 9",3,"A curious historical note is sounded in this chapter. V.15 introduces a certain Yonadav son of Rekhav. This family, known to scholars as Rechabites, seem to have constituted a separatist group that lived in a strict religious manner and so allied themselves with the anti-Ah’av faction headed by Yehu."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 10",1,"Chapter 10. Yehu Consolidates Power: Whereas the last chapter described individual deaths in the House of Ah’av, this one moves to not one but three large-scale killings. The triple massacre involves a good deal of deception, and implicates both soldiers and the general population. Given that the dead are the heirs to Ah’av and are Baal-worshippers, it is not surprising that Yehu, whose name mimics God’s own (YHWH), is rated positively as a king by the text. Yet the chapter closes with some reservations about him, namely, that he is not guiltless of the sins of Yorov’am. In fact, Yehu is less a heroic figure and more a vehicle for divine punishment of those judged by the Bible to be wrongdoers. Even though they are set in a ruthless age, the accounts of his violent and underhanded behavior might well have caused discomfort among ancient readers as they do among modern ones."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 11",1,"Chapter 11. The Orderly Coup in Judah: In contrast to the last few chapters, the change of rule in Judah that now takes place occurs without extensive violence. Indeed, the text emphasizes protection more than killing: the royal child Yoash is hidden in a bedroom with his nurse, and guard details are placed around him; the wicked Atalya is escorted into the palace to her doom in an orderly fashion; and the young king is brought down from the Temple to the palace, to take his place on the throne. Notably, from v.14 through v.20, “the House of YHWH” and “the House of the King” repeat, eight and four times, respectively; the single occurrence of “the House of Baal” serves to herald its destruction."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12",1,"Chapter 12. Yehoash and the Temple: After two chapters in which the tearing down of Baal’s temple and altars figured prominently, the description of the long reign of Yoash/Yehoash, who in fact grows up in the Temple, is limited mainly to what he did regarding the “House of YHWH” in Jerusalem. The leisurely description of the repairs there, and how money was raised for them, is a welcome contrast to the bloody changes of government that have recently characterized the text. As Zevit (2004) notes, income from good deeds goes to the repair, while that from guilt, etc., is given to the priests."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 12",2,"Two ironies spring out at the reader at the end of the chapter: after fifteen occurrences of the word “silver” in eleven verses, holy vessels and gold are quickly given over to the king of Aram, to avert an attack on Jerusalem. And after all the care that the king has lovingly lavished on the Temple’s repair, which would seem to make him deserve only praise and long life, Yehoash is assassinated."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13",1,"Chapter 13. Northern Kings; The Death of Elisha: The reigns of two “evil” northern kings lead up to the death of Elisha. The first, Yehoahaz, is notable for entreating YHWH (v.4), with the result that God sends an unnamed “deliverer”—phraseology that recalls Judges (Cogan/Tadmor). The second king, Yehoash, has his sixteen-year reign compressed into four verses, yet another example of the approach to history writing taken in the book of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13",2,"Elisha’s final act, while not as memorable as his predecessor’s, is striking nevertheless. The prophet, on his sickbed, has the king shoot an arrow through the window, and then exhorts him to strike the ground with more arrows. When the king stops at three blows, the prophet expresses his disappointment and prophesies that Israel will now not be able to defeat Aram decisively (although Yehoash is able to recover some Israelite territory). Thus ends Elisha’s career, with his powers undiminished, still affecting the course of international affairs."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 13",3,"Integrated into this account is a tiny, two-verse story about Elisha’s grave that gives further evidence of his involvement in the miraculous, even after his death. It recounts how his bones resurrect a dead man who is in the process of being buried. This is the kind of motif that we find in world folklore but which is fairly uncommon in the Hebrew Bible. Such a typical saint story would have been unthinkable regarding Moshe, but, as we have seen, the Elisha (and Eliyyahu) narratives preserve a kind of folk religion in which almost anything can happen, especially as it relates to life and death."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 14",1,"Chapter 14. Kings North and South I: We begin a sequence of kings with the Judahite Amatzyahu, who is judged rather favorably by the writers. Unlike Yehu, he is careful to observe the law, even in the midst of taking vengeance. On the other hand, he unsuccessfully defies Yehoash of Israel, and the result is another despoiling of the Temple. One cannot help feeling that a process is at work that will lead to disaster by the book’s end."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 14",2,"In the midst of such foreboding, a strong king (Yorov’am II) comes to the throne of the north. Despite his bad rating, for the usual reasons, it is noted that he “restored the border of Israel” (v.25)—a recollection implying an earlier chronicle as a source text for the writers here, one that is not as harsh on his forty-twoyear reign as we normally get in this book (Cogan/Tadmor). Once again, God takes pity on the Israelites, promising to let them survive. Yet we are just a few chapters from the fall of this Northern Kingdom."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 15",1,"Chapter 15. Kings North and South II: In this remarkable chapter, eight separate reigns are subsumed. But they are constructed with the book of Kings’ standard building blocks: a king’s illness, a conspiracy and several assassinations, bloody warfare, tribute paid in silver to Assyria, and an exile of Israelite townspeople. As is typical, the northern kings are judged as evil and the southerners as good, except for the latter’s failure to destroy the local sanctuaries."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 15",2,"Equally notable is the sudden appearance, in v.29, of the premier power of the ancient Near East at the time, Assyria. Although Kings has thus far ignored the growing strength of the Assyrian Empire, it will break out in full force in the chapters to come. Some background is thus in order."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 15",3,"Throughout a good part of the period covered in Kings, Assyria, situated around the Tigris River in the northern part of Mesopotamia, today’s Iraq, was the first of the great ancient empires to dominate Israel after Egypt some centuries before. By the ninth century they had extended their reach westward to the Mediterranean, and in the ensuing centuries one can speak of “Neo-Assyria,” which for the first time established an empire that encompassed most of the Middle East. Its scope has been revealed by modern archaeological exploration, which has turned up extensive written documents and fine examples of monumental architecture as well, including some memorable pieces currently in the British Museum, such as the large “cherubim” (winged sphinxes) that guarded the palace at Nineveh, and the moving reliefs depicting the conquest of the Judean city of Lachish. These sources convey a vivid picture of both splendor and warfare: elaborate portraits of kings on their thrones, surrounded by gods, servants, and subject kings; scenes of royal hunting of lions; soldiers with battering rams and siege ladders. In all of these, distinctive rectangular curly beards appear, along with the pointed helmets that struck dread throughout the ancient Near East."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 15",4,"Assyrian war policy included two memorable features, the impaling of captured peoples on tall stakes (as illustrated in the Lachish reliefs) and the deportation of subject populations, sometimes replacing them with others (as in II Kings 17). The former may have been done to set an example to the constantly rebelling provinces under Assyria’s domination, while the latter would have both depleted the local leadership and talent and supplied Assyria herself with new blood for administrative and commercial purposes."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 15",5,"Certainly the daily political life of the Israelites was profoundly affected by the Assyrian threat, but that threat also had long-term cultural influences. Assyria’s destruction of the Northern Kingdom terrified the south, but probably also effected the fleeing of northern refugees, who may well have brought with them texts and traditions that were later incorporated into the Bible. In addition, the language and concepts used in Assyrian inscriptions and treaties appear to have been mimicked, or rather co-opted, by biblical writers in texts such as Deuteronomy, Kings, and Isaiah. So, in a very real sense, eighth-century Assyria had a major if indirect hand in the creation of the Hebrew Bible."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 16",1,"Chapter 16. Ahaz and Assyria: From the breakneck chronological speed of the previous chapter, the text now slows down to concentrate on an “evil” Judean king, Ahaz. His crimes consist not only of the oft-repeated act of allowing the people to worship at the local shrines, but also of child sacrifice. In addition, he appeals to the king of Assyria for military help against Aram, cementing his request with a gift/bribe of treasures from the Temple. As a result of the despoiling, which this time is self-imposed, Ahaz comes to build an Assyrian-style altar—that is, he does Assyrian-like renovations in Jerusalem—on which the text spends more time than on any other aspect of his sixteen-year reign."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17",1,"Chapter 17. First Catastrophe: The Fall of Israel: Readers who are accustomed to the detailed battle scenes in Homer and elsewhere will be disappointed by the long-awaited account of Israel’s destruction, which takes up a mere handful of words in two verses. While the Assyrian relief commemorating the somewhat later destruction of the Judean city of Lachish lays out the contemporary particulars of siege, execution, and exile in gripping and poignant artistic terms, the biblical writers in our chapter are content to describe Israel’s demise, which had such a major influence on biblical thinking, in the sparsest way possible."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17",2,"The reason for this laconic approach becomes clear beginning in v.7: “So it was, / because …,” which then continues at great length, first, to recall God’s warnings to Israel through the prophets, and then, to recount through a long string of verbs how the people turned away from the right path into idolatry. Only in v.18 does the text finally inject God’s reaction, as it were. Vv.21–23 provide an additional interpretation of the downfall, citing Yorov’am’s primal sin of idolatry."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17",3,"Beginning in v.24, we are additionally told how, in consonance with what we now know of Assyrian practice, the conquerors place some of their own citizens in the vanquished land. When the new settlers are attacked by lions, which the Bible understands as punishment for their not acknowledging Y<small>HWH</small>, they are given an exiled priest to teach them how to worship him. But the result, ranging far from idealized Israelite practice, is syncretism, a combination of religions. In this section, which again takes up much more textual space than the fall of Israel itself, the key word is “awe”; that is, the settlers are supposed to worship God correctly, but do not, “until this day” (v.41). So from the perspective of a southern writer, the north has lost its identity, and thus is lost to history. In fact, the northern exiles blended into the Assyrian population, and for all practical purposes disappeared. The romantic notion of the “Ten Lost Tribes,” which envisioned them in distant lands awaiting discovery by later explorers, has no historical currency, despite its being a legend beloved in the Western world. On the other hand, those northerners who fled in the opposite direction, into Judah, may have brought with them their own traditions about Israel’s past, and this contribution to the process of the Bible’s development is of the greatest significance. It may even have been the beginning of the long sequence of adaptation which ultimately led to the canonization, the final form, of the text."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 17",4,"This chapter gives evidence of a complex history, mixing condemnations of both the north and the south, and inserting several verses (18b–21) that bring the chapter up to date with the Babylonian Exile (see Brettler 1995 for a full analysis). As we have seen elsewhere in Kings and indeed throughout Deuteronomistic History (DH), such a practice is not unusual, and supports the idea of an evolving biblical text that is a testimony to Israel’s creative memory."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18",1,"Chapter 18. Hizkiyyahu: Reform and Revolt: As the text shifts for its remaining eight chapters to the Southern Kingdom, Judah, three will now be devoted to one king. Hizkiyyahu (Hezekiah) is lauded above all his predecessors, and we are immediately told why: he destroys the pagan sanctuaries and their attendant cult objects. Most of Chap. 18, however, is taken up with the problem of the threat from Assyria. The king is forced to strip more wealth from the Temple, but that does not prevent King Sanheriv (Sennacherib) of Assyria from sending a large army to menace Jerusalem."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18",2,"What ensues is one of the Bible’s most memorable scenes, which is retold beginning in Isa. 36, with Chap. 37 paralleling our Chap. 19. High Assyrian officials, speaking within earshot of the city walls, taunt the Jerusalem delegation, haughtily suggesting that Y<small>HWH</small> himself has commissioned them to come against the city, and that they have overcome many other gods in their military sweep through that part of the world. The tension in their speech, outside of its sarcasm and constant insulting of Y<small>HWH</small>, arises from the fact that it is delivered in “Judean,” that is, Hebrew, and thus can be understood by the onlooking soldiers who are seemingly destined to die in the siege. As for the people’s silence, while it is mandated by Hizkiyyahu (v.36), it is a hollow one, and has more dismay than defiance in it."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 18",3,"Cohn likens the scene to a showdown in a Western movie, and notes how, by mentioning names and titles of the participants, the writer renders the action more serious and more vivid. Its historicity is impossible to verify, but its use of typical Assyrian diplomatic language (Sweeney 2007) makes it realistic. More important, as explicated by Machinist (2000), the speech at first poses a serious challenge to Israelite theology, perhaps voicelessly joined by those Judeans who must have urged capitulation; but this makes the end result in the next chapter—the precipitous withdrawal of the Assyrian army—all the more proof of Y<small>HWH</small>’s supreme power over earthly empires."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19",1,"Chapter 19. Jerusalem Saved: From the low points at the beginning of the chapter, where Hizkiyyahu clothes himself in sackcloth (the garment of mourning) and the text repeats at least part of Assyria’s taunting (vv.10–13), the audience is assured in just two verses (6–7) that not only will the mighty conqueror fail in his designs, but he himself will also fall. It is the prophet Yesha’yahu (Isaiah) who makes this confident pronouncement, and his appearance provides the perfect counter to military force. Here, as so often in the book of Kings, politics is overcome by the divine Word."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 19",2,"Literarily, this is accomplished in two passages. First comes Hizkiyyahu’s heartfelt prayer (vv.15–19), mimicking an old cuneiform model (Hallo/Simpson). It ends with the familiar theme of universal acknowledgment of Y<small>HWH</small>. More pointed is Yesha’yahu’s pronouncement of the word of Y<small>HWH</small>, beginning in v.21. Breaking into poetry, while unusual in Kings, is perfectly in keeping with the Bible’s practice of inserting verse at climactic moments (see, for instance, Exod. 15 and I Sam. 2). Picking up on the “mocking” motif (v.16), the prophet sends the Assyrian king packing. Significantly, he opens with the ironic reversal of an image that will be familiar a bit later in the Bible. “The Nubile Daughter of Zion” (Jerusalem), so often an object of pity and derision in the literature that postdates the destruction of Jerusalem, here gets to do a little deriding of her own. In other imagery, the poem alternates visions of agricultural growth and plenty with ones of destruction. Thus the rescue of Jerusalem is artistically adorned, as it were, and the theological challenge has been overturned (Machinist 2000)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 20",1,"Chapter 20. Hizkiyyahu and the Prophet Yesha’yahu: In a twist from what by now seems like a well-worn motif, a sick king is given a reprieve. As Hizkiyyahu’s praying worked previously, so it does here as well. The chapter abounds in interesting images: on the positive side, the king is shown a sundial going backward, confirming that his disease has indeed been reversed, while negatively, Hizkiyyahu’s displaying of Jerusalem’s treasures is used by the prophet to remind the king (and the reader) that within a few generations, treasures and princes alike will be exiled to Babylon. So the clock cannot be turned back after all."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 20",2,"Hizkiyyahu’s reign comes to an end with the barest of mentions of what modern historians of Jerusalem remember him for: the crucial step of making the city’s water supply from the Gihon Spring more accessible. Not cited at all is what is of equal or greater importance: the considerable expansion of the city to the so-called Western Hill (today’s Jewish and Armenian Quarters of the Old City). From this period of history on, at the very least, Jerusalem is a city of consequence."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21",1,"Chapter 21. Evil Kings: Menashe and Amon: The long reign of Menashe is the last straw in YHWH’s toleration of Judah’s idolatry. We know what is to come immediately, as the usual formula, “he did what was evil in the eyes of YHWH,” is amplified by the ominous phrase “according to the abominations of [the Canaanites].” From v.12 on, a sentence of doom is pronounced over Jerusalem and Judah."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 21",2,"Of Menashe’s successor Amon, it is only necessary for the text to note, first, how he continues in his father’s idolatrous footsteps, and second, how both he and those who assassinate him are done away with. His death may have come at the hands of an anti-Assyrian faction who were themselves killed by the “Landed People.” Their actions, which resulted in installing his eight-year-old son Yoshiyyahu on the throne, may have held off the Assyrians."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 22",1,"Chapter 22. Yoshiyyahu’s Accession; The Finding of the Scroll: Having been told a few chapters previously about how Judah’s greatest king since the United Monarchy was Hizkiyyahu, the text introduces a new hero, Yoshiyyahu, another one who “did what was good in the eyes of YHWH,” and innocuously goes on to describe some Temple repairs and the payment for them, a motif which we encountered earlier. In the midst of the repairs, however, a “Record of the Instruction” is found. When it is read before the king, he breaks down, realizing that this divine Instruction, whatever its exact identity, has not been heeded for generations. In typical Kings fashion, this is confirmed by prophetic speech, this time from a female member of the profession (Hulda), and the news is not good: Judah and Jerusalem will indeed eventually fall, and Yoshiyyahu’s only consolation is that he himself will not live to see it. Similar thoughts had been addressed to Hizkiyyahu in 20:16–18."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 22",2,"It has long been asserted that the newly found scroll is the book of Deuteronomy, or at least its core. Among that book’s major goals, after all, are the extirpation of idolatry and the centralization of the sacrificial cult in Jerusalem, and the language applied to Yoshiyyahu is a reprise of Deuteronomic phrases (see 23:25 below). Further, the discovery fits a known pattern in the ancient world, where a king’s desire to promulgate new laws is often accompanied by the publication of an authoritative document. If that scroll is represented as being of hoary lineage, as in this case, so much the better."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 22",3,"Amid the dramatic scenario of the newly found scroll and national revival, an odd note can be heard. Three of Yoshiyyahu’s court officials have names of animals that live in concealed areas: the rock badger (<i>shafan</i>), the mouse (<i>’akhbor</i>), and the mole (<i>hulda</i>). This is possibly a coincidence, but it may also be slyly purposeful in a narrative that describes the unearthing of a long-lost document in the bowels of the Temple. I am not prepared, however, to declare this chapter the Bible’s version of <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23",1,"Chapter 23. Yoshiyyahu’s Reform; His Death: After a great public ceremony in vv.1–3, in which, as Mann notes, the word “all” is used for emphasis, and during which the newly found document, now significantly called the “Record of the Covenant,” is read before the people, the text turns (v.4) to a rapid-fire and detailed recounting of the religious purge initiated by Yoshiyyahu. There is no dialogue to interrupt the violence or to oppose the king’s actions, and the verbs used are in the singular, as if to personalize the action (Cohn 2000)."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23",2,"Except for the burial site of the prophet who had foretold the purge all the way back in I Kings 13:2–3, and that of another prophet, everything not tied to Y<small>HWH</small> is not only physically destroyed but rendered ritually polluted as well. One positive act is the re-observance of the Passover offering, which the text portrays as having been neglected for centuries. Something similar had taken place in Chap. 5 of Joshua, as an affirmation of the invaders’ peoplehood. Here too it is a fitting symbol of a utopian attempt to reorder society."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 23",3,"Despite the superlatives applied to Yoshiyyahu, surpassing the description of Hizkiyyahu a century earlier, the decree against the Southern Kingdom is not canceled, and the king himself is overtaken by the events of international politics. On a mission northward to stop Egyptian aid to Assyria, he is killed by the Pharaoh; interestingly, the exact details are not given. So dies the last hope of Judah. His great reform as described by the text appears as too little, too late. The reign of his son Yehoahaz lasts for only three months, and is succeeded by an Egyptianappointed puppet king, Yehoyakim. Both are rated by the text as “evil.”"
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24",1,"Chapter 24. The First Exile: All of a sudden a new dominant power, Babylon, appears in the text. The Bible is chiefly interested in how several Judean rebellions bring down the wrath of the Babylonian king, Nevukhadnetzar, upon the Southern Kingdom, leading to disaster. The destruction of Jerusalem takes place in two stages in the two remaining chapters. The first is triggered by a revolt against Babylon by Yoshiyyahu’s son Yehoyakim; this is followed by Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite attacks (attributed, however, not to the king’s wrongdoings but to those of Menashe, decades earlier). During Yehoyakhin’s brief reign, the Babylonians themselves invade. The resulting exile, dated to 597 B.C.E., involves the remaining Temple treasures and the military and elite of the country. Those left, according to the text, are simply the poor and the new puppet king, Yehoyakhin’s uncle Tzidkiyyahu."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24",2,"Amid the narratives of destruction, it will be useful for the reader to have a sense of who the Babylonians were. By the mid-seventh century, Assyria began to falter. Several decades later, civil war provided the opportunity for the Neo- Babylonians to throw off the Assyrian yoke, and in 612, Nineveh, the capital, was sacked."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24",3,"Based around the Euphrates in southern Mesopotamia, Babylonia arose on a hoary foundation of language (Sumerian and Akkadian), law, literature, and architecture. By the ninth century, the Chaldeans (anachronistically mentioned in Gen. 11:31) had taken over the area, although within a century, the Assyrians to the north conquered Babylonia and established a dual monarchy which lasted for a long period. With the fall of Nineveh, the Neo-Babylonian Empire came to dominate the Middle East for the next seven decades, until the rise of Persia."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24",4,"The accomplishments of Babylonian civilization were considerable. Nebuchadnezzar built the fabulous Hanging Gardens in his capital city. The country abounded in ziggurats, the pyramid-shaped temples whose ruins still dot the Iraqi landscape. As befitted an old civilization, the Babylonians made signal advances in astronomy, astrology, and mathematics, and already possessed an advanced irrigation system. They also contributed or transmitted some of the world’s earliest surviving great literature, including the immortal Epic of Gilgamesh."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 24",5,"In the Hebrew Bible, all this is barely hinted at, but many biblical narratives, especially those that appear early on (such as aspects of the Creation, Flood, and Tower of Babel stories in the first section of Genesis), may well be reacting to, or against, some of its ideas and institutions. There may even be an element of parody in some of these stories. Once again, then, the Bible comes across as a kind of counter-text, a text which, as the prophet Jeremiah himself was characterized, was “appointed against nations and kingdoms, / to uproot and to pull down” (Jer. 1:10), despite the seeming insignificance of ancient Israel in the context of the region."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25",1,"Chapter 25. Final Catastrophe: The Fall of Judah: As in Chap. 17, the account of the final battle here is extraordinarily brief; the narrator clearly has little interest in military details. More central, once the city wall is breached, are the capture and treatment of Tzidkiyyahu, the king, and the destruction of the Temple. After, once again, a brief description of the fate of the buildings and people of Jerusalem, the text becomes expansive, dwelling longingly (and not surprisingly) on the destroyed or despoiled vessels and columns of the Temple."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25",2,"Some key political details remain. The Babylonians appoint a governor, ironically named Gedalyahu (“God has done great things”), to administer what is left of Judah. He counsels cooperation with the conquerors, but is assassinated by those Judahites who are still in a rebellious frame of mind."
"The Early Prophets, Ii Kings, 25",3,"The entire narrative of Kings then fast-forwards and comes to an end (vv.27–30) with what amounts to an extended note, precisely dated in the spring of 561 <small>B.C.E.</small>, describing the treatment of the surviving Davidic king, Yehoyakhin, who had been exiled thirty-six years before. The captive king’s fate—he is taken out of prison and allowed to eat at the Babylonian king’s table for the rest of his days—could be read in two ways: either he is highly favored in his limited circumstances (his throne is “set above the thrones of the [other] kings” who have been taken to Babylon), thus providing a shred of hope for the exiles, or the text is reaffirming that his power is quite limited, since he is supported not by his own subjects but at the whim of the king of Babylon. This subdued, even depressing ending leaves us in a kind of limbo; as McKenzie (2010) puts it, both Kings and the DH overall are “strangely silent about the future.” In any event, with the end of the book, Israel embarks on centuries of control by others or other forces (Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans), which would lead ultimately to both a wider exile and the creation of the Hebrew Bible in its final form."
