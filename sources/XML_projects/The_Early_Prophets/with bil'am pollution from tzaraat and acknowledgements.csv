"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 1",Genesis 1-50
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 2","T<small>HE TEXT OF</small> G<small>ENESIS SEEMS TO SPEAK WITH MANY VOICES</small>. F<small>OR A BOOK WHOSE BASIC</small> arrangement is chronological, tracing the history of a single family, it exhibits a good deal of discontinuity on the surface. Here time flows uniformly, there it takes startling jumps; fragments are followed by more or less full-blown tales; genres alternate, from mythic to genealogical to folkloristic. In addition, scholars often portray Genesis as a collection of historically diverse materials that were compiled by scribes for whom deviating from received tradition was anathema. Hence the repetitions, the inconsistencies, and the irregular pacing."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 3","Is Genesis then, at best, a collection of stories related to the origins of Israel, with most of its seams still showing? Such an assessment does not do justice to what must have been a complex process of addition and growth or to the final product. An overview of the book does produce a certain scheme; at some point in the text’s history a coherent picture must have begun to emerge from the disparate materials handed down. For the modern reader, utilizing the Buber-Rosenzweig method of focusing on repeating words and key themes as the text presents them may make it possible to generalize about the organization of the book and also to speculate on its overall intent in the form in which it has come down to us."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 4","On its most obvious level Genesis is a book about origins. It seeks to link the origin of the people of Israel with that of the world, relating in the process how various human characteristics and institutions arose."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 5","On the surface this parallels much of ancient literature and folklore. All peoples are interested in their own beginnings, picturing them in a way which validates their present existence. Genesis, however, is different in that, like the rest of the Torah, it downplays the heroic element of the people’s origins and in its place stresses God’s role in them. Moreover the one great omission—the origin of God—establishes from the beginning a unique basis for a tribal chronicle. From Genesis and subsequent books we learn primarily about God’s relationship to the people and what he expects of them; almost everything else is subordinated to this purpose."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 6",Preliminarily one can speak of at least seven major themes whose recurrence establishes their importance in the book:
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 7","1. <i>Origins:</i> Of the world, of humanity, and of the people of Israel.<br>2. <i>Order/Meaning in History:</i> By means of stylized or patterned chronology—reliance on certain round numbers such as 3, 7, and 40—it is suggested that human events are not random but somehow planned.<br>3. <i>Blessing:</i> From creation onward God bestows blessings on his creatures in general and on the fathers and mothers of Israel in particular.<br>4. <i>Covenant:</i> God concludes agreements with human beings.<br>5. <i>God Punishes Evildoing:</i> God is provoked to anger not by his capriciousness but by human failure to uphold justice and morality.<br>6. <i>Sibling Conflict, with the Younger Usually Emerging the Victor:</i> The order of nature (primacy of the firstborn) is overturned, demonstrating that God, not nature, is the ruling principle in human affairs.<br>7. <i>Testing:</i> God tests those who are to carry forth his mission; the result is the development of moral character."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 8","Superseding these important themes, which occur throughout the Bible in various forms, is the dominant one of <i>continuity</i>, represented by the unifying word in Genesis <i>toledot</i> (“begettings”). The word appears eleven times, often accompanied by long genealogical lists. The names may deflect attention from what is central to Genesis. The major thrust of the book would seem to be toward human fecundity, following the early divine command to “bear fruit and be many” (1:28), and pointing toward the eventual fecundity of the people of Israel (which will only be realized in the book of Exodus). Such an emphasis seems appropriate in a book about origins."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 9","Ironically, however, the undercurrent in Genesis points not to life and its continuation, but rather to its threatened extinction. In story after story the protagonist, his people, and occasionally the entire world are threatened. In at least one case (Avraham) a perfectly legal and natural solution is found—the birth of Yishmael as his heir—only to be rejected by God in favor of a more difficult one: a son born to an elderly woman."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 10","It is clear that the stress on continuity and discontinuity has one purpose: to make clear that God is in control of history. Human fertility and continuity in history come not from magical rites or from the arbitrary decisions of the gods, but from a God who bases his rule on justice. Nature disappears as a ruling factor in human affairs, replaced by a principle of morality which is unshakable precisely because it comes from a God who is beyond the rules of nature."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 11","But the result is a book which abounds in tension. From the beginnings of human history (Chap. 4) we encounter contradictions and opposites, whether on a small scale (fertility and barrenness) or a large one (promise and delayed fulfillment). Nowhere is this so clear as in the dramatic high point of the book, Chap. 22. As Avraham stands with knife upraised, the entire enterprise of Genesis hangs in the balance. But the entire book is replete with such tensions and continuity-threatening situations. There are barren wives, brothers vowing to kill brothers, cities and even a world being destroyed by an angry God. The main characters of Genesis thus emerge as survivors, above all else. Noah sets the pattern, but he is merely the first, and too passive an example. The Patriarchs must brave hostile foreigners, bitter intrafamily struggles, and long wanderings before they can find peace."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 12","While by the end of the book many of the tensions have been resolved, one conspicuously has not: God’s promise of the land of Canaan. As the book ends, “in Egypt,” we are left to ponder how this God, who keeps his promises to “those who love him” (Ex. 20:6), will bring the people back to their land—a land inhabited by someone else and in which the Children of Israel own only a burial site. Yet despite the tension, we may assume from the experiences of the Patriarchs that God will indeed “take account of” the Israelites (50:24), that he will take whatever ill has been planned against them and “plan-it-over for good” (50:20)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 13","A word should also be said here about hero traditions. In the great epics of the ancient world the hero often stands as a lonely figure. He must overcome obstacles, fight monsters, acquire helpers (whether women, “sidekicks,” or magic objects); and his triumph in the end signals man’s triumph over his archenemy, Death. Every battle won, every obstacle hurdled, is psychologically a victory for us, the audience, a cathartic release from our own frustrating battle against death."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 14","The Bible sees things rather differently. Death is also overcome, but not only by the individual’s struggle. It is rather through the covenant community, bound together by God’s laws and his promises, that the heroic vision is lived out. Despite the triumphs of the characters in Genesis, it is really in the book of Exodus that the great battle scenes (the plagues in Egypt, the Red Sea) and meetings with the divine (Mount Sinai) take place. And it is therefore God himself who is most properly the “hero” of these stories. No major character in Genesis achieves success without depending fully on God, and the standards that are held up to them are ultimately seen as God’s own, to be imitated by imperfect humankind."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 15","The book of Genesis falls naturally into four large sections. The first, usually termed the “Primeval History” (Chaps, 11–11), begins with creation and progresses through the early generations of humanity, ending in Mesopotamia. The second (Chaps. 12 through 25:18) is the cycle of stories concerning Avraham, the father of the people of Israel. Part III (Gen. 25:19 through Chap. 36) deals in the main with stories about his grandson Yaakov. The final section (Chaps. 37–50) is the tale of Yosef and of how the Children of Israel came to live in Egypt (thus paving the way for the book of Exodus)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 16","The following skeletal outline will lay out some of the interesting structural features of the book. There is an elemental symmetry that emerges from the four sections; further comments, especially about how the sections cohere, will be found in the explanatory material accompanying the text in this volume."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 45","There is of course great variety within this bare structure; each version of a motif has its own special characteristics and emphases. Yet the patterning observed above gives the book a general coherence, above and beyond differences. It also demonstrates a conscious hand at work, one concerned about the texture of the book as a whole and able, despite the possible rigidity of what had been handed down, to shape the received material into a plastic and breathing unity."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 46","Two general observations about Genesis will round out the picture here. First, as the book progresses there is a tendency for the style of the literature to become smoother. The abrupt changes and sometimes fragmentary nature of the material in Part I, and the vignettes built around Avraham’s life in Part II, give way to a greater coherence and concentration in Part III, and finally to a relatively flowing and psychologically complete narrative in Part IV Along with this, the characters in the latter half of the book seem to be more changeable and human, in contrast to Noah and Avraham, who often appear almost perfect models of piety."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure 47","Second, contact with God becomes less and less direct as Genesis moves on. Avraham’s dreams and visions seem a far cry from Adam’s conversations with God in the garden (although see Chap. 18); Yaakov’s encounters with God are less frequent than Avraham’s; and finally, Yosef never has a conversation with God, although he receives dream interpretations from him. This process of distancing may reflect an often-observed tendency in religions to think of primeval times as a “golden age” of closeness between gods and men, as contrasted to today (whenever one is writing), when humankind finds itself tragically distant from the divine and in need of communication."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History 1",Genesis 1-2
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History 2",T<small>HE COLLECTION OF STORIES WHICH FORMS PART I OF</small> G<small>ENESIS HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED</small> for a number of purposes:
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History 3","1. History is traced from the creation of the world, in a direct line, down to Avraham, father of the People of Israel. Through use of the leading-word <i>toledot</i>, “begettings,” we are meant to view him as the logical end point in God’s preliminary plan in history."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History 4","2. The nature of God, as he will appear throughout the Hebrew Bible, is firmly established. He is seen as a Creator who is beyond fate, nature, and sexuality; as an all-powerful orderer and giver of meaning to history; as a bestower of blessing to living creatures; as a giver of choice to human beings; as a just punisher of evil and, simultaneously, a merciful ruler; and as a maker of covenants. The one quality of God which does not unfold until the Patriarchal stories (Parts II-IV) is his shaping of human destiny through focusing on the People of Israel. It is portrayed as the logical outcome of the characteristics just mentioned."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History 5","3. It appears that the Mesopotamian origins of Israel are reflected in such narratives as the Creation, the Flood, and the Tower of Babel, and are transformed or repudiated in the biblical versions. What in the older culture appears arbitrary and chaotic has been changed in the Bible into stories that stress morality and order. Further, human beings in Genesis Chapters 1–11, despite their failure to five up to God’s expectations, are nevertheless considered capable of doing so, in contrast to the Mesopotamian view that humankind was created merely to be slaves to the gods."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History 6","4. Like virtually all other creation stories, Part I is concerned with the origin of the world and its institutions. Chapter 1 expounds on the origins of earth, sky, vegetation, animals, and human beings (as well as the Sabbath); Chapter 2, of sexuality, death, pain in childbirth, and work; Chapter 4, of sin, hatred, and murder, as well as of cities and crafts; Chapter 6, of giants; and Chapter 10, of nations (including the low status of the Canaanites) and languages."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History 7","In sum, Part I serves as a fitting Prologue, not only to Genesis but to the entire Bible. The reader’s chief task in interpreting it is to be able to determine the reason for the inclusion of any one section into the whole."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, God as Creator 1",Genesis 1:1-2:4
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, God as Creator 2","Three principal themes emerge from the great creation account with which Genesis opens. The first is the total and uncompromised power of God as creator; the second, the intrinsic order and balance of the created world; and the third, humankind’s key position in the scheme of creation. These themes are brought home as much by the form in which they are presented as by their actual mention."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, God as Creator 3","God (Heb. <i>elohim</i>, a generic term) is introduced into the narrative without any description of origins, sex, or limitations of power. As the only functioning character of the chapter, he occupies center stage. There is no opposition, no resistance to his acts of creation, which occur in perfect harmony with his express word."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, God as Creator 4","As a sign of both God’s total control and his intent, the world unfolds in symmetrical order. The division of God’s labor into six days, plus a seventh for rest, itself indicates a powerful meaningfulness at work, as well as providing the external structure for the narrative. Interpreters have tended to divide these into either three groups of two days or two groups of three, with always the same results: a balanced and harmonious whole. In addition, the number seven is significant (as it will be elsewhere in the Bible) as a symbol of perfection, not only in Israel but in the ancient world in general."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, God as Creator 5","The narrative uses several repeating words and phrases to both unify the story and underscore the theme of order. These include “God said,” “Let there be…,” “God saw that it was good,” “It was so,” and “There was setting, there was dawning. …”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, God as Creator 6",<img>
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, God as Creator 7","The text is so formed as to highlight the creation of humankind. Although in each previous day “God said” is the keynote, suggesting forethought as well as action, here (v.26) God fully spells out his intentions, as it were, thinking out loud. Humanity, created in the divine “image,” is to hold sway over the rest of creation. Only with the addition of humankind is God able to survey his newly formed world and to pronounce it “exceedingly good” (v.31)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, God as Creator 8","At least two motifs appear in this chapter which will become important later in Genesis. The three occurrences of “blessing” (1:22, 1:28, 2:3) point to a central idea in the Patriarchal stories. In addition the concept of order and its logical conclusion—that history makes sense—figures prominently in the familial histories of the book. This is accomplished largely by the meaningful use of numbers, as above."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, God as Creator 9","The entire account concludes (2:1–3) with a tightly structured poem. “God,” “the seventh day,” “work,” and “made” are mentioned three times, “finished,” “ceased,” and “all” twice; and “created” returns, echoing 1:1, to round out the whole creation narrative."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, God as Creator 10","The postscript (2:4a; some scholars align it with what follows in Chap. 2 instead) introduces the key structural phrase of Genesis, “These are the begettings.…” It may also indicate the polemical intent of the creation story. Rosenzweig understood the verse to contrast “begetting,” i.e., sexual creation as it occurs in non-Israelite myths, with the “true” creation."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, God as Creator 11","In that vein, a final word needs to be said about extrabiblical evidence. As has often been pointed out, Gen. I is unmistakably reacting against prevailing Near Eastern cosmogonies of the time. Most of the cultures surrounding ancient Israel had elaborate creation stories, highlighting the birth, sexuality, and violent uprisings of the gods. As we indicated at the outset, the concept of God presented here militates against such ideas, arguing chiefly out of omission and silence. (It should also be noted that in poetic books such as Isaiah, Job, and Psalms, a tradition about violent conflict at creation has been preserved.) The Genesis narrative has taken such old mythological motifs as battles with the primeval (female) waters or with sea monsters and eliminated or neutralized them. What remains is both utterly simple and radical in its time."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Garden and Expulsion 1",Genesis 2:4-3:24
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Garden and Expulsion 2","From the perspective of God in Chap. 1, we now switch to that of humankind (note how the opening phrase in 2:4, “earth and heaven,” reverses the order found in 1:1). This most famous of all Genesis stories contains an assortment of mythic elements and images which are common to human views of prehistory: the lush garden, four central rivers located (at least partially) in fabled lands, the mysterious trees anchoring the garden (and the world?), a primeval man and woman living in unashamed nakedness, an animal that talks, and a God who converses regularly and intimately with his creatures. The narrative presents itself, at least on the surface, as a story of origins. We are to learn the roots of human sexual feelings, of pain in childbirth, and how the anomalous snake (a land creature with no legs) came to assume its present form. Most strikingly, of course, the story seeks to explain the origin of the event most central to human consciousness: death."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Garden and Expulsion 3","The narrative unfolds through a series of contrasts: good and evil, life and death, heaven and earth, give and take, knowledge and ignorance, humans and animals, hiding and revealing. Some of these concepts appear literally as key words in the text. The characters also appear through contrasts: man as God’s image and as dust, woman as helper and hinderer, the snake as shrewd and (after the curse) lowly."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Garden and Expulsion 4","A further focus is provided by the echoing of the word “eat,” whose connotation changes from sustenance/bounty (2:9, 16) to prohibition (2:17) to misunderstanding (3:1–5) and disobedience (3:6, 11–13), and finally to curse (3:14, 17, 19). Such a flexible use of words sets up a rhythmic drama which, as much of Genesis, bears resemblance to poetry rather than to prose."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Garden and Expulsion 5","Part I of the story (Chap. 2) sets the stage in the garden, focusing on <i>Adam</i>, “Everyman” (see <i>Cambridge Bible Commentary</i>, Gen. I–II). God is here regularly called “Y<small>HWH</small>, God,” a rare designation which may suggest a preexpulsion view of the wholeness of God as well as of humankind. Man continues his status as “God’s image” (1:26–27), imitating the divine act of giving names (1:5, 8, 10). He is also nevertheless a creature of the dust, both at the beginning (2:7) and end (3:19) of the story."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Garden and Expulsion 6","The bridge to Part II (Chap. 3) is deftly accomplished by linking two identical­sounding words in the Hebrew, <i>arum</i> (here, “nude” and “shrewd”). The choice of the snake as the third character is typically ancient Near Eastern (it is so used in other stories about death and immortality, such as the <i>Gilgamesh Epic</i> from Mesopotamia). Some interpreters have seen sexual overtones in this choice as well. Yet a plain reading of the text need not overemphasize the snake, who disappears as a personality once the fatal fruit has been eaten."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Garden and Expulsion 7","The ending of the story has also raised questions of interpretation. Buber was among those who see in the act of expulsion from the garden a deed of mercy rather than one of fear or jealousy. Certainly a creature whose first act upon acquiring new “knowledge” is to cover himself up poses no threat to the Creator. The text, like its late successor, the book of Job, may be suggesting that in the human sphere, unlike the divine, knowledge and mortality are inextricably linked. This is a tragic realization, but it is also the world as human beings know it."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Garden and Expulsion 8","Although the specifics of this story are never again referred to in the Hebrew Bible, and are certainly not crucial for the rest of Genesis, one general theme <i>is</i> central to the Bible’s worldview. This is that rebellion against or disobedience toward God and his laws results in banishment/estrangement and, literally or figuratively, death. Thus from the beginning the element of <i>choice</i>, so much stressed by the Prophets later on, is seen as the major element in human existence."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Garden and Expulsion 9","All this said, it should be recognized that the garden story, like many biblical texts, has been the subject of endless interpretation. One line of thought takes the psychological point of view. The story resembles a vision of childhood and of the transition to the contradictions and pain of adolescence and adulthood. In every way—moral, sexual, and intellectual—Adam and Havva are like children, and their actions after partaking of the fruit seem like the actions of those who are unable to cope with newfound powers. The resolution of the story, banishment from the garden, suggests the tragic realization that human beings must make their way through the world with the knowledge of death and with great physical difficulty. At the same time the archetypal man and woman do not make the journey alone. They are provided with protection (clothing), given to them by the same God who punished them for their disobedience. We thus symbolically enter adulthood with the realization that being turned out of Paradise does not mean eternal rejection or hopelessness."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The First Brothers 1",Genesis 4:1-16
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The First Brothers 2","With the story of Kayin and Hevel the narrative points both forward and backward. For the first time the major Genesis themes of struggle and sibling hatred, and discontinuity between the generations, make their appearance. In addition the concept of <i>sin</i> is introduced (Rosenzweig), having not appeared by name previously."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The First Brothers 3","One may observe significant links to the garden story. Once again human beings are given a choice; once again disregarding the warning leads to death and estrangement from God; and once again the primal bond between humanity and the soil is ruptured. Chapter 3 is directly recalled by the use of specific wording: God echoes the curse he had put on the woman (3:16) in his warning to Kayin (4:7), and “Where is Hevel your brother?” (4:9) brings to mind “Where are you?” (3:9), which had been addressed to Kayin’s father."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The First Brothers 4","The text is punctuated by the use of “brother,” a meaningful seven times, as well as by changing connotations of the word “face” (Kayin, unable to bring about a lifting of his own face, becomes estranged from God’s). Repetition also helps to convey the harshness of Kayin’s punishment: he is exiled to the “land of Nod/Wandering” (v.16), for which we have been prepared by the “wavering and wandering” of verses 12 and 14."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The First Brothers 5","Although this story may well have originated as a tale of enmity between two ways of life (farmer and shepherd), or in another context, it has obviously been transformed into something far more disturbing and universal."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Line of Kayin 1",Genesis 4:17-26
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Line of Kayin 2","From whole stories the text turns to several brief accounts, some of which are clearly fragments. The first of these deals with origins: of cities, of certain crafts, and of worship. The former two are associated (perhaps negatively) with Kayin s line. The only personality in these texts about whom we learn anything is Lemekh—and his “saying” (vv.23–24) seems hopelessly obscure. Some interpreters have understood it as a challenge to God, and thus believe that it has been included here as an example of the wickedness typical of the generations that preceded the Flood."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Line of Kayin 3",The names of Adam and Havva’s son and grandson (vv.25–26) are sad reminders of Hevel’s death—a personal touch in an otherwise prosaic section of narrative.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, From Adam to Noah 1",Genesis 5:1-32
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, From Adam to Noah 2","The extraordinary numbers in this section are significant, not so much for their length as for their message. Cassuto has tried to fit them into a defined scheme, showing that the purpose, and achieved effect, of our text is to convey that human history follows a meaningful pattern. Pride of place on the list is occupied by the seventh member, Hanokh, who is portrayed as the first man of God. He serves as a preparation for Noah, who also “walks in accord with God” (6:9). Hanokh’s life span, 365 years, exemplifies the number scheme of Genesis: as an expression of numerical perfection (the number of days in a year), it symbolizes moral perfection."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Antiquity and the Preparation for the Flood 1",Genesis 6:1-8
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Antiquity and the Preparation for the Flood 2","The final pre-Flood section of the text includes a theme common to other ancient tales: the biological mixing of gods and men in dim antiquity. Perhaps this fragment, which initially seems difficult to reconcile with biblical ideas about God, has been retained here to round out a picture familiar to ancient readers, and to recall the early closeness of the divine and the human which, according to many cultures, later dissolved. It is also possible that the episode serves as another example of a world that has become disordered, thus providing further justification for a divinely ordered destruction."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Antiquity and the Preparation for the Flood 3","The stage is set for the Flood by means of a powerful sound reference. In 5:29 Noah was named, ostensibly to comfort his elders’ “sorrow” over human “pains” in tilling the soil. Here (6:6), however, the meaning of the name has been ironically reversed. The one who was supposed to bring comfort only heralds God’s own being “sorry” and “pained” (vv. 6–7). A similar ironic wordplay, where the audience knows what the name-bestower does not, occurs in Ex. 2:3; curiously, the hero of that passage, the baby Moses, is also connected with an “ark”—the term for the little basket in which he is set adrift."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Deluge 1",Genesis 6:9-8:19
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Deluge 2","The biblical account of the Flood is replete with echoes and allusions which point to three clear motifs: God’s justice, the totality of punishment, and a new beginning patterned after Gen. I."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Deluge 3","The first of these is brought out in 6:11–13: the repetition of the word “ruin” indicates not only the sorry state of society but also the principle of just retaliation, for God is to “bring ruin” upon the earth (v.13)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Deluge 4","The totality of the disaster is conveyed by the repeated use of the word “all” in 7:21–23, as well as by the completeness of the list of those destroyed (7:21–23). Humans, as befits their place in the order of creation, appear last, but actually it is they who drag virtually all of creation down with them. This reflects a deeply held biblical idea that human action directly affects the orderly and otherwise neutral functioning of nature."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Deluge 5","There are striking parallels between the Flood narrative and the creation account of Chap. 1. Just as the animals were created, each “according to its kind,” their rescue, both in boarding and leaving the Ark, is similarly worded. “Ocean” and the great “rushing-wind” which existed at creation (1:2) return here, the former to signify a lapse into chaos and the latter, the restoration of order and peace (7:11, 8:1). Finally, after the Flood (9:1–3) Noah is blessed in wording that recalls Adam’s blessing in 1:28–30. The world thus begins anew, with the implication of some hope for the future."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Deluge 6","Repetition emphasizes other aspects of the story’s message. In general the word-stem “live” occurs constantly throughout the text, highlighting the rescue and renewal of life as well as its destruction. Noah’s obedience, another major theme, is indicated by variations on the phrase “according to all that God commanded him, so he did” (6:22). Of rhythmical, almost ritual-sounding import is the phrase “you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Deluge 7","Our story has often been compared, with much justification, to the several Mesopotamian Flood accounts (e.g., in the <i>Gilgamesh</i> and <i>Atrahasis</i> epics), with which it shares a great deal of detail. At one time scholars were quick to concentrate on the parallels, but the differences are now recognized as being much more significant. In general one may say that in contrast to the earlier (Mesopotamian) versions the biblical one is unambiguous in both tone and intent. It has been placed in Genesis to exemplify a God who judges the world according to human behavior, punishes evil and rescues the righteous. This is a far cry from the earlier accounts, where the gods plan the destruction of the world for reasons that are unclear (or in one version, because humankind’s noise is disturbing the sleep of the gods), and where the protagonist, Utnapishtim, is saved as the result of a god’s favoritism without any moral judgments being passed."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Aftermath 1",Genesis 8:20-9:19
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Aftermath 2","The passages immediately following the Flood narrative speak of a God who is remarkably receptive to a human kind of change. From having been “sorry” that he created humankind (6:6), he now evinces a change of heart about the entire issue of evil, conceding human imperfections (8:21). In a wonderfully structured declaration, where “never again” moves in position from the middle to the beginning of the phrase (8:21–22), God as it were chooses to restrain his own ability to radically disturb the processes of nature. Where later on in Genesis the human characters exhibit the capacity to change, here it is God himself."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Aftermath 3","The blessing in 9:1–3 establishes Noah as a kind of second Adam (and it might be noted that chronologically Noah is the first man born after Adam dies). It repeats the basic formulation of the blessing in 1:28–30, with an important exception: meat-eating is now to be allowed, as part of God’s concession to human nature. Previously only the plant world had been accessible to humankind for food. However—and this very word punctuates the text twice in 9:4–5—there is to be an accounting for willful bloodshed, as if to suggest that the eating of meat is being permitted only under strict conditions. To underscore the importance of this concept, the section about bloodshed uses the vocabulary of creation: human beings are made “in the image of God.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Aftermath 4","With vv.8 and 9 the key concept of “covenant” is established in fact for the first time in the Bible. It is accompanied, as is usual in the Bible, by a symbol or “sign” (in this case, the rainbow). We are led back to the creation story again, as other biblical texts speak of the Sabbath as a “sign of the covenant” between God and Israel (e.g., Ex. 31:12–17)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Aftermath 5",The sixfold repetition of the phrase “never again” provides a thematic unity in these passages.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Drunkenness and Nakedness 1",Genesis 9:20-29
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Drunkenness and Nakedness 2","From the lofty poetry of God’s blessings and promises, we encounter an all-too-brief description of a bizarre event. The soil, which evidently has not entirely shaken off its primeval curse, proves once again to be a source of trouble. The nature of the crime mentioned here (“seeing the father’s nakedness”) has been variously interpreted; Buber and others see in it a reference to the sexual “immorality” of the Canaanites, which the Israelites found particularly abhorrent. This would explain the emphasis on the <i>son</i> of the culprit in the story, rather than on the perpetrator."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Drunkenness and Nakedness 3","A similar undistinguished ancestry is traced in Chap. 19, referring to the incestuous origins of Israel’s neighbors and frequent enemies, the Moabites and Ammonites."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Table of the Nations 1",Genesis 10:1-32
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Table of the Nations 2","Genesis, with its typically ancient Near Eastern emphasis on “begettings,” now traces the development of humanity from the sons of Noah. The key formula throughout is “their lands, their nations.” Commentators have noted numerical unity in the list, citing a total of seventy nations (once repetitions are omitted) laid out in multiples of seven. That number, as we have indicated, represents the concept of totality and perfection in the Bible. Thus the stage is set for the Babel story of the next chapter, with its condemnation of humanity’s attempt to forestall the divinely willed “scattering” into a well-ordered world."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Table of the Nations 3","Many of the names in this chapter have been identified (see Speiser), but some are still not known with certainty. Israel is conspicuous in its absence; despite the biblical narrative’s ability to trace Israel’s origins, those origins are meant to be seen not solely in biological terms but rather in terms of God’s choice. Similarly, Israel arises from women who begin as barren—thus pointing to divine intervention in history, rather than the perfectly normal account that we have here."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Unfinished Citadel 1",Genesis 11:1-9
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Unfinished Citadel 2","At its most obvious, in an isolated context, this famous story is about the overweening pride of man, as represented by his technology. God’s actions here recall the ending of the garden story, where humanity was also within reach of the divine."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Unfinished Citadel 3","Yet more is involved than a threat. Buber felt that this episode has been inserted at this point to show that humanity has failed again, as at the time of the Flood. It has not spread out and divided into nations, as in Chap. 10. The failure paves the way for a new divine plan, which is to be realized through one man (Avraham) and his descendants."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Unfinished Citadel 4","Structurally, the story is a tiny literary masterpiece. It utilizes numerous plays on sound which make meaningful and often ironic linkages between sections and ideas in the text. Most significant is how the general message—that God’s response occurs in exactly the same terms as the human challenge (i.e., divine justice)—is transmitted by means of form. Fokkelman has provided a detailed study; it will suffice here to indicate only the outline. The divine “Come-now!” of v.7 clearly stands as an answer to humankind’s identical cry in vv.3 and 4. In addition humans, who congregated in order to establish a “name” and to avoid being “scattered over the face of all the earth” (v.4), are contravened by the action of God, resulting in the ironic name “Babble” and a subsequent “scattering” of humanity (v.9). The text is thus another brilliant example of biblical justice, a statement about a worldview in which the laws of justice and morality are as neatly balanced as we like to think the laws of nature are."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, The Unfinished Citadel 5","There is an important cultural background to the story. “Shinar” refers to Mesopotamia, and the “tower,” undoubtedly, to the ubiquitous <i>ziggurratu</i> (now unearthed by archeologists) which served as man-made sacred mountains (i.e., temples). By portraying an unfinished tower, by dispersing the builders, and by in essence making fun of the mighty name of Babylon, the text functions effectively to repudiate the culture from which the people of Israel sprang (Avram’s “Ur” of 11:28 was probably the great Mesopotamian metropolis). From Chap. 12 on, a new worldview is created."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Noah to Avram 1",Genesis 11:10-32
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Noah to Avram 2","Here are enumerated another ten generations, making the orderly connection between the origins of the world (Noah was viewed as a second Adam) and the origins of the people of Israel. The life spans are considerably shorter than those of Chap. 5, yet some sort of careful number scheme seems evident here as well (see Cassuto 1972)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part I; The Primeval History, Noah to Avram 3","Beginning with v.26 we are introduced to Avram, with little hint of what is to come in his momentous life. For the moment he is only a son, a brother, and a husband, and a man whose early life is marked principally by the death of the old world (Haran and Terah), with little hope for the new (his wife is barren)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives 1",Genesis 12-50
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives 2","T<small>HE STORIES ABOUT THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF</small> I<small>SRAEL, AS A COLLECTION, ARE</small> almost contrapuntal in their richness. Life experiences are repeated and common themes recur; yet at the same time there is a remarkable variety of personalities."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives 3","Two prominent themes throughout are God’s promises (of land and descendants) and his blessing. The texts revolve around the question of whether and how God will fulfill his promises, and how people will effect the transfer of the blessing. Each generation portrayed in the narratives must deal with the inherent tensions raised by these questions, since their resolution does not occur easily."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives 4","The stories are also marked by each figure’s struggle to develop a concept of the religious life, of “walking in accord with God.” Each one carves out his own distinct path, to arrive at a mature understanding of what it means to be a father of the people of Israel. In order to bring about such an understanding, God apparently “tests” them in both obvious and more oblique ways, often against a backdrop of bitter sibling rivalry. One also observes a physical unsettledness about the Patriarchs’ quest; only Yitzhak is spared the wanderings that occur so regularly in the stories."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives 5","Rather interestingly, although the texts purport to be about “fathers,” it is God himself who most consistently fits that role for the characters. God acts <i>in loco parentis</i> for each of the Patriarchs, always, significantly, after the loss of the human father. He first appears to Avraham after the death of Terah; to Yitzhak after that of Avraham; to Yaakov after he leaves home (and a seemingly dying father); and he helps Yosef directly, after he has left his father’s home."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives 6","Numbers play an important role in the Patriarchal stories, as they did in Part I. It has been pointed out (see Sarna 1966) that the life spans of the Patriarchs fit into a highly ordered pattern. Avraham lives for 175 years, equaling 7 × 5<sup>2</sup>; Yitzhak, for 180 years, equaling 5 × 6<sup>2</sup>; and Yaakov, for 147 years, or 3 × 7<sup>2</sup>. This is unmistakably a purposeful scheme, meant to convey that human history is orderly and meaningful. Similarly an examination of the stories reveals that Avraham lives for 75 years in the lifetime of his father and 75 years in the lifetime of his son, while Yaakov spends 20 years away from his father, with Yosef roughly following suit in the next generation."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives 7","Last, it should be noted that the Patriarchal stories in various details anticipate the later Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. The specific references will be mentioned in the Notes."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham 1",Genesis 12:1-25:18
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham 2","A<small>LTHOUGH</small> A<small>VRAHAM IS THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER OF</small> I<small>SRAEL, THE DIVERSE TRADITIONS</small> about him which have been collected and connected to form a cycle of stories give evidence of much more. The cycle portrays an active <i>Homo religiosis</i> who converses with God, sometimes with an air of doubt and questioning, who proclaims God’s name at various sacred sites, who is concerned about justice and the treatment of the oppressed, and who makes dramatic life decisions without flinching. The stories thus reveal struggle, despite the fact that Avraham often appears to be the “perfect” man, always obeying God’s bidding and prospering."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham 3","Buber (1982), noting the unifying effect of the verb “see” throughout the cycle, understood Avraham as the father of the Prophets of Israel (formerly called “seers”). He also viewed the cycle as based around the series of tests that Avraham must undergo, tests quite different, we might add, from the labors of Hercules and other such ancient challenges."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham 4","Other than “see,” a number of leading-words launch the major concerns of the Patriarchs: “bless,” “seed,” and “land.” At the same time the cycle contains previously encountered motifs, albeit with interesting refinements: punishment for sin (this time, with human questioning), intimacy with God (here through visions), and sibling rivalry (with more complex results than murder). Above all we note the singling out of one man to perform the will of God, a man very different from the rather passive Noah."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham 5","Avraham stands at the core of the entire book of Genesis, as his experiences will in many ways be reflected in those who follow him. At the core of both the book and the cycle looms the disturbing Chapter 22, which brings together and resolves, for the moment, the major themes encountered so far."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Call and the Journey 1",Genesis 12:1-9
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Call and the Journey 2","The Avraham cycle begins decisively, with a command from God to leave the past behind and go to an unnamed land. Prominent in this speech, clearly, is the concept of blessing, which will be realized by the gifts of land (Canaan) and seed (Yitzhak, the son)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Call and the Journey 3","The classic mythological motif of the journey, where the hero meets such dangers as monsters and giants, has here been avoided. All that the text wishes us to know about is God’s speech and Avram’s immediate obedience; as in Chap. 22, all other details of the actual trip have been omitted."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Wife I 1",Genesis 12:10-20
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Wife I 2",Almost immediately upon his arrival in the promised land Avram is forced to leave it. It will be his son Yitzhak’s task to remain there on a more permanent basis.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Wife I 3",This is the first of three such stories which are practically identical (see Chaps. 20 and 26). All pose a challenge for the interpreter. An honored man of God seeks to save his own skin by passing his wife off as his sister; in each case the Patriarch emerges safely and with increased wealth.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Wife I 4","Speiser has tried to use the analogy of Hurrian (i.e., from Harran) law in which a wife can be elevated to the status of “sister” as one element in the expansion of her status. The legal background, however, is unclear and may not be decisive here. Coming as it does after God’s promise to biologically found “a great nation” (v.2) through Avram, the story in its first version is probably best understood as an example of God’s protection not only of the key male figure, but of the Matriarch as well. Harming Sarai, or even the threat of violating her sexuality, brings with it divine punishment. In addition the story also enables Avram to expand his wealth—itself a sign of God’s favor and the Patriarch’s importance or “weightiness” (see Polzin 1975)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Lot; The Land 1",Genesis 13:1-18
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Lot; The Land 2","We return to the theme of the land. Not for the last time, Avram’s nephew Lot is used as a foil. Their “parting” shows how Lot makes a bad choice—the “wicked and sinful” area of Sedom and Amora—while Avram settles “in the land of Canaan,” which had been promised to him. From here (vv.14ff.), Avram is given God’s twofold promise again, with that of descendants being spelled out more vividly this time."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Lot; The Land 3",This section is linked to the previous one by the repetition of the phrase “he and his wife and all that was his.”
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, War and Rescue 1",Genesis 14:1-24
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, War and Rescue 2","Abruptly Avram is presented in a new light: that of successful warrior (see Muffs). Consistent with his character as we will come to know it, he stands by his kinsman, acts intrepidly, and refuses the spoils of war. Equally important, he is respected by foreigners, a theme that will return both in Genesis and later. Perhaps this very different story has been included here as part of the early sections of the cycle in order to establish Avram’s status and stature. He is no longer merely a wanderer but well on the road to becoming a powerful local figure."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, War and Rescue 3","Whether the events described in this chapter are historical or part of an elaborate symbolic or mythical scheme has been the subject of debate among biblical scholars. The issue, barring unexpected archeological finds, is likely to remain unsolved."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, War and Rescue 4","The story is constructed around a geographical framework, using the formula “—that is now <i>x</i>—” to identify older sites for a contemporary audience. The one place which is <i>not</i> identified, the “Shalem” of verse 18, may well be Jerusalem. If so, this would substantiate the city’s claim to holiness. Historically it was not conquered until King David’s reign in the tenth century <small>B.C.E.</small>"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Covenant between the Pieces 1",Genesis 15:1-21
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Covenant between the Pieces 2","Amid scenes of great drama and almost mystery, a number of significant motifs are presented: (1) Avram’s expressions of doubt that God will keep his promise about descendants (thus heightening the tension and final miracle of Yitzhak’s birth); (2) the linking of the Patriarch to the event of the Exodus centuries later; and (3) the “cutting” of a covenant, in a manner well known in the ancient world. This last motif, especially with its setting of “great darkness” and “night-blackness,” takes Avram far beyond the earlier figure of Noah into a special and fateful relationship with God."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Firstborn Son 1",Genesis 16:1-16
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Firstborn Son 2","In the face of Sarai’s inability to bear children, Avram is given the legitimate option of producing an heir through her maid, Hagar. Somewhat embarrassing to later interpreters, this practice was nevertheless common in the ancient Near East (see also 30:3ff., 30:9ff.). Hagar abuses her temporarily exalted position (as her son Yishmael apparently does in a parallel story, in Chap. 21), but is saved by God’s intervention. The motif of “affliction” is continued from Chap. 15 (here, in vv.6, 9, and 11); also mentioned three times is God’s “hearkening” (hence the name Yishmael/God Hearkens). Buber understood this vocabulary to allude to the Exodus story, which in its early chapters uses the same terms."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Firstborn Son 3","Although Yishmael is not ultimately the chosen heir, he is nonetheless protected by God (see 21:20) and is eventually made into “a great nation” (17:20), as befits a child of Avram."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Covenant of Circumcision 1",Genesis 17:1-27
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Covenant of Circumcision 2","As Plaut notes, up to this point the covenant between God and Avram has been rather one-sided. In this chapter Avram is given a command to perform—not only of circumcision, but to be moral and upright (v.1, expanded in 18:19). Circumcision is but the symbol of the ongoing imperative to do “what is just.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Covenant of Circumcision 3","In many societies circumcision has been connected directly to puberty and marriage, usually taking place (as it does here to Yishmael) at around the age of thirteen. Our passage’s moving back of the rite essentially to birth is a daring reinterpretation, at once defusing the act of exclusively sexual content while at the same time suggesting that the covenant, a lifelong commitment, is nevertheless passed down biologically through the generations. The males of the tribe are not simply made holy for marriage. They bear the mark upon their bodies as a sacred reminder of their mission."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Covenant of Circumcision 4","The chapter echoes with repetition: “exceedingly, exceedingly” (vv.6 and 20, referring to the fruitfulness of Avram’s descendants), “you and your seed after you” (vv.7, 10; see also v.19), “for the ages” (covenant and land, vv.7, 8, 13, 19), and “into your generations” (vv.7, 9, 12)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Covenant of Circumcision 5","Preparatory to Avram’s assumption of fatherhood—of an individual and of a people—his name is changed (v.5), as is that of Sarai (v.15). This act is of the utmost significance in the biblical world. Since a person’s name was indicative of personality and fate, the receiving of a new one signified a new life or a new stage in life. Similarly, Yaakov (and in a sort of coronation, Yosef) will undergo a change of name. Such a practice still survives among kings and popes."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Visit and Promise 1",Genesis 18:1-15
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Visit and Promise 2","The announcement of Sara’s impending child is set in the familiar ancient garb of a tale about divine travelers who visit an old couple. Central, as is usual in folklore, is the idea of hospitality, emphasized in the text by the threefold use of “pray” (please) (vv.3–4), “pass on/by” (vv.3–5), and by Avraham’s flurry of activity (he himself “runs” twice, “hastens” three times, and “fetches” four times in serving his guests)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Great Intercession 1",Genesis 18:16-33
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Great Intercession 2","With v.17 the narrative is interrupted, and there begins a remarkable scene in which man confronts God. As if to emphasize the importance of this encounter, the text presents God as thinking out loud, and using the intimate term “know” (see 4:1) to describe his relationship to Avraham. And Avraham, the man through whom the nations “will find blessing” (v.18; see 12:3), the progenitor of “a great … nation” (v.18; see 12:2) that will see injustice its great goal, is now confronted with an urgent question of justice. While Avraham seems to be testing God in this story, it may in fact be precisely the reverse that is intended. Perhaps here more than anywhere else in the entire cycle (with the possible exception of Chap. 22), Avraham appears as the worthy father of his people, the one who will “charge his sons and his household … to do what is right and just” (v.19). Without this story Avraham would be a man of faith but not a man of compassion and moral outrage, a model consistent with Moses and the Prophets of Israel."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Great Intercession 3","The tightly structured, almost formal dialogue allows us to focus totally on the issue at hand. Predominating as refrains are the words “innocent” and “guilty,” along with the expected versions of “just/justice” that pervade Avraham’s remarks."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The End of Sedom and Amora 1",Genesis 19:1-38
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The End of Sedom and Amora 2","The detailed and colorful story of Lot in Sedom and in flight from it adds a great deal to the Avraham cycle. On the one hand there is the portrayal of Lot’s continuing his uncle’s tradition of hospitality (vv.1–3), even to the extent of being willing to sacrifice his own daughters’ virginity. On the other hand Lot comes across as timid (vv.7–8) and fearful (vv.18–20). In fact the word “pray” (which we noted in Chap. 18 as a “hospitality term,” and which serves that function in verse 2 here as well) is used later in this chapter in a way that almost suggests whining. He thus once again brings Avraham’s personality into sharper focus."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The End of Sedom and Amora 3","The crimes of Sedom and Amora are at last indicated more openly: abuse of the sacred duty of hospitality, and sexual immorality (v.5). The latter theme returns at the end of the story, with the incestuous incident that takes place at the instigation of Lot’s daughters."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The End of Sedom and Amora 4","The story uses some stylized vocabulary. In v.13, the messengers talk of “bringing ruin,” just as we encountered in the Flood narrative (6:13). The narrative also gives negative twists to words which were positive in the previous chapter: “know” and “just” are changed to indicate illicit sex (v.5) and a condemnation of the alien Lot (v.9, “act-the-judge and adjudicate”). Here too, “door/entrance” is transformed from a place of contact with God to one of confrontation with men."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The End of Sedom and Amora 5","The account of the destruction itself is terse and mysterious, but it also reveals the predicament of an all-too-human man, Lot."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The End of Sedom and Amora 6","The final section of the Sedom and Amora story recounts the origins of two of Israel’s neighbors, the Moabites and Ammonites. As traditional enemies, they are not treated very kindly, any more than was the ancestor of the Canaanites in 9:20–27."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Wife II 1",Genesis 20:1-18
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Wife II 2","The second occurrence of “The Matriarch Protected” comes immediately before the story of Yitzhak’s birth, as if to emphasize God’s hand in the process one more time. In this long variation on the theme, God is most active and Avraham most revealing of his past. He emerges from danger as a man who clearly enjoys God’s full protection and bounty."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Wife II 3","The story almost draws a web of magic around Sara. Avimelekh is nearly killed by God, and Sara’s childlessness is inflicted upon all the women in the king’s household—even though there is not the slightest doubt of his innocence (he “had not come near her”)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Yitzhak Born 1",Genesis 21:1-8
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Yitzhak Born 2","Two principal ideas punctuate this climax for which we have waited since Chap. 12: God keeps his promises (hence the poem in v.1), and the key word in the stories about Yitzhak: “laughter” (here the result of the actual birth)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Yishmael Banished 1",Genesis 21:9-21
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Yishmael Banished 2","Once Yitzhak has been born, separation must be made between heir and firstborn. Despite Avraham’s obvious love for him, Yishmael must leave; his mother must repeat her ordeal of Chap. 16 as well. Nonetheless the text emphasizes that God is there “with the lad” (v.20); twice the Yishmael motif of “God hearkening” resounds (v.17); and God promises that the boy will eventually attain the same exalted status as his brother (vv.13, 18)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Yishmael Banished 3","Structurally, this brief tale foreshadows the next chapter, the ordeal of Yitzhak. It speaks of a journey into the unknown, a child at the point of death, the intervention of God’s “messenger,” the parent’s sighting of the way out, and the promise of future blessing. Of course the differences between the two stories are equally important."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Treaty 1",Genesis 21:22-34
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Treaty 2","This interlude, which usefully separates the life threats to Avraham’s two sons (for a similar example, see I Sam. 25), is one of many scenes demonstrating Avraham’s relationship with local princes."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Great Test 1",Genesis 22:1-24
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Great Test 2","This story is certainly one of the masterpieces of biblical literature. In a famous article by Erich Auerbach it is remarked how biblical style as exemplified here, in contradistinction to that of Homer and other epic bards, eschews physical and psychological details in favor of one central preoccupation: a man’s decision in relation to God. The result of this style is a terrible intensity, a story which is so stark as to be almost unbearable."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Great Test 3","Chap. 22 is a tale of God’s seeming retraction of his promise (of “seed”) to Avraham. The fact that other issues may be involved here (i.e., Israel’s rejection of local and widely practiced ideas of child sacrifice) may be quite beside the point. Coming just one chapter after the birth of the long-awaited son, the story completely turns around the tension of the whole cycle and creates a new, frightening tension of its own. The real horror of the story lies in this threatened contradiction to what has gone before."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Great Test 4","Most noticeable in the narrative is Avraham’s silence, his mute acceptance of, and acting on, God’s command. We are told of no sleepless night, nor does he ever say a word to God. Instead he is described with a series of verbs: starting-early, saddling, taking, splitting, arising, going (v.3; similarly in vv.6 and 9–10). Avraham the bargainer, so willing to enter into negotiations with relations (Chap. 13), allies (Chap. 14), local princes (Chap. 20), and even God himself (Chap. 18), here falls completely silent."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Great Test 5","The chapter serves an important structural function in the Avraham cycle, framing it in conjunction with Chap. 12. The triplet in v.2 (“Pray take your son,/ your only-one,/ whom you love”) recalls “from your land/ from your kindred/ from your father’s house” in 12:1; “go-you-forth” and “the land that I will tell you of” (v.2; the latter, three times in the story) similarly point back to Avraham’s call (12:1, “Go-you-forth … to the land that I will let you see”). There he had been asked to give up the past (his father); here, the future (his son). Between the two events lies Avraham’s active life as man of God, ancestor, and intercessor. After this God will never speak with him again."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Great Test 6","In many ways this story is the midpoint of Genesis. It brings the central theme of continuity and discontinuity to a head in the strongest possible way. After Moriyya, we can breathe easier, knowing that God will come to the rescue of his chosen ones in the direst of circumstances. At the same time we are left to ponder the difficulties of being a chosen one, subject to such an incredible test."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Great Test 7","The story is also the paradigmatic narrative of the entire book. The Patriarch passes the test, and we know that the fulfillment of the divine promise is assured. Yet there is an ominous note: love, which occurs here by name for the first time, leads almost to heartbreak. So it will be for the rest of Genesis."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Purchase and Burial 1",Genesis 23:1-20
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Purchase and Burial 2","Even though he is now secure in God’s covenant, Avraham must still live and function in the human world. His purchase of a burial plot for Sara shows us once more his dealings with his neighbors, here as their equal, and also establishes at last his legal foothold in Canaan, albeit with a small piece of land. The long conversations and considerable formality of the chapter, which are not unusual in an ancient Near Eastern context, contrast with the extreme brevity of the previous chapter."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Purchase and Burial 3","The narrative strikes a curious balance between the emotional reality of the situation (e.g., the repetition of “dead,” “presence,” and “bury”) and the requirements of legal procedure (“Hear me,” “give title,” and “holding”)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Betrothal Journey 1",Genesis 24:1-67
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Betrothal Journey 2","The last full episode of the Avraham cycle is the longest in the book. Its leisurely pace, attention to detail, and concentration on speeches as well as action belie the importance of what is being recounted: the finding of a wife for Yitzhak, who is biologically to continue the line. Yet after all that has happened in the previous chapters, we know that this will be taken care of by God. That is implied in Avraham’s assured “he himself [God] will send his messenger on before you” (v.7)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, The Betrothal Journey 3","Many meeting/betrothal scenes in the Bible take place at a well (e.g., Yaakov, Moshe); this was probably a literary convention (see Culley 1976b and Alter 1981 for a discussion of the significance of such a phenomenon). Like other crucial moments in Avraham’s life the chapter involves a journey, albeit one made by his emissary. It is therefore natural that the key words of the chapter are “go,” “journey,” and “grant success.” “Take” also appears frequently, as the biblical term often used for “marry.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Avraham's Descendants and Death 1",Genesis 25:1-18
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part II; Avraham, Avraham's Descendants and Death 2","Avraham’s death is bracketed by two passages dealing with his offspring: first, through Ketura (a concubine), and then through Hagar (Yishmael’s line). God’s promise is on the way to fulfillment, although Yitzhak is as yet childless and only a small portion of the land has been permanently acquired."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov 1",Genesis 25:19-36:43
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov 2","B<small>EFORE COMMENTING ON THE</small> Y<small>AAKOV CYCLE, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO CONSIDER WHY HIS</small> father Yitzhak, the second of the Patriarchs, receives no true separate group of stories on his own."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov 3","Yitzhak functions in Genesis as a classic second generation—that is, as a transmitter and stabilizing force, rather than as an active participant in the process of building the people. There hardly exists a story about him in which he is anything but a son and heir, a husband, or a father. His main task in life seems to be to take roots in the land of Canaan, an admittedly important task in the larger context of God’s promises in Genesis. What this means, unfortunately, is that he has almost no personality of his own. By Chapter 27, a scant two chapters after his father dies, he appears as (prematurely?) old, blind in both a literal and figurative sense, and as we will see, he fades out of the text entirely, only to die several chapters, and many years, later."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov 4","The true dynamic figure of the second generation here is Rivka. It is she to whom God reveals his plan, and she who puts into motion the mechanism for seeing that it is properly carried out. She is ultimately the one responsible for bridging the gap between the dream, as typified by Avraham, and the hard-won reality, as realized by Yaakov."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov 5","Avraham is a towering figure, almost unapproachable as a model in his intimacy with God and his ability to hurdle nearly every obstacle. Adding to this the fact that Yitzhak is practically a noncharacter, and that Yosef, once his rise begins, also lacks dimension as a personality, it becomes increasingly clear that it is Yaakov who emerges as the most dynamic and most human personality in the book. The stories about him cover fully half of Genesis, and reveal a man who is both troubled and triumphant. Most interestingly, he, and not Avraham, gives his name to the people of Israel."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov 6","Distinctive themes of the cycle include physical struggle, deception, and confrontation. These are expressed through the key words of Yaakov’s name (“Heel-Holder” and “Heel-Sneak,” then Yisrael, “God-Fighter”), “deceive” and similar words, and “face.” Also recurring are the terms “love,” “bless,” “firstborn-right,” and “wages/hire” (one word in Hebrew). The cycle is structured partly around etiologies (folk explanations of place-names and personal names) and also around Yaakov’s use of stones in several of the stories."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov 7","Continuing from the Avraham cycle are such earlier themes as wandering, sibling rivalry, the barren wife, wives in conflict, the renaming of the protagonist, God perceived in dreams and visions; and particular geographical locations such as Bet-El, Shekhem, and the Negev (Cassuto 1974)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov 8","Finally, it should be mentioned that the Yaakov stories are notable in the manner in which they portray the two levels of biblical reality: divine and human. Throughout the stories human beings act according to normal (though often strong) emotions, which God then uses to carry out his master plan. In this cycle one comes to feel the interpretive force of the biblical mind at work, understanding human events in the context of what God wills. It is a fascinating play between the ideas of fate and free will, destiny and choice—a paradox which nevertheless lies at the heart of the biblical conception of God and humankind."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Rivka's Children 1",Genesis 25:19-34
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Rivka's Children 2","Two stories of sibling confrontation begin the Yaakov cycle. From the first, vv. 19–28, all the necessary conditions are introduced for what is to come: struggle in the womb (foreshadowing Yaakov’s wrestling match in Chap. 32, the structural resolution of this earlier one), God’s plan for the younger son to outdo the older one, the importance of names as clues to personalities, and parental preference. This last point seals the fate of the two boys."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Rivka's Children 3","The second story (vv.29–34) is Yaakov’s first act of stealth, and sets the pattern for his whole life. Note at the same time the text’s emphasis on Esav’s role (v.34), “Thus did Esav despise the firstborn-right.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Rivka's Children 4","As before, these episodes point in two temporal directions. Esav resembles Yishmael, the man of the bow; and parental preference will launch the initially tragic action in the Yosef story (Chap. 37)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, In the Land 1",Genesis 26:1-6
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, In the Land 2","As we have suggested, there is no true collection of stories about Yitzhak. That is, virtually nowhere does Yitzhak appear in a tale where, as a distinct individual, he is a central character. And unlike Yaakov and Yosef, Yitzhak never directly receives his father’s blessing. This is bestowed by God, and one gets the impression that even Avraham does not deal with his son as an individual. This is not surprising, given Yitzhak’s function in his father’s life."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, In the Land 3","For the narrative, his main purpose, as we have stressed above, is simply to remain in the land (note the repetition of the word “land” in this section). It is almost as if Avraham, the man who lives in the shadow of sacred trees, plants one in the person of his son. In this chapter Yitzhak is forbidden to go beyond the borders of Canaan. Even his death, so seemingly out of place in Chap. 35, occurs after Yaakov has returned home from his wanderings: only when it is assured that there will be continuity in the land is he allowed to die—despite the fact that as a result the text must leave him blind and dying for twenty years."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, The Wife III 1",Genesis 26:7-11
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, The Wife III 2","Here is the final “Yitzhak version” of the tale, constructed around the same king whom Avraham had encountered in Chap. 20. Its individual coloring is supplied by the “laughing-and-loving” of v.8, playing on Yitzhak’s name. Otherwise, just as in the following episode, he is merely repeating his father’s experience."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Blessing 1",Genesis 26:12-33
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Blessing 2","Confirmation of Yitzhak’s status as heir comes in vv.12–14, in the form of material blessings (already referred to immediately after Avraham’s death, 25:11). It will be Yaakov’s task to reclaim and continue the spiritual side of the tradition."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Blessing 3","The first episode is centered around not Yitzhak but Avraham. The phrase “his father” reverberates; and Avimelekh returns. In the second episode, Avraham’s treaty with that king (Chap. 21) is replayed, with the same result as before: an explanation of the name Be’er-Sheva."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Deceit and Blessing 1",Genesis 26:34-28:9
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Deceit and Blessing 2","Of all the stories of Genesis, this is perhaps the most brilliantly staged. Nowhere is the narrative so vivid as here, and nowhere, even including Chap. 22, is the tension so masterfully drawn out."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Deceit and Blessing 3","Despite the fact that the story line is a simple one, involving deception and the “taking” of the blessing, the text is imbued with great subtlety. Most striking is the sensuality it invokes: seven times we hear of “game,” six of the “delicacy” (or “tasty-dish”), and three times Yitzhak “feels” Yaakov (who “comes close” four times). In fact the story makes use of all five of the senses. One sense—that of sight—is defective, and on that deficiency will turn the action of the story. Yet another level of meaning is apparent: “to see” in ancient Israel, as in many cultures, was a term connected to prophetic powers, as we observed regarding Avraham. So here, ironically, Yitzhak’s blindness leads to both deception and to the proper transferral of the blessing."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Deceit and Blessing 4","Structurally the story is framed by two references to Esav and his wives: 26:34–35 prepares the way for his loss of the blessing, by showing that he has alienated himself from his parents (and broken Avraham’s charge regarding Yitzhak in 24:3), and 28:6–9 finds Esav obeying his father and making a rather pathetic attempt to reassure himself of his love."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Deceit and Blessing 5",Some of the story’s motifs will return later. The threefold “as he loves” looks to the crucial role that the theme of “love” will play later on in Genesis (as well as being a key to the story itself). The general theme of nonrecognition will return with an interesting twist in the Yosef novella (especially in Chaps. 42–44).
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Yaakov Sets Out 1",Genesis 28:10-22
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Yaakov Sets Out 2","Yaakov’s journey takes him not only to a foreign land, but to the portals of adulthood. It begins fittingly with a dream vision, so that we will know from the start that God is with him. In fact Yaakov always encounters God at crucial life junctures, at the point of journeys (31:3—leaving Aram; 32:25ff.—meeting Esav; 35:1— returning to Bet-El; 35:9ff.—the homecoming; and 46:2ff.—on the way to Egypt)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Yaakov Sets Out 3","The setting for this particular encounter is highly unusual, especially when compared to the generally nongeographical nature of the revelations to Avraham. The idea of a sacred site (“place,” a biblical word with these connotations, occurs three times) is strongly suggested. The notion of a ladder or ramp (or “gateway,” v.17) between the divine and human worlds is well known in ancient stories. A variation of the theme occurs in 32:2–3, where Yaakov sees “messengers” again in an “encounter”; these two stories frame the middle of the entire cycle."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Yaakov Sets Out 4","As Yaakov enters his adult life, he resembles both his grandfather Avraham, the visionary, and his son Yosef, the dreamer."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Arrival in Aram 1",Genesis 29:1-14
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Arrival in Aram 2","As one might expect from the usual biblical pattern, Yaakov meets his bride-to-be at a well. As in other ancient stories (see also Ex. 2:15–17) the hero performs a feat of physical strength, this time with a large stone—continuing the use of stones as a motif in the Yaakov stories."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Arrival in Aram 3","Lavan is once again the chief representative of the family, as he was in the betrothal account of Chap. 24."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Deception Repaid 1",Genesis 29:15-30
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Deception Repaid 2","The language of the text here, as well as the tenor of the situation, suggest that the Bible has set up Yaakov’s punishment for having stolen Yitzhak’s blessing from his brother. “Deceived” (v.25) and “younger … firstborn” (v.26) echo the Chap. 27 narrative, and provide another example of biblical justice."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Love, Jealousy, and Children 1",Genesis 29:31-30:24
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Love, Jealousy, and Children 2","The narrative now demonstrates (1) how Yaakov prospers in exile, increasing both in wealth and in progeny, and thus (2) how God fulfills his promise to the Patriarchs to “make them many.” Characteristically for the Bible, this takes place as a result of human emotions: the jealousy of two sisters who are married to the same man. The emotions, interestingly, are portrayed largely through the names given to Yaakov’s sons. In the end Lea seems to be the victor, at least in the terms of a culture that prizes the production of male children; she becomes the mother of fully half of the sons of Israel (Redak)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Yaakov in Exile; Stealth and Prosperity 1",Genesis 30:25-32:1
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Yaakov in Exile; Stealth and Prosperity 2","The long account of how Yaakov outwits Lavan rounds out the portrait of his personality: he is a man at once clever, successful, and harassed. The text goes to great lengths to describe both men in behavior and thought, and we are given enough dialogue to be able to understand their motivations. The repeating words point to major themes: “serve,” “wages,” “face” (which will become central to the whole cycle by Chap. 32), and a whole vocabulary of trickery: “steal” (with the variations “be stealthy” and “steal the wits”), “take away” (see Chap. 27), “snatch,” and “rob.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Preparations for Esav 1",Genesis 32:2-24
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Preparations for Esav 2","As if to portend something momentous, Yaakov’s first act upon setting out for home is an encounter with “messengers of God.” From this starting point everything is subsequently a matter of “two camps” (v.8) or two levels: the divine and the human. This is the key to understanding the meeting between Yaakov and his brother in its entirety: Yaakov will have to deal with God before he can resolve his problem with Esav."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Preparations for Esav 3","With an obsequiousness whose language reflects both the culture and the emotional setting, Yaakov prepares a gift for Esav, but finds to his dismay that his brother is “coming to meet him,” with seemingly hostile intent. Once again stealth (or at least extreme caution) is the rule, with Yaakov taking elaborate precautions."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, The Mysterious Stranger; Struggle at the Yabbok 1",Genesis 32:25-33
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, The Mysterious Stranger; Struggle at the Yabbok 2","Unexpectedly there is a break in the narrative. The stage has been set for something mysterious to happen with a nighttime backdrop and accented references to “crossing” (vv.23–24), which clearly refers to more than just the river."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, The Mysterious Stranger; Struggle at the Yabbok 3","The great wrestling scene at the Yabbok both symbolizes and resolves beforehand Yaakov’s meeting with Esav, much as Shakespeare’s prebattle dream scenes (e.g., <i>Julius Caesar, Richard III, Macbeth</i>) will do with his characters. Struggle, the motif already introduced in the mother’s womb (Chap. 25), returns here, but that is not the only consideration. At issue is Yaakov’s whole life and personality, which despite his recent material successes are still under the pall of Esav’s curse (27:36). Central, then, is the change of name in v.29, which suggests both a victorious struggle and the emergence of a new power. This is further supported by the Hebrew plays on sound: <i>Y’KB</i> (Yaakov), <i>YBK</i> (Yabbok), and <i>Y’BK</i> (wrestling)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, The Mysterious Stranger; Struggle at the Yabbok 4","The story may have originated as the well-known tale of a hero fighting a river divinity, but it clearly has been transformed into something much broader by its position and vocabulary."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, The Mysterious Stranger; Struggle at the Yabbok 5","On the mysterious aspects of both the story and the name Israel, see Geller."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Resolution 1",Genesis 33:1-17
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Resolution 2","Once the Yabbok crisis is past, there is hope for reconciliation of the brothers. Even so, Yaakov exercises caution, behaving like a man who is presenting tribute to a king. The narrative is brought full circle in vv.10 and 11, where “face” is once again highlighted and where Yaakov’s gift is termed a “token-of-blessing.” At last the tension of Yaakov’s early life seems resolved."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Home; Peace and Violence 1",Genesis 33:18-34:31
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Home; Peace and Violence 2","“Yaakov came home in peace to the city of Shekhem” (33:18) continues the theme of resolution. Not only has Esav accepted his gift, but Yaakov has arrived home safely, in fulfillment of his prayer in 28:21. Like Avraham he purchases land; again like him he builds an altar."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Home; Peace and Violence 3","Chap. 34, however, shatters the newly created atmosphere of security and peace (“peaceably disposed” in v.21 is a bitter twist). Whereas Avraham and Yitzhak had been able to conclude treaties with the inhabitants of Canaan, Yaakov winds up in the opposite position. The text implies, as usual, that Canaanite sexual behavior is odious (v.7, “such [a thing] is not to be done!”), and this provides the spring for the action. Interestingly, Yaakov’s sons act somewhat like their father had, “with deceit” (v.13); and love once again leads to an unfortunate end."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Home; Peace and Violence 4","The vengefulness and brutality of Yaakov’s sons in this story anticipates their later behavior in the Yosef story (Chap. 37); surprisingly, it is for the present crime and not the sale of Yosef that their father condemns them on his deathbed (49:5–7)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Home; Peace and Violence 5","The chapter is notable for the latitude it allows its characters to express their thoughts and emotions: Shekhem’s desire and love, the sons’ anger and cunning, the Hivvites’ gullibility and greed, and Yaakov’s fear. Like other stories in the Yaakov cycle, it presents us with a somewhat ambiguous situation, where right and wrong are not always simple and the putative heroes are not always heroic."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Home; Blessing and Death 1",Genesis 35:1-29
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Home; Blessing and Death 2","Several brief notices round out Yaakov’s return to Canaan. First (vv.1–7) there is the return to Bet-El, where he builds an altar and has the “foreign” gods of his household people put away—thus fulfilling his promise in Chap. 28. This passage is built upon the Hebrew word <i>El,</i> God (related actually to an earlier Northwest Semitic name for a god)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Home; Blessing and Death 3","Apparently a second version of Yaakov’s name change is recorded in vv.9–15. As in the case of Avraham, seed and land are promised by God. The land can be given to him and “to your seed after you” only upon his return."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Home; Blessing and Death 4","Finally, spread out through the chapter are the accounts of three deaths: Devora, Rivka’s nurse (v.8—a veiled reference to Rivka’s own death?), Rahel (vv.16–20), and finally Yitzhak (vv.28–29). Yaakov’s youth is over, with the dramatic break with those close to him in that period."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Re'uven 1",Genesis 35:21-22
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Re'uven 2","The following tiny fragment, concerning Re’uven’s usurping his father’s concubine, serves to presage his fall as firstborn later on. Such an act had symbolic value in biblical society; Avshalom (Absalom) sleeps with David’s concubines as a sign of rebellion and a desire to attain the crown (II Sam. 16:21–22)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Esav's Descendants 1",Genesis 36:1-43
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Esav's Descendants 2","The complicated genealogies and dynasties of this chapter close out the first part of the Yaakov cycle, strictly speaking. Fitting in the context of a society which lay great store by kinship and thus by careful remembering of family names, it may also indicate the greatness of Yitzhak’s line, as Chap. 25 had earlier done for Avraham. Certainly the lists give evidence of a time when the Edomites were more than merely Israel’s neighbors, assuming great importance in historical recollection (Speiser)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef 3","Initially the tale is one of family emotions, and it is in fact extreme emotions which give it a distinctive flavor. All the major characters are painfully expressive of their feelings, from the doting father to the spoiled son, from the malicious brothers to the lustful wife of Potifar, from the nostalgic adult Yosef to the grief-stricken old Yaakov. It is only through the subconscious medium of dreams, in three sets, that we are made to realize that a higher plan is at work which will supersede the destructive force of these emotions."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef 4","For this is a story of how “ill”—with all its connotations of fate, evil, and disaster—is changed to good. Despite the constant threat of death to Yosef, to the Egyptians, and to Binyamin, the hidden, optimistic thrust of the story is “life,” a word that appears in various guises throughout. Even “face,” the key word of the Yaakov cycle which often meant something negative, is here given a kinder meaning, as the resolution to Yaakov’s life."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef 5","A major subtheme of the plot is the struggle for power between Re’uven and Yehuda. Its resolution has implications that are as much tribal as personal, for the tribe of Yehuda later became the historical force in ancient Israel as the seat of the monarchy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef 6","Although many details of the narrative confirm Egyptian practices, those practices actually reflect an Egypt considerably later than the period of the Patriarchs (Redford). Of interest also is the prominence of the number five in the story, a detail that is unexplained but that gives some unity to the various sections of text."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef 7","In many ways the Yosef material repeats elements in the Yaakov traditions. A long list could be compiled, but let us at least mention here sibling hatred, exile of the hero, foreign names, love and hate, dreams, and deception—even so detailed as to duplicate the use of a goat-kid. But its focusing on a classic rags-to-riches plot, with the addition of a moralistic theme, make the Yosef story a distinctive and always popular tale, accessible in a way that the more difficult stories of the first three parts of Genesis are not."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Young Yosef; Love and Hate 1",Genesis 37:1-36
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Young Yosef; Love and Hate 2","As has been the pattern with the Avraham and Yaakov cycles, the opening chapter here introduces the key themes of the entire story. These include the father’s love, the power of words, dreams, “ill” as a key word (here denoting evil intent but eventually encompassing misfortune, among other concepts), and of course, the brothers’ hatred, which at first glance is the motivating force behind the action."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Young Yosef; Love and Hate 3","But the initial blame for what happens clearly lies with the father (vv.3–4), and is made unbearable by Yosef’s own behavior. In point of fact he is largely responsible for his own downfall, bearing tales about his brothers (v.2) even before Yaakov’s preference for him is noted. His insistence on telling his dreams to his brothers must be galling, particularly the second time (v.9), coming as it does after the report that “they hated him still more for his dreams” (v.8)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Young Yosef; Love and Hate 4","The key word of the chapter, not surprisingly, is “brother,” culminating in Yehuda’s ironic words (v.27): “let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother….” Shortly afterward Yosef, their “(own) flesh,” is sold into slavery and probable death."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yehuda and Tamar 1",Genesis 38:1-30
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yehuda and Tamar 2","Chap. 38 has been the subject of many discussions, for it seems to be out of place. It interrupts the story of Yosef at a crucial dramatic spot, and is not chronologically fully consistent with it (Yehuda ages considerably; then we return to Yosef as a seventeen-year-old). Some feel that the suspension in the drama helps to raise tension; others argue that this is the only possible place to put an important tradition about the important brother. While these and other arguments may have their merit, one may discern some significant thematic connections as well, both within the context of the Yosef story and of Genesis as a whole."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yehuda and Tamar 3","The episode first of all demonstrates the growth of Yehuda as a character who is central to the Yosef novella. Already in Chap. 37 he had demonstrated active leadership, albeit in a questionable cause. There he actually saved Yosef’s life, in contrast to Re’uven’s unsuccessful and ultimately self-centered rescue attempt. As the one who basically assumes responsibility, he will be made to undergo an inner development in the narrative, and again becomes the one to take charge of the youngest son (Binyamin, in Chaps. 43 and 44). The missing piece that begins to explain his nobility in this regard (Chap. 44) is the present chapter. Yehuda here learns what it is to lose sons, and to want desperately to protect his youngest. Although his failure to marry off Tamar to the youngest son leads to public humiliation (twice, actually), his response shows that he immediately accepts blame: “She is in-the-right more than I” (v.26). Such an interpretation is further confirmed by the restriction of the word “pledge” to here and 43:9. Yehuda has learned what it means to stake oneself for a principle."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yehuda and Tamar 4","Only after we have been informed of Yehuda’s change can the narrative resume with Chap. 39. True to biblical thinking, redemption may start only after the crime has been punished (e.g., the Samson story, where the hero’s hair begins to grow immediately after his imprisonment)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yehuda and Tamar 5","Actually the chronology works out quite well. We are told via 41:46, 53–54, that about twenty years elapse between the sale of Yosef and his meetings with the brothers in Egypt; this often signifies a period in biblical parlance and could encompass a generation or a bit less. Since Yehuda was quite possibly a father already in Chap. 37, the present story could well end just before the events reported in Chap. 43—in other words, Yehuda reaches full inner maturity just in time."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yehuda and Tamar 6","The other function of this story seems to be to carry out the major theme of Genesis as we have presented it: continuity and discontinuity between the generations. What is at stake here is not merely the line of one of the brothers, but the line which (as the biblical audience must have been fully aware) will lead to royalty—King David was a descendant of Peretz of v.29. This should not be surprising in a book of origins; we noted the possible mention of Jerusalem in 14:18. Apparently a popular early theme, connected as we have noted to the power of God in history, continuity/discontinuity is repeated in somewhat similar circumstances in the book of Ruth (which contains the only other mention of “begettings” outside of Genesis and Num.3:1)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yehuda and Tamar 7","The narrator has woven Chaps. 38 and 37 together with great skill. Again a man is asked to “recognize” objects, again the use of a kid, and again a brother (this time a dead one) is betrayed."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yosef; Rise and Fall 1",Genesis 39:1-23
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yosef; Rise and Fall 2","This chapter prefigures Yosef’s eventual rise to power and simultaneously chronicles his lowest point, literally and figuratively. The two strands of the plot are woven together into a pattern of success/authority → imprisonment → success/authority. This also mirrors the larger story, which progresses from favorite son → slavery → viceroy of Egypt. The integration takes place partly through the medium of a key word, “hand”—which also occurred four times at the end of Chap. 38 and thus acts as a further textual connector. Yosef’s success is tied six times to the phrase “in his hands” (vv.3, 4, 6, 8, 22, 23); he is thrown into prison because of the garments that he left in his mistress’s “hands” (vv.12, 13). Similarly, the movement of the chapter is mirrored in the word “eyes,” which is linked first to the theme of authority (v.4), then to the attempted seduction (v.7), and finally to authority again (v.21) (Alter)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yosef; Rise and Fall 3","The chapter also repeats the phrase “And it was” (in one form or another) some twelve times, as a distinct stylistic pattern."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yosef; Rise and Fall 4","Yosef’s temporary downfall occurs here for reasons beyond literary balance or suspense. It is in a very real sense the punishment for the bratty behavior of his adolescence. Once again words (this time not his own) get him into trouble (vv.17, 19), as they did in 37:8. And once again a garment is displayed as proof of a fabricated crime."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, The Rise to Power; Dreams 1",Genesis 40:1-41:52
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, The Rise to Power; Dreams 2","Continued are the themes of Yosef’s success in adversity and skill in interpreting dreams (yet his father and brother, and not he, had done the interpreting in Chap. 37!). In Chap. 37 dreams had brought about his downfall; here (Chap. 40) they will help the cupbearer and in Chap. 41 ultimately save a country, his family, and himself. Yosef’s self-assurance and reliance on God, already evident in 39:9, here mean that it will not be long before he stands at the pinnacle."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, The Rise to Power; Dreams 3","Yosef’s dramatic rise to power is an old and favorite motif in folklore. The text colorfully presents Pharaoh’s dreams, in great detail, especially in his emotional retelling. All the more striking then is Yosef’s simple interpretation (41:23–27)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Famine; The Brothers Come 1",Genesis 41:53-42:38
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Famine; The Brothers Come 2","Worldwide famine creates the backdrop for the family drama that is about to unfold. The ancients understood famine as sent by the gods, often as punishment; and the events of our text suggest that God is indeed the prime mover here. We are again presented with the characters of Chap. 37, all of whom have somehow changed. Yaakov emerges as more pitiful than ever (a shadow of the wrestler at the Yabbok), Yosef as powerful governor, not only of all Egypt but of his family’s destiny as well, and the brothers, remarkably, are repentant (42:21–22). We also see Yosef’s emotional side for the first time. He weeps in 42:24, as he will do three times again (43:30; 45:2, 14–15)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, The Test 1",Genesis 43:1-44:34
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, The Test 2","Yosef’s testing of his brothers is masterful, not only because of the plan itself, but also because of the depth of emotion that the text evokes in its characterizations. It demonstrates how well the whole story has been integrated into the Yaakov material, for here as well as there long conversations are used to reveal complex passions."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, The Test 3","Some have questioned the morality of Yosef’s actions, seeing that the aged Yaakov might well have died while the test was progressing, without ever finding out that Yosef had survived. But that is not the point of the story. What it <i>is</i> trying to teach (among other things) is a lesson about crime and repentance. Only by recreating something of the original situation—the brothers are again in control of the life and death of a son of Rahel—can Yosef be sure that they have changed. Once the brothers pass the test, life and covenant can then continue."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Reconciliation 1",Genesis 45:1-28
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Reconciliation 2","In revealing his true identity at last, Yosef makes two points: first, that it was all part of God’s plan; and second, that the family must immediately prepare for migration to Egypt. Thus the personal story is intertwined with the national one, and the text therefore gives limited time and space to psychological details. The motif of God’s plan is stressed by the repetition of “God sent me” (vv.5, 7, 8), while the anticipated bounties of settling in Egypt are brought out by the threefold “good-things of Egypt” (vv.18, 20, 23) and by the repeated exhortation to “come” (vv.18, 19)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Migration to Egypt 1",Genesis 45:16-47:12
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Migration to Egypt 2","Yaakov’s descent to Egypt involves three meetings: with God, with Yosef, and with Pharaoh. The first is God’s final revelation to Yaakov. God had previously forbidden Yitzhak to go to Egypt during a famine (26:1–2), but his son may now go as part of the divine plan, his people’s destiny. The blessing given to Avraham’s children (particularly to Yishmael) is repeated in 46:3, and God will be “with” Yaakov (46:4) on this journey as he has been on others."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Migration to Egypt 3","The meeting between father and long-lost son is brief but powerful, returning as it does to the “face” motif (46:30). Immediately afterward Yosef gives the family advice on how to demonstrate their usefulness to the Egyptians, and one is struck by the precariousness of their situation in even this best of circumstances."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Migration to Egypt 4","Yaakov’s brief audience with Pharaoh is both moving and pathetic. The Patriarch sums up his life in depressing terms, and it becomes clear that long life (he believes his own to be short), in addition to wealth and fertility, is considered a sign of divine favor."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Migration to Egypt 5","The actual migration is sketched in a few brief strokes. The list of names in 46:8–27 has been constructed on patterned numbers, with a total of seventy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yosef the Life Giver 1",Genesis 47:13-26
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yosef the Life Giver 2","The events of this section are not attested historically in Egyptian records. Perhaps they have been included here to confirm Yosef’s stature as Rescuer, not only of his family but of all Egypt as well (see note to 42:2). The description of Yosef’s power is now complete: just as the brothers were ready to “become my lord’s servants” (44:9), so now are the Egyptians (47:25)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yosef the Life Giver 3","Some have seen the episode as an ironic reversal of what is to come in Exodus, with the Egyptians’ enslavement of the Israelites; if so, this interlude may have been an amusing one to ancient Israelite audiences."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yosef the Life Giver 4",The text uses the repetition of the phrase “to/for Pharaoh” to effectively paint the legal transaction.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yosef's Sons Blessed 1",Genesis 48:1-22
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yosef's Sons Blessed 2","Yaakov, near to death, blesses his grandsons (Rahel’s!) in moving terms, bringing full circle many of the motifs of his life. Elder and younger sons are switched by the blind Patriarch, who this time, though, is one who is fully aware of their identities. As in both literature and life, a dying man sees both past (here) and future (the next chapter) with great clarity, as in a vision."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yaakov's Testament and Death 1",Genesis 49:1-33
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yaakov's Testament and Death 2","In this ancient piece of poetry, Yaakov addresses his sons, not as they are, but as they will be. There is little resemblance, for instance, between the Binyamin as the beloved and protected youngest son of the Yosef story and the preying wolf of v.27, but the Benjaminites were later to be known for their military skills. Scholars have therefore seen the entire poem as a retrojection of Israel as it came to be on the days of the Patriarchs."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yaakov's Testament and Death 3","As in the fuller Yosef narrative, the first three sons are quickly disqualified from active leadership, paving the way for the rise of Yehuda (the tribe from which sprang David and the royal house of Israel). Despite this, Yosef still receives the richest blessing."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yaakov's Testament and Death 4","The chapter is textually among the most difficult in the Torah. Many passages are simply obscure, leaving the translator to make at best educated guesses."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yaakov's Burial 1",Genesis 50:1-14
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yaakov's Burial 2","The funeral of Yaakov seems to presage the Exodus from Egypt—here with Pharaoh’s permission and a large royal escort (including “chariots and horsemen,” who in several generations will pursue Yaakov’s descendants into the sea)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, Yaakov's Burial 3","Interestingly, the <i>Iliad</i> also ends with an elaborate burial scene. The contrast is instructive: the Homeric epic celebrates the deeds and mourns the lost youth of a hero (Hector); Genesis reflects Yosef’s standing at court and the desire to bury Yaakov in the land of Canaan, in the family plot. Note too that Genesis has two more scenes, tending to lessen the impact of this impressive funeral sequence."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, The End of the Matter 1",Genesis 50:15-26
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, The End of the Matter 2","Drawing out the tension inherent in the Patriarchs’ family relationships to the very end, the text repeats an earlier situation in Yaakov’s life—his brother’s feelings of “grudge” and threats to kill him—in the guise of his sons’ fears toward Yosef. Here, however, there can be no question of personal vengeance, since Yosef sees the brothers’ betrayal of him as but part of a larger purpose. In his words of v.20, “God planned-it-over for good … to keep many people alive,” the text resolves two of the great hanging issues that have persisted throughout Genesis: sibling hatred and the threat to generational continuity."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Genesis, Part IV; Yosef, The End of the Matter 3","Left hanging, of course, is the issue of the promised land, since the narrative concludes “in Egypt,” but these final chapters lead to the assurance that God will “take account” (vv.24–25) of the Sons of Israel, as they are soon to be termed."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 1",Exodus 1-40
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 2","T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> E<small>XODUS IS</small> I<small>SRAEL’S SECOND BOOK OF ORIGINS</small>. G<small>ENESIS HAD CONCERNED</small> itself with the beginnings of the world, of human beings and their institutions, and of the people of Israel as a tribal family. Exodus continues this thrust as it recounts the origin of the people on a religious and political level (here inseparable as concepts). A number of biblical ideas receive their fullest early treatment in this book: God’s acting directly in history; making himself “known” to both Israelites and foreigners; covenant as a reciprocal agreement between God and humans; law as an expression of total worldview; and the use of sacred structure (Tabernacle or “Dwelling”) as a vehicle for and expression of perceived truths about the world. In addition, several biblical institutions make their first appearance in Exodus: Passover, Sabbath, rudimentary leadership/government, and cult/priesthood. All this is presented in a general narrative framework, raising the question as to whether what we have here is story or history. Is Exodus a fanciful reconstruction of what happened to Moshe (Moses) and his generation, riddled with anachronisms? Or is it a faithful and reliable handing-down of eyewitness data which only the cynical or irreligious would doubt?"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 3","For the first position there are several supports. We possess virtually no extra-biblical references to the events recorded in our book, either in Egypt or elsewhere. Then, too, there seem to be inconsistencies of time within the story (Chaps. 16 and 18 appear to presuppose laws which were given later), and patterns within the telling of the tale that are too symmetrical (the Plagues) or too stereotyped (the constant use of stylized language) to be simple reporting of fact. Finally, Exodus is lacking in the citation of personal and geographical names, especially as compared to the books that precede and follow (Genesis and Numbers)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 4","For the second position, that of Exodus as a reliable historical record, there exist no methods of proof other than evaluation of literary form—that is, accepting that oral literature is able to preserve facts without later coloration. But even if it could be shown that Exodus is oral literature—an evaluation which is too sweeping, given the present form of the book—modern scholarship has come to cast doubt on the absolute historical reliability of oral tradition (see Vansina)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 5","Despite these observations, there is still something unsettling about writing Exodus off as a work of fiction, however pious that fiction may have been. For the rest of the Hebrew Bible abounds in emotional references to the experience of the exodus. At every stage of biblical literature, that experience is invoked for the purpose of directing behavior (see especially Judg. 2, I Sam. 8, II Sam. 7, II Kings 17, Neh. 9, and Ps. 78; and most of Deuteronomy is rhetorically grounded in it). The entire structure and emotional force of biblical law rest upon such exhortations as “A sojourner you are not to oppress:/you yourselves know (well) the feelings of the sojourner,/for sojourners were you in the land of Egypt” (Ex. 23:9) and such situations as that of the Hebrew serf (Ex. 21:2ff.). Apparently the experience of the exodus period was crucial in forming the group consciousness of the Israelites, and ever since it has provided a model from which both later Judaism and Christianity were to draw frequently and profoundly."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 6","A hypothetical analogy, based on American history, may help to shed light on the historicity of Exodus. Imagine a book based on the following outline: first, a section on the American Revolution, with some biographical material on a few of the Founding Fathers, focusing mostly on the outbreak of the war and key battles; second, a description of the Constitutional Convention, including some of the more important speeches and discussions; third, the text of the Constitution itself; and finally, L’Enfant’s original blueprints for the building of the new capital, Washington, D.C., interspersed with accounts of the first few presidents’ inaugural addresses. What would be the underlying message of such a book? We are certainly dealing here with more than a straight journalistic description of the events, more than a legalistic discussion of constitutional law, and more than a technical presentation for architects. Such a book would actually be presenting the ideals of America’s self-image: a nation founded on the willingness to fight for particular rights against Old World tyranny, established under democratic laws based on reason and providing governmental checks and balances, and whose ideals would be embodied in the construction of a brand-new, centrally located capital city that used classically grounded forms of architecture to express grace and reason as the basis for the new society."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 7","Now this portrayal is very simplistic, but it gets its point across (and I would be willing to wager that, somewhere in this country, there exists a school textbook written along these lines). In a similar manner, although with much more weight given to God’s role in the process, the book of Exodus unfolds. The dramatic story of Israel’s deliverance from bondage, coupled with Moshe’s own early development, is only the first part of the book, and accounts for less than half of it. It is followed by several stories of desert wanderings, and then by a presentation of the covenant made between God and Israel at Sinai, against a stunning natural backdrop. The second half of the book enumerates a series of laws which constitute the covenant, and the details of construction of a portable sanctuary designed both to symbolize and actually to accommodate God’s presence among the Israelites (with the interruption of a major rebellion). So, like our theoretical American model, Exodus conveys far more than information about events. It is, rather, the narration of a worldview, a laying out of different types of texts bearing the <i>meaning</i> of Israel’s historical experience."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 8","I stress the word “experience” because that is what is at stake here. Human memory is always selective. We remember what we wish to remember, giving weight to particular emotions, sometimes over and above the facts (or, as the poet Maya Angelou puts it autobiographically, “The facts sometimes obscure the truth”). The same thing appears to be true of group memory. What a people remembers of substance is not nearly as important as how they process their experience."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 9","In our Exodus text one can perceive a characteristically Israelite process at work. The book emerges as a mix of historical recollection, mythical processing, and didactic retelling, what Buber and others have called a “saga.” What is preserved in the book of Exodus, therefore, is a Teaching (Heb. <i>Tora</i>) based on a set of experiences, which became history for ancient Israel. Hence, to understand better the workings of the book, we need to turn to its themes and its structure. This will be more fruitful than trying to find the exact location of the Sea of Reeds or Mount Sinai, or the “Lost Ark,” or Moshe’s burial site— of whose location “no man has knowledge until this day” (Deut. 34:6). These have all receded into archeological oblivion. What has survived of ancient Israel is its approach to history and to life, and its literature. In that sense, the book of Exodus is an attempt to distill history and to learn from it, using echoes from the past to shape the present and the future."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 10","When we turn to a closer consideration of the structure of Exodus, we must proceed on the assumption that a work of art stems from both artful and unconscious design. Therefore, any structuring of such a book can only be hypothetical and must not limit itself to ironclad categories."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 11","With that said, a number of potential divisions of our book present themselves. The first emerges from a close look at the subject matter of the text. Strikingly, Exodus appears to be arranged in groups of a few chapters each (bearing in mind that the chapter divisions are historically late), resulting in the following scheme:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 12","1. Prologue in Egypt (Chap. 1)<br>2. Moshe’s Early Life and Call (Chaps. 2–4)<br>3. Moshe’s Mission in Egypt (5:1–7:13)<br>4. The First Nine Plagues (7:14–10:29)<br>5. The Tenth Plague and the Exodus (Chaps. 11–13)<br>6. In the Wilderness I: The Deliverance at the Sea (14:1–15:21)<br>7. In the Wilderness II: Early Experiences (15:22–18:27)<br>8. Covenant at Sinai (Chaps. 19–20)<br>9. The Terms (Laws) and Conclusion of the Covenant (Chaps. 21–24)<br>10. Details of the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25–27)<br>11. Details of the Cult (Chaps. 28–31)<br>12. Rebellion and Reconciliation (Chaps. 32–34)<br>13. The Building of the Tabernacle, Priestly Vestments (Chaps. 35–39)<br>14. Conclusion (Chap. 40)"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 13",Such a measured shifting of focus helps to maintain the flow of the text and our interest in it.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 14","A glance through this list will also lead to the positing of larger structures. The traditions collected in Exodus fall naturally into both geographical and thematic divisions. The first part of the book takes place in Egypt (1:1–15:21), the second in the wilderness (15:22–40:38); this could alternatively be viewed as the events preceding Mount Sinai (Chaps. 1–17/18) and those that take place there (Chaps. 18/19–40). One could also combine the geographical and thematic aspects, resulting in the structure (1) Israel in Egypt (1:1–15:21), (2) Israel in the Wilderness (15:22–24:18), and (3) Tabernacle and Calf (Chaps. 25–40)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 15","My own preference for structuring Exodus also combines these aspects, as follows:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 16",I. The Deliverance Narrative (1:1–15:21)
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 17",II. In the Wilderness (15:22–18:27)
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 18",III. Covenant and Law (Chaps. 19–24)
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 19",IV. The Blueprints for the Tabernacle and Its Service (Chaps. 25–31)
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 20",V. Infidelity and Reconciliation (Chaps. 32–34)
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 21",VI. The Building of the Tabernacle (Chaps. 35–40)
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 22","These divisions exhibit a great deal of overlapping. In Part I, Israel’s life in Egypt (Chap. 1) paves the way for Moshe’s early years (Chaps. 2–4), then the account of his mission before Pharaoh and the Plagues (Chaps. 5–13), and the final victory (Chaps. 14–15); Part II is anticipated by some of what happens after the exodus itself (Chap. 14), and leads to Sinai (Chap. 19); the covenant and laws of Part III naturally lead to other prescriptions, this time the building instructions for the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25–31); planning the sacred structure in Part IV is followed by the making of a forbidden construction, the Golden Calf (Chaps. 32–33); and the reconciliation between God and Israel (Chap. 34) restores Israel’s capacity to return to the actual building of the Tabernacle, and to complete it (Chaps. 35–40). So despite the presence of what must have been several very diverse traditions behind the final text of Exodus, it has been skillfully woven together to form a coherent whole. In addition to the above structures, it can be said that the book of Exodus rests on several textual backbones, inner structures and recurring themes and motifs that help to create a unified work. These may be listed by category:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 23","1. There are various climaxes which serve to highlight the action—the Encounter at the Bush (Chaps. 3–4), the Tenth Plague and Exodus (12:29–42), the Deliverance at the Sea (14–15:21), the Revelation at Sinai (Chaps. 19–20), the Calf Episode (Chap. 32), and Completion of the Tabernacle (Chap. 40). Anchoring these dramatic scenes, at the center of the book, is the Sinai Revelation. The Binding of Yitzhak (Isaac) in Chapter 22 of Genesis serves much the same focusing function."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 24","2. There exist three strategically placed accounts of God’s Presence accompanying the Israelites (13:21–22, 24:15–18, 40:34–38) which share a common vocabulary. Key words in these passages are “day/night,” “cloud,” “fire,” “dwell,” “Glory,” “cover,” “go up,” and “in the eyes of the Children of Israel/before the people” (it should be noted that not every passage uses all of these terms). These words chart God’s movement: first, following the Exodus; second, following the concluding of the covenant; and third, following the erection of the Tabernacle, at the end of the book. A variation of these Presence accounts occurs in Numbers 9:15–23, where it rounds out the picture—for it is at this point that the Israelites finally depart from Sinai (having spent about a year there), on their journey toward the Promised Land."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 25",3. Several leading words recur throughout the book and give it a sense of unity:
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 26","<i>serve</i>— The Israelites pass from “servitude” to Pharaoh into the “service” of God; laws are given that warn against “serving” other gods, that specify how a “serf” is to be treated, and that detail the “service” (i.e., construction and dismantling) of a sanctuary where God is to be properly “served.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 27","<i>Glory</i>—Liberated from Pharaoh’s “stubbornness” (Heb. <i>koved lev</i>), the Israelites experience God’s “Glory” (Heb. <i>kavod</i>) at the Sea of Reeds, and encounter it again at Sinai (Chap. 24) and when the Tabernacle is completed (Chap. 40). When Israel falters in Chapter 32, Moses begs to see God’s “Glory” as a sign of reassurance. This is one of the central issues of the book, receiving its clearest formulation in Chap. 17:7—“Is Y<small>HWH</small> in our midst, or not?” Without the accompanying Presence, the Israelites can survive neither in Egypt nor in the wilderness. That the book ends with the “Glory” taking up residence in the Tabernacle is a sign that all is well in this regard."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 28",<i>know</i>—The Plagues and the liberation take place so that Egyptian and Israelite alike will acknowledge God as the true ruler (who “knows” the slaves’ sufferings). The book as a whole portrays a God who is “known” by his compassion toward the oppressed.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 29",<i>see</i>—God “sees” and rescues the people early in the book (Chap. 3); they “see” his deliverance at the sea (Chap. 14) and the awesome display at Sinai (Chaps. 19-20); the Tabernacle blueprint is given to Moshe to “see” (Chaps 25ff.).
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 30","4. Aside from theme words, there are also several thematic threads that run through the book. These may be listed as well:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 31","<i>distinction</i>—The Israelites learn what it is to be separated out, first for oppression and later for God’s service. This process occurs during the Plagues and throughout the legal sections, which are often based on the making of distinctions (the Hebrew word for “holy,” <i>kadosh,</i> may originally have had this connotation). In general, Exodus is a book that abounds in polarities and distinctions: between God and Pharaoh, life and death, slavery and freedom, Egyptianness and Israeliteness, city and wilderness, visible gods/magic and an invisible God who is not conjurable, doubt and trust."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 32","<i>construction</i>—The Israelites are enslaved as builders of Egyptian cities; they go on to build a society, a calf-god, and a Tabernacle."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 33","<i>rebellion</i>—From the beginning, God and Moshe are often unheeded, as the Israelites seek to maintain or return to their status as dependent slaves in Egypt (Chaps. 2, 5, 14, 15–17, 32)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 34","<i>Sabbath</i>—As a newly freed people, Israel is to adapt to a rhythm of work and sacred cessation, which celebrates both creation and freedom. The Sabbath is at issue immediately after liberation (Chap. 16) and is commanded three times (Chaps. 20, 31, 35); and the account of the Tabernacle’s completion echoes the vocabulary of God’s completed creation in Genesis 2, a passage which serves as one justification for observing the Sabbath (see Ex. 20:11)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 35","<i>origins</i>—We are told of the beginnings of the new covenant (distinct from that concluded with Abraham), the law system, the cult/priesthood, and the sacred calendar, but with the significant omission of the monarchy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 36","<i>covenant</i>—God establishes a relationship with the people of Israel: if they will obey him and observe his laws, he will protect them and treat them as his “firstborn son.” This form of covenant is different from the ones in Genesis, and plays a significant role in subsequent books of the Bible."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 37","<i>God in History</i>—The God of Exodus actively intervenes to rescue a people, defeating their oppressors in battle; he leads them through the wilderness, meets them, and makes a covenant with them."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 38","5. The above themes are specifically Israelite themes. There are, however, motifs in Exodus that have a more universal ring. One could term these anthropological, since they employ standard aspects of human experience to convey the overall messages of the book."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 39","<i>Fire</i> is used frequently and in varied contexts (at the Burning Bush and later back at Mount Sinai, in the desert trek, in the Tabernacle service, and at the Calf incident), usually to make a statement about God. In contrast to conventional fire gods (e.g., the Norse trickster Loki), the God of Exodus is most often associated with the more positive aspects of fire: constancy, purity, and transformation. The fire at Sinai does not destroy Moshe and the people, but rather turns them into something new. At the same time it should not be forgotten that fire is used regularly to connote anger in the Bible, especially God’s, and especially in the later wilderness narratives."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 40","<i>Water</i> appears throughout Exodus, not as a backdrop but as an active medium which most often signifies life and death simultaneously. The Nile, into which the enslaved Hebrews’ babies are thrown, gently bears the infant Moshe to safety: the Nile, the giver of life in Egypt, is changed into blood, itself a major signifier of life in the Bible but useless here because it is undrinkable; the Sea of Reeds acts as a passageway of birth for the Israelites but as a graveyard for their Egyptian pursuers. The availability of water becomes a central issue in the wilderness, as an instrument for survival and for the testing of the Israelites’ faith. Finally, water creates the ritual purity necessary for the people at Sinai and their priests in the Tabernacle to approach God."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 41","<i>Desert/Wilderness</i> is the scene of the crucial second part of the book. Only in the desert, away from the massive influence of age-old Egyptian culture, can the new Israelite society be forged. Moshe, like many other real-life and fictional heroes, demonstrates this in his own early life. The desert acts as a purifying agent for him, changing the Egyptian prince into a member of his own true people. Similarly, the Israelites begin the process of transformation from bondage to self-rule, a process which is taught in the harsh reality of desert life and which will take an entire generation to complete."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 42","In point of fact, all these media—fire, water, and desert—suggest change as a major concern of the book of Exodus. Our text chronicles the start of Israel’s journey as a nation, a transformative journey which takes vastly changed circumstances, a whole generation in time, and indeed several books of recounting to complete. Exodus is very concerned with topography—not for the purposes of historical recollection (as Genesis was, apparently) but as an account of an inner journey. Thus the people travel to the boundary between Egypt and the desert, through the sea, to the great fiery mountain; and we know that they cannot but be on their way to a final goal. That goal, the Promised Land, will not be realized in Exodus, because in this book we stand only at the beginning of the journey. Change does not occur quickly, and the true molding of a people, like that of an individual, requires formative experiences over time. In Exodus, then, the People of Israel begins in adolescence, as it were. It has survived infancy in Genesis, a period marked by constant threats of physical extinction, and must now begin the tortuous process of learning to cope with adulthood—that is to say, people-hood—in a hostile world."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 43","That process will take us past the present text. Exodus stands at the beginning of a trilogy in the middle of the Torah. It takes us from slavery up to Sinai, inaugurating the law-giving process. Leviticus will concentrate almost exclusively on laws (of “holiness”), never budging geographically, while Numbers will see the conclusion of the Sinai experience and the traveling toward (and actually reaching) the land of Israel. Exodus is thus of great importance in the overall five-book pattern, introducing key elements of the wilderness books: law, institutions, rebellion, and—Moshe himself. It serves as a bridge between the great narratives of Genesis and the priestly code of Leviticus and the wanderings of Numbers (Green­berg 1972 notes how the opening of Exodus points back, to Gen. 46; and the closing points forward, to Num. 9). It in fact contains elements of all three books."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure 44","Exodus is the basis not only of what follows in the Torah, but also sets the stage for the rest of the Hebrew Bible. What Israel understood of its God, and what that God expects of them, are set forth most directly and unforgettably in the memories enshrined in the book of Exodus."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 1",Exodus 1:1–15:21
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 2","T<small>HE FIRST PART OF THE BOOK OF</small> E<small>XODUS IS PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF THE</small> Genesis narratives, by abbreviating the genealogy of the immigrant Yaakov from Gen. 46:8–25. We find here the same centrality of God, the same kind of sparse but powerful biographical sketch of the human hero, and a narrative style similar to that of the previous book."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 3","And yet Exodus introduces a new and decisive element into the Hebrew Bible, which becomes paradigmatic for future generations of biblical writers. The book speaks of a God who acts directly in history, blow by blow—a God who promises, liberates, guides, and gives laws to a people. This is, to be sure, an outgrowth of a God who brings the Flood and disperses the Babel generation, but it is also a decisive step forward from a God who works his will in the background, through intrafamily conflicts (which comprise most of Genesis). This deity frees his people, not by subterfuge, but by directly taking on Egypt and its gods. Pharaoh and the Nile, both of which were considered divine in Egypt, are in the end forced to yield to superior power. Surely it is no accident that the ending of Part I—the Song of Moshe at the Sea—hails Y<small>HWH</small> as Israel’s true king, a king whose acts of “leading,” “redeeming,” and “planting” his people are exultingly affirmed in the body of the Song."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 4","Part I receives its structural coherence in a number of ways. For one, it encompasses a straight chronological narrative, moving from Israel’s enslavement to its liberation and triumph over its oppressors. The ending, Chapter 15, is rhetorically and stylistically fitting (see Gaster 1969), celebrating as it does the mighty deeds of God. For another, Part I carefully paces its climaxes, building up from the Burning Bush to various stages of Plagues, to the Tenth Plague/exodus and finally the great scene at the sea. There are also a number of key words that help to tie together various sections of the narratives: “know,” “serve,” and “see.” All of these go through interesting changes in meaning, through which one can trace the movement of central ideas (see the Commentary)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 5","In the area of vocabulary, David Daube (1963) has made the interesting observation that the Deliverance Narrative uses a number of verbs that occur regularly in biblical law regarding the formal release of a slave: “send free” (Heb. <i>shale’ah’</i>), “drive out” (<i>garesh</i>), and “go out” (<i>yatzo</i>’). In addition, the motif of the Israelites’ “stripping” the Egyptians (3:22, 12:36) links up with the regulation of release in Deut. 15:13. “… you are not to send him free empty-handed.” Daube sees our text as bearing the stamp of Israelite social custom: Pharaoh is made to flout “established social regulations.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 6","Finally, several scholars (Kikawada, Ackerman 1974, Fishbane 1979, and Isbell) have pointed out that the vocabulary of the first few chapters of the book foreshadows the whole of Part I. This use of sound and idea helps to create unity in these narratives (despite their possibly diverse origins), and is also of importance in viewing the biographical material in the first four chapters."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 7",<b>T<small>HE</small> E<small>ARLY</small> L<small>IFE OF</small> M<small>OSHE AND</small> R<small>ELIGIOUS</small> B<small>IOGRAPHY</small></b>
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 8","Dominating the early chapters of Exodus, more than the description of bondage itself, is the figure of the reluctant liberator, Moshe. The portrayal of his beginnings contrasts strongly with the classic hero stories of the ancient world."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 9","This is not immediately apparent. Moshe’s birth narrative parallels that of King Sargon of Akkad; his flight from Egypt and return as leader are reminiscent of Jephthah and David in the Bible, and of the Syrian king Idrimi (as recounted in Akkadian texts) as well. In addition, half a century ago Lord Raglan attempted to demonstrate common elements in hero biographies by compiling a list of up to thirty key motifs. Those relevant to Moshe include: the father a relative of the mother, an attempt made to kill him at birth, his escape through the action of others, being raised by foster parents, little information about his childhood, his traveling to his “future kingdom” upon reaching adulthood, promulgating laws, losing favor with the deity, dying on the top of a hill, not being succeeded by his children, and a hazy death/burial. Moshe therefore shares with Oedipus, Hercules, Siegfried, and Robin Hood, among others, a host of common elements; his point total according to Raglan’s scheme puts him toward the top of the list as an archetypal traditional hero. It must be concluded that, far from being a factual account, his biography is composed largely of literary constructs."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 10","When one looks closer at the biblical portrayal of Moshe, however, the purpose and particularly Israelite thrust of these constructs becomes clear. Almost every key element in Moshe’s early life—e.g., rescue from death by royal decree, rescue from death by water, flight into the desert, meeting with God on the sacred mountain—foreshadows Israel’s experience in the book of Exodus. The key theme of the distinction between Israel and Egypt, so central to the Plague Narrative and to Israelite religion as a whole, is brought out beautifully in the depiction of Moshe’s development from Egyptian prince to would-be liberator to shepherd in the wilderness, the latter an ancestral calling (cf. Nohrnberg, who also discusses Yosef as developing in exactly the opposite direction—from Israelite shepherd boy to Egyptian viceroy, complete with Egyptian appearance, wife, and name). What is important in these early chapters of Exodus, then, is not the customary focus on the young hero’s deeds (e.g., Hercules strangling serpents in the cradle) or his fatal flaw (although there is a hint of this too!), but on what he shares with his people, or, more precisely, how he prefigures them."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 11","Another aspect of these stories removes them from the usual realm of heroic biography. Elsewhere in the Bible, individual hero types are at least partially overshadowed by the true central “character”: God. This appears to be true in Exodus as well. Moshe develops only so far; he recedes as a full-blown personality during the Plague Narrative, to emerge sporadically in later encounters with the people (e.g., Chaps. 16 and 32–33; the portrait expands in the narratives of the book of Numbers). No wonder that later Jewish legend (and further, Christian and Muslim stories as well) found it necessary to fill in the tantalizing hints left by the biblical biographer, with sometimes fantastic tales. But in the Exodus text, it is God who holds sway. In this context, one is reminded that Israelite thinking had room neither for worship of human heroes nor interest in the biography of God (i.e., divine birth and marriage) on the model of surrounding cultures. The biblical portrayal of both God and Moshe has been reduced in our book to only such facts as will illuminate the relationship between Israel and its God. Thus we learn from the Moshe of Exodus much about the people themselves, and about prophecy (cf. Chaps. 3-4); from the God of Exodus, how he acts in history and what he demands of the people. More than that is not easily forthcoming from our text (interestingly, the Passover Haggadah picked up on the Bible’s direction and all but omitted Moshe’s name in the celebration of the holiday)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 12","As we have suggested, later Jewish legend—some of which may actually be of great antiquity—sought to fill in various aspects of Moshe’s life that are missing from the Exodus text. A perusal of Ginzberg will uncover rich legendary material, dealing with Moshe’s childhood, family identity, experience in Midyan and elsewhere as a hero. While this material does not always illuminate the biblical story, it does demonstrate how folk belief includes a need for heroes in the classic Raglan mold; the Midrashic portrait of Moshe corresponds nicely to what we find in other cultures."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 13","Turning to stylistic characteristics of these early chapters, we may note that a good deal of repetition occurs, as if further to highlight the themes. Baby Moshe is saved from death twice; three times he attempts acts of opposing oppression; twice (Chaps. 2 and 5) he fails in his attempts to help his enslaved brothers; and twice (Chaps. 3 and 6) God reassures him with long speeches that center around the Divine Name. This kind of continuity is artfully literary, but it is also an echo of real life, where people often live out certain themes in patterns."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 14","Finally there is the matter of recurring words. Most important is the telling use of “see,” from the loving gaze of Moshe’s mother (2:2), through to the auspicious glance of Pharaoh’s daughter (2:6), then to Moshe’s sympathetic observing of his brothers’ plight (2:11); all this seems to be linked to the episode at the Burning Bush, where God “is seen” by the future leader (3:2), and where the climax of this whole development takes place: God affirms that he has “seen, yes, seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt…. and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them” (3:7, 9). Thus Moshe’s biography leads to, and is an outgrowth of, the people’s own situation."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 15","In sum, Moshe’s early biography leads us to ponder the “growing up” process through which the people of Israel must pass on their way out of Egypt. The narratives that deal with his leadership of the people in the wilderness period, from Ex. <i>16</i> on, will help to round out our picture of him as a real personality, with the tragedies and triumphs that are a part of human life but magnified in the case of great individuals."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 16",<b>O<small>N THE</small> J<small>OURNEY</small> M<small>OTIF</small></b>
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 17","World literature is dominated by stories involving a journey. More often than not, these tales are framed as quests for holy or magical objects (e.g., the Holy Grail), or for eternal youth/immortality (Gilgamesh). The classic pattern, as Joseph Campbell has described it, calls for the hero to make a kind of round trip, crossing dangerous thresholds (monsters, giants, unfriendly supernatural beings) both on the way toward the goal and on the way home. Either at the middle or at the end of the journey stands the goal, which often entails meeting with the divine and/or obtaining a magical or life-giving object (e.g., the Golden Fleece)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 18","Such stories mirror our own longings for accomplishment and acceptance, as well as our universal desire to overcome the ultimate enemy, Death. In the hero’s triumphs, we triumph; his vanquishing of death cathartically becomes our own."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 19","This mythic substructure has penetrated the biblical tales, but it has been toned down for human protagonists, to suppress the idea of the mortal hero in favor of the divine one. Thus all the Patriarchs except Yitzhak (Isaac) go on fateful long journeys (his is reserved for the three-day trip to Moriah in Gen. 22), yet there is none of the color and adventure that we find, for example, in Greek mythology. Outside of Yaakov’s encounter with the mysterious wrestler in Gen. 32, there is little in Genesis to suggest hero tales on the classic mold. In Exodus, too, Moshe makes a significant journey—to Midyan—one might say, within himself, to find his true identity and calling, but it is highly muted, containing virtually no details. The round trip contains two thresholds of death, with Moshe first threatened by Pharaoh’s justice (2:15) and, on the way back to Egypt, by God himself (4:24–26). The initial goal is attained at the “mountain of God” “behind the wilderness,” where, meeting with divinity amid fire, he is finally able to integrate his own past, present, and future (as he will return to this mountain with the entire people in Chaps. 19ff). At the Burning Bush, the Egyptian prince, the Israelite shepherd, and the Hebrew liberator coalesce, investing Moshe with unique qualifications for his task."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 20","But it is to a larger journey framework that we must look to understand the “hero” content of Exodus, and with it, that of the Torah as a whole. The major journey undertaken is, of course, that of the people of Israel, from slavery to Promised Land. It is also a journey from death to life, from servitude to god-king to the service of God as king; along the way, death serves to purify an entire generation. And yet even this most obvious of journey stories differs markedly from those of gods and heroes so familiar in Western culture. The people of Israel function as a collective antihero, an example of precisely how not to behave. They play no active role whatsoever in their own liberation, use neither brawn nor wits to survive in the wilderness, constantly grumble about wanting to return to Egypt, and at both Sinai and the threshold of the Promised Land (in the book of Numbers), their chief form of behavior is first fear and later rebellion."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 21","Moshe’s own journeys parallel those of the entire people later on. Like them, he flees from Pharaoh into the wilderness, meets God at flaming Sinai, and has trouble accepting his task but must in the end. Here is where Moshe shines as the true leader: he epitomizes his people’s experience and focuses and forges it into something new."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 23","The heart of the Exodus story sets out the confrontation between the visible god-king, Pharaoh, who embodies the monumental culture of Egypt, and the invisible God of Israel who fights for his ragtag people. The drama is conveyed by means of alternating conversations/confrontations and events. The narrator has built his account, bracketed by the early approach of Moshe and Aharon (Aaron) to Pharaoh, which fails (Chap. 5), and the extended construct of the Tenth Plague (11—13); in between fall the schematically arranged first nine plagues."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 24","Three overall stages characterize this latter section. The first is indicated by the oft-repeated demand, “Send free my people, that they may serve me!”; the second is the “hardening” of Pharaoh’s heart; and the third, the unleashing of each plague. Further, it can be shown that the plagues are presented via a variety of structures and substructures (see Greenberg 1969 and the chart in Sarna 1986). Some commentators divide them into five thematic groups of two apiece—1 and 2, the Nile; 3 and 4, insects; 5 and 6, disease; 7 and 8, airborne disaster; and 9 and 10, darkness/death (Plaut). Also fruitful is the following threefold division: 1, 4, and 7, God’s command to confront Pharaoh in the morning; 2,5, and 8, God says, “Come to Pharaoh”; 3, 6, and 9, no warning is given to Pharaoh. Yet another grouping of themes is possible (Bar Efrat): 1–3, God vs. the magicians of Egypt; 4–6, stress on the distinction between Israel and Egypt; 7–9, the most powerful plagues."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 25","This utilization of order, symbolized by “perfect” numbers such as 3 and 10, finds a parallel in the creation story of Genesis 1 (where the key number, of course, is 7, 3 + 3 + 1, whereas here we have 3 + 3 + 3 + 1). Both texts display a desire to depict God as one who endows nature and history with meaning. The poetic tradition about the plagues, as represented, for instance, by Psalm 78, was content to describe the plagues in brief, within the setting of a single poem. The narrator of the Pentateuchal traditions, however, has a different point to make, and structured exposition is the best way to do it."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 26","There is another structural tendency that one may observe in the Plague Narrative. Repeating words and motifs comprise over twenty shared and discrete elements in the story. Since the vast majority of these occur by the end of the fourth plague, this leaves the narrator free to develop plagues 7 and 8 with particular intensity, using a full palette of descriptions, with the addition of the theme that these were the worst of their kind ever to take place in Egypt. It will be useful here to list a few of the key words and phrases, and motifs, that can be found in the Plague Narrative:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 27","<i>Words/phrases:</i> Go to Pharaoh; send … free; know; throughout the land of Egypt; plead; distinguish; tomorrow; man and beast; not one remained; heavy [i.e., severe] as Y<small>HWH</small> had said."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 28",<i>Motifs:</i> Moshe’s staff; Aharon as agent; magicians; death.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 29","It is important to note here that the structuring of the plagues is not a perfectly balanced one. The narrative varies between exact repetition of elements and phrases and nonrepetition (Licht). By thus using sounds and ideas in variation, the narrator is able to weave a tale whose message constantly reinforces itself, and which holds the audience’s attention without getting tedious."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 30","I have deliberately omitted the question of Pharaoh’s heart above, as a separate issue. A host of expressions is used in the text to describe Pharaoh’s stubbornness: “harden” (Heb. <i>hiksha</i>), “make heavy-with-stubbornness” (<i>hakhbed</i>), and “strengthen” (<i>hehezik/hazzek</i>), with the resultant “refused” and “did not hearken.” This motif is the only one that occurs in all nine plagues, and therefore stands at the very heart of our narrative. When one notes the pattern within—that Pharaoh does the hardening at the beginning, God at the end—the intent begins to become clear. The Plague Narrative is a recounting of God’s power, and Pharaoh’s stubbornness, which starts out as a matter of will, eventually becomes impossible to revoke. The model is psychologically compelling: Pharaoh becomes trapped by his own refusal to accept the obvious (in biblical parlance, to “know”). Despite the prophetic idea that human beings can be forgiven, we find here another one—that evil leads to more evil, and can become petrified and unmovable."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative 31","A final note about the backdrop of these stories. Cecil B. DeMille did it differently, and in the difference lies the gap between Western culture and biblical culture. In the movie <i>The Ten Commandments</i> (a strange title, given the actual content of the film!), DeMille’s own 1956 remake of his earlier silent film, great stress is put on the physical, visual trappings of Pharoah’s court. Apparently no expense was spared to bring in costumes, sets, and extras, and the result causes the audience to focus on the splendor of Egyptian culture, despite the fact that it is peopled by the villains of the story. In contrast, the Bible says practically nothing about the visual backdrop of the Plague Narrative. Just as Genesis made reference to the mighty culture of Babylonia by parodying it (for instance, in the Babel story of Chap. 11), Exodus strips down Egyptian culture by making it disappear, and by ridiculing its gods. The book saves descriptive minutiae for the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25ff.), preferring to stress the positive and simply to omit what it found as negative. This profoundly “anticultural” stance (see the intriguing analysis by Schneidau) was characteristic of Israel’s worldview and was a mystery to the Greeks and Romans who centuries later conquered the land; it was to stand the people of Israel in good stead in their wanderings through the centuries."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Prologue in Egypt 1",Exodus 1:1-22
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Prologue in Egypt 2","Rather than being presented as a totally separate story, the book of Exodus opens as a continuation of the Genesis saga. This is true both specifically and generally: the first five verses echo and compress the information about the descent of Yaakov’s family into Egypt that was given in Gen. 46:8–27, while “Now these are the names” (v.1) recalls the oft-repeated formula “Now these are the begettings,” which forms the structural background of Genesis. At the same time one might note that the main subject matter of our chapter, life and death (or, threatened continuity), is central to the thematic content of Genesis (see my <i>At the Beginning,</i> “On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure”)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Prologue in Egypt 3","Kikawada and Ackerman (1974) have shown that the opening chapters of Exodus reflect other Genesis material as well. For instance, the five verbs in v.7 mirror the language of creation (Gen. 1:28 and 9:1–2), where a similar vocabulary of fecundity signals the divine desire to “fill the earth.” It is as if Israel’s “becoming many” in Exodus fulfills the plan of history inaugurated at creation, at the same time reminding us of God’s promise to Avraham, to make his descendants as numerous “as the stars in the heavens and [as] the sand that is on the shore of the sea” (Gen. 22:17)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Prologue in Egypt 4","This leads to the predominant issue of Chap. 1: Pharaoh’s paranoid fears about Israel’s growth. What for God was a sign of blessing (cf. the “swarming” of creatures in Gen. 1:20f.) is for Pharaoh a sign of disaster, a feeling of being overwhelmed by what is alien. The birth of the Israelite nation is thus placed in a vivid context, completely physical in its description. And because birth, and not the economic aspects of slavery, is central, the actual description of the oppression of the Hebrews has been reduced to a bare minimum here. Contrary to DeMille’s spectacular and stereotyped portrayal of the Israelites’ sufferings, the Bible limits itself to a few brief verses in the early chapters of the book. The same holds true for parallel depictions of bondage in biblical literature, such as Psalms 78 and 105. It is the experience of being a stranger in Egypt that the Bible has chosen to focus on, rather than on the horrors of slave labor."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Prologue in Egypt 5","In Exodus, the Egyptians cannot stand having aliens among them (this theme has already appeared in Genesis regarding their eating habits—see Gen. 43:32); they dread their presence and fear their increase. A natural plan of attack, to stem the human tide, is genocide. Ironically, because of his fear of war Pharaoh concentrates his worries around the males, ignoring the true source of fecundity. And it is the women in these chapters, as many commentators have pointed out (see Exum), who play the major role in beginning the liberation process. The midwives accomplish a successful coverup; Moshe’s mother and sister, and Pharaoh’s daughter, save the future liberator’s life. “If she be a daughter, she may live” (v.16), along with four other occurrences of “live” in vv.17–22, underscore the irony and the certainty of Israelite survival. The use of women—a group that was often powerless in ancient societies—in these stories makes the eventual victory of the Israelites all the more striking from a traditional patriarchal point of view (see Ackerman 1982); the motif returns a number of times in Israelite literature, as with Jael and Judith."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Prologue in Egypt 6","Failing in his commissioning of special agents (midwives) to carry out his genocidal plan, Pharaoh finally must enlist “all his people” (v.22), and shift the scene to a cosmic setting, the Nile. The stage is thus set for the birth, endangering, and rescue of Moshe."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Prologue in Egypt 7","The historically minded reader may ask: Why would the ruler of a society that is (literally) built on slavery destroy his own workforce? Two answers are possible. First, the story is tied to Chap. 2, the survival of Moshe, and thus must be told to that end (a threat to males). Second, the story does not describe a rational fear, but paranoia—paralleling the situation in Nazi Germany of the 1930s and 1940s, where Jews were blamed for various economic and political catastrophes not of their own making and were eliminated from a society that could have used their resources and manpower."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Moshe's Birth and Early Life 2","Picking up from the last phrase of Chap. 1, “let every daughter live,” Chap. 2 opens as a story of three daughters (the word occurs six times here), Moshe’s real and foster mothers, and his sister."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Moshe's Birth and Early Life 3","It has long been maintained that the story of Moshe’s birth is a classic “birth of the hero” tale, sharing many features with other heroes of antiquity. (See p. 250.) The parallel most often drawn is that of Sargon of Akkad, whose birth story is set in an era before Moshe but was written down later; similar elements include being separated from the real parents through a death threat, and being set adrift on the river. Hallo cites other parallels in Hittite and Egyptian literature, noting at the same time that “none of them includes all of the elements of the Moses birth legend.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Moshe's Birth and Early Life 4","If, as I maintained in the introduction (“On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure”), most of this material has been collected for didactic and not for historical purposes, we are entitled to ask what this story was intended to teach. It cannot simply be written off as an attempt to explain away Moshe’s name and origins. Two elements seem crucial. First, the text as we have it centers around the activity of women—giving birth, hiding, watching and adopting Moshe. The female principle of life-giving triumphs over the male prerogatives of threatening and death-dealing; the Nile, source of all life in Egypt, births another child. Second, the story and its continuation to the end of the chapter set up Moshe as a man of two sides: Hebrew and Egyptian. He is at once archetypal victim (of Pharaoh’s death decree) and archetypal collaborator, growing up, as he apparently does, in Pharaoh’s palace. What are we to make of this two-sided fate and personality? It may well have been intended as a reflex of the people of Israel itself. Often in the Hebrew Bible the hero’s life mirrors that of Israel (see Greenstein 1981), and the case of Moshe is a good example. Moshe develops into a Hebrew—that is, he eventually recovers his full identity. This is accomplished, first, through his empathy with and actions on behalf of “his brothers” (vv.11, 12), then through his exile from Egypt, and finally through the purifying life in the wilderness as a shepherd. Thus Moshe’s personality changes are wrought by means of separations, and the same process will characterize the coming Plague Narrative (with its emphasis on “distinction” between Egypt and Israel) and the entire Israelite legal and ritual system, which stresses holiness and separation."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Moshe's Birth and Early Life 5","The first section of the chapter (vv.1–10) uses a number of repeating words: “take” appears four times, indicative of divine protection; “child,” seven times (Greenberg 1969); and “see,” which as I have mentioned, will recur meaningfully in Chap. 3. There is also a threefold motif of death threat in the chapter: at birth, on the Nile, and at the hand of the avenging Pharaoh. Isbell notes several items of vocabulary (e.g., “deliver,” “feared,” “amid the reeds”) that return in the victory account at the Sea of Reeds (Chap. 14)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Moshe's Birth and Early Life 6","From the other two accounts here (vv.11–14 and 15–22), we learn all we need to know about Moshe’s early personality: he is Hebrew-identifying but Egyptian-looking; concerned with justice, but impetuous and violent in pursuit of that goal. It is also ominous that his first contacts with the Israelites end in rejection, since that will so often be his experience with them later on. The doubly unsatisfactory situation of confused identity and impetuous means must be rectified, and it is exile that accomplishes it. The Midyanite wilderness transforms Moshe into shepherd, foreigner, father, and seer—in short, into a son of the Patriarchs (see also “On the Journey Motif,” above)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Moshe's Birth and Early Life 7","Incredibly, the man whose activity is to span four whole books has, it seems, half his life (or, according to the chronology of 7:7, two-thirds of his life!) described in a single chapter. Typical of biblical storytelling, much has been compressed and left out, but enough is told to establish the person who is to come."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, God Takes Notice 2","Chap. 2 ends on a note that looks forward and backward simultaneously. The fourfold “God” plus verb (vv.24–25) echo the same structure at Creation’s first day (Gen. 1:3–5), and suggest that he puts his concern for the people of Israel on a par with his concern for creation of light (connoting “good” in folklore). In addition, the four verbs used here play a prominent role in the entire Deliverance Narrative, as Isbell has shown."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Bush; The Call 2","The great revelation scene in these two chapters, so much a classic in the literature of the West, comes as somewhat of a surprise in the close context of our story. Nothing in Exodus so far has prepared us for such a religious, inward vision on the part of Moshe; and indeed, Genesis itself contains no meeting between God and a human being of such a dramatic character. Adam and Avraham converse with God; Yaakov experiences him, to be sure, in dreams and in the guise of a wrestler; but nowhere thus far does one find a biblical hero encountering God with such intensity and purity of vision."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Bush; The Call 3","The shepherd, now in the service of his father-in-law, the “priest,” comes upon the “mountain of God,” “behind the wilderness.” The results are those of an unintended or half-intended journey. Moshe, who had fled previously, finds himself at the utmost reaches of the wilderness, almost like Jonah in the bowels of the boat or of the great fish. The sight that Moshe is granted is of unclear nature, but it involves fire, with all its pregnant associations: passion, purity, light, mystery (Greenberg 1969), and here, inextinguishability."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Bush; The Call 4","God’s initial speech (vv.6–10) contains all the elements basic to the Deliverance Narrative: it identifies him as the ancestral deity, establishes his compassion for the oppressed people, demonstrates his resolve to rescue them, and ends with the commissioning of Moshe to be his emissary. Central here is the verb <i>see,</i> whose threefold occurrence (vv.7 and 9) ties together the threads of the previous parts of Moshe’s story (see above)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Bush; The Call 5","The entire scene is the model for the “call” of the biblical prophet, with its emphasis on God’s speaking to the fledgling prophet amid a vision and the motif of refusal; of the call scenes in the Bible, this is the longest and most memorable in its starkness. A man is called by God to return to society and serve as God’s spokesperson—despite any opposition he may encounter and despite his personal shortcomings. Moshe’s reluctance, indeed his almost obsessive need to turn down the commission, is as much indicative of the general nature of prophecy (cf. Elijah and Jeremiah) as it is of Moshe’s own personality. The prophet must be prepared “to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and plant” (Jer. 1:10), and to stand tall against kings if necessary (Jer. 1:13). So it comes as no surprise that the call is met with less than enthusiasm. And this refusal also teaches something about Israel’s political conceptions. With such a response as this, there can be no question of personal ambition or inner lust for power. The prophet does what he does out of compulsion: he is driven by forces that he perceives as external to him."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Bush; The Call 6","In our text, Moshe refuses the commission five times, and five times God counters. In four of these cases the assurance is given that God will “be-there” with him (3:12, 14; 4:12, 15), and the use of that verb carries in its essence one of the most significant motifs of the Bush Narrative: the interpretation of God’s name."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Bush; The Call 7","When Moshe asks God for his name in 3:13, he asks for more than a title (Buber and Rosenzweig 1994). In the context of Egyptian magic, knowing the true name of a person or a god meant that one could coerce him, or at the very least understand his true essence. Moshe foresees that the slaves will want to be able to call on this power that has promised to deliver them."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Bush; The Call 8","God’s answer is one of the most enigmatic and widely debated statements in the Hebrew Bible (the reader will want to consult Childs for a full bibliography). What does <i>ehyeh asher ehyeh</i> mean? One’s suspicions are aroused from the outset, for the answer is alliterative and hence already not easy to pin down; the poetics of the phrase indicate both importance and vagueness or mystery. There is some scholarly consensus that the name may mean “He who causes (things) to be” or perhaps “He who is.” Buber and Rosenzweig, taking an entirely different tack (of which one occasionally finds echoes in the scholarly literature), interpret the verb <i>hayoh</i> as signifying presence, “being-<i>there</i>,” and hence see God’s words as a real answer to the Israelites’ imagined question—an assurance of his presence. The B-R interpretation has been retained here, out of a desire to follow them on at least this significant point of theology, and out of my feeling that it also fits the smaller context. For of the several times that Moshe tries to wriggle out of his mission, God answers him all but once with the same verb, in the same meaning: “I will be-there with you” (note the parallel between Moshe and the people again)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Bush; The Call 9","It is, however, also possible that <i>ehyeh asher ehyeh</i> is a deliberately vague phrase, whose purpose is antimagical and an attempt to evade the question (Rosenzweig speaks of this as well), as if to suggest that possession of the true name cannot be used to coerce this God. In this interpretation, it would follow that, just as God is magicless (see v. 20), he is nameless, at least in the conventional sense of religion. On the other hand, the name Y<small>hwh</small>, however it may have been vocalized throughout the history of the text, did function as a name in ancient Israel (and possibly outside of Israel as well). It was used in oaths (e.g., Gen. 22:16, II Sam. 12:5), and later, in the Second Temple period, limited in public pronunciation to the high priest on the Day of Atonement. As happens frequently in the history of religion, if we follow a concept long enough it transforms back to the beginning, often in an opposite meaning, and so when the use of Y<small>hwh</small> is traced through the Middle Ages one finds it turned into a magical name at the hands of Jewish mystics."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Bush; The Call 10","To return to the Bush Narrative as a whole: these chapters introduce a number of important words that will recur throughout the enire Liberation Narrative. These include “trust,” “hearken to (my) voice,” “staff,” “heavy,” “go out,” “strong,” “send,” and “blood” (see Isbell). It should also be mentioned that several key words occur in multiples of 7 from 2:23 to 4:31 (Cassuto): “see” (7), “send” (7), “go” (14), “mouth” (7), “speak/word” (Heb. <i>dabber/davar;</i> 7). This vocabulary in particular focuses the story around major aspects of prophecy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Bush; The Call 11","In the end, what does Moshe have with which to return from the mount of vision? In the DeMille film version his face and personality clearly change; in the biblical text, however, he comes back with a word—the divine promise—and a staff, “with which you shall do the signs” (4:17). He had previously been a man whose lack of tolerance for injustice produced violence; now he is armed with words and a wonder-working object—not a sword or a helmet, but a shepherd’s staff."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Journey Back 1",Exodus 4:18-31
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Journey Back 2","It is clear that something has been inserted into the normal course of our narrative. What follows v.20 should be v.27; Moshe, ready to go back to Egypt, is met by Aharon in the wilderness, and they subsequently announce their mission to the Children of Israel. However, the editor has prefaced the brothers’ meeting, first with a warning to Moshe that his mission will be strongly resisted by Pharaoh, and a warning that Moshe is to deliver to Pharaoh. Then follows a bizarre episode, which, like the Name passage discussed above, has provoked centuries of comment and attempts to explain it. What are we to make of the circumcision story here, especially the last scene, which is unclear not only in import but in details such as pronouns as well?"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Journey Back 3","Buber (1988) explains it as an event that sometimes occurs in hero stories: the deity appears as “divine demon” and threatens the hero’s life. Perhaps this underlines the dangerous side of contact between the human and the divine. But there seem to be other reasons for the passage’s inclusion at this point in the text. First, it serves as an end bracket to Moshe’s sojourn in Midyan. As mentioned earlier, Moshe flees Egypt under pain of death (2:15); here, on his return, he is in mortal danger once more. Second, our passage seems to be an <i>inclusio</i> or bracketing passage for the entire Plague Narrative (Kosmala and others). This is confirmed by the use of vv.21–23 as an introduction. God, designating Israel his firstborn and alluding to the future killing of Pharaoh’s/Egypt’s firstborn sons, demonstrates his power as life-taker, to be pacified or turned away only by a ceremonial blood-smearing—parallel to the Israelites’ smearing of blood on their doorposts when their own firstborn are threatened by the Tenth Plague (12:12–13)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Journey Back 4","Two final points should be noted here. First, it is with the act of his son’s circumcision that Moshe finally becomes a true Israelite (that, after all, was the major term of God’s covenant with Abraham in Gen. 17). Similarly, Yehoshua (Joshua), Moshe’s successor, will circumcise the next generation of Israelites in the process of conquering the Promised Land (Josh. 5:2). And second, it is telling, again, that the person who saves Moshe’s life in adulthood is a woman. In a sense, Moshe’s early life is now over, having come full circle."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Before Pharaoh 1",Exodus 5:1-6:1
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Before Pharaoh 2","Moshe and Aharon’s initial efforts to free the people—even temporarily for an act of worship—are unsuccessful, as foretold in the previous chapter. But even though God had predicted failure, we are still left with a portrait of clashing human wills: the liberators’, the king’s, and the reluctant people’s. The narrative appears to be a set-up for the second major revelation of God to Moshe (Chap. 6), which, preceded by expressions of doubt on both Moshe’s part and that of the people, harks back to the concerns voiced at the Burning Bush. There is also a forward-looking figure, Pharaoh, who is a prototype for other foreign rulers and enemies in the Bible who challenge God (Greenberg 1969)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Before Pharaoh 3","Chap. 5 contains the Bible’s most extended description of the conditions of Egyptian bondage. Not surprisingly, the root “serve” occurs seven times in vv.9 to 21 (Greenberg 1969), and sound variations on the Hebrew <i>ra’</i> (“ill/evil”) three times (vv.19–23)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Promise Renewed 1",Exodus 6:2-13
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Promise Renewed 2",Greenberg (1969) and others have noted how this section in many respects recapitulates God’s speeches at the Bush. Once again God assures Moshe that he has “heard” and “recalled” the Israelites and their old covenant; once again he promises to act (“bring out” resounds four times); once again the promise is linked to an interpretation of God’s name; and once again Moshe expresses doubt as to whether he will be believed or listened to (v.12).
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Promise Renewed 3","Why the repetition? Perhaps here, as elsewhere, to double is to emphasize. Also, just as Moshe initially failed as a self-appointed liberator in Chap. 2, only to be sought out by God in the wilderness, he fails as a leader here as well, followed by God’s reassuring speech. There can be no question from whence the liberation comes."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Genealogy of Moshe and Aharon 2","At this tension-filled moment in the narrative, in the face of Moshe’s self-doubt and the possible collapse of his mission, there is an unlikely break, at least by Western storytelling standards. Apparently the genealogy has been inserted to buttress Moshe and Aharon’s claim to represent the people before the Egyptian crown, and to stress their Levite ancestry (which solidly establishes them within the priestly class in Israel). Significantly, the genealogy of Yaakov’s sons ends with the third, Levi, and the rest of the list enumerates the Levite clans. More significantly, the ages mentioned are composed of patterned numbers such as 3, 7, 30, and 100. As in Genesis, this betokens a concept of order and meaning in history."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Genealogy of Moshe and Aharon 3","Thus legitimated, Moshe and Aharon can return to the task at hand. It would seem, then, that the passage is speaking to the Israelites, both in Egypt and in the audience of later generations."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Mission Renewed 2","As preparation for the next meeting with Pharaoh, Moshe is once more reminded that the king will not listen to him. Taking a page from his speech at the Bush, God instructs Moshe and Aharon to use the “sign” that had previously served to convince the people: snake magic. Yet despite Aharon’s one-upping the Egyptian magicians in the warm-up for the plagues, Pharaoh remains unconvinced. This episode helps to prepare for what follows, and indeed contains a virtual glossary of Exodus words. Some of these are: “speak,” “send,” “harden,” “heart,” “sign/portent,” “hand,” “bring out,” “know,” “staff,” “hearken,” “midst.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, First Blow 1",Exodus 7:14-25
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, First Blow 2","The first plague uses elements and words common to many subsequent plagues; in addition to those just mentioned, it introduces “refuse” and “reek” and “throughout all the land of Egypt.” More important is the choice of site and object for the curse: the Nile (a god in Egypt), water (source of life for the Egyptians but earlier source of death for the Hebrew babies), and blood (sign of life and death). No more effective choice could have been made for this first demonstration of the far-reaching power of the Israelite God."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, First Blow 3","As with the first six plagues, the threat is long and the actual carrying-out brief. Note the relationship, at the end of the episode, between the uncaring Pharaoh and his own people, who have to scratch for water."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Third Blow 1",Exodus 8:12-15
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Third Blow 2","With the third plague, the curse becomes more intimate, affecting the bodies of all living creatures in Egypt (cf. the refrain in vv.13–14, “on man and on beast”). The narrative uses the briefest plague formula here, without introduction or warning to Pharaoh. Yet it results in an Egyptian effort to end the siege, as the magicians term the plague “the finger of a god” (v.15)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Fourth Blow 1",Exodus 8:16-28
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Fourth Blow 2","Despite its similarity to the previous plague (insects), number four introduces a new and important element into the tale: the idea that God makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. It also involves protracted bargaining between Moshe and Pharaoh over the issue of allowing the Israelites to worship God."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Fifth Blow 1",Exodus 9:1-7
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Fifth Blow 2","Although this plague spares humans, it is nevertheless described as “heavy” (v.3). The narrative uses a play-on-words as well: the Hebrew for pestilence (<i>dever</i>) echoes that for thing (<i>davar</i>)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Sixth Blow 1",Exodus 9:8-12
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Sixth Blow 2","Just as in the previous “short” plague, number 3, the magicians come to the fore. No longer do they cry to Pharaoh; they cannot even take the stage!"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Seventh Blow 1",Exodus 9:13-35
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Seventh Blow 2","Long like its corresponding predecessors (numbers 1 and 4), the seventh plague prefaces its occurrence with an emphatic introduction by God, and its warning gives God-fearing Egyptians a chance to save themselves (vv.19–21), something new. The description of the plague itself is fraught with spectacle, presaging Sinai with its use of thunder and fire. There is also the ominous note, twice in the text (vv.18, 24), that such a plague was unique in Egyptian annals. The plagues, at least for the Egyptians, now transcend the realms of normal, explainable experience, as well as of historical recollection."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Eighth Blow 1",Exodus 10:1-20
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Eighth Blow 2","Anticipating Pharaoh’s eventual capitulation, the Egyptians now urge their king to release the Israelites, before Egypt is truly “lost” (v.7). The request occurs before the plague does. This longest plague is in many ways the most devastating of all, affecting as it does the very soil itself. Here the last two plagues are anticipated (v.15, “the ground became dark”; and v.17, “this death”), and the previous one is echoed (vv.6, 14, with the reference to past history). Also foreshadowed, in the locusts’ removal, is the final victory at the Sea of Reeds (Chap. 14), through the mention of the location and the use of a powerful wind."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Ninth Blow 1",Exodus 10:21-29
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Ninth Blow 2","Little is new here; darkness foreshadows the final plague, death. Yet at the end of the brief episode, as well as in 11:8, we are given a glimpse into the human element, as Moshe and Pharaoh rage in anger against each other."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Final Warning 1",Exodus 11:1-10
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Final Warning 2","What seems to be the introduction to the last plague is made up of motifs common to several of the previous ones. It also reintroduces the idea of despoiling the Egyptians, which had been mentioned in Moshe’s original commission (3:21–22)—so we know that redemption is at hand. Artfully, the specification of what “one more blow” is, is delayed until v.5. In addition, there is the motif of Moshe’s greatness/fame among the Egyptians, which would appear to be a suppressed remnant of the story (in the face of the desire to glorify God as the hero). The section ends (vv.9–10) with a summary of the entire Plague Narrative—or at least of what is to be learned from it."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Passover Ritual 1",Exodus 12:1-28
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Passover Ritual 2","The festival depicted in this chapter is, in the opinion of many scholars, a combination of two ancient holy days: a shepherds’ festival, in which each spring a lamb was sacrificed to the deity in gratitude and for protection of the flock, and a celebration of the barley harvest, at which time all leaven/fermentation products were avoided (although see Ginsberg, who theorizes a shepherds’ festival with <i>matza</i>). Each has numerous parallels in other cultures (see Gaster 1949). What has apparently happened here is that the two days have been fused together and imbued with historical meaning. In addition, rites that were originally protective in function have been reinterpreted in the light of the Exodus story. But whatever its origin, Passover as described in our text bespeaks a strong sense of Israelite tribal community and of distinctiveness. And it is distinctiveness, which played such an important role in Israelite religion, that is singled out here, with the striking penalty for transgressing the boundaries of the festival—being “cut off” (probably death). One also notes the repetition of the phrase “a law for the ages” (vv.14, 17, 24). Passover, then, is central both to the Exodus story and to Israelite ideas as a whole (see Sarna 1986 for a detailed discussion)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Tenth Blow and Exodus 1",Exodus 12:29-42
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Tenth Blow and Exodus 2","The final blow falls. This most horrifying of all the plagues, and the reaction to it, are described in only two verses, whereas the rest of the narrative concerns itself with preparations for and actual description of the exodus. Note how, as above, the narrative is surrounded by ritual concerns—trying to explain the subsequent reason for eating unleavened bread (which had not been done in v.15f., above). There also returns the important motif of despoiling (“stripping”) Egypt."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Tenth Blow and Exodus 3","The section ends (vv.40–42) with a dramatic summary of Israel’s sojourn in Egypt and the importance of the Passover festival, built on repetition (“thirty years and four hundred years,” “a night … for Y<small>hwh</small>,” “keeping-watch”). Again, a past event is made immediate for the audience. The powerful religious tones of story and ceremony are established by the threefold reference to night as the setting for both (vv.29–31)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Who May Make Passover 1",Exodus 12:43-50
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Who May Make Passover 2","Continuing the immediacy of ritual, the narrative pauses where one would expect it to talk about the Israelites’ route, to specify carefully that partaking of the Passover meal, and indeed being a part of the community in general, requires circumcision on the part of the participant. In essence, it creates the new Israelite nation, on the heels of common participation in a historical event. This small passage has been inserted between two occurrences of the same phrase (“that same day”), an editorial device often used in biblical literature."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Passover and the Firstborn 1",Exodus 12:51-13:16
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Passover and the Firstborn 2","To close out the text’s celebration of the exodus event, the editor includes a peroration on the firstborn. This too is a reinterpretation of earlier religious practices. Many ancient cultures selected the firstborn as an object for sacrifice to the gods—whether firstborn of fruit, of animals, or of human beings—the grounds for this being that the firstborn represents the best that nature has to offer (see Gen. 49:3, where Jacob’s firstborn is “beginning of my strength”). The idea of strength is played upon in the reinterpretation of sacrifice: four times, including at the end of the passage, we are told that the firstborn is to be consecrated, “for by strength of hand Y<small>hwh</small> brought you out of Egypt” (vv.3, 9, 14, 16)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, Passover and the Firstborn 3","The chapter has a few notable characteristics. For one, the eating of <i>matzot</i> has been integrated into the firstborn material; for another, the language is unmistakably reminiscent of Deuteronomy (vv.5 and 11, “it shall be [a refrain here]/when Y<small>hwh</small> brings you to the land of the Canaanite …”; see Deut. 6:10, 7:1, etc.). This has led some scholars to point to a relatively late date for the material, supporting the idea that Israel in its sixth-century <small>b.c.e.</small> exile in Babylonia looked back to recast the past in its own image. At any rate, memory is clearly important here, with two passages stressing the continuity of commemoration through the following generations (vv.8–10 and 14–16)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Route and the Escort 1",Exodus 13:17-22
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Route and the Escort 2","The initial exit from Egypt highlights an ominous fact about the Israelites: God is well aware of their weaknesses and leads them by a detour, lest they “see war” and seek to recover the familiar security of being serfs. The section also explains what they are doing out of the way of the logical route to Canaan (the place names are difficult to identify, but the general stress is clear), and sets up the great final victory of the next chapter."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Route and the Escort 3","Two other elements of weight enter in this brief passage. One concerns Yosef’s bones, which leave Egypt with his descendants. The body of Yosef seems to anchor early Israelite history: its mummification brings the Genesis stories to a close, its journey here links up Israel’s patriarchal past with the radically new deliverance from bondage, and its final interment in the land of Israel formally closes out the conquest of the land under Yehoshua (Joshua) (Josh. 24:32)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Route and the Escort 4","Another unifying motif is that of God’s accompanying the journeying Israelites in the form of cloud and fire. This passage is the first of what I have called the “Presence Accounts” described in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Sea of Reeds 1",Exodus 14:1-31
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Sea of Reeds 2","The liberation account ends with two literary masterpieces: the semipoetic story of Israel’s miraculous passage through the Sea of Reeds along with God’s smashing of the Egyptian war machine, and the song of triumph that follows in Chap. 15. Taken together, they form a natural conclusion to what has gone before and a bridge to what follows. Chap. 14 marks the Israelites’ last contact with the Egyptians, and the beginning of their desert journey."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Sea of Reeds 3","As if the actual exodus were not dramatic enough, the narrator or editor has included a battle scene at this point in the text. As before, the principal combatants are God and Pharaoh, and as before, we begin with God’s hardening the monarch’s heart (v.4) to teach him a final lesson (“I will be glorified”). In that vein, some of the plague motifs are repeated, making Chap. 14 a fitting conclusion to the Deliverance account stylistically and thematically (see also Isbell). At the same time the story includes a foreshadowing of Israel’s behavior in the wilderness for the next two years, with a detailed account of their complaints against Moshe (and God’s miraculous response)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Sea of Reeds 4","God appears in this story in his most warlike garb, and temporarily resembles many of the gods of antiquity (Cross uses the term “the divine warrior,” relating it to Northwest Semitic imagery). This is not unusual for the Bible, and seems appropriate here, given the climactic nature of the events and the general context of the Deliverance Narrative. Otherwise, the Hebrew God was conceived of as the originator of all things, good and evil, and was of course not compartmentalized into limited tasks as were other gods of neighboring cultures."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Sea of Reeds 5","From a formal point of view, the sea narrative is among the most formulaic in the Hebrew Bible. That is, it is built entirely upon several phrases that repeat throughout the text, stressing its major themes. These include: God’s “making Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed” (vv.4, 8, 17); God’s “being glorified” through what he does to the Egyptians (vv.4, 17, 18); Israel’s going “upon dry-land” (vv.16, 22, 29); the waters’ “returning” (vv.26, 27, 28); Israel’s marching “through/into the midst of the sea” (vv.16, 22, 23, 27, 29); Pharaoh’s “chariots and riders” (vv.17, 18, 23, 26, 28); and a description of the standing waters, “the waters a wall for them to their right and to their left” (vv.22, 29); see also the refrain, “before Pi ha-Hirot … before Baal-Tzefon” (v.4) and “by Pi ha-Hirot, before Baal-Tzefon” (v.9). The text is thus much more than a journalistic account of what happened: it is a rhythmic retelling of an experience, strongly conditioned by traditional (probably oral) Israelite forms of storytelling."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Sea of Reeds 6","The ending (vv.29–31) betrays the influence of Deuteronomy. Using language that mirrors the end of the entire Torah (Deut. 34), the text speaks of seeing, fearing, hand, eyes, and the unique-to-Deuteronomy phrase “Moshe his servant” (see Deut. 34:5). Significantly, then, the final narrative of Israel’s relationship to Egypt is cast as a classic ending in general."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, At the Sea of Reeds 7","What exactly happened at the sea? As I indicated in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above, such a point is unanswerable, and may not have a great bearing on the meaning of our text. Scholars have scrambled their brains for decades, trying either to reconstruct precisely what “natural” event this “really” was (e.g., tides, tidal wave), or to identify the exact location of the “Sea of Reeds.” While such matters are important to the historian, the Bible itself concentrates on the theme of the story. The narrator was concerned to demonstrate God’s final victory and to portray Israel’s escape in terms of a birthing (through a path, out of water), and these themes had the most influence both on later biblical tradition and on the generations of inspired Jews and Christians that heeded them."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Song of God as Triumphant King 1",Exodus 15:1-21
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Song of God as Triumphant King 2","Moshe’s famous Song at the Sea provides a natural boundary in the book of Exodus. It sets off the Egypt traditions from those of Sinai and the wilderness, and brings to a spectacular close the saga of liberation. This is borne out even in scribal tradition, still observed in the writing of Torah scrolls today, where the Song is written out with different spacing from the preceding and following narrative portions."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Song of God as Triumphant King 3","A poem is necessary at this point in the story, to provide emotional exultation and a needed break before the next phase of Israel’s journey in the book. The Song manages to focus the Israelites’ (the audience’s?) intense feelings in a way that neither the ritual of Chaps. 12–13 nor even the semipoetic description of God’s miraculous intervention in Chap. 14 can do. Only poetry is capable of expressing the full range of the people’s emotions about what has happened. This is similar to the effect of the great poems that occur toward the end of Genesis (Chap. 49, the Blessing of Yaakov) and Deuteronomy (Chaps. 32–33, the Song and Blessing of Moshe)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Song of God as Triumphant King 4","A major concern of the poet is God’s kingship, with which he ends the poem (a one-liner—“Let Y<small>hwh</small> be king for the ages, eternity!”—contrasting with the doublets and triplets in the body of the poem). This is no accident, nor is it inappropriate; since Chaps. 4 and 5 the story of Exodus has revolved around just who shall be king (God or Pharaoh) and just who shall be served. By the end of Chap. 14 this is no longer an issue. The victorious Y<small>hwh</small> can now be acclaimed as king, while we hear nothing further of Pharaoh. (Has he drowned or merely been written out of the story? Later generations of Jews enjoyed giving him a role in the world to come: he stands at the gate of Hell, admonishing evildoers as they enter; see Ginzberg.)"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Song of God as Triumphant King 5","The attempts to recover what happened at the sea through the poem are doomed to failure, considering that the piece is constructed out of two traditional stories, the victory at the sea and the later conquest of Canaan (vv.1–12, 13–17). Further, it is set in cosmic terms. The words “Oceans” (Heb. <i>tehomot;</i> vv.5, 8) and ‘breath” (<i>ru’ah;</i> v.8) recall the primeval chaos at the beginning of Creation itself (Gen. 1:2). This technique is characteristic of much of ancient/religious literature: a great event is told in a way that reflects the beginnings of the gods and the world (this may include statements about the end of the world as well)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Song of God as Triumphant King 6","It should be noted that some scholars point out the close resemblance between God’s victory here and scenes in other ancient Near Eastern literatures that portray the triumph of a storm god over a sea god. So however historical the events in Chaps. 14–15 may have been, in their biblical retelling they have been patterned after antecedents in myth."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Song of God as Triumphant King 7","Much has been written concerning the structure of the Song (see, e.g., Cassuto, Cross, and Lichtenstein). I will mention only a few points here. The vocabulary of the poem is extremely concentrated. Major ideas are expressed by clusters of key verbs. Note, for instance, the grouping of “flung,” “hurled,” “plunged,” “shattered,” “smashed,” “consumed”—a veritable lexicon of military victory. A number of verbs describe divine leadership (“led,” “guided,” “brought”), and God’s establishment of the Israelites in Canaan (“planted,” “founded”). The fear of the Canaanites (of Israel and its God) is graphically expanded to “shuddered,” “seized with writhing,” “terrified,” “seized with trembling,” “melted away,” “… dread and anguish,” and “grew dumb.” Finally, there are a number of nouns that express weight (cf. Heb. <i>kaved,</i> previously discussed): “stone,” “dam,” and “lead.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Song of God as Triumphant King 8","The overall effect of the poem is of fierce pride at God’s victory, and exultant description of the destruction and discomfort of enemies, whether Egyptian or Canaanite. This general tone parallels many ancient war poems; what is characteristically Israelite about it is God’s choosing and leading a people. Therefore the last verse goes far beyond the celebration of a single military victory. The Song constitutes the founding of a theocratic people."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Song of God as Triumphant King 9","Scholars have long noted the archaic style of the Song, which uses forms characteristic of early biblical Hebrew. Its tone is for this reason even more exalted than is usual in biblical poetry. An imaginative reflection of the effect can be found in Daiches, who paraphrases the Song in the style of early English epic poetry."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part I; The Deliverance Narrative, The Song of God as Triumphant King 10","Two sections have been appended to the end of the poem. First there is the poetically remarkable summary of the narrative in v.19, notable for the fact that it is composed wholly from phrases used in Chap. 14. There follows a women’s repetition/performance of at least part of the Song complete with dance. Some scholars see this as the “original” form of the poem. Of equal interest is the characterization of Miryam as a “prophetess.” But there may be a structural reason for her appearance as well: the enterprise of deliverance from Egypt began with a little girl at the Nile, watching through the reeds to make sure her baby brother would survive; it ends with the same person, now an adult, a “prophetess” celebrating the final victory at the Sea of Reeds."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness 1",Exodus 15:22–18:27
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness 2","T<small>he wilderness narratives in the</small> T<small>orah must have been extraordinarily im</small>portant to the narrator/editor, as evidenced by their placement at this point in Exodus. Why did he/they see fit to insert here material which, chronologically at least, would fit better at a later point—for instance, in the book of Numbers (which reports essentially the same sort of incidents)?"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness 3","The answer comes from several quarters. The wilderness stories embody a key process for the Torah story: Israel’s passage from enslaved childhood to troubled adolescence, with a hopeful glance toward adulthood (the Promised Land). This process starts immediately after liberation; indeed, it is its direct result. Further, the three “desert themes” prominent in Chapters 15–18–“grumbling” against God and Moshe, hostile neighbors, and early self-government—are appropriate to include before the meeting at Sinai, in that they demonstrate dramatically the people’s need for reassurance, protection, group solidarity, and institutions (whereby they can live harmoniously). These narratives, therefore, lay out Israel’s precarious position and create the hope for a cure. It is only later on in the Torah, in the book of Numbers, that we will discover that the growing-up process in the wilderness could not be accomplished in a single generation."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness 4","The portrait of a people (or of an individual, as is often the case in religious literature) undergoing transformation in a place outside of normal geographic/cultural boundaries is a well-known phenomenon in traditional stories. Anthropologist Victor Turner speaks of the “liminal” experience, where the protagonist or initiant is separated spiritually and geographically from his origins in order to be changed into something new (see Fredman and Cohn). This is paralleled by the process of pilgrimage in the world of ritual, as can still be observed among many communities of the world to this day. The desert is the site of liminality par excellence: it is a harsh place that contains none of the succoring elements of human civilization, yet at the same time it leads the wanderer into truer communication with nature and the divine, metacultural forces of the universe. It is a place of betwixt and between, which mirrors the experiencer’s psychological state. In the case of Israel, later biblical sources speak of the wilderness period with striking force, either as an example of the people’s long-standing and deeply ingrained rebelliousness (e.g., Psalm 95), or fondly, as a kind of honeymoon period between God and Israel (e.g., Jer. 2:2). In both cases what is evoked is only a stage on the way, and not the final goal (see Talmon)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness 5","Transformation always involves both life and death, and so it is not surprising that a characteristic theme of the stories before us is lack of food and/or water. The opening episodes of the section (15:22–17:7) comprise three scenes of “grumbling” about the difficulties of survival (with the structure: water-food-water), with a unique biblical twist: God and the people “testing” each other. And so the transformation depends very much on God’s action on the people’s behalf (twice he has to “instruct” them—the very verb from which the term “Torah” is derived). The suspension of the life process, or at least its imperiling, is notable also in the fact that, in contrast to the fertility of the Israelites in Egypt, “the trek narrative does not relate a single birth” (Cohn). This is especially striking given the strong birth image of Israel at the Sea of Reeds, which is still in the reader’s mind as the section opens."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, Grumbling I 1",Exodus 15:22-27
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, Grumbling I 2","The first of the wilderness narratives is linked to what has gone before via the theme of water. Fresh from their rescue from death at the sea, the Israelites look for water in the desert and find the discovery of unpotable water intolerable. The key word, especially for the many later wilderness traditions such as we find in Numbers, is “grumbled” (Heb. <i>lyn</i>), which leads to God’s nurturing of the people. Strangely, the theme of undrinkable water recalls the beginning of the plague sequence in Egypt (7:20–21)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, Grumbling I 3","Right away in this first desert episode we are told the purpose of Israel’s journey: God is testing them, to see if they will “hearken” to what he bids them to do. The language is in the style of Deuteronomy. One should also mention the idea of “law and judgment,” indicating another crucial desert theme: Israel’s ability or inability to govern itself."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, Grumbling I 4",The account ends with an abundance of water in v.27.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, Grumbling II 1",Exodus 16:1-36
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, Grumbling II 2","Moving now halfway (in terms of time) to their Sinai destination, the people encounter a new lack: food. This reintroduces the “testing” motif (V.4), with its built-in answer: God provides quails and <i>mahn</i> (trad. English “manna”). The story is full-blown, and its repeating vocabulary sets forth the issues clearly: “grumble” occurs seven times, and “command/commandments” four times, linked to the idea of testing. Indeed, this long story poses the question central to all the wilderness narratives: “… whether they will walk according to my instruction or not” (v.4)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, Grumbling II 3","The manna was important in early Israelite tradition as a witness to God’s nurturing, as attested by the end of the chapter with its ritual prescriptions regarding it (vv.32–34; note the threefold repetition of “safekeeping”). But it also sets up an emphasis on a more permanent institution in Israelite culture: the Sabbath. One notion that this passage may convey is the antiquity and importance of the Sabbath, preceding the laws of Sinai as it does here. Also at issue is whether the Israelites can follow simple rules laid down by God."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, Grumbling III 1",Exodus 17:1-7
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, Grumbling III 2","With the third wilderness story we return to the water theme. This time the element of “quarreling” with Moshe is added, in addition to the portrayal of Moshe’s eroding patience (v.4). Otherwise it is a variation on the basic theme (notice, for instance, the similarities between 16:3 and 17:3). The ending is ominous, reversing the previously held idea of God’s testing Israel."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, War with Amalek 2","In addition to testing/grumbling, conflict with foreigners is a significant wilderness theme (see Num. 20–24). It is perhaps for this reason that it has been included in the pre-Sinai traditions. Its placement here may depend on its use of Moshe’s staff; the previous narrative ended with the use of that object, and such linkage was a known form of composition in ancient literature."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, War with Amalek 3","The tradition about Israel’s relationship with Amalek, however brief, persists as an important one in the Bible. Saul, Israel’s first king, is commanded by God to wipe out the Amalekites, as punishment for their opposition of Israel in our passage (I Sam. 15), and centuries later, Haman, the evil Persian councillor who proposes to exterminate the Jews of his country, is portrayed as a descendant of the Amalekite king (Esther 3:1)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, War with Amalek 4","Our story, however, is no mere military report, but also a tradition about the power of the “staff of God.” In another culture, indeed in later Midrashic literature, such a theme would receive Excalibur-like treatment, but the Bible suppresses the magical side and simply uses it as a tool, expressing God’s continuing deliverance of Israel."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, The New Society; Yitro's Visit 1",Exodus 18:1-27
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, The New Society; Yitro's Visit 2","Israel finally reaches the “mountain of God,” but this, remarkably, is subordinated to the fact that Moshe and the people meet up with Yitro, whom we recall from Chaps. 2–4. The designation “father-in-law” recurs throughout this chapter (thirteen times), perhaps playing up the importance of the relationship in Israelite society. The real concern of the story, however, is Moshe’s early attempt to set up a functioning judicial system in Israel (hence the key word <i>davar,</i> ten times, translated here as “matter” in the sense of “legal matter”). The chapter thus serves as a good prelude to Sinai, which will include far-ranging legal material (despite the fact that some scholars see it as an insertion from a later period—cf. v.16, “God’s laws and his instructions”)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part II; In the Wilderness, The New Society; Yitro's Visit 3","It has been noted (Cohn) that the “trek narratives” in Exodus and Numbers have been laid out evenly, with six “stations” between Egypt and Sinai and another six between Sinai and the land of Israel. Thus here, Israel has come to the midpoint of its journey. In another perspective, Moshe himself has come full circle, returning to both the spot and the man in whose presence the mature adult phase of his life had begun."

The fateful public meeting between the deity and the amassed human community will betoken the formal change of masters: the people, no longer enslaved by the Egyptian crown, now swear fealty to their divine Lord, who imposes rules of conduct upon them in return for his protection and their well-being."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 3","The settings for these events of covenant-making and law-giving are appropriately impressive. The mountain naturally functions as a bridge between heaven and earth (with only Moshe allowed to ascend!), but it is additionally accompanied on this occasion by the powerful manifestations of smoke, fire, cloud, thunder, lightning, and trumpet blasts. To try and pin down exactly to what natural phenomena the story alludes, be they volcano, earthquake, or the like, is somewhat beside the point; what speaks through the text is the voice of an overwhelming experience. Indeed, as Greenberg (1972) points out, the account in Chapter 19 may have been deliberately left ambiguous and contradictory, showing that the editor wished to include all the received traditions about the event."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 4","At the same time, it should be noted that the Sinai revelation resembles the appearance of the storm-god Baal in Canaanite texts, especially in the combining of thunder/lightning and earthquake. Psalm 18:8 portrays a similar scene. So as varied as the phenomena accompanying God’s appearance here are, they conform to a known literary pattern (Greenstein 1984c)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 5","As mentioned previously, Sinai stands geographically at the center of the Israelite wanderings. As the textual center of the book of Exodus as well, it anchors the people of Israel on their journey toward the fulfillment of their destiny. But that function is purely a mythic one. Sinai never became an important biblical cult site, and the only later story to take place there, that of Elijah in I Kings 19, clearly stems from the desire to draw a parallel between Elijah and Moshe. The Hebrews apparently could not conceive of God’s abiding place’s being located outside the land of Israel. On the other hand, it was necessary to demonstrate that Israel’s laws and institutions arose, not out of normal settled political and economic circumstances, but rather as the direct gift and stipulation of God himself (see Cohn), and hence the choice of a site wholly removed from the great culture centers of the ancient Near East: the monolithic culture of Egypt, the ancestral heritage of Mesopotamia, and the fertility-based society the people were to encounter in Canaan. Sinai, the originating point of Israel as a self-defined community, had to start everything anew, on a stage in which all other considerations had been stripped away."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 6","Early in the history of biblical exegesis (the Midrash) it was noted that the events on Sinai resemble the conclusion of a marriage ceremony. Such an idea may even have been in the minds of the transmitters of the Exodus traditions. Indeed, the entire book is remarkably reminiscent of a pattern of rescue—courting—wedding with stipulations—home planning—infidelity—reconciliation—and final “moving in” (these stages fit into the general Part divisions I have used throughout the book). Lest this appear to be too Western a model, let it be noted that such analogies occur in the writings of the prophets, where the relationship between God and Israel is likened to that between husband and wife. This constitutes Israel’s version of what Joseph Campbell has termed “sacred marriage” in hero stories—not, as classically, the hero’s successful wooing of a goddess or semidivine creature, but an intimate relationship established between God and his people. As such, it is unique in the ancient world."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 8","Marriage may be one imaginative model for the Sinai experience, but it was covenant that the writers wished to stress above all in these chapters. Here we observe a fascinating phenomenon that occurs again and again in biblical religion: an institution well known in the secular world is given a religious emphasis in the Bible. For covenant (others, “pact”) was a widespread form of political bonding in the ancient Near East. Kings and vassals, from Anatolia to Assyria, regularly aligned themselves in treaties involving either freewill granting of privileges or an agreement of mutual obligations between parties. A number of texts laying out the stipulations and ceremonies particular to covenant-making in the ancient Near East have been recovered, and study of them is helpful for an understanding of what we have in Ex. 19–24. Three things are clear. First, the stylistic pattern in our chapters resembles what is found in Hittite treaty texts (Mendenhall 1954); second, the Exodus passages use narrative to express these events, not merely a list of conditions; third, and most important, no other ancient society, so far as we know, conceived of the possibility that a <i>god</i> could “cut a covenant” with a people. This last fact leads to the observation that, for Israel, the true king was not earthly but divine—despite the later establishment of a monarchy (Weinfeld 1972b). Hence the narrator’s concentration on these chapters, especially considering the dramatic nature of what had gone before (Chaps. 1–15)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 9","The covenant found in Exodus and subsequently in the Torah differs substantively from the two described in Genesis. Noah (Gen. 9) and all living creatures had been promised no further universal destruction, with the stipulation that human beings were not to eat meat with blood or commit willful murder. Avraham, too (Gen. 15, 17), was the recipient of a covenant: God would give him land and descendants, and Avraham was to attend to the circumcision of all his males (yet this is more sign than stipulation). What these early events have in common is the aspect of bestowal—God acts and promises, and human beings are the passive recipients. Exodus introduces the notes of mutuality and conditionality. Both parties are now to have a stake in the agreement, and it can be broken by either (as in Chap. 32; contrast this with the promise to Noah in Gen. 8:21–22, “I will never doom the soil again … never shall [natural processes] cease,” and Gen. 9:11, “Never again shall there be Deluge….”). From the Creator God we have moved to the God of History, who enters into a fateful relationship with the people of Israel (for more on this, see Sarna 1986)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 11","A century of modern Bible scholarship has led to far-reaching changes in the perceptions of biblical law. Initial archeological findings, which often included legal documents, had led comparativists to see in the biblical material a pale reflection of its Mesopotamian antecedents. The Code of Hammurabi, for instance, was deemed the source of some of the Exodus material. These early judgments have given way to a view that places more emphasis on what is distinctive about the biblical laws."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 12","For our purposes here, several brief points should be made, drawn from recent research; the reader may find them explored at greater depth in the essays by Greenberg (1970), Greenstein (1984), Paul, and Sarna (1986), and the work of Sonsino. Expressions of law in the ancient Near East, especially in documents from Mesopotamia, reveal a strong economic underpinning, tied to class structure. They also have at times a personal or political function. Hammurabi, for instance, presents his code with the express purpose that the gods and men may see what a just king he is. The laws are listed by category, with religion occupying its own sphere. Finally, the king acts as the enforcer of the laws, having received them from a god—who is nevertheless not their ultimate source. Law exists in the Mesopotamian texts as an abstract value, designed for the smooth functioning of society."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 13","By way of contrast, Hebrew law, as typified by our chapters, displays very different concepts and concerns. Class is hardly alluded to, reflecting a totally different kind of society economically but also expressing an ideal that began in the Genesis creation story with the common ancestor of the human race. The laws are presented as the terms of the covenant (our section is often termed the “Book of the Covenant”), and the motivation behind them is portrayed as historical/psychological (“… for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). Strikingly, the biblical regulations, not only here but in the other major collections as well (in Leviticus and Deuteronomy), blur the distinctions between religious and secular, and treat all law as a matter directly related to God. He is perceived as the source of laws; they are the expression of his will; and breaking them is a direct affront to and act of rebellion against him (contrast, for example, the modern American view)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 14","The key concept behind much of biblical law seems to be that of Ex. 19:6, to make of the people of Israel “a holy nation.” This expression, which appears nowhere else in the Bible, combines a secular notion (the Hebrew <i>goy</i>, meaning a political body, a state) with a sacral one: this people is to transform all of its life into service of God. There is, therefore, no subject in the code before us—slavery, social relations, torts, cult, or diet—that is not of immediate concern to the biblical God. The first part of 19:6, “a kingdom of priests” (Buber: “a king’s-retinue of priests”), would seem to suggest that despite the clear existence of a priestly group in ancient Israel, the ideal approached a more democratic form of religious expression."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 15","This leads us to posit a final question: Are the materials in Ex. 21–24 (and other texts in the Torah that enumerate laws) to be taken as actual regulations or cases, or as something else, rather more didactic? We have little evidence for the former view, and in fact other ancient Near Eastern legal documents such as the Hammurabi Code seem to point in the other (didactic) direction. Given the nature of Torah literature, where narrative has a teaching function rather than a purely historical one, it seems plausible that the legal texts as well were intended to elucidate principles of Israelite belief—to present, as it were, a worldview. The other possibility, more in keeping with the history of law, is Daube’s (1947) view that “many ancient codes regulate only matters as to which the law is dubious or in need of reform or both.” In other words, law in day-to-day Israel was regulated by established precedents, and certainly not by Ex. 21–23, in the main. But in this case, too, our text would be instructive of the biblical mentality. For a fuller treatment of biblical law and its context in the ancient Near East, see Sarna (1986)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai 16","Any attempt to describe this section structurally is bound to run into a roadblock; perhaps precisely because of the Bible’s desire <i>not</i> to distinguish between various categories of life, we do not have a watertight structure. Suffice it to say that, overall, most sections in these chapters begin with the general proposition “When …” (Heb. <i>ki</i>), and break down the issue under discussion into subsections beginning with “If …” (Heb. <i>’im</i>), a pattern found commonly in other legal systems as well. Beyond this, and the observation that there are some general categories and logical connections (for which, see the Commentary), one striking stylistic device in the Hebrew should be pointed out. From 21:5 through 23:24 a double verb form appears (the infinitive absolute followed by the imperfect) fully twenty-seven times. The effect of this device, which is rhetorically emphatic, is to give a sense of coherence to what are otherwise quite diverse laws."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, The Meeting and the Covenant 2","The account of God’s revelation at Sinai, like the narrative of the tenth plague and exodus, is embedded in a wider setting. After the covenant has been elucidated, the people assent; preparations are made to meet God; and the brief initial meeting is followed by more preparations, including stern warnings against trespassing on the mountain’s sanctity. When one takes Chap. 20 into account, the effect of all this is anything but smooth, from a narrator’s point of view, and I would agree with Greenberg (1969) that this may be deliberate—stemming from a desire either to include every tradition about this key event that was available to the editor(s), or else to suggest that such things are impossible to describe in normal language and logical sequence (Buber [1981], in another context, once referred to the Creation story of Gen. 1 as a “stammering account”). In any event, the entire description of the fateful meeting between God and the Israelites at Sinai is confined to a mere four verses (19:16–19). This stands in blatant contrast to other ancient Near Eastern traditions, which would have treated such an event with epic length and poetic diction (see, for instance, Deut. 32, or Psalm 78). So here, as in the opening chapter of Genesis, all has been stripped down, focusing attention on the covenant rather than on the mysterious nature of God."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, The Meeting and the Covenant 3","In that vein, it must be observed that the narrative centers around speaking, words, and sounds, keeping the visual to a minimum (in line with the warning in Deut. 4:12: “The sound of words you heard/a form you did not see/only a voice”). It also abounds in terms connoting warning and boundaries/separateness—the text contains three sets of warnings: vv.10–13, 21–22 (introducing the phrase “burst out,” which refers to God’s potential destructiveness if the boundaries are violated), and 24. This recalls Moshe’s own experience at Sinai earlier (cf. 3:5). And the number 3 gives the story the same touch of meaning provided by the numbers in Genesis; Israel arrives at the mountain three months after the exodus and meets God on the third day after their preparations."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, The Meeting and the Covenant 4","As Cassuto points out, the chapter does not begin with “Now it was …” (Heb. <i>va-yehi</i>), a normal marker for continuing a previous narrative. The Sinai material thus presents itself in utter newness. To use the previously cited wedding analogy: this text betokens a new relationship between God and Israel, however well they have known one another previously."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, The Meeting and the Covenant 5","Also notable in Chap. 19 is the emphasis on movement: going up (Heb. <i>’aloh</i>) and down (<i>yarod</i>) (see also 24:15–18). This movement serves to bridge the gap, usually great, between heaven and earth; but note that it is Moshe, and not the people, who does the ascending and descending."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, The Meeting and the Covenant 6","Structurally, vv.20–25 appear to have been added, to emphasize the warning theme.

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, The Ten Words (The Decalogue) 2","This section, among the most famous and important in all of religious literature, is set in dramatic tone. Its rhetoric could hardly be more striking. In a form relatively rare in ancient Near Eastern legal documents, a god sets forth demands, with no punishments listed. This “apodictic” form seems to indicate that the Ten Words function as a preamble to the actual laws of Chaps. 21–23, by laying forth the major principles on which Israel’s relationship to God is to be based (as is to be expected, the secondary literature on Chap. 20 is enormous; see Childs for a bibliography)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, The Ten Words (The Decalogue) 3","The numbering of the ten differs slightly in the Jewish and Christian traditions, with the main divergences coming in the split of vv.2–3 (or 3–4, as here); see Cassuto. There are also different opinions on the overall structure of the “Commandments.” Jewish tradition separates out those that treat the relationship between God and human beings (vv.2–11, numbers 1–5) and those that involve human society alone (vv.12–14, numbers 6–10), although it should be kept in mind that all offenses in ancient Israel were seen as affronts to God. This division might be borne out by stylistic considerations, for the last five, of course, begin “You are not to …” and numbers 2–4 all use the Hebrew word <i>ki</i> (“for”) to express reasons or results of the initial stipulations (vv.5, 7, 11, with the substitution of “in order that” in verse 12)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, The Ten Words (The Decalogue) 4","Other notable stylistic aspects here include the fact that “you” is always singular, and that numbers 2–4 and 6–10 are all put in the negative."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, The Ten Words (The Decalogue) 5","Several other features of the “Decalogue” are unique: the prohibition against worshiping images, which would have had a strange ring in the ancient world; the Sabbath as a holy day on which not even servants, farm animals, or noncitizens are to work, equally unprecedented in its time and place; and, strangest of all, the final prohibition against desiring (another person’s property)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, The Ten Words (The Decalogue) 6","The language and the content of the Decalogue, then, cooperate to create a lofty and challenging ethical code, which both the people of Israel and the Western world in general have struggled with ever since. The reader may wish to consult Buber’s stimulating essays (1982, 1963) “The Words on the Tablets” and “What Are We to Do about the Ten Commandments?”, as well as the essays in Segal."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Aftermath 2","The verses that follow the Decalogue highlight an important aspect of the Sinai tradition: its occurrence in a public setting. Vv. 15–18 could fit nicely after 19:20a; the Decalogue would then follow 20:18. Yet it seems to have been important for the narrator to stress (v.19) that God spoke to the people as a whole, not merely secretly in a revelation to a visionary or priest. To emphasize this point, the verb <i>ra’oh,</i> “see/perceive,” occurs seven times in vv.15–19. V.19 also serves as a framework for the entire Revelation episode, recalling as it does the language of 19:4. Israel now has two reasons for obeying God: he brought them out of Egyptian bondage and he talked to them “from the heavens” (v.19)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Aftermath 3","The rest of the chapter functions as an introduction to the general body of the legislation that begins in the next chapter. Like Israel’s other law collections in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, it starts with rules pertaining to worship."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Aftermath 4","<i>On the Laws:</i> The reader should bear in mind again that the section headings used in the Commentary are for reference only. This is especially true for Chaps. 21–24, where the final form of the Hebrew text discourages distinguishing between different types of offenses (see p. 361, “On Biblical Law”)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Laws Regarding Israelite Serfdom 2","Given the importance of the root “serve” in the book of Exodus, it is fitting that the Covenant Code open with this theme. In vv.1–6 the text considers the case of the native serf, a status rather like that of the indentured servant in early American history. Immediately, the act of releasing such an individual—providing for his “going out”—is stipulated. “For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt” (Lev. 25:42). While the institution of serfdom existed of necessity in ancient Israel, it could not be tolerated as a permanent and fully dehumanizing one (on the other hand, these regulations deal with natives, not with foreigners). Note the use of seven here, as the number of perfection and limit—the servant goes free after seven years, just as the land rests every seven years (23:10–11)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Laws Regarding Israelite Serfdom 3","The second case (vv.7–11) deals with a woman whose poverty-stricken father sells her as a servant.

Our society has in general supported the first and third of these; but the regulations concerning father and mother do not accord with twentieth-century Western practice, and point up well the enormous importance of the parent-child relationship in ancient Israel (already suggested by “Honor your father and your mother” in the Ten Words). That relationship was often used to describe the one between God and Israel, and thus obedience is an important theme in the covenant as a whole."

The case of an accidentally caused abortion is especially highlighted (vv.22–25), and in a famous verse (23), the lawgiver breaks into rhetoric in order to stress that punishments be scrupulously fair. Also notable is the regulation concerning the goring ox (vv.28–32), where an <i>animal</i> is made to pay the death penalty, since it has destroyed the most sacred thing of all—life itself. Both of the latter cases have received exhaustive treatment in the scholarly literature (see Sarna 1986)."

Yet the category is not so neatly drawn; interspersed with these are laws concerning what we would consider religious affairs: sorcery, idolatry, blasphemy, and the sacred calendar. Once again the implication seems to be that all of these areas are of immediate concern to God, regardless of how they are labeled or pigeonholed."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters 3","Stylistically there is also great variety, as categorical prohibitions (22:18) alternate with pleas (23:5–6) and positive commands (23:10–12). A number of times the justification for the law is given in the text itself (e.g. 22:20, 26; 23:7, 8, 9, 11, 12), with the operative word being “for.” (Such a verse is called a “motive clause,” and is characteristically although not exclusively biblical; see Sonsino.)"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters 4","Most notable about this section is the full use that it makes of rhetoric. Several key laws are accompanied by an emotional appeal—e.g., “Oh, if you afflict, afflict them … !” (22:22); “for it is his only clothing … in what (else) shall he lie down?” (v.26); “for a Compassionate-One am I” (v.26); and “you yourselves know (well) the feelings of the sojourner” (23:9)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters 6","Toward the end (23:10–19), emphasis shifts to the festivals of Israel, with a special focus on the agricultural setting. As a result the general scholarly consensus is that these laws could not be wilderness regulations, but refer instead to life after the conquest of Canaan.

The Deuteronomic themes are classic: “taking care,” smashing Canaanite idols, God’s removing disease from the faithful Israelites, and the spelling-out of Israel’s future borders."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Epilogue; The Future Conquest 3","Also to be remarked are the sevenfold repetition of “before you” as a stylistic unifying device, and the ending theme of serving YHWH as opposed to “their gods.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Sealing the Covenant 1",Exodus 24:1-11
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Sealing the Covenant 2","To close out the account of covenant-making which began back in Chap. 19, the text recounts a formalized ceremony which has many points of contact with what was generally done throughout the ancient Near East when a covenant was “cut.” Twice Moshe reads God’s words to the people, and twice (vv.3, 7) they give their assent. This is no imposing of laws by a dictator, but a freely accepted, “signed, sealed, and delivered” agreement cemented by blood, the signifier of life itself."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Sealing the Covenant 3","As representatives of the people, Moshe, Aharon, Aharon’s sons, and seventy elders ascend Mount Sinai, and, most remarkably, “see” God in some sort of vision—without, as one might expect, their being destroyed. They also eat and drink, as was customary in the sealing of the agreement (and often done in business to this day; see Gen. 31:44–54)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Moshe Ascends Alone 1",Exodus 24:12-18
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Moshe Ascends Alone 2","Finally, Moshe leaves the people, in order to receive the laws in permanent (stone) form. He “goes up” the mountain four times (or, most likely, is on his way up). In order to give his absence the weight it needs—so that the people will grow restless, setting up the situation that produces the Golden Calf in Chap. 32–the text will now turn to a completely different matter for fully seven chapters."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part III; The Meeting and Covenant At Sinai, Moshe Ascends Alone 3","The ending of this section anticipates the ending of the book of Exodus, with its mention of God’s “glory,” “dwelling,” “fire,” and “day/night.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 1",Exodus 25–31
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 2","D<small>espite the importance of all that has preceded, the section of</small> E<small>xodus we</small> now encounter occupies a significant amount of text, and therefore commands our attention, in the overall scheme of the book. It may seem puzzling to modern readers that a book that purports to be about a people’s origins should choose to fill a third of its pages with a detailed description of a sanctuary, down to the last piece of tapestry and the last ritual vessel. Yet it is an indication of the “Tabernacle’s” centrality in Israel’s idea system that the story of its construction dominates the last half of Exodus."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 3","Several factors may help to explain. First, the system of animal and grain sacrifices, or cult, was as important in ancient Israel as it was elsewhere in antiquity, as the chief means of formally expressing religious feeling. Indeed, the Bible traces this institution back to the beginning of human history, to Cain and Abel (Gen. 4:3–4). The cult’s centrality survived the railings of the Prophets and the destruction of Solomon’s Temple, and was still strong enough in late antiquity to provoke a severe crisis when its chief site, the Second Temple, fell to the Romans in the year 70 <small>c.e.</small> The latter event was a crux upon which the creation of classical Judaism took place, and the process was a painful one. So the opinion that many moderns have, that animal sacrifice was a barbaric custom, is quite beside the point as far as ancient Israel was concerned."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 4","Second, there is the great theme of the book of Exodus, “Is Y<small>hwh</small> in our midst or not?” (17:7), to which our account gives a resounding positive answer. The book of Exodus traces not only the journey of the people of Israel from Egypt to Sinai, but also the journey of God to rescue the people and to dwell (“tabernacle”) among them (Greenberg 1972). A detailed presentation of God’s “residence,” as it were, is meant to convey the assurance that the people are led by God himself. This further supports the biblical image of the divine king, who dwells among his subjects and “goes before” them."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 5","Third, the Israelites shared with their neighbors the idea that a victorious God, following his triumph, was to be honored by his enthronement in a human-built structure (see Hallo). Thus the last half of Exodus, far from trailing off into obscure priestly details, fits a well-known mold in its contemporary environment."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 6","A final explanation of the prominence of the Tabernacle sections may be found in their intimate connection with the idea of the Sabbath. The “blueprint” chapters, 25–31, end with an extended passage on observing the Sabbath; the construction chapters, 35–40, begin with a brief passage on the prohibition of work on the holy day. These structural aspects suggest (as the ancient rabbis also saw) that cessation from work here means precisely from the tasks of construction, and that once a week human beings must step back from their own creating to acknowledge the true “work” of creation. Chapters 25–40, including the Golden Calf narrative, bring out these ideas through their use of refrainlike phrases, especially the repetition of one key word: “make” (Heb. <i>’asoh</i>). The entire section is an object lesson in what the Bible deems it proper for human beings to make, and is a vehicle of contrast between God’s creation and human attempts to reach the divine. Israel is engaged in the making of the Tabernacle (notice how “build,” which would make more sense, is not used); when the time comes for the work to be put aside temporarily, they are to “make” the Sabbath. To these observations may be added the long-observed fact that the vocabulary of the Tabernacle’s completion (“finished,” “work,” “blessed”) recalls the completion of Creation in Gen. 2:1–4. Thus we are taught that Israel, through its religious life as typified by Sabbath and cult, becomes a partner in the process of Creation, either by imitating the divine act or by celebrating it."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 7","Other peoples, to be sure, recall the beginning of the world in ritual and story, so it is important to make an anthropological observation. The purpose of all sanctuaries is to build a bridge to the divine, to link up with the forces that transcend human beings. It is perceived that certain places are particularly appropriate for this (folklore terms such places “the navel of the earth”), and, by extension, sanctuaries firmly anchor that inherent holiness. What the Tabernacle account initially accomplishes, most notably in its closing chapter (40), is to transfer a topographic “bridge” to a human-made and portable one. With the completion of this Dwelling, we find God resident neither on Sinai nor in the later Jerusalem, but rather accompanying the people “upon all their marches” (40:38). The sacred center here thus moves; it is a portable anchor that establishes stability wherever it goes. The vitality that surrounded this idea is still to be seen in the successors of the Hebrew Bible, classical Judaism and Christianity, for whom, respectively, Torah and Cross provide a center that is at once movable and stabilizing."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 8","But the sacred center, for biblical religion, finds equal expression in <i>time.</i> While the Dwelling account seems obsessed with matters of space, its setting among the Sabbath passages stresses more the concept of time. Such an aspect already begins to make itself felt in 24:16, where Moshe, on Sinai to receive the laws, waits for six days while the “cloud” covers the mountain, and is able to ascend only on the seventh day, at God’s summons. We are thus left, paradoxically, with a structure (Dwelling) which at first glance uses many well-known art forms and religious motifs common to the ancient Near East, but which is a total departure from them via its connection with the Sabbath—an institution with no known equivalent in the ancient world. The Dwelling account presents us with a people for whom sacred time takes precedence over sacred space (for more on these themes, see Sarna 1986)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 9","There have been many attempts, textually and artistically, to reconstruct the Tabernacle on the basis of our text here, the rationale being that surely so much detail as we find here will serve as the guidelines for an actual structure. Rabbinic and medieval Jewish commentators, as well as modern scholars, have expended considerable energy to that end. But in fact none of the reconstructions has succeeded, for, as with narrative, the text is as much message as description. The text’s main concern, it seems, is for the Dwelling to reflect holiness, in its choice of measurements and materials (see Haran 1985). The layout of the Dwelling expresses aesthetic ideas of perfection, through various symmetrical proportions (see Appendix); the materials are graded such that the closer one gets to God (in the “Holiest Holy-Shrine”), the more precious the metal. In addition, both the colors used and the types of workmanship employed are similarly graded. In a general way, the intent of the narrator seems to have been close to the intent of the great cathedral builders of the Middle Ages: to reflect divine perfection and order in the perfection and order of a sacred structure."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 10","The Dwelling, as described in Exodus, resembles other ancient Near Eastern sanctuaries in many particulars (for which, see the Commentary below), as well as strongly reflecting aspects of the later Temple of Solomon (I Kings 6–7). Some scholars have also likened it to a Bedouin tent (Heb. <i>shakhen</i> seems to be an archaic verb for “to tent”), appropriate to desert conditions. It is perhaps all three, a coalescing of Israel’s ideas of the cult from a variety of historical and religious settings. That the Dwelling was viewed as historical is clear from biblical tradition itself (see II Sam. 7:6, for instance). But one should keep in mind that it is also a paradigmatic model, that helps to round out the overall scheme of Exodus. The book traces the progress of the people of Israel from servitude (to Pharaoh) to service (of God), and uses the human activity of building to do so. Thus, as Exodus opens, the Israelites are forcibly made to build royal storage cities; as the book ends, the people complete a structure through which they may serve the divine king."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 11","Finally, there is the sequence of description in these chapters: the text begins with the blueprint for the holiest object, the “coffer” (ark), and proceeds through the structure in descending order of holiness. After the building instructions themselves are given, a number of related matters are treated, chief among them the attire of the priests and the ceremony consecrating the priests. The establishment of the cult, like that of the system of justice, is thus viewed as the command of God rather than the result of the need or request of human beings (contrast this with the “requested” monarchy in I Sam. 8)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult 12","<i>The “Contribution”</i> (25:1–9): In the first seven verses of this opening section dealing with the Dwelling, the Israelites’ contribution toward the structure is described in detail; but only in v.8 is the purpose of this activity made clear.

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Coffer 2","The coffer or ark was a cult object of major importance in premonarchic and early monarchic Israel. In our text it contains the “Testimony” (i.e., the tablets with the Ten Words); in Josh. 3:14–15 it precedes the people into the Promised Land; in I Sam. 4:11–5:12 it is captured in battle but mysteriously wreaks havoc among the enemy (hence its cinematic offspring <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>). Finally, David’s transporting of it to Jerusalem (II Sam. 6) marks the formal establishment of that city as a holy one and as the capital of Israel."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Coffer 3","In Exodus the coffer literally plays a central role. It stands in the innermost recesses of the Tabernacle, at the sacred center. Considering what the coffer contained—tablets with God’s words on them rather than statues of gods—it addresses the primacy of divine word over divine representation in ancient Israelite thought."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Purgation Cover 1",Exodus 25:17-22
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Purgation Cover 2","<i>Kapporet</i> here could indicate simply “cover,” yet its function goes beyond mere protection. The name of this central part of the above-cited central cult object may be a play on words. The Hebrew verb <i>kapper,</i> which occurs again later in these texts (see 29:33–37), often means “purge” or “purify”; earlier translators rendered it as “expiate” or even “propitiate,” and the <i>kapporet</i> as “mercy-seat” or “propitiatory.” The <i>kapporet</i> was apparently the holiest spot in the Israelite cult system, and it was there that God was said to speak his will to the people. This idea represents a remarkable shrinking and intimatizing process: the God who spoke to the assembled people, amid thunder, fire, and trembling earth at Sinai, now communicates with them from an area roughly the size of a small desk or table. In addition, there is a shift from a one-time event (Sinai) to the permanent fact of a sanctuary—a development which will later be repeated in Solomon’s Temple."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Table 1",Exodus 25:23-30
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Table 2","The table and its implements, like some of the other features of the Tabernacle, are holdovers from a more blatantly pagan model, where the gods were seen to be in need of nourishment. By thus using conventions of worship common throughout the ancient Near East, Israel expressed its desire to serve God, even while it was aware that he was not the sort of deity who requires food and drink. It might also be mentioned that another common object found in ancient sanctuaries, a bed, has intentionally been omitted from our structure."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Lampstand 1",Exodus 25:31-40
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Lampstand 2","Despite the wealth of detail lavished on this striking symbol, its exact construction, like that of the Dwelling in general, remains unclear. The vocabulary used for its constituent parts comes from the realm of plants: shaft, stems, blossoms, almond shapes, etc. Indeed, the major latent symbol behind the lampstand is the tree—which appears in many forms and in almost all religions (Meyers). The tree as a symbol is to be found throughout human culture, in such diverse settings as Native American stories and Norse myths; in the ancient Near East it specifically connoted permanence, growth, and majesty—in other words, a reflection of the divine. If one adds to this range of meanings the function of the lampstand—illumination (which often implies not only the giving of physical light but also, as the English phrase has it, enlightenment)—the lampstand will be seen to emerge as an object with considerable evocative power. All these meanings may not have been immediately obvious and conscious to the ancient pilgrim or worshiper, but they periodically surfaced; the lampstand was ancient Judaism’s symbol of preference (judging from synagogue ruins) and not the “Star of David,” which, as Gershom Scholem has shown, was a medieval mystical addition."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Lampstand 3","The importance of the lampstand in our text is indicated by v.40, where the motif of God’s revealing the structure of a sacred object on the mountain is resumed.

First, sacrificial animals and bread are brought and prepared; then the priests are systematically clothed in their sacred vestments. After the first animal is slaughtered, its blood is dashed against the altar and the innards are burned as an offering; then the second ram is slain, and its blood is placed on the priests’ extremities, to purify them. Blood is sprinkled on the priests’ garments; then they hold up the fat-parts and breast of the ram, and follow by offering it up. Then the priests eat the cooked flesh of a special ram, the remains of which are to be burnt. Finally, the altar is purified."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Anointing Oil 2","“Holy” is once again heard as a key word, both in the sense of making something sacred and in the sense of being reserved for special use only. Oil was used in many ancient cultures for positive purposes; elsewhere in the Bible, of course, it played its role in the anointing of kings and prophets, as well as the courteous treatment of guests and after bathing. Oil, then, carried with it connotations of brightness (see Ps. 104:15) and life itself."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Incense 3","The offering-up of incense was a feature common to worship all over the ancient Near East. At least two reasons have been advanced for its use: purification, and a fragrance pleasing to the deity. It is also curious how our text speaks of God’s being with the Israelites as a column of cloud and of fire; the incense smoke might also then be reminiscent of this divine manifestation."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, Craftsmen 2","As the Tabernacle account opened with a summary description of what was to be constructed, so it ends, with some names added. The craftsmen for the task, Betzalel and Oholiav, are depicted as “wise” (Heb. <i>hakham</i>), that is, skilled; they will make what Moshe has been given to see."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Sabbath 1",Exodus 31:12-17
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Sabbath 2","<i>The Tablets</i> (31:18): As a reminder of the Sabbath’s importance amid all the anticipated construction activity, the Israelites are now commanded to observe the holy day. The section is also a prelude to the Golden Calf story, which will be concerned with improper “making”; and “make” appears in a variety of different contexts."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part IV; The Instructions for the Dwelling and the Cult, The Sabbath 3","A second prelude draws the initial Tabernacle section to a close. Moshe receives God’s word engraved in stone, by God himself; this will presumably be deposited in the “coffer” of which the text spoke in its opening chapter (25). But the section is forward-looking as well, in that the tablets will play a dramatic role in the story immediately following this passage."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored 1",Exodus 32–34
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored 2","W<small>ITHOUT THE STORY THAT FOLLOWS</small>, <small>THE BOOK OF</small> E<small>XODUS WOULD BE INCOMPLETE OR</small> at least hopelessly idealistic and idealized. Thanks to the inclusion of the Golden Calf episode, we recognize the people of Israel so familiar from the bulk of the wilderness narrative—stubborn, untrusting, and utterly unable to comprehend what has just occurred at Sinai (note the parallel between this section and 15:22ff.: after witnessing the awesome displays of God, the people fall prey to typical human anxieties about their own survival). We are also given a classic biblical description of God in this story—that he is demanding but also compassionate."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored 3","There is no doubt that the narrative wishes to portray the breaking of the recently made covenant, and also to focus once again on the anxiety about God’s presence that pervades the whole book. Some see it as a political polemic, given that a similar story is found in I Kings 12:28ff., about Jeroboam’s split from the Solomonic monarchy; according to this theory, the Exodus account is a projection backward of the sin of the Northern Kingdom. Jeroboam, leading a secessionist movement, intended to set up a sanctuary to rival Jerusalem. At the same time, the Exodus story does appear first, and thereby helps to explain why Jeroboam’s deed was considered so terrible by later generations."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored 4","But surely the Golden Calf story plays such an important role in the present book of Exodus as to sidestep the question of which version came first. It puts into sharp relief the nature of the people, its leader, and its God, and provides some insights into the complex relationships between these parties; it focuses particular aspects of the Tabernacle idea (see above); and it makes clear the difficulties of the emerging faith community."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored 5","The story also contributes some welcome dramatic scenes at this point. It is as if the reader has awakened from a dream: major characters, including God himself, reemerge as real personalities, while secondary characters (Aharon and Yehoshua) are fleshed out. Everywhere there are fierce emotions: doubt, anger, panic, pleading for mercy, courage, fear. And, indeed, the entire enterprise of Exodus hangs in the balance, as God wishes only to destroy the faithless people (a rough parallel exists in Gen. 22, where all that has previously been promised to Avraham is threatened). Only after the stark emotions just mentioned have been cathartically absorbed, and the covenant restored, can there be a return to the task at hand—the building of an abode for the divine amid the very human community of Israel. As to the stylistic aspects of the story, we should note the repeated use of the verbs “see” and “know,” among others. Their transformation at different points of the story signals a return to these earlier Exodus themes, this time with a new urgency and a new enterprise at stake: the continuity of the fledgling people."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, The Sin of the Molten Calf 2","We have spent twelve chapters—a major portion of the book of Exodus—dwelling on the heights of Sinai; we have witnessed revelation, law-giving, the command to build a shelter for the presence of God, and the establishment of a priestly cult. But now, as Moshe prepares to descend from the mountain, we are reminded of the other side of the coin: the real world of human frailty. This has occurred before, at the very same site: in Chaps. 19 and 20 we observed a fearfulness on the part of the people toward getting too close to the divine, as a power too awesome to deal with. Now the fear goes the other way, and, with the disappearance of Moshe, the intermediary, turns to despair. The very thing that had been warned against in the Decalogue (and hence, the first of the terms of the covenant)—the making of a “carved-image/or any figure/that is … on the earth beneath” (20:4), and bowing down to it (20:5)—takes place here, requested by the people in their hour of need. It is abetted by, of all people, their divine spokesman and priest, Aharon."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, The Sin of the Molten Calf 3","Some scholars have sought to soften the sin of the calf by claiming that the Israelites did not view it as an idol but rather merely as a representation of the divine. This does not seem to be borne out by the text, either in the Decalogue or later in the Jeroboam incident, which is often equated with the most heinous crimes (see I Kings 16:26)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, Response; God's Anger 1",Exodus 32:7-14
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, Response; God's Anger 2","Now that the people have committed what amounts to a capital crime, the issue at stake is what the punishment shall be. After informing the unsuspecting Moshe of what has taken place down below, with the words “<i>your</i> people [italics mine] … has wrought ruin” (v.7), God indicates his intent to destroy Israel, and to found a new nation beginning with Moshe. However, early Jewish tradition already sensed that something deeper might be happening here. The phrase “let me be” (Heb. <i>hanniha li</i>), it has been observed, suggests that God actually wishes Moshe to argue with him, and this is supported by his acquiescence in record time (v.14). Indeed, the text never says “God’s anger flared up,” reserving that key verb for Moshe (v.19). What we learn from this section is not only God’s forgiving nature but something significant about Moshe: faced with a dictator’s dream—the cloning of an entire nation from himself—he opts for staunchly defending the very people who have already caused him grief through their rebelling, and who will continually do so in the ensuing wanderings. And he does not even eschew blackmail to attain his goal. His argument in v.12, that the Egyptians will jeer at this God who liberated a people only to kill them in the wilderness, rings truer in a pagan context than in the Bible. But the next verse reveals Moshe’s vision: he knows that his task is to continue the foundation established by the Patriarchs and to assure the continuity that has been imperiled so many times before."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, Response; Moshe's Anger 1",Exodus 32:15-29
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, Response; Moshe's Anger 2","In a sense, the text backtracks chronologically here, to focus solely on Moshe. The first four verses are prefatory but important. Possibly to set the drama of the scene to follow, Moshe is described as carrying the “tablets of the Testimony,” which are dubbed the work of God. Yet another point is being made: the work of God is contrasted with the imperfect work of human beings, the law with its hope versus the idol with its underlying despair."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, Response; Moshe's Anger 3","Sounds of revelry, implied as being worse than sounds of war, reach Moshe, and upon his descent into the Israelite camp he loses control. But smashing the tablets has implications beyond the emotional: it is a legal voiding of the covenant (as in the English “breaking an agreement”). Moshe deals with all concerned in swift succession: the calf is destroyed, Aharon is confronted, and the people are brutally purged."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, Response; Moshe's Anger 4","It is possible that there are historical considerations behind this section. Some see the portrayal of Aharon, who certainly comes across as weak, as part of a strain in the political thinking of a later period. According to this view, the later decline of Aharon’s priestly line is reflected in his behavior here. Others see the “mandating” of the Levites (v.29) as a reflection of a later power struggle among the priestly classes in Israel. Childs finds Aharon’s role in the story to be a literary one: he is a foil for Moshe. Aharon is willing to capitulate to the people, seeing them (perhaps realistically) as “set-on-evil” (v.22). Moshe holds fast to his dream of a “kingdom of priests” (19:6) and thus demands of himself a type of leadership that cannot compromise. The Calf story, then, focuses not only on the great crime of idolatry but also on the nature of Moshe as leader. It is the resumption of the biblical portrait of Moshe, which will return again with greatest force throughout the book of Numbers."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, After the Purge 1",Exodus 32:30-33:6
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, After the Purge 2","Although blood has been spilled to punish the guilty, Moshe must still expiate Israel’s sin. In this vein, he offers to be erased from God’s “record” if the people are not forgiven. Then commences God’s reply, couched in terms of who will lead the people to the Promised Land. He will not do it himself, as previously (see the glorious image of 13:21–22), but through the agency of a “messenger.” He will fulfill his promise to the Patriarchs, but not himself among his “hard-necked” people. Their “sin” (the word occurs eight times in vv.30–34) has destroyed that possibility."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, After the Purge 3","An interesting chord is struck at the end. Israel must strip themselves of their ornaments, the spoils of battle, as it were, from the Egyptians. Those ornaments had been used to build the Calf. The final note is ominous: God is yet to decide “what to do with you,” reminiscent perhaps of another scene with identical wording—2:4, where Moshe’s sister had followed the little-ark downstream, “to know what would be done to him.” In both cases, the people of Israel stand on the brink of disaster, saved only by divine intervention."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, Moshe at the Tent 2","This brief digression seems to function as support for Moshe’s role, so important in the book as a whole and in this story in particular.

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, Moshe's Plea and God's Answer 1",Exodus 33:12-34:3
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, Moshe's Plea and God's Answer 2","Continuing the dialogue with God from 32:34f., Moshe now pleads that what is necessary is nothing less than the personal assurance that God will lead the people. Six times the verb “know” echoes, along with repetitions of “pray” and “favor”—and so the issue at hand is intimacy and the bonded relationship of covenant. Significantly, also, Moshe refers to Israel three times as “your people,” trying to force God to acknowledge them as his own once more. Answering Moshe’s request for intimacy, God agrees to let him get close, but with limits, and we are reminded of Sinai once more (see the boundary-setting in 19:12–13, 21ff.). The earlier revelation scene is about to be replayed, in altered form—most notably, without the people themselves present."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, God Reveals Himself 1",Exodus 34:4-9
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, God Reveals Himself 2","This passage is another one of the climaxes of the book, of which I spoke in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above. In contrast to the scenes given in other ancient literatures, where, for instance, the texts speak of a physical brightness too great to bear, or of epic descriptions of the gods, our passage is remarkably brief and devoid of physical description. All that is ventured here is a statement of God’s essence, or, more precisely, of his essence for human beings: merciful but just. This image, which had such a great influence on the development of Christianity and Islam as well as Judaism, is of the highest importance in the understanding of the biblical God; it is almost as if the text is saying “This is all that can be known, intimately, of this God, and this is all one needs to know.” There is no shape, no natural manifestation (in contrast to the thunder and lightning approach at Sinai—but one should bear in mind what has just happened with the Calf): only words, which describe God’s relationship to human beings."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, God Reveals Himself 3","Moshe hastens, at the climactic moment, to plead on behalf of the people. Most curious is the fact that God does not seem to agree to “go in their midst,” nor does he ever give in and reinstate Israel with the term “my people” (see v.10). Nevertheless, it appears that the rift between deity and people has been satisfactorily repaired, given what comes next."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, The New Covenant 1",Exodus 34:10-28
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, The New Covenant 2","A preamble (vv.10–16) promises God’s continued “wonders” and warns emphatically against Israel’s mixing with the Canaanites upon its future possession of the land. Once the actual legislative content of the passage begins in v.17, one notes the continuation of the stylistic pattern which began with v.10: Deuteronomic language. The laws bespeak an agricultural society, not a nomadic one, and suggest that the warning against blending with Canaanite society may be from the perspective of a later period—an Israel long settled in the land. Although some scholars see Egypt as the origin of the Calf symbol, it also has a well-known existence in Canaanite mythology, as a symbol of Baal, god of fertility. Therefore the connection between our text and that of Kings may be close indeed, and the Calf story may have had a very contemporary ring to later audiences."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, The New Covenant 3","As is typical of the Calf narrative, our passage concludes, not only with wider issues—the formal writing-down of the covenant—but also with Moshe: that he neither ate nor drank during the encounter with God. We see the story both from its inception and its end concerned with the man whose task it must be to bring the divine word to the Israelite people."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, Moshe Radiant 1",Exodus 34:29-35
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part V; The Covenant Broken and Restored, Moshe Radiant 2","As if to underscore the point just made, and like the Tent section in Chap. 33, the Calf account ends with a focus on Moshe’s leadership. Gone is any reference to the molten image; the central concern is the effect of God’s communication upon Moshe. Indeed, “speak” occurs seven times here, and the formula “the skin of Moshe’s face was radiating” three times. Putting this section at the end of the narrative leaves the reader with the sense that Moshe’s prayer for God’s closeness in Chap. 33 has at last been answered, and that his very body now bears the sign of divine favor (note the use of the rich symbol of light). Communication between God and Moshe, with Israel witnessing and therefore involved again (in contrast to its removal from this activity at the beginning of Chap. 32), may now proceed again without interruption, and it will now be possible and appropriate to resume construction of the structure whose purpose it is to embody God’s presence in the world of human beings."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part VI; The Building of the Dwelling 2","A<small>S IF NOTHING HAD GONE AWRY</small>, <small>THE NARRATIVE NOW RETURNS TO DESCRIBE HOW THE</small> Dwelling was built. This time, as was noted by the sages of the Talmud, the order follows the natural logic of construction (i.e., dwelling, tapestries, covering, boards, sockets, bars, etc., and then the ritual objects), rather than the earlier one of sanctity (i.e., coffer, purgation-cover, table, lampstand, etc., and then the structure itself). The most notable omission is the carrying out of priestly ordination; that is reserved for Lev. 8, perhaps so as not to interfere with the narrative momentum of the construction process, or else to focus more on the Dwelling itself and its divine resident. The only major interruption in this part is 38:21–31, which fits in with one of the important themes of these chapters: the extent of the Israelites’ contribution to the sanctuary."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part VI; The Building of the Dwelling 3","As there is no need to repeat what was said about each part of the Tabernacle in the commentary to Chaps. 25–31, the commentary here will be limited to brief remarks on the differences between the two long Tabernacle sections (Parts IV and VI); here Cassuto has provided most of the necessary material."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part VI; The Building of the Dwelling, Preparations for the Construction 2","The account of what the Israelites brought as contributions for the work, and the description of those who were to carry it out, is long and repetitive. This factor, with the addition of a refrainlike pattern of key words (e.g., “mind,” “willing,” “service,” “work,” “wise,” “design,” “brought”), strongly portrays the people’s enthusiasm for and participation in the sacred task. Note also the fourteenfold occurrence of “every/all/entire” (Heb. <i>kol</i>) in vv.20–29. Vv.3–7 push the narrative to a crescendo, with the people actually bringing much more than is needed (and may also be a contrast to their briefly stated surrendering of jewels in the Calf episode, 32:3)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part VI; The Building of the Dwelling, The Completion of the Parts; Bringing Them to Moshe 3","More significant is what has long been noted: the literal parallels between our section and the initial creation story in Genesis (see, for instance, Leibowitz and Sarna 1986). The phrases “Thus was finished …” (v.32), “And Moshe saw all the work: and here, they had made it” (v.43), and “Then Moshe blessed them” (v.43), echo “Thus were finished …” (Gen. 2:1), “Now God saw all that he had made,/and here: it was exceedingly good” (Gen. 1:31), and “God gave the seventh day his blessing” (Gen. 2:3). At the end of the passage describing the erection of the Tabernacle, there is an additional parallel: “So Moshe finished the work” (40:33); cf. Gen. 2:2: “God had finished … his work.” The close parallels suggest what we find in the case of many cultures: human building, especially (but not exclusively) of sanctuaries, is to be viewed as an act of imitating God. The Israelites, at the close of the book chronicling their founding as a people, link up with God’s scheme in creating the world. The Dwelling is therefore a reflection of the perfection of the world and the divine hand that oversees it. Yet neither the people nor Moshe pronounces the Genesis words “it was (exceedingly) good” over the sanctuary; that would be human <i>hubris</i>."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Exodus, Part VI; The Building of the Dwelling, Final Instructions; Setting Up 2","Most prominent in God’s commands to erect the Tabernacle are two related verbs: “hallow” and “anoint,” each of which occurs in one form or another eight times here. So the major theme here is not the actual building, but dedication for a purpose. Included in this section, as it was in Part IV, is the appointment of Aharon and his sons to “be-priests.”"

There are a number of technical terms which, in addition to their constant repetition in the text, inviting overemphasis on strangeness, are difficult to render accurately into English. For their part, Buber and Rosenzweig translated what they understood as the meaning of these terms, even if it meant creating new words in German that made little sense to someone not familiar with the Hebrew concepts. Some examples are found below."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus 2","My initial inclination was to leave the names of sacrifices, etc., in Hebrew transcription, but I have come to feel that this places an undue burden on the English reader. With some reservations I have therefore opted for a mix of transcription and translation."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus 3","Buber saw the names of several sacrifices as suggesting movement between the human and the divine. Thus the names of the two most common sacrifices, <i>korban</i> and <i>ola</i>, were rendered “Nearbringing” and “Highbringing” in B-R. I have utilized “near-offering” and “offering-up”; in the case of the former, the intent of the text may simply have been to indicate what the worshiper “brings-near” to the altar, although the effect was certainly understood to bring humans closer to God. A third type of sacrifice, the <i>minha</i>, which B-R rendered as “leading-gift,” always indicates a “grain-gift” in cultic texts. My German predecessors would undoubtedly not have approved of my less radical approach to these terms; I have, however, followed them in retaining “bringing-near” as a verb, denoting variously “to bring,” “to sacrifice,” and “to officiate” (in the sanctuary), which I have indicated in the Notes."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus 4","As for <i>hattat</i> and <i>asham</i>, these two key sacrifices have a number of meanings in the text. I have chosen to retain them in transcription, providing occasional translations on location or explanations in the notes."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus 5","A most important term in the priestly material is the adjective <i>tamei</i> (along with its noun, <i>tum’a</i>). The word refers to a ritual state, the existence of which was understood in ancient Israel as a grave danger to the “purity” of the sanctuary. It is not, however, “uncleanness” in the physical sense, but a state akin perhaps to radioactivity: in this case, it drives away the divine presence from Israel (cf. Greenstein 1984a for another analogy). B-R used “stained/tainted” in their translation; most recent scholars use “polluted” and “pollution” to describe the phenomenon. I have accepted the latter in my discussions below but have chosen to stay with Hebrew transcription in the text itself, allowing for a wider and less overtly negative form of the term. Were I in a flippant mood brought on by political correctness, I might suggest “ritually challenged” for <i>tamei</i>."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus 6","One more problem in translating Leviticus is worthy of mention. A Buber-Rosenzweig type of rendition is fairly adaptable for narrative and even poetry; but in legal and cultic passages, such as we find in abundance in Leviticus, it imposes huge constraints on the translator. Recent English translations such as JPS and the New Revised Standard Version have conveyed the basic meaning of these passages in reasonably clear language. I, on the other hand, have not found it possible to avoid awkward English in this material. I hope nevertheless that, despite the difficulties involved for the reader, the rhetoric and structure—and sometimes the obscurity—of the Hebrew, which left the text open to later disagreement and interpretation, will still be visible and instructive."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus 7","A final note on translation practices. Buber and Rosenzweig did not always hold to the principle of one Hebrew root, one corresponding German root, if this was unimportant or simply an impossibility. I have similarly on occasion deviated from full consistency in translating certain words. So, for instance, I found that the many different uses of Heb. <i>shamor</i>—“guard,” “keep,” “take-care”—simply could not be standardized in translation. In the main, when I have found it possible to connect passages via their standardized language in the Hebrew, I have done so in English."

Many people find it difficult to relate to the description of ritual slaughter of animals and the disposal of their blood and flesh in the opening section of the book, or to the detailed prescriptions regarding bodily functions, skin disease, and mold in Chapters 12–15. Others experience Leviticus as obscure: Why exactly do Aaron’s sons die in Chapter 10? How can one explain the ritual of the scapegoat in Chapter 16? A frequently encountered reaction to the book is the desire to get on to the book of Numbers—which at least has some intriguing narratives such as Moses’ sin and punishment, the faint-heartedness of the spies, and Balaam’s reversed prophecies."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 3","Yet Leviticus, as it has been placed in the Torah, signals that something of singular importance is at work. The book, after all, occurs at the center of the overall five-book structure. Unlike the other four, it is set entirely around Mount Sinai, and so it forms, geographically as well as structurally, the heart of the Torah document. In addition, the priestly interests so clearly presented in Leviticus appear throughout the Torah: as genealogical lists (Genesis, Exodus, Numbers), descriptions of rituals (Exodus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), and details about the building of the desert “Dwelling” of God (Exodus). Indeed, the opening chapter of it all, Gen. 1 (the Creation story), has strong links in both its themes and terminology with the priestly law."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 4","Leviticus in fact presents a significant strain, conventionally termed the “priestly” view, in biblical thought. Anthropologically considered, it sheds important light on the outlook of some of those who compiled and read the Hebrew Bible. And the process did not stop there. Many of the categories found in Leviticus were continued and expanded by later Judaism: regulations concerning sexuality and diet, concepts of separation and holiness, and how to deal with one’s fellow human beings in a variety of economic and social settings. These found expression in different but still recognizable form simultaneously in the development of Christianity."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 5","In late antiquity Leviticus was known as <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, the Priestly Instruction (or simultaneously understood, as Levine suggests, as the Instruction of the Priests). Given both the concerns of the priestly writers and the wording they use to express those concerns, I see Leviticus as the Book of Separations, the book in which are set forth distinctions between a whole range of aspects of ancient Israelite experience and practice: holy and profane; ritual purity and pollution; permitted and forbidden in sexuality and diet; Israelites and others; and priests, Levites, and common folk among the Israelites. This near-obsession with drawing lines (or, as Douglas has presented it, concentric circles) may in some sense reflect the position of Israel in the ancient Near East as a small, beleaguered newcomer in a region of hoary empires, situated on land that was constantly invaded by both great powers and local foes. It may also be an echo of the larger Bronze Age and Iron Age process of change from the former, well-nigh universal worship of the Mother Goddess, to the later patriarchal societies with which the Western world still deals through its three monotheistic religions and their cultural outgrowths."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 6","Overarching the theme of separations or distinctions, through much of the book, is the polarity of order/disorder, represented best in Leviticus by the problem of life and death. As many scholars have noted, regulations regarding sacrifice here connect up with symbolically offering up human life—through the substitution of an animal—to the deity; blood is avoided at all costs, due to its connoting life. Animals that may be used for food (as well as for sacrifice) are in the main those which do not consume other living creatures. Pollutants which endanger the purity of the sanctuary (“Dwelling”) include bodily emissions which the Israelites connected with death (e.g., menstrual blood and “wasted” semen). Finally, the complex system of purification from some kind of skin disease may well originate in the similarity between disease and death. In sum, then, it is no surprise that, two books later, the Deuteronomic Moses implores the people to “choose life” rather than the “death” engendered by improper behavior by both priests and commoners."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 7","Interestingly, the strong urge to make order (ritual laws) out of disorder (the chaotic processes of human life, from killing animals for food to sexual relations) is reflected in other aspects of the Torah—most notably in the narrative portrayal of the descent lines from father Abraham. Here, the discontinuity represented by sibling rivalries and other threats to survival is countered by God’s establishing a kind of continuity through the choosing of younger brothers. In this case, the strong hand of ritual control is replaced by the somewhat hazardous element of surprise and close calls. But it does manage to provide for family continuity and, ultimately, the survival of the people. Whether this points to early or later experiences historically is the subject of ongoing and unresolved debate among biblical scholars. A widely accepted possibility is that the Torah as we have it was edited by priestly editors living in or shortly after the Babylonian Exile (6th–5th centuries <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>.), and that those editors took earlier material (which itself was already multilayered) and adapted it into an overall scheme expressing promise, disobedience, destruction, and survival/hope (cf. Fox 1993)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 8","In point of fact, Leviticus is best viewed as only a part, albeit the major one as a bloc, of a major thrust of the Torah. According to most biblical scholars, the “priestly” worldview, and the texts that may be attributed to it, makes its appearance with the very chapter with which the entire Torah begins, Gen. 1. Here distinctions and ordering are at the very heart of the text. God, immediately after his first creation-by-word (light), “separates” between light and darkness, then goes on to perform the same operation between heavenly waters (the storehouses of rain) and earthly ones. His remaining acts of creation involve putting heavenly bodies, vegetation, and animal life in order—each “according to its kind,” on specific days of creation. Animals are distinguished from plants through their receiving vocal divine blessing; humans from animals through the addition to the blessing of the phrase “have dominion over” the rest of living things. At the same time, humans are told that they may eat only what grows from the ground, implying that to do otherwise would be a violation of the order of things. Crowning the whole account is the poem (Gen. 2:1–4a) about God’s “finishing” of the “work” of creation, symbolized by his “hallowing” (making holy or separate-for-God) the seventh day. In Gen. 1, then, we are presented with a brief but complete vision of the cosmos as ordered in space, time, and life-forms, under the aegis of a metasexual, nonviolent, and benevolent deity."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 9","As Genesis unfolds under priestly influence, humans are presented with basic rules and warned of the consequences if those rules are broken. The paradisical situation of Adam and Eve (no labor, vegetarianism, no danger from animals, and sexual innocence) is disrupted by human disobedience, resulting in banishment from Eden—a shattering of the previous wholeness and order. Cain’s murder of his brother leads to the same punishment: uprootedness and hard labor. The mixing of divine and human beings in Gen. 6:1–2 results in a clear distinction being established by God, that humans will henceforth be limited in age. Finally, the account of the universal flood in Chapters 6–9 presents a picture that uses a number of Leviticus motifs. The earth is to be destroyed because human wrongdoing has “ruined” it (or, in Levitical language, “polluted” it). Animal life is rescued by means of taking pairs of animals aboard the ark—with Leviticus’s distinctions of “pure” and impure dutifully mentioned. Noah’s three sons, who also come onto the ark, later become the forefathers of three great divisions of humanity, as laid out in detail in the genealogical lists of Chapters 10–11. Finally, the new beginning of the cosmos, with Noah as a second Adam (cf. the latter’s blessing in 1:28 with that of the former in 9:1–2), is accompanied by both animal sacrifices and dietary restrictions (the introduction of meat is new, accompanied by the caveat—as in Lev. 17—that blood is not to be consumed)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 10","A major part of the priestly scheme emerges with the detailed instructions concerning the construction of the Tabernacle (God’s place of “Dwelling” on earth) and the priestly vestments that are to be worn there, in Ex. 25–31 (with much of this material repeated in narrative form in Chapters 35–40). The details make sense as part of a larger picture, in which the closer one gets to the “Holiest Holy-Shrine” where God takes up dwelling, the more central the measurements of space and the more precious the materials used. This concentric sense of order is reflected also in the layout of the wilderness camp of the Israelites in Num. 2. Thus the Tabernacle functions as a minicosmos, a visible and ritual representation of the creation itself. Through the layout of curtains within and tribal encampments without, space is ordered; through the festivals (enumerated in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, with some mention in Exodus as well), time is ordered. And, thanks to the provisions laid out in Leviticus, through priest/lay hierarchy, dietary rules, and sacrificial regulations, life-forms are ordered. The result is an almost utopian scheme. It is a world in which everything and everyone are to take their place under the perfect worship of a perfect God, banishing or avoiding death, defect, and disorder. In the priestly view, the world is to be an echo of the divine order that is portrayed in the Creation story."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 11","Viewed in the perspective of priestly concerns (only part of which we have just outlined), Leviticus is largely concerned with the potential disruption of this utopia. If Genesis chronicles threats to the fulfillment of God’s promises to Abraham, if Numbers recounts threats to his descendants’ survival on their march through the wilderness, then Leviticus concentrates on threats to Israel’s life with God. It presents a whole system of rules designed, first, to provide for purification and reconciliation with God through the sacrificial cult; second, to protect sanctuary, priests, land, and people from estrangement from God (via “pollution” of various kinds); and, finally, to establish a code of behavior that will ensure the perpetual enjoyment of God’s blessings on the land promised to Israel’s ancestors. From this it can readily be seen how Leviticus, far from being of interest to specialists and historians only, is in fact a crucial part of the Torah—perhaps its most crucial part, in that it supplies the ideological center of gravity for the whole. Once Leviticus is added to the narratives, poems, laws, and lists that comprise the rest of the Torah, a picture emerges that is more than literature and more than history. The five books become the multilayered and multifaceted monument that has been studied, puzzled over, and built upon for over two millennia."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 12","In sum, the world of the priestly strain in the Torah is a realm of desired order and perfection, a realm in which wholeness is to reign, in which anomaly and undesired mixture are not permitted, and in which boundaries are zealously guarded. The human body becomes symbolic of the cosmos: its life/death boundary is marked, and troublesome flows from it are carefully regulated. The land of Israel becomes symbolic of the cosmos: too much evildoing pollutes it, to the point where it can do naught else but “vomit out” its settlers (as it vomited out the previous ones). The animal kingdom, from which humans are allowed to take life under carefully prescribed circumstances, becomes symbolic of cosmic values, through heightening awareness of predator and victim, and careful avoidance of blood, the symbol of life. Indeed, in the system of Leviticus, it is no wonder that death is the major pollutant, and that blood of acceptable animal sacrifice is the agent through which human beings find atonement for minor pollutants."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 34",Other commentators have of course seen it differently. Most follow the traditional scholarly approach of starting the “Holiness Code” with Chapter 17; Levine rightly parallels it to the beginnings of other law collections in the Torah (Ex. 20:19–23 and Deut. 12; the ending here in Chapter 26 also parallels the endings in the other two codes). Hallo understands the structure as 1–11: Rites of Consumption; 12–16: Rites of Purification; and 17–26: Holiness.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 35","Overshadowing the clear three-part structure, however one wants to divide it up, is the complex issue of two apparent documents or schools of thought. Biblical scholarship terms these P (“Priestly”) and H (“Holiness”), and roughly attributes the first part of the book (through Chap. 16) to P, with the rest to H. There has been detailed, ongoing debate about the approaches and dating of these sources. As of this writing, it is generally accepted that H is later than P, but there seem to be numerous interpolations of one source into the other, and it is difficult to place them historically with certainty. Here, as elsewhere in biblical literature, we have a layering effect rather than a clear-cut delineation of “authors.” As usual, that appears to have been intentional."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 36","A word should be said about the relationship between law and narrative in the Torah. As Damrosch has noted, the legal and cultic texts in the five books might be seen by modern readers as intrusive. On the surface, they certainly seem to interrupt a good story. Genesis is largely unencumbered by nonaction (except for the genealogical lists—attributed to P!), but the gripping account of the redemption from Egypt in Exodus, and the drama of revelation on and apostasy beneath Mount Sinai, give way to the sober architectural details of the Tabernacle’s construction. Similarly, the narratives of the book of Numbers, which are among the most striking in the literature, are set off against a background of censuses, laws about suspected adultery and the taking of vows, Levitical duties in the Dwelling, and an enumeration of sacrificial gifts brought by the tribes, among other things."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 37","The bulk of material in Leviticus, and its placement in the Torah, make it clear that the five books that we have convey their point precisely through the medium of narrative <i>plus</i> cult/law. In the Israelite worldview, these two rather distinct forms, which intermingle past, present, and future (Damrosch), fruitfully enrich and explain one another. It is as if a history of the American Revolution contained all of the debates on and drafts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, as well as accounts of battles and biographies of key personalities. That such an approach parallels neither Homeric epic nor ritual texts in their purity of form is exactly the point: we have here a new genre of great complexity and richness, in which narratives exemplify laws and laws follow narratives. The result is truly a torah, a “teaching” or “instruction.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 38","Finally, we might mention the issue of priests and laypeople. Scholars have often seen Leviticus as originating as a manual for priests. What is most fascinating, and perhaps most important (for later history), about this book is the way in which it takes priestly rules and transmutes at least some of them for use in the general populace of ancient Israel. This can be seen most dramatically in the dietary laws, which in other cultures often serve exclusively for priests, and in the area of sexual taboos, which do likewise. In postbiblical Judaism this shift becomes particularly evident: the Jew’s dinner table is termed a “sanctuary in miniature” (complete with loaves of bread and the use of salt—two elements found in the ancient sacrificial cult); dietary laws are expanded for the general population to provide for separation of milk and meat; and separation of husband and wife during menstruation, among traditional Jews, leaves the context of Sanctuary pollution and finds a home in the context of a philosophy of marriage. Many other examples could be brought of the widening of priestly laws to an entire people. Perhaps most dramatic—and most significant—is the eventual shift of the learning and interpretation of sacred texts away from the priests, who in most cultures served as the guardians of the text (and often the culture’s only literate body; cf. medieval Christian Europe). In Judaism of late antiquity, this monopoly was decisively broken; first the scribe and then the rabbi (“master”) took over, with learning extended at last to all those who might make the effort to acquire it. The great exception, at least in antiquity, was women—who, it will be noted, were also excluded from priestly functions in the Bible."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 39","Three relatively recent developments make it possible to approach Leviticus as a significant, powerful, and interesting biblical text. The first is the explosion of both full-length and shorter studies of the book and its concerns that have appeared in recent years. The work of Milgrom (1991), Levine (1989), Wenham (1979), Eilberg-Schwartz (1990), and Bamberger (1981), to cite just a few of the English-language studies on aspects of Leviticus, now makes it possible to have a serious entry into the book based largely on advances in understanding the cultures of the ancient Near East. It also, admittedly, puts the translator and commentator in a bind: is it possible to add anything new, or will it suffice simply to summarize? My approach in this volume has been largely the latter, along with suggesting to the reader some fruitful directions for further study."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 40","The second development helpful for approaching Leviticus, which also informs many of the studies just mentioned, is the using of anthropological insights to understand concepts and rituals found in the book. Such an approach places Leviticus in a broader human context, indicating what it does and does not share with other cultural and religious systems. For Leviticus is concerned with the same issues that plague all human societies: how to deal with the boundaries of life and death, how to comprehend and approach the transcendent in life, how to understand one’s (or one’s nation’s) place in the cosmic order, how to make for a just society. Viewed in this light, the book is a “Small Code” (cf. Northrop Frye’s designation of the Bible as “the Great Code”). That is, Leviticus need not remain a total mystery to us, to be unraveled only through detailed analysis and even change (Judaism) or substitution (Christianity), but can be understood on its own terms, if approached with care and in the spirit of seeking the larger picture in the details."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure 41","Finally, we should mention the aesthetic dimension. Like the other books of the Torah, Leviticus uses its own rhetoric to convey its message. Far from employing flat “priestly” style (whatever that may be), it uses formulas, refrains, and other rhythmical forms to impress its teaching (Heb. <i>tora</i>) upon its hearers. This aspect of the book has been the subject of recent study (cf. Paran), but was already echoed in the Buber-Rosenzweig translation. It is my hope that the present volume will contribute to an appreciation of the style of Leviticus."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 1",Leviticus 1–10
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 2","T<small>HE SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK OF</small> E<small>XODUS CONCERNED ITSELF WITH SETTING UP THE</small> sacrificial cult of Israel. It therefore set forth the prescriptions for and construction of a sanctuary and the priestly garments, and laid out a ceremony for the investiture of priests. But the description of how sacrifices were to be offered, and for what purpose, is not part of the book, which as edited seems more interested in contrasting the building of a sanctuary with building cities for the Pharaohs, as part of its portrayal of the victory of the biblical God over the gods of Egypt. Although at the end of the book the “Dwelling” is completed, we do not get to see the various sacral rites performed there."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 3","Leviticus also delays the ordination of the priests, until Chapter 8, preferring instead to begin with a kind of manual on the offering and disposal of sacrifices. It then moves us from the details of sacrifice into the narrative of the sanctuary’s dedication and opening rites, providing a natural bridge for Part II, in which ritual pollution and purity, the province of priests, is dealt with."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 4","The function of the sacrificial cult in ancient Israel will be discussed in “On Animal Sacrifice” below. In general it should be noted that the existence of a class or profession whose job it is to mediate between the divine and human realms is widespread in most older cultures, and the Israelite priesthood, whatever its origins and development, was but one of many such groups in the ancient Near East. It existed, to use the language of Exodus, to “serve” God, maintaining his holiness through ritual and helping to maintain the order of sacred culture which was supposed to mirror God’s ordering of the cosmos. Accordingly, as we will learn later in Leviticus, priests were to be set apart from the general population in a number of areas. There were strict rules about whom they could and could not marry, and they were barred from coming into any contact with the dead, for instance. Their functions extended beyond sacrifice; they could provide oracular advice in times of need, and taught the people “instructions” (Heb. <i>torot</i>) regarding various ritual matters."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 5","As part of an overall scheme, there was a conscious parallel between priests as part of a select circle and sacrificial animals—as well as the people of Israel. That is, all three stood at the center of concentric circles dedicated to God; and as one moved out (toward Levite and commoner, animals permitted for eating and those forbidden, and neighbors and foreigners), one got further and further away from the divine. The hierarchy regarding the cult thus reinforced the theme of separation which we have noted above."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 6","In the view of Milgrom, Israel’s cult was distinguished from those of its neighbors by its purposefully ignoring the complex web of rituals regarding demons. The sanctuary was to be purged of ritual pollution, not only by semimagical means (the sprinkling of sacrificial blood) but also and primarily by the confession of wrongdoing and the sincere desire to repent. Then, too, the sanctuary, while in most respects resembling shrines elsewhere in the ancient Near East, omitted certain crucial items, most notably statuary representing the gods and a bed for them to rest on. Finally, certain religious rituals were forbidden, such as mutilation of the priests’ bodies. In all these cases, Israel introduced something new into the area of worship."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 7","For many decades there has been major and heated debate by scholars in favor of one or the other scheme for following the history of the priesthood and the cult. There are those who view these institutions as stretching back to Israel’s earliest history, while others see strong evidence of a late, possibly even exilic, reworking of the priestly material. Similar arguments dot the landscape of literary criticism of the Torah, in which scholars have tried to divine at what point priestly editors might have put their distinctive stamp on the literature. From Wellhausen in the nineteenth century to Knohl, Milgrom, and Levine in the late twentieth, there has been no lack of theorizing on these issues—and no definitive answers. For the moment we are left to read Leviticus as it is placed in the Torah, with an awareness that a variety of historical and ideological influences are imbedded, if not hidden, in our text."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 8",O<small>N</small> A<small>NIMAL</small> S<small>ACRIFICE</small>
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 9","A<small>LTHOUGH IT APPEARS EARLIER IN THE</small> T<small>ORAH</small>, <small>ANIMAL SACRIFICE RECEIVES ITS FULL</small>est treatment in Leviticus. Besides the opening seven chapters, which are devoted to a relatively brief description of how sacrifices are to be offered and disposed of, many other chapters in the book talk about sacrificial rituals: the installation of the priests (8–9), rules about disposing of the <i>hattat</i> sacrifice (10), purification offerings brought in the event of such “polluting” states as childbirth and skin diseases (12–15), and finally the “scapegoat” ceremony of Chapter 16. They appear in most of the later chapters as well."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 10","What function did sacrifice, particularly of animals, play in the religion of ancient Israel? How could a God who proscribed the murder of human beings (Ex. 20:13, 21:12) countenance the taking of animal life for ritual purposes? To answer these questions, we must turn briefly to some of the commonly proposed theories surrounding sacrifice."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 11","The idea of offering up living creatures to the gods is one of hoary antiquity. Walter Burkert, on the basis of the study of Greek religion, suggests that sacrifice is a means of dealing with guilt over the taking of life. That is, the switch from gathering to hunting society, made possible by technology (the invention of tools), while it raised human accomplishment and consciousness to a new level, also brought with it the acute sense of having violated something essential in the cosmic order. Such guilt is not mitigated by the fact that early people hunted for food and not for pleasure. The way of dealing with the guilt, giving life back to the gods, is in a true sense restoration; life is given back for life taken, so that it may ultimately be renewed (contrast this to the profoundly unecological use of living and inorganic resources over the past “civilized” centuries). And it must be done via ritual. In Burkert’s view, ritual deals with human anxiety by “raising the ante”—by means of increasing anxiety, it is controlled. So guilt over life-taking is assuaged by making a ritual out of the killing, and the shared experience of trauma helps to create solidarity within the group. Despite the subsequent rise of agriculture, says Burkert, the hunting ritual played out in sacrifice could not be done away with, so ingrained had it become, and the rationale behind sacrifices was therefore transformed. Now domesticated animals could be used, giving greater control over the process."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 12","In another approach, De Vaux (1965) postulates three motives for sacrifice. In the first model, that of “gift,” the worshiper brings something of value to the deity. The animal is killed, setting it apart for sacred use; it is burned, turning it into an invisible substance which can rise to the gods. The gift may be for thanksgiving or, more likely, may be to assuage the demonic powers that many societies (especially Mesopotamia, Abraham’s homeland) felt controlled everyday life. Giving establishes reciprocal movement; altruism has no place here (Burkert). One is reminded of the elaborate giving ceremonies among many peoples on occasions such as weddings; giving establishes relationship and maintains the social order."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 13","In addition to gifts, another mode of sacrifice involves communion, as nineteenth-century scholars such as Robertson Smith observed. Here the model of the meal is crucial: humans and gods share a great repast, thereby cementing kinship as surely as the closing of business deals is celebrated by drinks and dinner. Passover, both in the Bible and subsequently (even when the sacrifice per se was no longer involved), may serve as a striking example of the effectiveness of such a paradigm."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 14","A final type or function of sacrifice is atonement or expiation. Here a sin, communal or individual, is purged away by the act of sacrifice; the gods receive life as a substitute for the sinner’s own, which is symbolized by the victim’s blood. The fact that the animals permitted in the Bible for sacrifice are pastoral and hence frequently used metaphorically for the Israelites themselves, is significant in this regard. This approach is further illustrated in the Bible by the end of the Flood story, where God accepts Noah’s sacrifice, implying that he accepts animal life (which now, simultaneous with properly offered sacrifice, is permissible for food) in place of that of humans (Eilberg-Schwartz). It should be noted that, in the Bible, sacrifice for the sake of atonement is almost always in reference to unintentional sins, whereas deliberate wrongdoing may not be atoned for through this system."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 15","Which of these rationales is truly at work in Levitical sacrifice? Actually, at various times one can find all of them—the texts present a variety of motives and occasions for sacrifice in biblical Israel, from thanksgiving to purification and reparation. But in general one may say of Israelite sacrifice, as one may say of much of the ritual in Leviticus, that it is designed primarily to maintain or repair the relationship between God and Israel. Such an understanding helps to explain the unity of the book, as we will see in our discussion of pollution: sacrifice was a crucial element in keeping the covenant, and hence God’s beneficent presence among the Israelites, intact."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood 16","The fact that this reconciliation, as it were, takes place against a background of slaughter should not be as upsetting to moderns as it is usually felt to be. In ironic contrast to our mechanized and mass-produced society, where the killing of animals for food takes place at a remove from our consciousness and from our direct participation, the sacrificial system in fact involved worshiper and priest alike, and the symbolic value of the operation, whatever it may have been in specific cases, lay in its directness, in its consciousness of the taking of life. Some would even maintain that in societies where the practice and rationale for sacrifice has broken down, there is inevitably an increase in intrahuman violence (Girard)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Varied Sacrificial Offerings I 1",Leviticus 1:1-17
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Varied Sacrificial Offerings I 2","The first chapter begins with a description of the <i>ola</i>, the “offering-up,” which appears throughout the Bible as a standard sacrifice, frequently preceding others. It is characterized by being totally burned on the altar, and functions essentially to bring human beings to the attention of God and to win his acceptance. So the offering-up does not deal with sin, as later sacrifices do (Wenham)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Varied Sacrificial Offerings I 3","This opening chapter of the book sets the standard pattern for the first seven chapters concerned with sacrifices. It lays out general rules about the preparation and presentation of the offerings; from 7:38 on and throughout the rest of the Torah, specific applications and how they work will be explained (Anderson). Enumerated are the kind of animal to be sacrificed (in order of value, and hence indicating that rich and poor alike have access to the system); the personal participation of the worshiper; and the tasks of the priests. Many of the phrases recur throughout the opening chapters of the book, but the main refrain is the concluding “fire-offering of soothing savor for Y<small>HWH</small>.” Three kinds of animals appear here; they are, again, all domesticated."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Varied Sacrificial Offerings II 1",Leviticus 2:1-16
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Varied Sacrificial Offerings II 2","The <i>minha</i>, understood earlier in the Bible as simply “tribute” or “gift” (cf. Gen. 4:3 and 32:14), comes in the priestly texts to indicate specifically an offering of grain. Using a three-part structure of grain cooked in an oven/griddle/pan, paralleling Chap, 1’s cattle/sheep/birds, the description of the <i>minha</i> focuses on the type of grain offered, what is added to it, the strictures against fermenting, and the “covenant of salt.” The chapter ends with the usual refrain, “a fire-offering for Y<small>HWH</small>.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Varied Sacrificial Offerings III 1",Leviticus 3:1-17
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Varied Sacrificial Offerings III 2","The purpose of the so-called <i>shalom</i> sacrifice has been debated. Levine, for one, sees it as a “sacred gift of greeting,” intended to address God in the fellowship of other laypeople and priests at a sacred meal. This communal, lay aspect of the sacrifice is significant. Some scholars have understood animal sacrifice to be essentially humanity’s way of bonding with the gods (as well as with dead ancestors), and would thus see in the present form, with its emphasis on the meat, an example of this idea."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Varied Sacrificial Offerings III 3","Unlike the obligatory sacrifices, the shalom sacrifice accepts a variety of animals, and the rules regarding them are not as stringent. Some theorize that originally all meat-eating in ancient Israel was of this type."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Varied Sacrificial Offerings III 4","Once again, we have the division into larger and smaller domestic animals. Notable is the descriptive refrain regarding the disposal of the animals’ innards."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings I 1",Leviticus 4:1-35
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings I 2","The first of these, the <i>hattat</i>, is the subject of voluminous recent debate among scholars. Formerly translated as “sin-offering,” it is now (thanks to Milgrom) understood more accurately as a purification offering in a variety of settings. The <i>hattat</i> decontaminates the sanctuary, and apparently individuals as well, and so is extraordinarily important in Israelite cultic thinking and practice. B-R rendered it (as have others) as a “de-sin offering,” which, while inelegant, preserves the biblical connection between sin (moral pollution) and ritual pollution. Again the sacrifice involves a multiple structure, dealing with the different components of the community: priests, community as a whole, leaders, and individuals. The High Priest’s ritual is more elaborate than those that follow, as befits the representative of the community. Once his ritual is complete, we encounter for the other parties the refrain “and he/they shall be granted-pardon.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings I 3","Central to the <i>hattat</i>-offering is the use of its blood as a detergent to absorb and purify the pollution that has accrued in the sanctuary. As a prime signifier of life, it will have this function a number of times in the Torah."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings II 1",Leviticus 5:1-26
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings II 2","The last sacrifice described in these opening chapters is the <i>asham</i>, variously translated as “guilt-offering” and (more recently) “reparation-offering.” Its use varies, but can involve financial restitution for wrongdoing. There is disagreement about whether the verb means “to feel guilt” (Milgrom) or “to realize guilt”; in any event, the sacrifice deals with the realm of blame/liability, especially in cases of unintentional wrongdoing. Notable in this chapter are several refrains: “and the priest is to effect-purgation for him from his sin,” “it is a <i>hattat</i>-offering” (which returns here), and “he shall be granted-pardon.”"

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Instructions on Disposing of Sacrifices I 2","What happened to the sacrifices after their being offered belongs to the category of what Hallo calls “consumption”—that is, a complex system of either nonuse (burning), “payment” for the priests (eating), or permission for the worshiper to eat. Here again we encounter a threefold structure corresponding to groups of three sacrifices. This time, however, the order adopted depends on the frequency of the sacrifice, from daily to voluntary (Wenham). The chapter also introduces the important word <i>tora</i> (conventionally spelled <i>Torah</i>), “instruction,” which will recur at key points throughout the first half of Leviticus. It apparently originally meant “[priestly] rules/instructions,” but later came to connote portions of Moses’ teachings (especially Deuteronomy) and eventually the Five Books of Moses as a whole."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Instructions on Disposal of Sacrifices II 1",Leviticus 7:1-38
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Instructions on Disposal of Sacrifices II 2",The first part of the chapter concerns the eating of three more categories of sacrifice. Vv.16–27 demonstrate the extreme caution regarding lay consumption. The ending (vv.37–38) provides a summary (which mentions a “mandate-offering” not described in this chapter!) and phraseology that usually occurs at the end of a book or major section in the Torah: “which Y<small>HWH</small> commanded Moshe at Mount Sinai … in the wilderness of Sinai.”

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Installing the Priests 2","This chapter and the next, which might easily have followed the instructions for it in Ex. 29, has instead been placed here, perhaps as the logical conclusion to material about offering sacrifices. (Placing it at the end of Exodus might also have detracted from the impressive scene with which that book ends. For a discussion of the complex relationship between the Exodus and Leviticus texts, see Milgrom.) We now shift from a prescriptive mode to a descriptive, narrative one, which will prepare us for the brief but disastrous story of Aharon’s sons in Chap. 10."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Installing the Priests 3","A refrain here is various forms of “as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe,” also a key phrase in the Exodus texts. In addition, one hears the constant use of the verb “make-holy,” appropriate in this context. Finally, one might point to the balance between Moshe’s sequence of action in Chap. 8 and Aharon’s parallel actions in Chap. 9."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Installing the Priests 4","There is much in this chapter that is rhythmic. The description of Aharon’s being clothed in the holy vestments in vv.7–9 has the ring of ritual to it, as conveyed through its steady alternation of verb and garment."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Installation Continued; The System in Operation 2","Until now, the description of sacrifices has been largely from the viewpoint of the worshiper. Now the perspective changes to narrative, and is from the viewpoint of the priests—with the recognition at the same time that it is a public ceremony. Again, as Milgrom has noted, there is no verbal component to the ceremony (although some have argued that it is inconceivable that sacrifices could have been offered in silence). The sacrifice of the <i>hattat</i>-offering, along with other types of offerings, once again suggests the importance of a purified, perfect system in the worship of God."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Installation Continued; The System in Operation 3","The refrain in vv.4 and 6 concerns God’s “being-seen” by the Israelites; what is in fact seen is his “Glory” or “aura,” reminiscent of Mount Sinai and the completion of the Dwelling in the book of Exodus. The ending of the chapter also recalls the ending of Exodus, with the leaders blessing the people and fire proceeding from God."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Systems Failure 2","As so often in the Torah, a brief narrative breaks in at this point, apparently to illustrate the dangers associated with the priests’ tasks that we have just celebrated in the previous chapter. Just as the sin of the Golden Calf followed scenes of revelation at Sinai, so here too we are taken from the pomp of the priests’ installation and set face to face with human failure. Alternatively, the story could be explained as a lead-in to the laws on priestly behavior in vv.9–11, just as the Golden Calf story precedes a remade covenant in Ex. 34."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Systems Failure 3","What exactly was Nadav and Avihu’s capital crime? Commentators over the ages have argued back and forth. Some see it as accidental: Nadav and Avihu somehow misconstrued what they were supposed to do—but divine service can brook no errors on the part of the people’s representatives. Other interpreters, taking their clue from v.9, feel that Nadav and Avihu were drunk and so not in full control of their ritual duties. Milgrom’s suggestion, that the story serves to warn the Israelite audience to stay away from offering their own incense (which often was connected to idolatry), makes historical sense; but the context of the tale here, after what has gone before, makes the specific crime less important than the idea that the priests must in general “get it right.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part I; The Cult and the Priesthood, Systems Failure 4","The chapter has a three-part structure: crime/punishment/mourning; laws on drunkenness of priests and the proper disposal of the sacrifices; and a confrontation between Moshe and Aharon over ritual procedure, which is resolved, not by death but by reasoned discussion."

Greenstein 1985a). Once the book of Exodus ends, with the erection of the Tabernacle—a symbolic reflection of the cosmos in which God “takes up dwelling” among the Israelites—we are left with a structure that must be carefully guarded and its ritual purity maintained. To this end, Leviticus now turns to the issue of pollutants, largely of the body, that arise from what we might call territorial problems: the border of what goes into the body, expressed through animals permitted and forbidden for food; the border between life and death, as expressed through sexual functions and discharges; and the border of outer surfaces, as expressed through skin disease (<i>tzaraat</i>), mildew on clothing, and mold on houses. The system of avoidance and purification that is presented in Chapters 11–15 ensures that the “Holy-Area” will either not become polluted or, should that prove to be unavoidable, will be properly decontaminated, for such contamination has the potential of leading to God’s withdrawal from dwelling “in the midst” of the people of Israel."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 3","The pollutants discussed in these chapters do not by and large carry with them punishments per se; that is, they are not regarded as violations of the moral order (although <i>tzaraat</i> in biblical stories often did carry the implication that the victim had in fact done something to deserve his or her condition). Nor do they pose an actual danger to the person—unless he or she comes in contact with holy objects, people, or space. Then it becomes clear that biblical pollution was considered contagious; hence the need for rituals. What was generally required was that the polluted person observe a period of separation from the sanctuary (or, in more extreme cases, from the camp), to be reintegrated after either time alone or with the addition of laundering their clothes and/or washing themselves. In the latter cases, water was seen as acting as a purifying agent, not as cleanser in the detergent sense (and so the word “unclean,” so often used in translating Heb. <i>tamei</i>, is misleading). As before, these processes applied to priests (cf. Chap. 22) and to laypeople alike (Chaps. 12–15). The major pollutant, death, was seen as so virulent that it received treatment in a separate setting, Num. 19."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 4","A different category of pollution existed alongside the one we have just mentioned. It included human wrongdoing, which we might call immoral or unjust actions (e.g., incest, oppression of the poor), and also transgression of boundaries (e.g., between holy and profane, or breaching the fairly rigid system of classification in nature among animals, textiles, etc.). These types of pollution, then, involved behavior which can be seen to be disruptive or worse to the established social order. As a rule they could not be atoned for through sacrifice or other ritual forms, but lead to exile or death. They are dealt with mainly in the final section of Leviticus, Chapters 18–26."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 8","It has long been recognized that seeing the dietary laws as resulting from consciousness of hygiene is a deeply inadequate way of understanding them. Nor can some of the later explanations adduced by Jewish tradition, however noble (for instance, that adhering to such a system teaches self-discipline), provide a satisfactory explanation for the rules in the context of Leviticus. What is more to the point is that the priestly worldview stressed boundaries and order. A hierarchy reigns in virtually every aspect of Israelite life as conceived in the Torah: people, land, animals, eligibility for the priesthood, the Tabernacle, and the calendar. There is a complex system of “graded holiness” (Jenson) informing Israelite life, with two basic messages: (1) God is to be approached in stages, and (2) the world is set up in a tight, ordered structure which reflects the distinctions between God and humans, Israel and the other peoples."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 9","It is especially the latter that is at work in the dietary laws. The animals are discussed in categories that are reminiscent of the (priestly) creation story of Genesis 1; note the refrain in both passages of (each animal) “according to its kind.” Lev. 11 makes distinctions, and scholars have sought to understand them according to a number of possible criteria: ease/clarity of classification (anomalies, especially as regards locomotion, tend to be prohibited), whether or not the animal is carnivorous (those that are, are prohibited), and the wild or domestic status of the animal (the former are frequently prohibited). The message that emerges from the scheme is multifaceted. It would appear to hold that:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 10","1. Human activity is to reflect the inherent orderliness of creation, a kind of imitation of God (namely, as he kept things clear at the beginning, you should do the same with what enters your body)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 11","2. The ideal state, already portrayed in the Garden of Eden story, is vegetarianism—where no animal life need be taken by humans (this despite God’s command to Adam to “dominate [the earth]” in Gen. 1:28)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 12","3. Animals permitted for consumption, among them those fit for sacrifice, are by and large those which are familiar to the Israelites in daily life through domestication. They tend to be animals often used by the Bible to symbolize humans. Eilberg-Schwartz calls this phenomenon “Israel in the mirror of nature,” and gives numerous examples extending throughout Israelite culture. He concludes that “the dietary restrictions carve up the animal world along the same lines as Israelite thought … [they] specify what kinds of animals are ‘food for thought.’”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 13","It should be mentioned that Mary Douglas, who pioneered an anthropological approach to these laws three decades ago, has recently given them another go (1993b). In earlier studies, Douglas (1966) saw the system in Lev. 11 as we have indicated above—as a “cognitive ordering of the universe”; she also spoke of it as symbolizing the protection of boundaries in Israelite society. Her latest understanding focuses on the animals as reflective of the idea that (Israelite) culture is aimed at demonstrating God’s righteousness/justice in all areas of life, through laws regarding the body. Thus, priests, sacrificial animals, and food animals may not have any “blemish” (below, “defect”) in them; and animals prohibited for eating are either the perpetrators or victims of predation (symbolizing the human perpetrators or victims of injustice)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 14","A final point relates to a major theme in Leviticus and indeed in many of the priestly texts of the Torah: separateness. We have seen how a major function in God’s creation of the world—with which the Bible opens!—is “separating” aspects of the natural world. A parallel verb was used in the plague narratives of Exodus, “making a distinction” (between Israelites and Egyptians). With the dietary regulations, “separating” returns. Given these thematics, one can say that Chapter 11 is a linchpin of priestly thinking. Like sexual relations, the other area of intimacy in human affairs, eating in the Bible goes far beyond the confines of one’s home and comes to symbolize an entire approach to life."

To many people, this section is even less interesting than the opening chapters of the book, and seems impossibly bogged down in primitive conceptions of disease and hygiene. But despite the fact that they undoubtedly reflect some ancient conceptions in these areas, these conditions and the role of the priest in making rulings on them have less to do with hygiene and medicine than they do with maintaining the borders between life and death, and symbolically affirming life."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 17","It seems that the polluting discharges are primarily sexual in nature, and this is probably not accidental. The biblical priests, in their extreme concern with both procreation/genealogy (especially of men, since the priesthood was male-hereditary) and purity (in approaching the sanctuary), were presented with a major problem. God, who was to be served in purity, was also the One in whose image human beings were made (Gen. 1:26), yet as a being beyond sexuality, who had neither relationships with other deities nor even a body. He left it ambiguous as to just how humans were to work out their sexual relations. The answer to the dilemma is at least partly solved by the Torah’s regulations regarding pollution and purity, incest and marriage. It is here that the issue of control is most significant. Eilberg-Schwartz points out that control and boundaries apply not only to Israel and the nations, but also and especially to male and female. As a male hierarchy, the priests viewed women, with their closer connections to the life process (and maybe also to previous forms of paganism in the form of goddess worship), as potentially dangerous, or at least problematic, to their system of purity. The seeming “disorder” of women’s discharges (perhaps representing “nature”) threatened the imposition of order (“culture”) that is so central to priestly thinking. But as a group concerned with the perpetuation of both the priestly class and the people of Israel, the priestly class could not do without women altogether, and the inescapable conclusion was strict regulation (cf. also Wegner 1992). Such regulation—labeling certain states or acts “polluting”—had the added benefit of controlling private morality in a way that could not be done otherwise (Douglas 1966)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 18","It is important to note that in classical Judaism after the year 70 (the date of the destruction of the Second Temple), the “purity” laws, while still assiduously studied, by and large ceased to operate except within the sphere of marriage. Thus, to this day, religious Jewish couples temporarily separate sexually during the wife’s period, but this by itself does not legally affect her participation in traditional ritual. The disease here termed <i>tzaraat</i>, translated for millennia as “leprosy,” is now recognized to be something different, perhaps several forms of skin disease involving scaling or flaking. These have nowhere near the frightening and fatal implications of classic leprosy (Hansen’s Disease). Leviticus nevertheless treats <i>tzaraat</i> at great length and in close detail. Here, perhaps more than anywhere else in the book, it is clear that at least parts of Leviticus were originally intended as manuals for priestly “instruction” (note, by the way, the sevenfold occurrence of the term in the pollution chapters, 11–15). It has been theorized that <i>tzaraat</i> is of such concern here because it was felt to resemble death/decay in a clear, outward fashion, and hence fits into these chapters, which deal so much with boundaries."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 19","An unexpected addition, from a contemporary point of view, to the <i>tzaraat</i> of the body is that which appears on textiles and on house walls (a fungus or mold or “dry rot”). The fact that the same word is used to apply to all these situations indicates that a wide concept is being applied here: how visible imperfection damages the utopia of the sacred society."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification 20","Finally, the role of the priest in these chapters should be noted. He does not function to remove demons or perform magical rites, but rather to examine the one suspected of having the disease (note the repetition of “look” in the chapter). He is more teacher and guardian of purity than healer or intermediary."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, The Dietary Rules 2","After ten chapters devoted mainly to cultic rules, we move from the priestly altar to everyone’s table—a fine example of the dual concerns of Leviticus (later Judaism was in fact to dub the table an “altar in miniature,” taking literally the injunction in Exodus for Israel to become a “kingdom of priests”). The chapter, as mentioned in “On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure,” functions as a bridge between the first two parts of the book. As Hallo notes, it rounds out the question of consuming food, a major issue in sacrifices; it also introduces the motif of pollution in a systematic way (there were references to it in regard to sacrifices, but not in as full a manner). The use of “Instruction” in v.46 echoes the summaries of sacrifices in Chap. 7, while “you are to separate” in v.47 links the chapter with the previous one. Looking forward, “Instruction” is also used in the pollution chapters that follow, and the fivefold repetition of “hallow/holy” in vv.44–45 even points us toward the major section on Holiness in the third part of the book."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, The Dietary Rules 3","It should be noted that, from vv.24–40, eating is not the issue, but rather coming into contact with the carcass of a <i>tamei</i> animal. The two areas are joined with the introduction of “swarming” creatures in vv.41–44, and the whole chapter concludes with a call to “separation.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, The Dietary Rules 4","Refrains are many, giving the chapter a more poetic structure than one would expect from such a list: “it is <i>tamei</i> for you,” “it is a detestable-thing for you,” “it is an abominable-thing,” “according to its kind,” “<i>tamei</i> until sunset.” The overwhelmingly negative character of the refrains serves to drum in caution and promote avoidance."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, The Dietary Rules 5","Many of the animals on the lists of Lev. 11 are familiar, but it must be stressed that, as with plant and place-names in the Bible, a number of the precise identifications have been lost to us, and educated guesses are in order."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, Pollution from Childbirth 2","This chapter, which is in chiastic relation to Chap. 15, designates a new mother as <i>tamei</i>, most likely due to her intimate contact with the life/death boundary during childbirth. Her separation from and reintegration into the community echo similar customs in many societies (see Bamberger); as often happens with life-cycle events, ritual here reflects what is happening psychologically. The doubling of the separation period when it is a girl that is born is best explained by the concept that a girl potentially doubles the “life-leak” that has taken place (Greenstein 1984a), since she will one day be a childbearing woman who will herself confront the life-death continuum."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, Pollution from Childbirth 3","While men obviously do not contract ritual pollution through childbirth, the concept of pollution from bodily discharges applies to them as well, as in the case of an involuntary emission of semen (cf.

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, Pollution from Tzaraat 3",Like other sections of Leviticus, this chapter and the next show signs of editing (for instance, the material in 13:47–59). Nevertheless, there is a clear structural pattern characterized by variations of “when … if … if” (Wenham).
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, Pollution from Tzaraat 4",The chapter’s character as “instruction manual” is brought out, according to Fishbane (1974), by its chiastic structure. It is built on three word-groups: (1) “swelling,” (2) “scab/spread,” (3) “shiny-spot” that recur in vv.4–38 (in the form: 3,2,1; 1,2,3; 3,2,1; 2,3). This “unexpected structure” (especially in a nonliterary text), he maintains, may have had the function of easing memorization for the priests, who needed to know this material for their “fieldwork.”

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, Purification from Tzaraat 2","In 13:44–45 we were informed about the diseased person’s isolation from the camp. We now turn to the ceremony attending his purification and, from v.33 on, that of a house. In a complex ritual that foreshadows the great Purgation ceremony of Chap. 16 (with some connections to the ritual of purging the impurity of death in Num. 19), <i>tzaraat</i> is removed from its dangerous position in the camp. Many aspects seem to be archaic and even tinged with magic; in Milgrom’s view, these characteristics survive only symbolically, and ancient Israel has rid itself of dependence on magic—in his words, it has “eviscerated” demonism."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, Purification from Tzaraat 3","The substances used for purification—cedar, scarlet, hyssop—seem to connote life (and hence remove the death symbolism of <i>tzaraat</i>): they all bear the red color of blood, which itself was the great biblical indicator of life (cf. 17:11 below). Notable is the adjective “living,” applied to both the birds and the water utilized in the ceremony."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, Purification from Tzaraat 4","The purification ritual itself, interestingly, parallels the consecration of the priests in Chap. 8. This is particularly evident in the fourfold dabbing of blood on the right extremities of the diseased person (cf. 8:23, 24 for the corresponding action). In Chap. 8, movement took place from the everyday sphere into that of the holy; here, the person with <i>tzaraat</i> moves from isolation to eventual reintegration into society (i.e., the camp)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, Polluting Discharges 3","Such pollution was considered much more contagious than that we have encountered previously, which is not surprising, given the area in which it falls. Wenham has noted the chiastic structure here, with male and female interchanging with short-term and long-term events. The core (vv.16–24)—the normal flows of seminal emissions for men and menstrual discharge from women—contrasts with discharges resulting from disease (vv.2–12, 25–27). The former merely pollute until sunset (except for the case of a couple having intercourse during the wife’s period), and thus demonstrate the modesty and restraint in matters of divine worship more than pointing to some kind of stigma per se."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, The Day of Purgation/Atonement 2","This chapter forms the climax of the section that began in Chap. 11. It is, along with Num. 19, the purification ritual par excellence, and has received much attention throughout the ages. As modern commentators have pointed out, two things are happening here: first, the sanctuary is being purged of the ritual pollution that has accumulated from both priests and laypeople; and second, the accumulated sins of the community are receiving atonement. It is not surprising, therefore, that the chapter is built on different uses of the verb <i>kipper</i>, which can denote covering, purging, atonement (expiation), or ransom; here the two meanings “purging” and “atoning” seem to fit the double context best. Probably the “purging” part is the earlier one, as many ancient Near Eastern cults utilized purification ceremonies for their sanctuaries."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, The Day of Purgation/Atonement 3","Appropriately, the ritual includes two processes, outlined by Levine: riddance, which involves transferring sin to a living creature and driving it outside the community into the uninhabited wilderness, and purification, which utilizes the blood of a sacrifice (rather like the <i>hattat</i> encountered previously in the book). Both rituals are conducted largely by Aharon, who as High Priest acts on behalf of the entire community."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, The Day of Purgation/Atonement 4","Later Judaism was fascinated by these rites; a detailed account of how they were to be conducted in postbiblical times has survived in the Mishnah (ed. c. 200), and a narrative version is still verbally reenacted by traditional Jews once a year on the Day of Atonement."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, The Day of Purgation/Atonement 5","The chapter opens with direct mention of the deaths of Nadav and Avihu (Chap. 10). This serves at least two purposes: first, it creates a bracket into which the Leviticus texts on pollution occur; and second, it reminds the audience of the pressing need to purify the sanctuary, whose very first recorded defilement came about as a result of the illegitimate act of Aharon’s sons."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, On the Shedding of Animal Blood 2","This chapter appears to be either an appendix to the first two parts of the book (sacrifices and purity) or a transition between them and the chapters on “holiness.” It must be said, however, that it does not use the standard wording of the holiness chapters. The text deals with the Israelites’ slaughtering of animals for food outside the sanctuary (“Dwelling”), insisting instead that such killing take place “at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.” In contrast, Deut. 12:20ff. permits the slaughtering of animals for meat without bringing them to the sanctuary—provided that their blood is poured out (since the consumption of blood is universally prohibited in the Torah). Scholars disagree about which practice came first; some (e.g., Wenham) argue for a wilderness setting here, while others see the chapter as reflecting the antipagan feelings of postexilic Israel (Bamberger; cf. v.7). Whatever the provenance, our chapter is clear about the extraordinary power of blood in Israelite thinking. As the life, which belongs to God, it must be returned to him, either actually, at the altar, or symbolically, on the ground (Greenstein 1984a). Here it is seen as effecting ransom; the life of the sacrificial animal substitutes for that of the sacrificer (cf. “On Sacrifice,” above). The upshot is that the taking of animal life is done with extreme awareness and care."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part II; Ritual Pollution and Purification, On the Shedding of Animal Blood 3","The chapter is built at least partially on repeating sound patterns. A threefold refrain is “that man is to be cut off from his kinspeople,” stressing the seriousness of the prohibition. Four times we hear “any-man, any-man” (Heb. <i>ish ish</i>), reinforcing the unusually broad scope of the command indicated by the beginning of the chapter (“to Aharon and to his sons and to all the Children of Israel”). Finally, in v.10 through 15, the word <i>nefesh</i> occurs nine times, with the alternating meanings of “person” and “life” (the pattern is 1–3–1–3–1 in these meanings)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness 3","While the exact structure and setting of the Holiness Code, as these chapters were designated a century ago, are subject to scholarly debate, its thrust seems clear enough. Beginning with sexual relations, Israel is to be “holy,” “separate” from other nations.

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness 4","<i>Imitatio dei</i>, the human urge to be godlike, is an ancient, undoubtedly prehistoric one. We long to be linked with the primal powers of existence, whose rush we feel at heightened moments of <i>perception</i>, but whose perfection is always out of reach in the flesh and blood world of human beings. The Torah, in contrast, presents the longing for perfection and wholeness as properly expressed through a discipline of <i>behavior</i> in all areas of life, personal and communal. The central lines “Holy are you to be, / for holy am I, YHWH your God” (19:2) are followed by line after line calling for holiness in worship, agriculture, interpersonal relations, business, the treatment of the disabled and the elderly, court procedure, and sexuality, to list some of the areas covered."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness 5","Many communities of the “elect,” from Qumran at the Dead Sea to medieval monasteries, and many individuals, from biblical Nazirites (Num. 6) to Sufi mystics and St. Francis, have sought to create lives suffused with holiness; one could easily maintain that many of the mainstream forms and ideas in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have remained wedded to this approach. They all owe a debt, one way or the other, to Lev. 18–26, especially in the communal sphere. Rarely has the drive toward holiness found as full expression in a vision of “real life” society, grounded in the everyday world of people and institutions, as it does in the texts to be found in the following chapters."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness 6","For many decades, debate has raged within the scholarly community as to the date and setting of H, the putative stratum of literature to which these chapters belong. As of this writing there is still not full agreement on (a) whether H was indeed a separate document or school, and (b) whether its origin and influence can be easily traced (cf., for instance, Knohl, and Milgrom 1993). These disagreements, however, should not and must not detract from the importance of what we have in these chapters: a significant statement of the ethical code of ancient Israel which continues to speak to contemporary problems."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Pollution from Forbidden Unions 2","Now begin, thematically and stylistically, the chapters on holiness. Like much of this final section of the book, Chap. 18 is distinguished by its powerful use of rhetoric (cf. vv.3–5, similar in tone to much of Deuteronomy). Separation returns as a major theme, this time stressing the divide between Israel and the nations around (vv.3 and 27–30). The emphasis on sexuality mirrors that on food in Chap. 11; the two often reflect each other in culture, both in practice and in imagery Thus the wording here (“it is insidiousness,” “it is perversion”) parallels the rhetoric of Chap. 11 (“it is abomination,” “it is a detestable-thing”). Structurally, just as the laws on pollution began with categories of and distinctions between animals for the purpose of eating, so the holiness laws begin with categories of and distinctions between partners for the purposes of sexual relations (Eilberg-Schwartz, Goodman). The confusing of boundaries again becomes a grave matter."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Pollution from Forbidden Unions 3","In Schwartz’s (1987) view, the list of forbidden women goes through a sequence from close relatives, to indirect ones, to women related to each other, and finally to other cases of “abomination.” In general, the list deals with women whose sexuality and reproductivity are controlled by males (Wegner 1992)—in other words, it reflects a highly patriarchal society."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Pollution from Forbidden Unions 4","An odd omission of sexual prohibitions is the one between a man and his daughter; perhaps it was universally understood as the primary one, and hence did not require mentioning."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Pollution from Forbidden Unions 5","Refrains in the chapter, which create its backbone, include “I am Y<small>HWH</small> your God” and the constant “the nakedness of X you are not to expose.” Late in the chapter, the words “abomination” and “<i>tum’a</i>” frequently recur."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, General Regulations on Holiness I 1",Leviticus 19:1-37
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, General Regulations on Holiness I 2","As the key chapter of this part of Leviticus, Chap. 19 is wide-ranging and rhetorically powerful. It extends holiness to virtually all areas of life—family, calendar, cult, business, civil and criminal law, social relations, and sexuality. Most (but not all) of the laws deal with what we would term ethics, that is, relations between people (Wenham notes the alternation of the terms “fellow [citizen],” “kinsman,” and “neighbor”). As such, they have become an exemplar and a cornerstone, at least in idealized form, in Western thinking about these issues."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, General Regulations on Holiness I 3","Structurally speaking, the chapter is not systematic. As Schwartz (1987)has noted, this is probably intentional, reflecting the desire to avoid categorization or compartmentalization of life before God. He lays out the structure of the core part of the chapter, vv.3–32, as discrete subsections, each ending with “I am Y<small>HWH</small> [your God],” with vv.33–36 as two appendices, and a summary in v.37."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, General Regulations on Holiness I 4","The opening (v.2) is crucial, even though the word-root “holy” does not recur in the chapter (it does, however, reverberate within the next four chapters). The style is predominantly apodictic—“You are not to …,” as was Chap. 18, and concentrates mostly on the negating of certain kinds of behavior. At the same time, the chapter makes a moving positive plea for proper treatment of the elderly, the poor, and, in general, one’s “neighbor” (which is extended to the foreigner [“sojourner”] in vv.33–34)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, General Regulations on Holiness II 1",Leviticus 20:1-27
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, General Regulations on Holiness II 2","We move now into laws dealing with some of the more serious offenses against God in the biblical view: idolatry (including worship of the “Molekh” and consulting spirits), insulting parents, adultery, and sexual crimes. These are distinguished from the previous chapter by the inclusion of punishments; their seriousness is indicated by their capital nature. The reiteration of sexual laws forms a bracket with Chap. 18, thus highlighting the central position and rhetoric of 19. Another bracket, this time within the chapter, involves the chiasm of necromancy and the exhortation to be holy (vv.6–7 and 26–27). Finally, while the motifs of the Israelites avoiding pagan practices, and the land “vomiting out” its wrongdoers, return from Chap. 18, there is a further throwback (vv.24–26): to Chap. 11, where “separation” from the nations was a major issue in terms of diet."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Regulations Concerning Holiness; Priests I 1",Leviticus 21:1-24
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Regulations Concerning Holiness; Priests I 2","This chapter, and the one that follows, relate holiness to the suitability of priests to serve in the sanctuary. The laws are in the main negative ones, that is, they outline ways in which a priest may be disqualified. The first part of the chapter concentrates on how contact with death disqualifies a priest; in Levine’s view, this avoidance of the dead reflects the Bible’s abhorrence of pagan cults centered around death. The laws concerning soundness of body and sexuality confirm earlier passages on holiness as wholeness."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Regulations Concerning Holiness; Priests I 3",The central word-root is again “holy”; six times in Chaps. 21–22 we hear the refrain “I am Y<small>HWH</small> the one-who-hallows you/them.”
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Regulations Concerning Holiness; Priests II 1",Leviticus 22:1-33
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Regulations Concerning Holiness; Priests II 2","The priestly rules on holiness continue, with special attention given to the priest’s proper state when he eats of the “holy donations.” The second part of the chapter, from v.17 on, turns to the state of the sacrificial animals. They are to be without blemish, just as the priests must be (cf. Chap. 21). This correspondence between human and animal has been noted before; it is part of Leviticus’s general scheme of a perfect God requiring perfection in worship."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Holy Days 1",Leviticus 23:1-44
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Holy Days 2","Having dealt with holiness in such areas as worship, family life, ethics, priestly qualifications and behavior, and sacrificial animals and objects, the text now turns to holiness in time: the sacred calendar. While all ancient societies marked sacred time, in Judaism as it evolved out of the Bible the calendar took on particular significance, especially in the situation of exile. The centrality of time in Judaism has been articulately portrayed by Heschel; here we will limit discussion to the fullest of the biblical sacred calendars (others occur in Ex. 23 and 34, and Deut. 16), the one set forth in the present chapter."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Holy Days 3","The scheme is characteristically Levitical—it focuses on order and perfection, expressing these qualities by the use of the number 7, which was used thus in a number of ancient Near Eastern cultures. A partial list in this regard would include: 7 days from sabbath to sabbath; 7 days of two major festivals, spring and fall; 7 weeks between the two pilgrimage festivals in the spring; and all the holy days falling within the first 7 months of the year, with a major cluster occurring in the seventh month. To this could be added material from other passages in the Torah: 7 years to every sabbatical year (Ex. 23:10–11, Lev. 25:2–7, Deut. 15:1–3); and 7-times-7 years (plus one) till each Jubilee year (Lev. 25:8–17). One could go further (cf. the discussion and lists in Jenson), but the thrust should be clear: time, as well as space and behavior, is to be ordered in a way that again reflects divine perfection. One might also mention the continuation of this kind of thinking in both later Judaism and Christianity, which looked upon history itself in a schematic way."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Holy Days 4","As laid out in Leviticus, the sacred days of the seventh month follow a conventional ancient pattern described by Gaster (1961): the dying of the old year (“mortification” and “purgation,” as expressed in Rosh Ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur), followed by the birth of the new year (“invigoration” and “jubilation,” as expressed in Sukkot). The biblical calendar, then, evolved along dual tracks—lunar-solar (lunar months of 29 or 30 days, with an extra month added in late winter, 7 times every 19 years); and spring/fall new year (Passover falls in the “first month,” but the full new year pattern, as we have mentioned, is played out in the fall)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Holy Days 5","A final indication of a late provenance for Chap. 23’s calendar lies in the long treatment (vv.9–22, a third of the chapter) of Shavuot, the “Feast of Weeks.” The emphasis seems to be on land here, suggesting a resettlement motif that would be particularly appropriate after the exile in Babylonia."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Holy Days 6","Theme words in the chapter include: “appointed-times,” “proclamation of holiness,” “throughout all your settlements,” “a fire-offering to YHWH,” and “anykind of servile work you are not to do.” V39–43, on the practice of and rationale behind Sukkot, seem to be another addition to the text, as they disrupt its natural flow."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Miscellany 1",Leviticus 24:1-23
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Miscellany 2","Two issues, unrelated to what has gone before, are treated here: certain ritual objects in the Dwelling (oil/lamps and “showbread”), and the story of a man who insulted God and therefore had to be executed (along with further rules about capital crimes). The function of this chapter is not clear; perhaps it serves as a breather between the important sections on sacred days (23) and land tenure (25). It is also possible (as Levine notes) that chapters such as this one and Num. 15 serve as a repository for various cultic laws that needed a location. There are two other places in the Torah where a brief passage on the lights in the sanctuary may originally have served to separate sections: the end of Ex. 27 and the beginning of Num. 8. If so, that function no longer is as major as it once might have been."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Miscellany 3","The first two parts (2–4 and 5–9) are linked by their common vocabulary: “take,” “arrange,” “regularly,” and “before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>” (Wenham). The second section (vv. 10–23) is united by its chiastic structure (cf. Wenham here as well). It has points of contact with material in the Exodus laws, but here with the characteristic addition (v.22) of “I, Y<small>HWH</small>, am your God.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Regulations Concerning Land and Slavery 1",Leviticus 25:1-55
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Regulations Concerning Land and Slavery 2","A final area of holiness that Leviticus discusses is that of ownership. The rules set forth in this chapter are based on the assumption that land, a most precious commodity in the ancient (and modern) Near East, and human beings, equally precious in the Bible, are not in fact the property of other human beings. The phrases “the land is not to be sold inharness, / for the land is mine” (v.23) and “For my servants are they … they are not to be sold as the sale of serfs” (v.42) express the main corollary: God is the sole owner of land and people. The chapter, then, sets out regulations that make perpetual human ownership of these impossible. In the case of land, not only is the soil to rest every seven years, but every fifty years (7 × 7 + 1), the land is to be “released” back to its original owner (who “redeems” it). Similarly, indentured servants—those who are forced into working for someone because of debts—are redeemable, if not by kin then by the occurrence of the Jubilee year."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Regulations Concerning Land and Slavery 3","Several things about the chapter suggest a late date to Levine. Redemption focuses on the individual rather than on the clan; “at Mount Sinai” might indicate an editorial hand; and the passages here, unlike their counterparts in Ex. 21 and Deut. 15, concentrate less on eradicating poverty than on ensuring that property stays in the family over generations. Indeed, some of the conditions presupposed by the chapter suggest the situation portrayed in Neh. 5, after the Babylonian Exile."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Conclusion; Blessings and Curses 1",Leviticus 26:3-45
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Conclusion; Blessings and Curses 2","The initial ending of Leviticus (Chap. 27 was added later) follows a pattern common to treaties in the ancient Near East: it provides blessings for remaining loyal to God (the suzerain) and curses for spurning him. A similar pattern, with greater rhetoric and emotional force, occurs in Deut. 28–30, with briefer examples in Ex. 23:25ff. and Josh. 24:20. The blessings center around peace and its attendant benefit, agricultural abundance; the curses detail, in increasing force, the calamities brought on by war: famine, defeat, and ultimately exile. That the curses take up much more room than the blessings is not surprising, given the didactic nature of the chapter; this is also characteristic of ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaty literature, where the major emphasis is placed on what will happen if the pact is violated. Later Jewish tradition dealt with the devastating tone and content of the curses by prescribing that, when read publicly as part of the weekly Torah cycle, they be chanted in an undertone."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Conclusion; Blessings and Curses 3","The structure of the chapter gives strong indication that there has been considerable editorial work here, and that may explain some of the difficulties in the later parts of the chapter. The confusion may well reflect the passage of time during and after the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587 <small>B.C.E.</small>, and thus an evolving response to the catastrophe. The pattern (suggested by H. L. Ginsberg, who is quoted by Levine) moves from doom to hope, and then to an explanation of why restoration has been delayed. In any event, it should be noted (as Levine does) that the curses are not all doom; they do, at various points, leave the door open for Israel’s “turning,” a point much emphasized by the Prophets."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, Part III; Holiness, Conclusion; Blessings and Curses 4","Lev. 26 is the first great monotheistic response to catastrophe, built on the idea that human beings have the capacity to influence their own fate by obeying or disobeying God. In Judaism, which was to experience numerous such catastrophes over the course of its history, literary response became an important mode of coping. Christianity took its own characteristic path in answering some of the same issues on a personal level."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, An Appended Chapter, Appendix; Support for the Sanctuary 1",Leviticus 27
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Leviticus, An Appended Chapter, Appendix; Support for the Sanctuary 2","Clearly a later addition to Leviticus, Chap. 27 provides for the upkeep of the sanctuary through a variety of means: donations of silver; pledging animals or property which is later redeemed for silver; confiscated property; and tithes. The nature of the text as appendix is obvious, given the finality of tone in the previous chapter, but it could also be said that 27 provides an appropriate ending to Leviticus, since it talks about dedication of property to God, as the book does in regard to all areas of life."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 1",Numbers 1-36
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 2","T<small>HE READER WHO APPROACHES THE BOOK OF</small> N<small>UMBERS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ITS</small> common Hebrew name, <i>Bemidbar</i>, “In the Wilderness,” will logically expect a narrative account of the wanderings of the Israelites before they reach the Promised Land. But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 3","It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 4","The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 5","Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:"

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 46","In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 47","With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 48","The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 49","Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 50","As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 51","The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure 52","It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp 1",Numbers 1–10
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp 2","T<small>O LIST IS TO DEMONSTRATE A SENSE OF ORDER AND CONTROL</small>. T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> Numbers commences with several lists that serve to arrange and catalog the Israelite camp in the wilderness: first, the “accountings” of the Israelites fit for battle; then, the symmetrical arrangement of the camp itself, around the Tabernacle; and finally, the special listing of the Levite population, accompanied by an enumeration of its special tasks in the camp. The first part of Numbers thus takes place as it were in the shadow of Mount Sinai—that is, under the aegis of the priestly school of thinking, in which order is everything."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp 3","There is a strong military bent to the arrangement. The census of Chapter 1 is not a head count of the entire Israelite population, but rather of those “twenty years of age and upward,” those eligible to serve in the army. The setup of the camp resembles that in ancient Egypt, with the sanctuary and ark (here “Dwelling” and “coffer”) in the center (in the Egypt of Raamses II—thought by some to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus—it was the king’s throne). The Levites, whom we have not encountered previously as a group with tasks distinct from those of the priests, emerge in this part of the book as caretakers and perhaps guardians of the sanctuary, in addition to their tasks of dismantling and transport of the “Holy-Shrine.” This military aspect reflects an ancient concept of Israel as the “forces of Y<small>HWH</small>,” surely a conquest image, which later becomes standardized in language in the phrase usually rendered “the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp 4","Some of the material in this section might well have been put elsewhere. Chapters 5–7 would have fit nicely in Leviticus; Chapter 7, the listing of the tribal gifts brought to the sanctuary upon its dedication, could even have followed Ex. 40, where Moshe completes the erection of the structure. That these chapters are here therefore must be the result of a conscious decision, either to include material that did not find its way into the other books, or out of a feeling that they were appropriately placed in the book about Israel’s wanderings in the wilderness."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Mustering of Israel 1",Numbers 1:1-54
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Mustering of Israel 2","For the opening of the book about the Israelites’ wanderings in the wilderness, the editor has chosen a logical point of departure: a tally of males prepared for war, listed by tribe. It is in fact a double list—first, the names of the tribal representatives who are to assist Moshe, and second, the count itself. The chapter is the epitome of orderliness, proceeding from the date of the census to who is to be counted, on to the counters and the census itself, and finally a treatment of the special case of the Levites (who, as noncombatants, are not mustered). It utilizes a number of repeating phrases, especially in the central census section. In this sense, the opening chapters of the book are a fitting companion to Leviticus—which likewise opens with God speaking from the Tent of Appointment, still in the Wilderness of Sinai."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Mustering of Israel 3","The large numbers that appear here have been a major source of debate in modern as well as earlier interpretation. After all, extrapolating from 600,000 adult males (excluding the elderly), one certainly winds up with a population in the millions—a theoretically possible but extremely unlikely scenario. Some alternatives are: (a) to understand Hebrew <i>elef</i> as not “thousand,” but rather as “unit” or “division,” which would especially make sense in a military setting; and (b) to regard the numbers as simply exaggerated. One might also, following Olson, see the statistics here as an attempt to impress the audience with the size of Israel, and/or to demonstrate how God has blessed them (as in the promises to Avraham in Genesis and the account in Ex. 1). There may, finally, be a “numbers game” occurring here, that is, some kind of symbolism of figures that eludes us (cf. Sarna 1986)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Layout of the Camp 2","Chap. 2 lays out a schematic diagram of the Israelite camp prepared for the desert march. The “Dwelling” naturally stands at the center, with four groups of three tribes each surrounding the structure on the outside, and three groupings of Levite clans guarding the inside of the rectangular sanctuary. Geographical pride of place, the eastern side, goes to the tribe of Yehuda (Judah) and two other tribes tracing their ancestry to sons of Lea (outside track), while Moshe and Aharon and their sons occupy the inside track."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Levites I 1",Numbers 3:1-51
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Levites I 2","Already introduced in 1:47–53, the issue of the Levites’ status and their tasks is an important subtheme in Numbers, and makes its central appearance in Chaps. 3 and 4. The present chapter opens with the genealogy of Moshe and Aharon (similarly, Chap. 6 of Exodus, which is a prologue to the Plague cycle, contains a genealogy of the two leaders)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Levites I 3","Notable is the concept that the Levites symbolically replace all the firstborn sons among the Israelites. In a more manageable way, then, the entire community participates in the sacred task of ministering in the sanctuary."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Levites I 4","Theme words in the chapter, not surprisingly, are “charge,” “count/accountable,” and “serve/serving-tasks.” Milgrom has also noted the sevenfold “by order of Y<small>HWH</small>” that permeates this chapter and the next."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Levites II 2","Here the tasks of the Levites are presented in great detail and listed according to clan. The jobs involve the guarding, dismantling, and transport of the “sancta” (holy objects). We are subsequently given a census of the Levites from ages 30 to 50, which fits here better than in Chap. 1. This age of service implies, perhaps, the physical strain associated with Levite tasks."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Priestly Matters; The Wife Under Suspicion 1",Numbers 5:1-31
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Priestly Matters; The Wife Under Suspicion 2","Chaps. 5 and 6 are texts that seem most appropriate in a priestly setting. In both cases, the priest plays a central role in the ceremony described, administering the test and oath to the suspected adulteress and purifying the Nazirite (Milgrom)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Priestly Matters; The Wife Under Suspicion 3","Here, as in several other cases in the book of Numbers, texts that one might have expected to find in Leviticus seem to have been deferred. The reasons are not difficult to fathom. Leviticus as it has been edited deals with three broad areas: the sacrificial cult, ritual pollution and purification, and holiness in communal and priestly behavior. Chaps. 5 and 6 of Numbers do not easily fit into these categories, although some connections can be found. These chapters are also long, detailed cases, and it is possible that they might have deflected the central thrust of Leviticus."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Priestly Matters; The Wife Under Suspicion 4","Having said this, Chap. 5 opens, appropriately, with concern for the purity of the sacred camp that has just been described in Chap. 2. It continues with an innovation (vv.5–10): some sins that were intentional can now apparently be expiated via confession and an <i>asham</i>-offering (cf. Lev. 5)—unlike the situation that obtains in Lev. 4–5, where it is only sins committed “in error” that are forgivable by means of the sacrificial system (with the addition of confession and restitution). This little section has been placed here perhaps because of its verbal link with the next, larger section—which addresses the issue of “breaking faith” (vv.6 and 12)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Priestly Matters; The Wife Under Suspicion 5","Beginning with v.11, we encounter a strange ceremony such as is found nowhere else in the Torah. Its odd aspects are not surprising, though, given the gravity of the accusation. Adultery in ancient Israel was a capital crime, while in the rest of the ancient Near East (Mesopotamia, for instance) it could sometimes be expiated through payment to the wronged husband. And significantly, it is the husband who is in total control here, and the mere “breath of suspicion” (a possible rendering of the text’s “rush of jealousy” in v.14) on his part results in a grave psychological ordeal for his wife. This is consistent with the male control over the sexuality of wives (and daughters) often observed in biblical texts (cf. Wegner 1988); there was of course no such procedure in regard to husbands. The last verse is telling; it presumes guilt on the part of the wife."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Priestly Matters; The Wife Under Suspicion 6","Frymer-Kensky (1984) sees the chapter as a manual for priests, and as a ritual that addresses “a crisis in the legal system”—for the crime is not provable by human agency (Milgrom points out that the word for “adultery” does not appear at all). She views the structure of the central parts of the ritual as revolving around pairs of verbs: the priest is to have the woman “stand before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>” (vv.16–18); “swear” (vv.19, 21); and “drink” (vv.24, 27). The combination of drink, oath-taking, and declaration of innocence is found elsewhere in the ancient Near East (Fishbane 1974)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Priestly Matters; The Wife Under Suspicion 7","Fishbane (1980) notes how the chapter ends with two summaries (vv.29 and 30) relating back to the descriptions in vv.12–14. The phrase found at the end of the chapter, “This is the Instruction,” often concludes ritual sections in the Torah (cf. Lev. 11–15), and indeed is found in 6:21 below; it may indicate the former existence of these laws in separate scrolls."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Nazirite 1",Numbers 6:1-21
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Nazirite 2","A “consecrated” or “separate” person, traditionally transcribed as “Nazirite” after the Hebrew <i>nazir</i>, was one who took upon himself or herself a special vow, exceeding the normal demands of the religious life. The urge to such behavior appears throughout the ages in many religious traditions, and doubtless reflects a deep-seated human desire. The motivation may stem from a joyous or tragic event, or simply from the need to serve God in what is felt to be a fuller way."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Nazirite 3","Three prohibitions characterize the Nazirite: no drinking anything made from grapes (note the Bible’s early sense that cultivation of the vine is problematic—the story of Noah’s drunkenness in Gen. 9:20ff.); no shaving the hair (hair was understood by the ancients as possessing almost magical characteristics); and no contact with the dead (including relatives; death was considered the major poilutant in Israelite thinking). Given that the Nazirite’s vow has a finite period, Milgrom theorizes that our chapter represents a priestly attempt to control ascetic urges."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Nazirite 4","The ritual (vv.12ff.) that ends the Nazirite’s “state of consecration” involves a variety of sacrifices, most notably a <i>hattat</i>-offering (cf. Lev. 4). This purification offering suggested to later interpreters that the Nazirite vow was to be viewed in at least a somewhat negative light. Certainly by Rabbinic times, formative Judaism came to look askance at undue asceticism; on the other hand, religious vows and abstentions were to survive and even flourish in medieval and later Judaism, Christianity, and Islam."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Nazirite 5","In light of the fact that a Nazirite could be either a man or a woman, the translation of this chapter uses “one” regularly instead of the text’s “he”—which in any event indicates both genders in this chapter."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Priestly Blessing 1",Numbers 6:22-27
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Priestly Blessing 2","with which the chapter ends is striking and sufficiently beloved by Jews to have survived to this day in the synagogue liturgy. But why is it here? Perhaps the blessing of the people is yet another example of a priestly function that has not been preserved in Leviticus, since it relates neither to sacrifice nor to purification (although it should be pointed out that Moshe and Aharon give an unquoted blessing to the people in Lev. 9:23)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Priestly Blessing 3","The blessing itself makes wonderful use of ancient Hebrew rhythm, with a threefold structure of progressively longer lines that is reminiscent of a magical formula. The varied verbs give comfort and reassurance, as does the last word of the blessing: <i>shalom</i> (“well-being”). The benevolent “lifting” of God’s face is a known image in the ancient Near East (cf. the references in Fishbane 1988). Its devastating opposite, the “hiding” of his face, is found in the Psalms, and also in Deut. 31."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Priestly Blessing 4","That this section was popular already in biblical times is indicated by its occurrence in a two-part version in Ps. 67:2, as well as its appearance, in various forms, on ancient Israelite amulets."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Gifts to the Sanctuary 2",Chaps. 7–9 constitute a threefold conclusion to the Tabernacle texts that began in Ex. 25. The contribution of each chapter will be explained in sequence.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Gifts to the Sanctuary 3","The longest chapter in the Torah in number of verses, and another one of the many lists in the book, Chap. 7 parallels what Levine calls “temple accounts” in the ancient Near East. These are inventory lists that were frequently written in columns. At the same time, it is a ritual text that focuses on description and not prescription, which is more usual. The chapter ends in v.89 with the first of our Tabernacle endings: a description of precisely where God would communicate with Moshe within the “Holiest Holy-Shrine.” The implication is that with the dedication of the structure, its purpose can now be fulfilled."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Gifts to the Sanctuary 4","The length of the chapter reinforces the importance and grandeur of the ceremony, and makes of the “Dwelling” an institution in which all participate, not only priests and Levites (Levine)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Purifying the Levites 1",Numbers 8:1-26
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Purifying the Levites 2","A parallel to Lev. 8–9, where the dedication of the priests is the last act before the cult goes into operation, this chapter concludes the Levitical portions of Part I of Numbers—a distinctive contribution, as we have noted. Many scholars see the Levitical sections as reflections of later power struggles within the Israelite priesthood. In Levine’s view, this evolution (perhaps from family-based guilds into a full-fledged tribe) is an indication of a relatively late provenance for our text here."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Purifying the Levites 3","Milgrom rightly makes the distinction between the “purification” of the Levites and the higher-level “hallowing” (i.e., sanctification) of the priests. It is also interesting to note the cultic rites used here: the offering of a <i>hattat</i> (the standard purificatory sacrifice), and mention of the Levites themselves being considered an “elevation-offering” (v.11)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Second Passover; Cloud and Dwelling 1",Numbers 9:1-23
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Second Passover; Cloud and Dwelling 2","It has been noted by Milgrom that, a number of times in the Bible, ceremonies dedicating a House of God are followed by the observance of one of the three pilgrimage festivals: Passover, Shavuot (Weeks), and Sukkot (Huts). Under Solomon, Hezekiah, Josiah, and Ezra/Nehemiah, respectively, we find a major celebration of Sukkot, Passover, Passover, and Sukkot. This linking of sacred space with sacred time is only natural. The account here echoes the first Passover as well, which similarly inaugurated a wilderness march (Milgrom). In contrast to the Exodus account, however, something new has been added with the inauguration of the Tabernacle/Dwelling. In Exodus (12:43–49), the major laws concerning Passover had to do with excluding non-Israelites and not breaking the bones of the sacrificial lamb; here, the bone motif returns, but the existence of the sanctuary raises the issue of ritual pollution."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, The Second Passover; Cloud and Dwelling 3","The second part of the chapter (vv. 15–23) parallels the ending of the book of Exodus (40:36–38), where, once the Tabernacle has been dedicated, the “Cloud” takes up residence there, to guide Israel “on all their marches.” Our passage here is longer and rather redundant, perhaps in order to set the chronological framework of the narrative straight."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Setting Out 2","Once trumpets for signaling the march have been made, the Israelites at last begin their trek from Sinai to Canaan—nineteen days after the opening events and commandments of the book. True to the orderly character of Part I, which here draws to a close, the exact progression of the march is laid out, tribe by tribe and Levite subgroup by subgroup."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Setting Out 3","A few other brief traditions have been included here: first, a renewed mention of Moshe’s father-in-law (cf. Ex. 18), who is exhorted to accompany the Israelites to Canaan. This text most likely continues the tradition recorded in the Bible of friendship between Israelites and Kenites, Hovav’s group."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part I; The Wilderness Camp, Setting Out 4","The departure sequence ends, as sections in the Bible sometimes do, with a poem—in this case, the battle cry (similar to the one in Ps. 68:2) associated with the coffer (vv.35–36). These verses, now completely stripped of their military connotations, are universally used by Jews when Torah scrolls are taken out and put back in the synagogue ark on Sabbaths and holidays."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives 2","V<small>IRTUALLY THE FIRST THING THE</small> I<small>SRAELITES DO AFTER SETTING OUT ON THE SECOND</small> leg of their journey to the Promised Land is—rebel. This pattern was already seen in the book of Exodus, where, despite the climactic miracle of deliverance at the Sea of Reeds, the Israelites “grumbled against Moshe” at Mara because of lack of drinkable water. Although a strain in later biblical thinking remembered the wilderness period as a kind of honeymoon (cf. Jer. 2:2), the Torah itself chose to remember it as a severe time of testing which the ex-slaves ultimately failed to pass."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives 3","The second part of Numbers is a remarkable collection of rebellion narratives that simultaneously display striking similarities and great and colorful differences. The section details six rebellions of the people, and two of the leaders themselves. They are united by a consistent vocabulary: verbs such as “grumble” and “assemble/gather/speak against” depict complaints against Moshe and Aharon and against God. These stories also display the recurring themes of dearth of food and water, and God’s anger at the rebellions, usually expressed in some form of plague (or, additionally, fire)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives 4","Rather than unfold in simple chronological order, one following another, these pieces of the text have been intensified by priestly editing, which has interspersed the stories with a number of cultic and legal passages (Chaps. 15, 18, and 19, all of which bear the theme word “law” [Heb. <i>hok</i> or <i>hukka</i>]), and which are somehow related to previous or succeeding narratives. The interruptions also allow each of the memorable rebellion narratives to “breathe,” giving the audience time to digest the images and the drama presented therein. The stories possess both in abundant measure; one thinks, for instance, of the “meat between the teeth” (11:33), of the grape clusters borne on a pole by two men (13:23); and of the great confrontation with Korah in Chapter 16 (not to mention its resolution), as well as Moshe’s dramatic failure in Chapter 20."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives 5","As in any great literature, repetition of story type or type scene is here accomplished via variation of the most telling kind. In this case we observe once again an alternating pattern to the rebellions, a pattern which reveals not one theme but several:"

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives 13","The pattern observable here is broken, in true biblical rhetorical style (where the last in a sequence often serves by its oddness to reinforce the whole), in a final rebellion (Chap. 25), where the people’s actions involve neither the “complaining” vocabulary nor a revolt against human leadership, but rather comprise the greatest biblical crime of them all: worship of other gods. Viewed in this patterned fashion, the rebellion narratives emerge with a kind of crescendo effect."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives 14","It is also possible, as I have done in “On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure,” above, to follow the scheme put forth by Mann—a three-part structure to the section, each with its internal logic and conclusions. These are treated below; for the moment, it will suffice to see in the first subsection (Chaps. 11–14) the inevitable result of wilderness rebellions: the divine decree that the slave generation must die out before entering the Promised Land; the second subsection (16–20) deals with the challenges to the leadership of Moshe and Aharon, and results in a similar decree, that they will die outside the land; and the third subsection (20–25) chronicles the encounter of the Israelites with neighboring nations, which initially goes in their favor but ends with the disastrous incident at Baal Pe’or (25)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives 15","The primary issue in these stories, to the biblical writer, is lack of trust in God. Each of the three sections mentions or implies that problem; 14:11 and 20:12 use the verb itself, and the narrative of Chapter 25 suggests it. The bottom line is that the Israelites could not keep faith with God—even after both staggering acts of divine intervention (i.e., rescue) and demonstrations of the force of divine wrath—and this lack of faith led ultimately to their dying out in the wilderness outside the Promised Land, in punishment. The stories clearly were meant to be understood as an unfortunate example for later generations, and were taken as such already in the biblical period (see, for example, the treatment in Psalm 78)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives 16","Read on another level, the rebellion narratives are largely concerned with the issue of human leadership, its qualifications, manifestations, and limitations (and even failures). Has there ever been a leader as beleaguered as Moshe? From the beginning of his career on the sands of Egypt, where he assumes the mantle of leadership in the matter of retaliating against the sadistic Egyptian taskmaster (Ex. 2:11–12), to its end at the plains of Moab, in stern address to the people he has struggled to lead (this is the setting of the entire next book, Deuteronomy), he must evoke trust in God, lead the people through an uncharted wilderness, and inspire confidence in his own leadership. His success is muted by the passing of the generation he initially leads, before it can enter Canaan; like them, he too must pass on—with merely a look beyond the Jordan, but no more. Later generations of Jewish readers wept on confronting Moshe’s seemingly premature death, and created heroic tales of his pleading before God to be let into the land he had so long sought to reach. In Numbers he fully deserves this stature, alternately interceding with and cajoling God, standing up for and then almost giving up on this people with whom his life has become so enmeshed. Our stories stress his gifts of prophecy and his pathos as a deeply human leader."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives 17","A final, troubling issue is the character of God in this part of the book. It is a measure of the Bible’s artistry that the rebellion accounts are so varied in content and style; but the variations in punishment—from undetailed death to skin disease to stoning and the earth opening up, just to mention a few examples—create an impression, not of artistic richness but of unremitting severity. The Bible does not seem to have a problem with this kind of divine behavior, and other ancient cultures would have felt at home here, but already in late antiquity, and continuing down to our own day, Jews and Christians most often have preferred, and prayed to, a more forgiving, nurturing, and compassionate God. Dealing with these texts, in the end, raises the question of whether to understand them as the result of “historical necessity” or “literary conceit” (that is, the old generation simply had to die out) or as they stand in the text: a harsh portrayal of what happened when the covenant people violated the covenant."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, First Rebellion 1",Numbers 11:1-35
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, First Rebellion 2","The mood of the book, which up until now has been orderly and celebratory, abruptly shifts. We move from a God who commands, leaders who lead, and a people that obeys, to a bitter triangle of constant complaining, questioning of leadership, and divine punishment."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, First Rebellion 3","The chapter that introduces the rebellion narratives is long and complex. Although it resembles Ex. 16 (the manna chapter) in some general respects, it has its own distinct vocabulary and concerns. It is stylistically held together by the repeating roots “eat,” “gather,” and “weep”; the “grumbling” of the Exodus story does not yet appear. The chapter combines the people’s complaints about the manna (and a concomitant craving for meat) with Moshe’s complaints about how difficult it is to lead this people; both receive answer from God, the people in the form of quails and Moshe through the dissemination of prophetic gifts to others in the camp."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, First Rebellion 4","It is in this chapter that Moshe—the dramatic and at times tragic Moshe of the Golden Calf story in Exodus—reappears as a character with deep emotions. Although his fate as a leader destined never to enter the Promised Land is not sealed until Chap. 20, one has the sense already here that the strain of his mission is beginning to tell. The vividness of the portrayal of Moshe is matched by that of the Children of Israel, whose words, usually complaints, include the picturesque description of Egyptian cuisine in v.5."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Sibling Rebellion 1",Numbers 12:1-16
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Sibling Rebellion 2","A challenge to Moshe’s leadership, which we had encountered both in Exodus and in the previous chapter, now comes from an unexpected source—Aharon and Miryam. Their complaint begins with some kind of objection to Moshe’s wife, but its core is quickly revealed in v.2: Does not God speak through them as well as through their stuttering brother? Milgrom speculates that it is the spreading of prophetic gifts in the previous chapter that gives them the idea. God’s response is to clarify Moshe’s uniqueness, and to punish Miryam—yet Aharon gets off easily here, possibly owing to a later editor who was highly sympathetic to the priesthood descended from Aharon, or because the latter, as High Priest, could not be tainted by <i>tzaraat</i> without damaging his priesthood, as Lev. 22:4ff. suggests (Sakenfeld)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Sibling Rebellion 3","Chap. 12 is linked to the previous chapter by use of the words “eat” and “gather.” As its own unit, it is built on the ironic use of Heb. <i>dabber be</i>-, which can mean either “speak through” or “speak against.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, The Spies in Canaan and Back 1",Numbers 13:1-33
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, The Spies in Canaan and Back 2","Here, as at the beginning of the book, we begin with a list—this time, of the men Moshe sends out to reconnoiter the land of Canaan. Order may also be perceived in the phraseology of Moshe’s questions to them (vv.18–20), and the mission goes well (witness the giant grape cluster in v.23). But everything falls apart in the middle of the report (vv.28ff.), and the ending of the chapter, in which the spies compare themselves (and, by extension, all the Israelites) to grasshoppers vis-a-vis the Canaanite natives of the land, is telling. It is a classic case of failure of nerve."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, The Spies in Canaan and Back 3","Scholars have detected a number of creative hands in this and the next chapter, based on the text’s alternating use of Calev and Calev/Yehoshua as the faithful spies, as well as other factors. The final result is a tug of war between sets of spies, the people, Moshe, and God. True to the new human tone of the narrative, so mundane a form as a reconnaissance mission has been here suffused with emotion, a trend that will continue throughout this part of the book."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Rebellion and Evil Decree 1",Numbers 14:1-45
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Rebellion and Evil Decree 2","Another long and dramatic account, this chapter contains echoes of previous narratives. The “grumbling” of Ex. 16 finally returns, and God and Moshe talk to one another in a manner that recalls the Golden Calf incident of Ex. 32–34. God wishes to destroy the people and start all over again with Moshe; the prophet, for his part, reminds God of his essentially merciful nature, and basically blackmails him by pointing out what will happen to his reputation among the nations should he destroy the Israelites. Unlike the resolution in Exodus, this time the people—at least the older generation—are doomed to die out. After two years of both miraculous rescues and despair, it has become clear that the former slaves will not be able to accomplish the work of conquest—even with divine help. That is to be left to their children, whom Moshe will address in Deuteronomy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Rebellion and Evil Decree 3","V.26 begins a section that seems to double the earlier part of the chapter. Perhaps it stems from a separate tradition concerning the incident. It leads to the people’s disastrous attempt to force the issue by invading Canaan without the Coffer and Moshe (hence, without God). Thus the spy story of 13–14, which began in orderly fashion, ends in disarray, with a crushing defeat."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Interlude 1",Numbers 15:1-41
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Interlude 2","Chap. 15, which gives respite from the striking rebellion narratives of 11–14, and a breather before the Korah story in 16–17 (although Wenham notes verbal ties to 13–14, and Buber 1988 to 16–18), brings together five rather disparate pieces of material that seem wrenched out of other contexts. We can, however, make some sense of them. Vv.1–16 (on various sacrifices) and 17–21 (about a “contribution” for God) are commanded for the time “when you enter the land of your settling / that I am giving you” or “when you enter the land / that I am bringing you to,” connecting them to the potential entry into Canaan of the two previous chapters and thus providing a setting that is missing in most of Leviticus. Further, vv.1–16 and 22–31, which, like Lev. 4, deal with the unintentional sins of the Israelites, both make pointed reference to the “sojourner,” the resident alien who is to be treated in respect of the laws involved here exactly like a native. The final section, on the tassels (Heb. <i>tzitzit</i>), is interestingly connected to the spy narrative via the term “scout around” in v.39 (Milgrom); “scout” had occurred seven times in the earlier story. “Bear in mind” also recalls the many instances of “reminders” in the Torah—objects such as a portion of manna—that serve as a visual warning or memorial for the Israelites of later generations. This is especially important after the Israelites’ losing heart in Chaps. 13–14. Stylistically, the four sections just mentioned are drawn together by the use of the phrase “throughout your generations” (vv.15, 21, 23, 38)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Interlude 3","This leaves the incident of the Sabbath violator in vv.32–36. It has clearly been placed in Numbers because it takes place “in the wilderness” (v.32); it has found its way into this specific chapter perhaps because it is, in its own way, a miniature rebellion story. Since it is so brief, it may well have been felt that it needed to be placed in a chapter already composed of short pieces. Stylistically it might have better appeared at the end of the chapter, but that position has been reserved for the rhetorically more dramatic section on the tassels."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, The Great Revolt 1",Numbers 16:1-35
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, The Great Revolt 2","In the two collections of wilderness rebellion traditions we have encountered thus far in the Torah, Ex. 15:22–17:7 and Num. 11–14, the rebels are a faceless “the people” or “the entire community.” An exception was Num. 12, where Aharon and Miryam complained against their brother; their personal example is now taken up by another relative, in a memorable narrative. The story of the revolt of Korah the Levite and Datan and Aviram the Reubenites, which may have stemmed from two different accounts, holds the common thread of the rebels’ feeling left out—Korah, as Moshe’s and Aharon’s first cousin, might well have headed the priestly line (his father was older than theirs), whereas Datan and Aviram’s tribe of Re’uven had lost some of its firstborn primacy, and was not even camped on the choice east side of the Dwelling. Moshe clearly sees the political motivation behind the revolt, and is indignant that anyone would impute greed (cf. v.15) or lust for power to him."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, The Great Revolt 3","As Buber (1988) points out, however, more is at stake here. The rebels’ contention that “the entire community, the entirety of them, are holy,” though it sounds at first blush like the ideal expressed in Ex. 19:6 (God’s offer to make of the Israelites “a kingdom of priests, / a holy nation”), is in reality a most dangerous claim. Holiness in the Bible is a trait that can be acquired, even transmitted to an extent, but it is not absolutely innate, except in the case of God; and the Torah sees as ope of its major goals developing the means whereby people can, with holy intent and preparation, properly serve the Holy. The fate of the rebels therefore bespeaks the seriousness of the threat they pose, and is unique in the Bible."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, The Great Revolt 4","The narrative hinges on a number of expressions. The conflict between Moshe and the rebels is nicely encapsulated by two pairs of identical charges and countercharges—“Too much (is) yours” (vv.3 and 7) and “Is it too little” (vv.9 and 13). The terms “community” and “assembly” are played upon, designating alternately the body of the people and the minicommunity of the rebels. More significantly, this chapter and those around it—15, 17, and 18—are meaningfully linked together by variations on the Hebrew root <i>k-r-b</i> (Buber 1994). The thread of meaning runs from “bringing near-offerings near,” to God “declaring [Moshe and Ahron] near” to him, to the fact that he has “brought-near” the Levites in terms of their duties, to Korah and his band being asked to “bring-near” the incense, whose fire-pans later become holy because they were “brought-near,” and finally, to the repeated warning to outsiders not to “come-near” the sancta. At issue is what Buber calls “authorized” and “unauthorized nearing,” which is mentioned frequently in Leviticus but is used in the present text with the full artistic resources at the narrator’s command. Viewed in this light, order is restored to the blurring of lines threatened by Korah."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Aftermath 2","The revolt of Korah, with its macabre ending, has made it clear that Levites must not “come-near” the priestly domains, physically or professionally. Accordingly, the incense pans of the dead rebels become plating for the altar, as a warning for the future. The “fire-pan” becomes instrumental immediately thereafter, as Aharon must obtain forgiveness for the people, who understand the deaths of Korah and his followers as a political purge by the two brothers. Aharon’s action, it should be noted, cannot prevent the initial round of deaths by divine plague."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Aftermath 3","Upon hearing the “grumbling” of the Israelites (a word that did not, interestingly, appear in the Korah story), God now deems it necessary to provide another sign: proof that it is the Sons of Aharon that he has chosen (cf. 16:5)—as if the earth opening up were not enough! This is Aharon’s flowering rod, a stick that, though long-severed from its original tree, still manages to produce flowers and fruit. The motif is noted in many other cultures (cf. Gaster 1969 for references); Wagner made use of it to provide the climactic moment in his opera <i>Tannhäuser</i>."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Levite Rules 2","In order to more strictly enforce the separate roles of priest and Levite, necessitated by the rebellion of Korah, the text turns to clarification of the Levites’ duties and regulations concerning them. They are to act as a buffer between the sancta and the people, but may not come into contact with the holy-things themselves; the priests, of course, may and must. The priests’ reward—actually, their means of support—consists of firstborn animals and firstffuits; the Levites’, of tithes."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Levite Rules 3","The chief refrain in the chapter is variations on “so that they may not die”; this has occurred already in 17:25, thus linking Chaps. 17 and 18 nicely."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Death and the Red Cow 2","Apparently to close out the Korah story, the text turns to a mysterious and powerful ritual, one designed to remove the contaminating pollution of death. It is important to note that the revolt in Chap. 16 led, not only to the deaths of the rebels and their households, but also to the perishing of 14,700 people in the subsequent plague (17:12–14). So despite the fact that priests and Levites now have their tasks straight, thanks to Chap. 18, there remains the serious matter of purification."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Death and the Red Cow 3","Levine notes the typical priestly pattern at work: first the remedy is prescribed, and then the actual circumstances that call for it are enumerated. He also sees the chapter as essentially a protest against the widespread cult of the dead in the ancient Near East, from which the Israelites notably separated themselves."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Death and the Red Cow 4","Milgrom has illuminated a number of aspects of the Red Cow ritual, notably by characterizing it as a sort of <i>hattat</i> ceremony. That ritual, it may be recalled, enabled the priests to decontaminate the sanctuary of ritual pollution, chiefly through the sprinkling of blood against the altar. Milgrom points to the unusual nature of the ritual here, in that the purifying agent (in this case, water that has been mixed with the special cow’s ashes, which came partly from burned blood) is sprinkled on persons, not objects."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites 1",Numbers 20:1-29
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites 2","The first part of this chapter contains a story that has deeply troubled readers for over two millennia. Its length belies its weight; in only thirteen verses, Moshe and Aharon have lost their most cherished dream—the privilege of entering the Promised Land."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites 3","The brevity here may result from the fact that, for the narrator, this story was a variant of, or constructed from, a similar one in Ex. 17, to explain more fully why the leaders shared the fate of their generation. In other words, their deaths may affect us more than the text meant it to. Nonetheless, the question of why exactly Moshe and Aharon received such a terrible punishment for a moment of indiscretion will not go away. Can it really be that the towering figure of Moshe, liberator and lawgiver, parent and prophet, is to be done away with in the blink of an eye, over a fit of justifiable temper? But it is a public moment, and there the answer may lie. The Bible consistently takes a stringent view of leadership: that leaders must be above reproach, and that they must not lose sight of the fact that it is God whom they represent. A similar impulse led to the strict standards to which the writer of Samuel-Kings, the so-called Deuteronomistic historian, held such revered personalities as David and Solomon."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites 4","From v.14 to v.21, the text gives us a moment to digest what has just happened, at the same time managing to introduce the major theme of the next several chapters: encountering other peoples and tribes as the Israelites near Canaan. First is Edom, in the territory to the east roughly between Eilat and the Dead Sea. The sequence begins tentatively, not with an Israelite victory, but not with a defeat either: they are forced to reroute their approach."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites 5","So as to keep the memory of Merivat-Kadesh close, the chapter ends with the death of Aharon, “before the eyes of the entire community” (v.27). For the first time in all the rebellion texts, the word “rebel” itself is used (v.24). On a positive note, leadership is seamlessly passed to the next generation; when Moshe returns from witnessing Aharon’s death, he is accompanied by the latter’s son El’azar, who is tellingly dressed in Aharon’s garments."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, First Victory; Rebellion Again; Traveling; Sihon and Og 2","A miscellany of wilderness traditions, Chap. 21 begins with a military victory—perhaps a sign that Israel’s terrible trials are coming to an end. Not insignificantly, the victory comes after the Israelites have properly vowed to allot booty to God (v.2), a far cry from their willful attempt at conquest at the end of Chap. 14. This brief account may in fact be a reworking or different account of the Horma incident in that passage."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, First Victory; Rebellion Again; Traveling; Sihon and Og 3","The strange events surrounding the “viper of copper” that follow provide a reminder, even amid the progress of the march and military successes, of the Israelites’ usual waywardness. As usual, the problem is food; several things, however, make this brief story unusual amid the rebellion narratives. For one, the punishment is unique; for another, the people call upon Moshe to remove the plague—in a manner that is more reminiscent of Pharaoh of Egypt, with the Plagues, than of previous Israelite behavior. Finally, there is the Bible’s record of what happened to the copper object: it was preserved in the cult and worshiped by the people, until it was smashed during the large-scale religious reform under King Hezekiah of Judah (late eighth century <small>B.C.E.</small>). One might note that the divine punishment for sin, once accomplished, clears the way for the Israelite victories that follow immediately."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, First Victory; Rebellion Again; Traveling; Sihon and Og 4","Of additional interest in this chapter is the inclusion of three ancient poems (vv. 14–15, 17–18, and 27–30), whose origins and language are both obscure. Preceded by a brief itinerary of the Israelites’ travels up to Moabite territory, soon to be the scene of the Bil’am narratives (Chaps. 22–24), the chapter ends with two successful clashes against local kings, Sihon and Og. While the accounts here are brief, postbiblical Jewish tradition took delight in spinning fantastic tales about these two kings (cf. Ginzberg)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, On Bil'am 1",Numbers 22:2-25:9
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, On Bil'am 2",N<small>OW EMBEDDED WITHIN THE SECOND PART OF THE BOOK OF</small> N<small>UMBERS, THE STORIES</small> and exalted poetry connected with the name of the pagan prophet Bil'am (Balaam) in many ways point to the final section of the book. They provide a welcome relief from the depressing and at times exasperating narratives of rebellion. Israel in Bil'am’s vision is the realization of the patriarchal dream, a sea of people (and tents) without number, upright in conduct and victorious in battle. In its focusing on the theme of reversal—curses turned to blessings, ass turned seer/prophet, and prophet turned fool—the Bil'am section suggests that, as we leave the old generation to die out in the wilderness, God’s own “cursing” of the people because of their rebelliousness will somehow, ultimately, be turned into blessing. No wonder that Buber (1988) felt the hidden presence of Moses and his vision of Israel in these chapters.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, On Bil'am 3",Recent archaeological finds have placed Bil'am as a figure known to extrabiblical traditions located in the lands east of the Jordan. The Torah uses him (as the Bible may have used Job and other such personalities) for its own purposes, picking up a theme it has utilized earlier: the acknowledgment of God’s power and Israel’s glory by a wise or inspired pagan (cf., for instance, the figure of Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, in Ex. 18; or, to use later examples, Jericho’s Rahab in Josh. 2 and the Queen of Sheba in I Kings 10). Just as the Pharaoh is made to acknowledge God’s power and Israel’s glory toward the beginning of the Exodus sequence, so the nations or tribes surrounding Israel are portrayed as coming to the same realization at its end. Bil'am, as it were, provides religious legitimacy for these ideas in the non-Israelite domain.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, On Bil'am 4",The narrative is built, not only on obvious theme words such as “word,” “speak,” and “curse/revile/doom,” but also on repeating phrases. Central to them, in variation, is “only the word that I [God] speak to you, / that (alone) may speak” (22:20, 35, 38; 23:12, 36). The episode with the she-ass, one of the most unusual in the Bible, revolves around the threefold “And the she-ass saw YHWH’s messenger” (22:23, 2.5, 27), suggesting, of course, that Bil'am, the reputed holy man, does not see him. The story also offers an illustration of the Bible’s balanced sense of justice: Balak “once again” sends emissaries, Bil'am “once again” beats the she-ass, but these actions are thwarted by the divine messenger’s “once again” blocking the path (and, symbolically, the curse).
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, On Bil'am 5",While some scholars have suggested that the she-ass section has origins independent from the main body of the story, it is verbally linked to Bil'am’s speeches later in the story by a single device. The refrain of “these three times,” describing Bil'am’s beating of the she-ass and her refusal to continue, is matched by the threefold refusal of God to allow anything but blessing to publicly issue forth from the prophet’s mouth (“[on] these three occasions,” 24:10).
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, On Bil'am 6",The poetic sections of the story are built on the basis of a stock scene: Bil'am has Balak build seven altars and prepare seven bulls and seven rams; the prophet sacrifices the animals, and has the king stand alongside the altars while he, Bil'am, goes off to encounter God. When he returns, he “takes up his parable,” stressing twice how God blesses, not curses, Israel, and how he will under no circumstances revoke that blessing. The full version of the blessing, beginning in 24:3, is distinguished by its lofty tone (clearly suggesting the infusion of the “spirit of God” [24:2]). The tripled “Utters …” signals an abrupt change in mood and inspiration; the word, more properly “the utterance of …,” is frequently used by the later Prophets to open their speeches.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, On Bil'am 7",A word should be said about the “oracles to the nations” that begin in 24:17. These are reminiscent of many Prophetic passages, in which the seer turns outside Israel and addresses the neighboring peoples (e.g., Amos 1–2:3). Their inclusion in Numbers helps to link the Bil'am story with what has immediately preceded it, the account of Israel’s militarily successful encounter with its historical neighbors.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, On Bil'am 8",Similarly, the Bil'am episode is linked to the chapter that follows it, the apostasy at Baal-Peor. A tradition reported in 31:8 informs us that Bil'am was among those killed by Pin’has in his “zeal” or “indignation” (Fishbane 1974) for Y<small>HWH</small>.

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 3","T<small>HE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO DRAW THE READER INTO THE WORLD OF THE</small> Hebrew Bible through the power of its language. While this sounds simple enough, it is not usually possible in translation. Indeed, the premise of almost all Bible translations, past and present, is that the “meaning” of the text should be conveyed in as clear and comfortable a manner as possible in one’s own language. Yet the truth is that the Bible was not written in English in the twentieth or even the seventeenth century; it is ancient, sometimes obscure, and speaks in a way quite different from ours. Accordingly, I have sought here primarily to echo the style of the original, believing that the Bible is best approached, at least at the beginning, on its own terms. So I have presented the text in English dress but with a Hebraic voice."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 4","The result looks and sounds very different from what we are accustomed to encountering as the Bible, whether in the much-loved grandeur of the King James Version or the clarity and easy fluency of the many recent attempts. There are no old friends here; Eve will not, as in old paintings, give Adam an apple (nor will she be called “Eve”), nor will Moses speak of himself as “a stranger in a strange land,” as beautiful as that sounds. Instead, the reader will encounter a text which challenges him or her to rethink what these ancient books are and what they mean, and will hopefully be encouraged to become an active listener rather than a passive receiver."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 5","This translation is guided by the principle that the Hebrew Bible, like much of the literature of antiquity, was meant to be read aloud, and that consequently it must be translated with careful attention to rhythm and sound. The translation therefore tries to mimic the particular rhetoric of the Hebrew whenever possible, preserving such devices as repetition, allusion, alliteration, and wordplay. It is intended to echo the Hebrew, and to lead the reader back to the sound structure and form of the original."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 6","Such an approach was first espoused by Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig in their monumental German translation of the Bible (1925–1962) and in subsequent interpretive essays. <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is in many respects an offshoot of the Buber-Rosenzweig translation (hereafter abbreviated as B-R). I began with their principles: that translations of individual words should reflect “primal” root meanings, that translations of phrases, lines, and whole verses should mimic the syntax of the Hebrew, and that the vast web of allusions and wordplays present in the text should be somehow perceivable in the target language (for a full exposition in English, see now Buber and Rosenzweig 1994). In all these areas I have taken a more moderate view than my German mentors, partly because I think there are limitations to these principles and partly because recent scholarship points in broader directions. As a result, my translation is on the whole less radical and less strange in English than B-R was in German. This, however, does not mean that it is less different from conventional translations, or that I have abandoned the good fight for a fresh look at the Bible’s verbal power."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 7","Buber and Rosenzweig based their approach on the Romantic nineteenth-century notion that the Bible was essentially oral literature written down. In the present century there have been Bible scholars who have found this view attractive; on the other hand, there has been little agreement on how oral roots manifest themselves in the text. One cannot suggest that the Bible is a classic work of oral literature in the same sense as the <i>Iliad</i> or <i>Beowulf</i>. It does not employ regular meter or rhyme, even in sections that are clearly formal poetry. The text of the Bible that we possess is most likely a mixture of oral and written materials from a variety of periods and sources, and recovering anything resembling original oral forms would seem to be impossible. This is particularly true given the considerable chronological and cultural distance at which we stand from the text, which does not permit us to know how it was performed in ancient times."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 8","A more fruitful approach, less dependent upon theories whose historical accuracy is unprovable, might be to focus on the way in which the biblical text, <i>once</i> <i>completed</i>, was copied and read. Recent research reveals that virtually all literature in Greek and Roman times—the period when the Hebrew Bible was put into more or less the form in which it has come down to us (but not the period of its composition)—was read aloud. This holds for the process of copying or writing, and also, surprisingly, for solitary reading. As late as the last decade of the fourth century, Saint Augustine expressed surprise at finding a sage who read silently. Such practices and attitudes seem strange to us, for whom the very definition of a library, for instance, is a place where people have to keep quiet. But it was a routine in the world of antiquity, as many sources attest."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 9","So the Bible, if not an oral document, is certainly an aural one; it would have been read aloud as a matter of course. But the implications of this for understanding the text are considerable. The rhetoric of the text is such that many passages and sections are understandable in depth only when they are analyzed <i>as they are heard</i>. Using echoes, allusions, and powerful inner structures of sound, the text is often able to convey ideas in a manner that vocabulary alone cannot do. A few illustrations may suffice to introduce this phenomenon to the reader; it will be encountered constantly throughout this volume."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 10","Sound plays a crucial role in one of the climactic sequences in Genesis, Chapters 32–33. Jacob, the protagonist, has not seen his brother Esau for twenty years. Now a rich and successful adult, he is on his way back to Canaan after a long exile. He sends messengers to forestall Esau’s vengeance—for twenty years earlier, Jacob had stolen the birthright and the blessing which Esau felt were righdy his own. When Jacob finds out that his brother “is already coming … and four hundred men are with him” (32:7), he goes even further, preparing an elaborate gift for Esau in the hopes of appeasing his anger. The text in VV.21–22 presents Jacob’s thoughts and actions (the translation is taken from the New English Bible):"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 11","for he thought, “I will appease him with the present that I have sent on ahead, and afterwards, when I come into his presence, he will perhaps receive me kindly.” So Jacob’s present went on ahead of him. …"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 12","This is an accurate and highly idiomatic translation of the Hebrew, and the reader will notice nothing unusual about the passage as it reads in English. The sound of the Hebrew text, on the other hand, gives one pause. It is built on variations of the word <i>panim</i>, whose basic meaning is “face,” although the Hebrew uses it idiomatically to encompass various ideas. (Note: in Hebrew, the sound <i>p</i> is pronounced as <i>ph</i> under certain circumstances.) If the text is translated with attention to sound, its quite striking oral character emerges (italics mine):"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 13",For he said to himself:
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 14",I will wipe (the anger from) his <i>face (phanav)</i>
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 15",with the gift that goes ahead of my <i>face; (le-phanai)</i>
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 16","afterward, when I see his <i>face, (phanav)</i>"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 17",perhaps he will lift up my <i>face! (phanai)</i>
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 18",The gift crossed over ahead of his <i>face. … (alpanav)</i>
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 19","Comparison of these two English versions is instructive. In the New English Bible, as in most other contemporary versions, the translators are apparently concerned with presenting the text in clear, modern, idiomatic English. For example, they render the Hebrew <i>yissa phanai</i> as “receive me kindly.” The N.E.B. translates the <i>idea</i> of the text; at the same time it translates <i>out</i> the sound by not picking up on the repetition of <i>panim</i> words."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 20","What does the reader gain by hearing the literalness of the Hebrew? And what is lost by the use of its idiomatic meaning? As mirrored in the second translation, it is clear that our text is signaling something of significance. The motif of “face” (which might be interpreted as “facing” or “confrontation”) occurs at crucial points in the story. The night before his fateful meeting with Esau, as he is left to ponder the next day’s events, Jacob wrestles with a mysterious stranger—a divine being. After Jacob’s victory, the text reports (32:31):"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 21","Yaakov called the name of the place: Peniel/<i>Face of God</i>,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 22","for: I have seen God,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 23","<i>face to face</i>,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 24",and my life has been saved.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 25","The repetition suggests a thematic link with what has gone before. One could interpret that once the hero has met and actually bested this divine being, his coming human confrontation is assured of success. Thus upon meeting Esau at last, Jacob says to him (33:10):"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 26","For I have, after all, seen <i>your face</i>, as one sees the <i>face</i> of God,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 27",and you have been gracious to me.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 28","It could be said that in a psychological sense the meetings with divine and human adversaries are a unity, the representation of one human process in two narrative episodes. This is accomplished by the repetition of the word <i>panim</i> in the text."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 29","The above interpretation depends entirely on sound. Once that focus is dropped, either through the silent reading of the text or a standard translation, the inner connections are simply lost and the reader is robbed of the opportunity to make these connections for himself. Clearly there is a difference between translating what the text means and translating what it says."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 30","While the Jacob passages use the sound of a specific word to indicate an important motif in the narrative, there are other cases where sound brings out structure, and the structure itself conveys the principal idea of the passage. A striking example of this is found at the beginning of Genesis. God’s first acts of creation in 1:3–5 are portrayed in a highly ordered fashion, suggesting that creation itself is orderly, and this idea is the thematic backbone of the whole chapter. We are meant to experience the orderliness of God’s activity through the sensuality of the language and through the particular way in which the text speaks. A translation keyed to the sound of the Hebrew reads:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 31",God said: Let there be light! And there was light.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 32",God saw the light: that it was good.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 33",God separated the light from the darkness.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 34",God called the light: Day! and the darkness he called: Night!
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 35","The four occurrences of “God” plus verb accomplish the narrator’s goal, and give a tone to the creation account that makes it akin to poetry. In contrast, virtually all modern translations treat the passage as prose, rendering it into clear written English but simultaneously removing its inner structure. What remains is a statement of what is taking place in the narrative, but without its underlying thrust. Again the New English Bible:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 36","God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light; and God saw that the light was good, and he separated light from darkness. He called the light day, and the darkness night."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 37","This translation is cast in good English style. For just that reason two occurrences of “God” have been omitted, and the passage consequently reads smoothly—so smoothly that one glides past it as if creation were the same as any other narrated action. But what has been lost is the characteristic oral ring of the text, and simultaneously its intent to say something beyond the content of words alone."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 38","Another example of translating with an ear to the sound and structure of the original, this time from the book of Exodus, comes from the dramatic story of the Sea of Reeds (14:11–12). The newly freed Israelites find themselves pursued by their former masters, the Pharaoh and his army; with their backs to the Sea, they panic, and bitterly harangue their would-be deliverer, Moses. The present translation, attempting to reflect the repetition and structure of the original, yields the following:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 39",they said to Moshe:
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 40",Is it because there are no graves in Egypt
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 41",that you have taken us out to die in the wilderness?
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 42","What is this that you have done to us, bringing us out of Egypt?"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 43","Is this not the very word that we spoke to you in Egypt,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 44","saying: Let us alone, that we may serve Egypt!"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 45","Indeed, better for us serving Egypt"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 46",than our dying in the wilderness!
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 47","This passage demonstrates several aspects of a rhetorical translation method, if we may so term it: the laying out of the text in “cola” or lines meant to facilitate reading aloud (more on this below); the repetition of words—“Egypt” five times and “wilderness” twice—to stress the irony of the Israelites’ predicament (as they see it, Egypt means life, and the wilderness, certain death); and the double use of “serve,” the very word that Moses constantly drummed into Pharaoh’s ears in the early part of the book to denote the Israelites’ desire to go and worship their God (“Send free my people, that they may serve me”). If we juxtapose the above translation with that found in, say, the New International Version, the importance of this approach to the text becomes clear:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 48","They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 49","Here the rhetorical force of the Hebrew has been ignored. The Hebrew text does not transpose “desert to die” to “die in the desert” at the end of the passage (the word order repeats in the original, for emphasis); it does not distinguish in sound between “Egypt” and “Egyptians”; and it certainly does not read like standard colloquial prose. Indeed, all of Chapter 14 of Exodus demonstrates the Bible’s use of an intermediate form between poetry and prose, a form designed to instruct as well as to inspire."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 50","But it is not only in narrative that the rhetoric of biblical language makes itself felt. Fully half of the book of Exodus is law or instruction, and one can find there further examples of the importance of sound structure in the Bible. Take, for instance, the law concerning the protection of widows and orphans (22:23–24). This time I shall present the text first through the eyes of the Jerusalem Bible:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 51","You must not be harsh with the widow, or with the orphan; if you are harsh with them, they will surely cry out to me, and be sure that I shall hear their cry; my anger will flare and I shall kill you with the sword, your own wives will be widows, your own children orphans."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 52","This is powerful language, especially in a law code. But the Hebrew text goes much farther, utilizing as it does a double form of the verb rarely found in multiple sequence:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 53",Any widow or orphan you are not to afflict.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 54","Oh, if you afflict, afflict them …!"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 55","For (then) they will cry, cry out to me,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 56","and I will hearken, hearken to their cry,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 57",my anger will flare up
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 58","and I will kill you with the sword,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 59","so that your wives become widows, and your children, orphans!"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 60","Here the text is in effect slowed down by the division into lines, and the verb forms are isolated to underscore their unique rhetoric. The effect of the whole is to focus attention on this particular law among a host of others."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 61","Once the spokenness of the Bible is understood as a critical factor in the translation process, a number of practical steps become necessary which constitute radical changes from past translation practices. Buber and Rosenzweig introduced three such major innovations into their work: the form in which the text is laid out, the reproduction of biblical names and their meanings, and the “leading-word” technique by means of which important repetitions in the Hebrew are retained in translation."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 62","First, as is obvious from the excerpts quoted above, the translated text is printed in lines resembling blank verse. These “cola” are based primarily on spoken phrasing. In Buber’s view, each unit represents simultaneously a unit of breathing and of meaning, thus illustrating the deep connection between form and content in the Hebrew Bible. While current scholars, myself included, would not agree with Buber that the text’s rhetoric necessarily corresponds to “breathing,” cola divisions do facilitate reading aloud and make it possible for the listener to sense the text’s inner rhythm—and only at that point can the text begin to deliver its message with full force."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 63","Cola do not correspond to the traditional verse divisions found in printed Bibles. Those divisions are of late origin (perhaps from the ninth century, in written form), and were adopted for the sake of reference. Jews and Christians have used them in roughly the same form since the middle ages. Cola, on the other hand, arise from the experience of reading the Hebrew text aloud and of feeling its spoken rhythms. The specific divisions used in this volume are somewhat arbitrary; each reader will hear the text differently. My line divisions are sometimes identical to B-R, but often are not; they sometimes correspond to the punctuation laid down by Jewish tradition (the Masoretic accents or <i>trop</i>), but not always. What is most important, however, is that the practice of dividing the text into lines points away from the apprehension of the Bible as a written book and restores the sense of it as spoken performance."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 64","Second, personal and place names generally appear in Hebrew forms throughout this translation. Thus, for example, the Hebrew <i>Moshe</i> is retained instead of Moses, <i>Kayin</i> instead of Cain, <i>Rivka</i> instead of Rebecca, and <i>Bil’am</i> instead of Balaam. This practice stems from the central role that names play in biblical stories (as often in literature). In biblical Israel as throughout the ancient world, names are often meant to give clues about their bearer’s personality or fate. The meaning of a name is often explained outright in the text itself. In <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> this is represented by a slash in the text, as in the following example (Gen. 30:23–24):"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 65",She said:
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 66",God has removed/<i>asaf</i>
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 67",my reproach.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 68","And she called his name: Yosef,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 69",saying:
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 70",May Y<small>HWH</small> add/<i>yosef</i>
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 71",another son to me.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 72","The name here is a play on words, hinting at Joseph’s eventual fate (he will be a son “removed” and “added,” that is, lost and found by his family). By retaining the Hebrew sounds in translation, a meaningful portion of the narrative is thus moved from footnotes, where it appears in most modern translations, back to the body of the text. That this is important is demonstrated by the fact that virtually every major (usually male) character in Genesis has his name explained in this manner."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 73","It should be noted that such interpretations of names in the Bible are not based on philological derivations, that is, on scientific etymology. The name Jacob/Yaakov, for instance, which is understood in Gen. 25 as “Heel-Holder” and in Chapter 27 as “Heel-Sneak,” probably held the original meaning of “may (God) protect.” But the biblical writers were not so much concerned with what a name originally meant as they were with its sound, and with the associations inherent in that sound. Therefore what is important in our example is that “Yaakov” recalls <i>ekev</i>, “heel.” This kind of interpretation is known as “folk etymology” or “popular etymology.” A similar phenomenon appears in the naming of Moses (Ex. 2:10)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 74","A third important technique with which biblical literature often conveys its message, and which must influence the translation of the text, is what Buber called the “leading-word” (<i>Leitwort</i>) principle. Key (“leading”) words are repeated within a text to signify major themes and concerns, like recurring themes in a piece of music (hence the similarity of Buber’s term to composer Richard Wagner’s word <i>Leitmotif</i>). A leading-word operates on the basis of sound: the repetition of a word or word root encourages the listener to make connections between diverse parts of a story (or even of a book), and to trace a particular theme throughout. This is not to be seen, however, as a static process. A leading-word may appear in different forms and contexts, with changed meaning, thus lending a sense of movement and development to the text and its characters. One example may be cited here; others appear throughout this book."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 75","Buber’s essay, “Abraham the Seer,” traces the biblical tradition’s portrayal of Abraham through the use of key words and phrases in the text. Chief among these is the verb “to see” (Hebrew <i>ra’o</i>), which appears constantly in the Abraham narratives and which tells us something significant about both the man himself and how he is meant to be remembered. At the outset of Abraham’s journey to Canaan, which signals his entry into biblical tradition as an independent personality, God sends him off to a land that he will “let him see” (12:1). Arriving in the land, Abraham is granted a communication from God, expressed by the phrase “Y<small>HWH</small> was seen by Avram …” (12:7). God subsequently promises the land to him and his descendants (“see from the place that you are … for all the land that you see, to you I give it and to your seed, for the ages” [13:15]). “Seeing” comes to the fore in the story of Abraham’s concubine Hagar; her encounter with God’s messenger ends with her addressing a “God of Seeing” (16:13). Further meetings between Abraham and God (17:1, 18:1) likewise express themselves visually, with the latter scene, where God announces Isaac’s impending birth at Abraham’s tent, almost unique in the Bible for its bold picture of God appearing directly to human beings. Finally, with the great test of Abraham in Chapter 22, the “Binding of Isaac,” the theme of seeing is brought to a climax. Buber describes the use of the leading-word in that passage, summarizing how it rounds out the entire Abraham cycle:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 76","It appears here more often than in any previous passage. Abraham sees the place where the act must be accomplished, at a distance. To the question of his son, he replies that God will provide (“see to”) the lamb for the burnt offering. In the saving moment he lifts up his eyes and sees the ram. And now he proclaims over the altar the name that makes known the imperishable essence of this place, Mount Moriah: Y<small>HWH</small> Will See. … God sees man, and man sees God. God sees Abraham, and tests him by seeing him as the righteous and “whole” man who walks before his God (17:1), and now, at the end of his road, he conquers even this final place, the holy temple mountain, by acting on God’s behalf. Abraham sees God with the eye of his action and so recognizes Him, just as Moses, seeing God’s glory “from behind,” will recognize Him as Gracious and Merciful.*<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">Martin Buber, <i>On the Bible: Eighteen Studies</i>, edited by Nahum N. Glatzer (New York: Schocken Books, 1982), p. 42.</i>"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 77","Buber goes one step further in his analysis of the leading-word <i>see:</i> he views it as a clue to the biblical concept of Abraham’s role in history. Taking the hint from I Sam. 9:9 (“the prophet of our day was formerly called a seer”), he posits that the Bible wants us to understand Abraham as the spiritual father of the later prophets. Abraham, then, is preeminent as the first man in the Bible of whom it is reported that God “was seen by him.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 78","Such an understanding of the role of leading-words as crucial to biblical style rarely makes itself felt in translation. Bible translators are reluctant to reproduce repetitions of Hebrew words in the text because they are generally fearful of creating a tedious English style. However, once one abandons the idea of the Bible as primarily a written work, the repetitiveness of leading-words becomes a signal rather than a stumbling block, freeing the reader to experience the dynamic manner in which the Bible expresses itself. That this sometimes entails a loss of nuance in the translation (where “see” in Hebrew may signify “perceive” or “understand” in a particular passage, for instance) is a price that must be paid; yet such a translation may in fact retain more of the breadth of the Hebrew than is immediately apparent."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 79","A final word needs to be said about the leading-word technique. It may serve a purpose in the text beyond conveying meaning: it may play a structural role, unifying sections that have been culled from different sources within biblical Israel to form a composite account. The ancient redactors of the Bible apparently crafted the material they received into an organic whole. Using such means as leading-word repetition, they in effect created a new literature in which deep relationships exist between the parts of the whole."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 80","The above three translation techniques—setting out the text in cola, transliterating and explaining Hebrew names, and reproducing leading-words—form the crux of an approach to the Bible’s spokenness, but there are other methods used by the text to the same end. Three are particularly worthy of mention: wordplay, allusion, and what I have termed small-scale repetition."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 81","The Bible uses wordplay to make a point forcefully, especially in prophetic passages or those with a prophetic flavor. In Gen. 40:13 and 19, for instance, Joseph predicts that the king of Egypt will end the imprisonment of two of his courtiers. When the cupbearer is to be restored to his former position, Joseph says,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 82",in another three days
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 83",Pharaoh will lift up your head. …
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 84","In contrast, when Joseph predicts that the chief baker will be executed, the text reads:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 85",in another three days Pharaoh will lift up your head
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 86",from off you. …
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 87","By beginning both statements with the same phrasing, the narrator is able to heighten the impact of “from off you” on both audience and victim."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 88","A powerful example of the second device, allusion, occurs near the beginning of Exodus. Baby Moses, floating precariously yet fetus-like on the Nile, is one of the enduring images in the book, as children have long attested. Modern English readers, however, are seldom aware that the Hebrew word for Moses’s floating cradle—rendered by virtually all standard translations as “basket”—is the same as the one used in Gen. 6:14ff. to describe Noah’s famous vessel (<i>teiva</i>). Preserving the connection between the two, as I have tried to do in the Exodus passage with “little-ark” (and which, incidentally, the authors of the King James Version did with “ark”), is to keep open the play of profound meaning that exists between the two stories."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 89","Finally, we may give an example of small-scale repetition. Unlike the leading-word technique, this is limited to a brief report and is used to express one specific idea. In Gen. 6:11–13, for instance, it illustrates an important biblical concept: just punishment. Three times in the passage we hear the word “ruin,” indicating what human evil has done to the world; the fourth time (v.13) it appears in a causative form, to show that God retaliates in exactly the same terms, measure for measure."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 90",Now the earth had gone-to-<i>ruin</i> before God; the earth was filled with wrongdoing.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 91","God saw the earth, and here: it had gone-to-<i>ruin</i>,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 92",for all flesh had <i>ruined</i> its way upon the earth.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 93",God said to Noah:
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 94","An end of all flesh has come before me,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 95",for the earth is filled with wrongdoing through them;
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 96","here, I will bring-<i>ruin</i> upon them, along with the earth."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 97","The Bible is fond of this technique, which it uses in a number of narratives that deal with human misbehavior (e.g., the Tower of Babel story in Gen. 11). It is another example of how the form in which the text is cast goes a long way toward expressing its intent."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 98","From the above examples it may appear that it is not difficult to carry out the Buber-Rosenzweig principles in a translation. In practice, however, the translator who wishes to bring the language spoken by his audience into consonance with the style of the Hebrew text runs the risk of doing violence to that language, forced as he or she is into “hebraizing” the language. There will of necessity be a certain strangeness and some awkward moments in such a translation. Buber and Rosenzweig themselves came under fire for creating a strange new kind of German in their work; one critic in 1933 accused them of “unusual affectations.” My renditions of the Torah books, while limited in what they wreak with the English language both by my cautiousness and by the less pliable nature of English (than German), have been liable to similar characterization, especially in the legal sections."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 99","This problem, however, is inherent in this kind of undertaking, and I have accepted its risks willingly. In the last generation there have been any number of clear, smooth-reading translations of the Bible, all aimed at making the text readily accessible to the reader. I have taken a different road, arguing (along with Buber and Rosenzweig) that the reader must be prepared to meet the Bible at least halfway and must become an active participant in the process of the text, rather than a passive listener. To this end, there is no alternative but to force the language of the translation to become the instrument through which the Hebraic voice of the text speaks."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 100","I have taken pains to illustrate some of the rhetorical devices that emerge from an oral reading of the text in order to indicate the direction taken in <i>The Five Books of Moses</i>. A concluding observation must be made. Every critic knows, or should know, that art defies categorization and exact description. We try to understand what makes a masterpiece tick, whether it be a painting, a piece of music, or a work of literature, yet in the end our analyses fall silent before the greatness and subtlety of the work itself. The techniques that I have described above must remain suggestive rather than definitive; they point out a direction rather than speak directly. Biblical narratives do not end with the phrase “The moral of the story is …,” any more than biblical laws overtly spell out their assumptions. Translating with attention to sound therefore may help to preserve not only the message of the text but also its ambiguity and open-endedness. In that persona the Bible has been familiar to Jewish and Christian interpreters, who for centuries have sought to fill in the gaps and resolve the difficulties in the text by means of their own ingenuity. This volume is aimed at helping present-day readers to share in that experience."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 101","Reading the Bible in the literary, rhetorical manner I have just explicated is grounded in certain assumptions about the text. <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> stays close to the basic “masoretic” text-type of the Torah, that is, the vocalized text that has been with us for certain for about a millennium. Deviations from that form, in the interest of solving textual problems, are duly mentioned in the Notes. In following the traditional Hebrew text, I am presenting to the English reader an unreconstructed book, but one whose form is at least verifiable in a long-standing tradition. This translation, therefore, is not a translation of some imagined “original” text, or of the Torah of Moses’ or Solomon’s or even Jeremiah’s time. These documents, could they be shown to have existed for certain or in recognizable form, have not been found, and give little promise of ever being found. <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is, rather, a translation of the biblical text as it might have been known in the formative, postbiblical period of Judaism and early Christianity (the Roman era). As far as the prehistory of the text is concerned, readers who have some familiarity with biblical criticism will note that in my Commentary I have made scant reference to the by-now classic dissection of the Torah into clear-cut prior “sources” (designated J, E, P, and D by the Bible scholars of the past century). Such analysis has been dealt with comprehensively by others (cfi, for instance, Levine on the book of Numbers). In addition, it remains a theoretical construct, and the nature of biblical texts militates against recovering the exact process by which the Bible came into being. In any event, virtually all the standard introductions to the Bible deal with this topic; beyond these, readers may find Friedman (1989) of particular clarity and usefulness."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 102","Given the text that I am using, what has interested me here is chiefly the final form of the Torah books, how they fit together as artistic entities, and how they have combined traditions to present a coherent religious message. This was surely the goal of the final “redactor(s),” but it was not until recently a major goal of biblical scholars. While, therefore, I am not committed to refuting the tenets of source criticism in the strident manner of Benno Jacob and Umberto Cassuto, I have concentrated in this volume on the “wholeness” of biblical texts, rather than on their growth out of fragments. My Commentary is aimed at helping the reader to search for unities and thematic development."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 103","At the same time, in recent years I have found it increasingly fascinating to encounter the text’s complex layering. It appears that every time a biblical story or law was put in a new setting or redaction, its meaning, and the meaning of the whole, must have been somewhat altered. A chorus of different periods and concerns is often discernible, however faintly. Sometimes these function to “deconstruct” each other, and sometimes they actually create a new text. In offering a rendition that does not try to gloss over stylistic differences, I hope that this book will make it possible for an inquisitive reader to sense that process at work. As far as analysis of the text in this manner is concerned, I would recommend to the reader the brilliant work of Greenstein (1985a) and Damrosch (1987)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 104","Some readers may wonder whether <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is merely an English translation of B-R. It is not. Although B-R served as the theoretical basis for my work, I have found it necessary to modify their approach in the present setting. There are a number of reasons for this."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 105","For one, Bible scholarship has made notable advances since Buber’s heyday (Rosenzweig had already died in 1929). Although he completed the German translation in 1961, and kept abreast of work in the field, it must be said that Buber did not greatly modify the text of the Pentateuch translation, philologically speaking, between 1930 when the second edition appeared and the revised printings of the mid-1950s. It seemed imperative to me to bring the work of postwar biblical philology to bear on the English translation, rather than relying solely on Buber’s etymologies. Some of the changes in this area have been cited in the Notes to the text (as “B-R uses …”)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 106","Second, in the attempt to make the German translation mirror the Hebrew original Rosenzweig did not hesitate to either create new German words or reach back into the German literature of past ages to find forms suitable for rendering certain Hebrew expressions. To perform a corresponding feat in English would simply not work; the language is not flexible, and usages change so quickly that an artful appeal to the past seems futile except for the benefit of linguistic historians. While I have endeavored to produce an English text that reflects the style of biblical Hebrew, I have in the main shied away from pushing the language beyond reasonable and comprehensible limits."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 107","There are other significant deviations from B-R here. I have used a different rendering of the name of God, which had been a distinctive B-R trademark (for an explanation, see “On the Name of God and Its Translation”). I have sometimes opted for different line divisions, based on my own hearing of the Hebrew; indented purely poetic passages, a practice not followed by B-R in narrative texts; read a large number of clauses differently from a grammatical or syntactical point of view; and loosened the practice, sometimes overdone in B-R, of reproducing a Hebrew root by a single English one wherever it occurs."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 108","It will be noted that I have included here one element that many readers felt was sorely lacking in B-R: notes and commentary. Every translation of the Bible implies a commentary, but few have included one with the text. <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> especially requires such an apparatus, both to explain its translation technique and to show how it may be used fruitfully in interpreting the Bible. Read in conjunction with the text, the explanatory material presents a methodology for studying and teaching the Bible."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 109","Finally, there is the personal aspect of this work. It was conceived as an act of homage to the B-R translation; at the beginning, I desired solely (and rashly) to bring their accomplishment over into English. It was therefore a labor of love, and despite the amount of work involved, a relatively safe one; I did not, at least initially, have to make my own decisions about the biblical text. I should certainly never have undertaken my own translation at that stage."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 110","But working on a project of this nature inevitably leads to things that are not predictable at the outset. It happened exactly as Rosenzweig wrote about his own involvement: like a seduction. It soon became apparent that, not only could I not in good conscience do to English what especially Rosenzweig had done to German, but I was also beginning to find my own voice as creator and scholar in the translation. Thus—although this was not my original intention—I am quite aware that in this book I am presenting a piece of myself as well as an approach to the Bible for English readers."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 111","This having been said, <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is still very much in the B-R tradition. It retains the general approach of its predecessor, exclusive of those principles that are dependent on the form and character of the German language. It is therefore the child of B-R, with all the links and independent features that a parent-child relationship implies. It may also be seen as an attempt to bring the work of B-R into a new era of Bible scholarship, and as an artistic endeavor in its own right."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 112","<i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is heavily indebted to B-R, but one may also view it in a more contemporary context. Over the past two decades, there has been an explosion of “literary” study of the Bible. Numerous scholars have turned their attention to the form and rhetoric of the biblical text, concentrating on its finished form rather than on trying to reconstruct history or the development of the text. Such an approach is hardly new. Already in late antiquity, Jewish interpretation of the Bible often centered around the style and precise wording of the text, especially as heard when read aloud. Similarly, the medieval Jewish commentators of Spain and France showed great sensitivity to the linguistic aspects of the Bible. In both cases, however, no systematic approach was developed; literary interpretation remained interwoven with very different concerns such as homiletics, mysticism, and philosophy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 113","It has remained for twentieth-century scholars, reacting partly against what they perceived to be the excessive historicizing of German Bible scholarship, to press for a literary reading of the Bible. Early pioneers in this regard include Umberto Cassuto, Buber and (later) Meir Weiss in Israel, and Benno Jacob (who was consulted frequently during the writing of B-R) in Germany. More recently we might mention James Muilenberg (who labeled his holistic approach “Rhetorical Criticism”), Edwin Good, James Ackerman, and Robert Alter in the U.S.; and J. P. Fokkelman in Holland. These names are now the tip of the iceberg, and one can speak of a whole school of interpreters in a literary or rhetorical vein. The reader will find a number of stimulating studies listed in “Suggestions for Further Reading.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 114","<i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is akin to many of these efforts, and has benefited directly from them. Although I began my work independently of the literary movement, I have come to feel a kinship with it, and regard my text as one that may be used to study the Bible in a manner consistent with its findings. At the same time, I am not committed to throwing out historical scholarship wholesale. It would be a mistake to set up the two disciplines in an adversarial relationship, as has often been done. The Hebrew Bible is by nature a complex and multi-faceted literature, in both its origins and the history of its use and interpretation. No one “school” can hope to illuminate more than part of the whole picture, and even then, one’s efforts are bound to be fragmentary. Probably, only a synthesis of all fruitful approaches available into a fully interdisciplinary methodology will provide a satisfactory overview of the biblical text (see Greenstein 1989). In this respect, approaching the Bible is analogous to dealing with the arts in general, where a multitude of disciplines from aesthetics to the social and natural sciences is needed to flesh out the whole. I hope that <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> will make a contribution toward this process, by providing an English text, and an underlying reading of the Hebrew, that balances what has appeared previously."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 115","There is another more recent movement in biblical studies which deserves both mention and study. As of this writing, feminist Bible criticism has come into its own. A substantial number of thoughtful and thought-provoking studies have appeared in recent years that examine the portrayal and position of women in biblical texts. One of the glaring gaps in previous Bible scholarship—and one of the difficult issues for contemporary readers of the Bible—lies in coming to terms with the social/sexual milieu assumed by the text. Wrestling with this issue is an appropriate complement to the other types of text-wrestling that have taken place throughout the ages. I have tried to present some of the findings of feminist criticism on the text, and I have listed some appropriate recent works in “Suggestions for Further Reading.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 116","To what extent can any translation of the Bible be said to be more “authentic” than another? Because of lack of information about the various original audiences of our text, the translator can only try to be as faithful as the information will allow. This is particularly true where a work as universally known as the Bible is concerned. Even if the precise circumstances surrounding its writing and editing were known, the text would still be affected by the interpretations of the centuries. It is as if a Beethoven symphony were to be performed on period instruments, using nineteenth-century performance techniques: would it still sound as fresh and radical to us as it did in Beethoven’s own day? Thus I would suggest that it is almost impossible to reproduce the Bible’s impact on its contemporaries; all that the translator can do is to perform the task with as much honesty as possible, with a belief in one’s artistic intuition and a consciousness of one’s limitations."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 117","Yet how are we to distinguish the point where explication ends and personal interpretation begins? From the very moment of the Bible’s editing and promulgation, there began the historical process of interpretation, a process which has at times led to violent disagreement between individuals and even nations. Everyone who has ever taken the Bible seriously has staked so much on a particular interpretation of the text that altering it has become close to a matter of life and death. Nothing can be done about this situation, unfortunately, and once again the translator must do the best he or she can. Art, by its very nature, gives rise to interpretation—else it is not great art. The complexity and ambiguity of great literature invites interpretation, just as the complexities and ambiguities of its interpreters encourage a wide range of perspectives. The Hebrew Bible, in which very diverse material has been juxtaposed in a far-ranging collection spanning centuries, rightly or wrongly pushes the commentator and reader to make inner connections and draw overarching conclusions. My interpretations in this book stem from this state of affairs. I have tried to do my work as carefully and as conscientiously as I can, recognizing the problems inherent in this kind of enterprise. I hope the result is not too far from what the biblical editors had intended."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 118","My ultimate goal in this volume has been to show that reading the Hebrew Bible is a process, in the same sense that performing a piece of music is a process. Rather than carrying across (“translating”) the content of the text from one linguistic realm to another, I have tried to involve the reader in the experience of giving it back (“rendering”), of returning to the source and recreating some of its richness. My task has been to present the raw material of the text as best I can in English, and to point out some of the method that may be fruitfully employed in wrestling with it."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 119","Buber and Rosenzweig translated the Bible out of the deep conviction that language has the power to bridge worlds and to redeem human beings. They both, separately and together, fought to restore the power of ancient words and to speak modern ones with wholeness and genuineness. Despite the barriers in their own lives—Buber’s early disappointments, Rosenzweig’s struggle with German idealism and later with a terrible paralysis that left him unable to speak—they each came to see dialogue as a central fact of interhuman and human-divine relations."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 120","The era in which we live, seventy years after the first appearance of the Buber-Rosenzweig <i>Im Anfang</i> (Genesis), is, however, heir to many decades of a very different experience. Since 1933, but beginning certainly well before, the Western world has experienced the debasement and trivialization of human language, and thus of divine language as well. From Stalin’s and Hitler’s speeches, to Orwell’s visions, to the reality of Vietnam War jargon and on to the babble of television and advertising, words seem to have lost their elemental meaningfulness in a way that the optimistic nineteenth century into which Buber and Rosenzweig were born could not have dared to believe. In this situation, can a translation of ancient books, even though they are from the Bible, have anything to say, or are they merely a “message from a dead man,” to use Kafka’s poignant expression?"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Translator's Preface 121","Yet Buber and Rosenzweig knew that language lives only in the mouths of speakers, human beings who face each other and who at every moment of conversation and contact literally translate for one another. The reading of the Bible is hopefully a cultural means for reawakening that conversation, for in the struggle to understand and apply these texts, one may come to perceive the importance of real words. A Bible translation should be the occasion for reaffirming the human desire to speak and be heard, for encouraging people to view their lives as a series of statements and responses—conversations, really. In sending the reader back to the text, the Buber-Rosenzweig Bible sought to counter the deadness of contemporary language and contemporary living which were all too apparent at the turn of the century, even before war and genocide began to take their toll. As we approach the end of that century, the same problems remain, altered further by the present revolution in communications. Amid the overcrowded air of cyberspace, the Hebrew Bible may still come to tell us that we do not live by bread alone, and that careful and loving attention to ancient words may help us to form the modern ones that we need."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, On the Name of God and Its Translation 1","T<small>HE READER WILL IMMEDIATELY NOTICE THAT THE PERSONAL NAME OF THE BIBLICAL</small> God appears in this volume as “Y<small>HWH</small>.” That is pretty standard scholarly practice, but it does not indicate how the name should be pronounced. I would recommend the use of traditional “the Lord” in reading aloud, but others may wish to follow their own custom. While the visual effect of “Y<small>HWH</small>” may be jarring at first, it has the merit of approximating the situation of the Hebrew text as we now have it, and of leaving open the unsolved question of the pronunciation and meaning of God’s name. Some explanation is in order."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, On the Name of God and Its Translation 2","The name of God has undergone numerous changes in both its writing and translation throughout the history of the Bible. At an early period the correct pronunciation of the name was either lost or deliberately avoided out of a sense of religious awe. Jewish tradition came to vocalize and pronounce the name as “Adonai,” that is, “the/my Lord,” a usage that has remained in practice since late antiquity. Another euphemism, regularly used among Orthodox Jews today, is “Ha-Shem,” literally, “The Name.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, On the Name of God and Its Translation 3","Historically, Jewish and Christian translations of the Bible into English have tended to use “Lord,” with some exceptions (notably, Moffatt’s “The Eternal”). Both old and new attempts to recover the “correct” pronunciation of the Hebrew name have not succeeded; neither the sometimes-heard “Jehovah” nor the standard scholarly “Yahweh” can be conclusively proven."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, On the Name of God and Its Translation 4","For their part, Buber and Rosenzweig sought to restore some of what they felt was the name’s ancient power; early drafts of their Genesis translation reveal a good deal of experimentation in this regard. They finally settled on a radical solution: representing the name by means of capitalized personal pronouns. The use of You, He, Him, etc., stemmed from their conviction that God’s name is not a proper name in the conventional sense, but rather one which evokes his immediate presence. Buber and Rosenzweig—both of whom wrote a great deal about their interpretation (see Buber and Rosenzweig 1994) based it on their reading of Ex. 3:14, a text in which another verbal form of Y<small>HWH</small> appears, and which they translated as “I will be-there howsoever I will be-there” (i.e., my name is not a magical handle through which I can be conjured up; I am ever-present). For more on this passage, and the name, see the Commentary and Notes in the text below."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, On the Name of God and Its Translation 5","The B-R rendering has its attractiveness in reading aloud, as is demonstrated by recordings of Buber reading his text, but it is on doubtful grounds etymologically. It also introduces an overly male emphasis through its constant use of “H<small>E</small>,” an emphasis which is not quite so pronounced in the Hebrew. For these reasons, and out of a desire to reflect the experience of the Hebrew reader, I have followed the practice of transcribing the name as Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, On the Name of God and Its Translation 6","Readers who are uncomfortable with the maleness of God in these texts may wish to substitute “God” for “he” in appropriate passages. While, as a translator, I am committed to reproducing the text as faithfully as I can, it is also true that the ancient Hebrews viewed God as a divinity beyond sexuality, and modern readers as well may see fit to acknowledge this."

I have by and large eschewed historical issues, and those pertaining to the origins and textual history of Genesis and Exodus.

I am also grateful to Professors Susan Handelman and Lewis Glinert for their insights over the past year, and to Drs. F. J. Hoogewoud and Martin Kessler for introducing me to the work of Dutch scholars, kindred spirits in their approach to the biblical text."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Acknowledgements 9","Two scholars were particularly gracious as this project came to a close: Professor Marc Brettler, who shared with me the galleys of his fine study, <i>The Creation of History in Ancient Israel</i>, and suggested various materials relating to the book of Deuteronomy; and Professor Jeffrey Tigay, who permitted me to see a draft version of his major new commentary on Deuteronomy (to appear as the final volume of the <i>JPS Torah Commentary</i> series). In connection with the latter, I wish also to thank Dr. Ellen Frankel of the Jewish Publication Society for her quick and helpful response."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Acknowledgements 10","I continue to benefit greatly from my colleagues in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures at Clark University; their warmth and collegiality around issues of language, identity, and culture are a source of nourishment to me. I wish also to thank the university administration for faculty development funds that they provided me early in the process of translating the final three books."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Acknowledgements 11","I am grateful to many friends who over the years have followed my work with interest and encouragement. Chief among these is William Novak, whose meaningful support and advice have stretched from 1971 to the present."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Acknowledgements 12","I would like to thank my children, Akiva, Leora, and Ezra, who have had to put up with a father whose brain may often have seemed to be in another millennium. Most of all, I would like to acknowledge the help of my wife, Cherie Koller-Fox, who has seen this project through since 1971, and has had to live with my none-too-easy journey through this work. Our conversations on the text and categories of Leviticus in particular have helped immeasurably to clarify my thinking on biblical issues. <i>Now He Called</i> is for her, with love. Most recent thanks go to Rabbi Israel C. Stein, who has alerted me to citation mistakes in the notes and a number of other errors. I am deeply grateful to him for his close reading, and for the opportunity to make needed corrections."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Acknowledgements 13","Finally, praise to the One who has helped me survive, and sustained me, and brought me to this moment."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Suggestions for Further Reading 1",,"T<small>HE SECONDARY LITERATURE ON THE</small> F<small>IVE</small> B<small>OOKS OF</small> M<small>OSES, SINGLY AND AS A GROUP, IS IM</small>mense. Tradition-minded Jews and Christians will as a matter of course make use of ancient exegetes and their medieval successors to get a fuller understanding of specific words and passages. Much of this material is now available in English translation, whether of Midrashim, some of the medievals, the Church Fathers, or Luther. As far as modern commentaries go, here too the amount of material is vast. New works appear constantly (Tigay’s JPS <i>Commentary on Deuteronomy</i>, for instance, will be appearing in 1996), and a full listing of appropriate works would take up several volumes on its own. The reader is therefore advised to consult the solid and extensive bibliographies found in the major commentaries such as Speiser (1964), Childs (1974), Sarna (1986), Milgrom (1991), Levine (1993), Weinfeld (1991), and Tigay (1996). As mentioned below, there is also a wealth of material to be gleaned from the numerous recent reference works, such as the <i>Anchor Bible Dictionary</i>."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Suggestions for Further Reading 2",,"The list below, which cites mainly English-language works, is intended to supplement <i>The Five Books of</i> Moses in terms of interpreting the text, providing ancient Near Eastern background, biblical history, and a literary approach to the Bible. It makes no pretense at being comprehensive, but is selective, including both those works which I found stimulating and those which are referred to in the Commentary and Notes (cited there by author and, if there is more than one work by the author, by date). The abbreviation ‘’JPS,” which appears numerous times in the notes, refers to the New Jewish Publication Society translation, listed as <i>The Torah</i> below."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, The Hiring of Bil'am 1",Numbers 22:1-41
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, The Hiring of Bil'am 2","Faced with overwhelming evidence of Israelite superiority, especially as evinced in the previous chapter, the Moabite king Balak tries to vanquish the invaders via a means more powerful than force of arms: a sorcerer’s curse. The first part of the story is memorable in its vivid characterization, use of theme words, and comic thrust. The central personalities have suggestive names: Balak sounds like a verb that means “to destroy,” Bil’am suggests “swallower” (hence destroyer), and Be’or, present only as the name of the sorcerer’s father, also connotes “destroying.” The text uses two different words for “curse,” soon to be joined by a third. The chapter introduces key themes of the story: “honor,” which Bil’am will refuse in the overwhelming face of God’s truth; “once again,” through which it becomes clear that, for God, “once [refusal of permission for Bil’am to go] is once-and-for-all,” and God’s blessing, once given, will not be rescinded (Rosenzweig 1994); and the emphatic refrain that, as noted above, in one form or another will echo throughout the story, “whatever God tells me, that (alone) must I speak/do.” Most memorable, of course, is the sequence about the talking donkey, which must have been more than a little amusing to ancient audiences. For here we have a dumb animal who sees divine messengers and possesses the divine gift of speech, contrasting with a prophet—who in Israelite thinking was supposed to be distinguished by his abilities as “seer” and mouthpiece of God—who sees nothing and raises his voice only to complain."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Bil'am's First Visions 1",Numbers 23:1-30
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Bil'am's First Visions 2","Having been granted permission to hire himself out to Balak, but with the caveat that he may speak only God’s word, Bil’am prepares to curse Israel. But his “encounters” with God leave not the slightest doubt of the outcome; curse is turned to blessing, despite all the correct ritual preparations and previous promises of payment for services rendered. One almost has the impression of a seance gone wrong. And, professionally speaking, hired prophets are supposed to tell kings what they want to hear."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Bil'am the Prophet 1",Numbers 24:1-25
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Bil'am the Prophet 2","Few moments in the Torah, to my thinking, can compare with what now happens in this story. The description of Bil’am’s transformation in the opening verses is matched and even surpassed by what happens to the poetry of this section. From v.3 on, we are treated to an elevation and intensification of poetic language, beginning with the rhythmic opening lines and continuing through the pregnant Middle Eastern imagery of trees and water."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Final Rebellion; Apostasy 1",Numbers 25:1-18
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Final Rebellion; Apostasy 2","A tale ostensibly meant to establish the permanent status of the Aaronide priesthood, this chapter has another important structural function. As the last section of Part II (at least as I have laid out the book’s structure), it prevents the wilderness traditions from ending on an up note. The Bil’am cycle with its exalted poetry would have made a positive conclusion, but the editor does not wish us to forget the basic facts of Israel’s wilderness experience: dissatisfaction, complaint, and rebellion. Here we end with the ultimate rebellion, the moment of serious unfaithfulness in the “marriage” between God and Israel."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Final Rebellion; Apostasy 3","Like his grandfather Aharon in Chap. 17, Pin’has is able to stay the plague from God, albeit not through peaceful means. His action here recalls the killing spree of the Levites at the Golden Calf incident, another major apostasy (Wenham). The text goes out of its way to name also specific offenders; the Moabite woman who is remembered for evil is, in fact, the daughter of a chieftain."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part II; The Rebellion Narratives, Final Rebellion; Apostasy 4","The horrifying details of Pin’has’s act remind the reader once again that, for the biblical writers, idolatry was the worst of all crimes. The books to follow, starting with Deuteronomy, will make this abundantly clear."

It is concerned, then, with the transfer of leadership from Moshe to Yehoshua (Joshua); with provisions for two and a half tribes to remain on the east bank of the Jordan River, as long as they take part in the impending invasion; with listing the entire route of the Israelites, from Egypt to the plains of Moab; and with the borders of the land to be conquered."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest 3","As has been the case earlier in the book, however, other material intervenes: a theme and variation doublet on the inheritance of land in a case where a man leaves daughters, not sons; two chapters on what sacrifices are to be brought on holy days; a section on vows taken by women; war with Midyan and the precise apportioning of spoils, both to warriors and to the sanctuary; and the law regarding accidental homicide, in which family vengeance is circumvented by the existence of “safe” Levite towns to which the manslayer may flee."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest 4","The inconsistent thematics may again be explained by the intrusion of an editorial hand, again by priestly interests. In Levine’s view, most of Chapters 25–36 function to establish matters of importance in the priestly view, just as in Chapters 1–10. Here law takes precedence over narrative."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest 5","Despite the varied subject matter of this section, it holds together structurally, via the common biblical technique of word (sound) repetition. The rather common verb <i>tzivvah</i>, “command,” weaves through every one of Chapters 26–36, except for 33. Sometimes it introduces what God wants the Israelites to do; sometimes it leads to the formula of fulfillment, “as YHWH commanded the Children of Israel, so they did”; still other times it refers to a command given by Moshe himself. The entire section begins with the verb (26:4), and ends with it as well (36:13). In addition, the chapters most far afield, 28–29 (taken as a unit) and 30, begin and end with it. Whether this was a conscious technique by redactors is hard to say, but its existence is striking."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest 6","Another structural device, that of framing, also occurs in this part of the book: after the introductory census (Chap. 26), the rest is built between two brackets, each involving the daughters of Tzelofhad, and each opening with the verb “to come-near” (27:1 and 36:1). So despite the wide-ranging material, some sense of unity has been imposed upon it."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest 7","Finally, there is the key occurrence, for the book of Numbers, of more lists, from census to holiday sacrifices, from stops along the journey to the precise borders of the Promised Land. We are in the presence of order once again."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest 8","What remains lacking at the end of the book is exactly what Deuteronomy supplies: a final exhortation from Moshe, which includes reiteration and further clarification of the laws, a public covenant ceremony, Moshe’s long blessing of the people, and the account of his death and burial. If added here, these topics might have tipped the scales of Numbers, which has given us almost too much to digest as it is; as the Torah has come down to us, they are more appropriately treated in the expansive and majestic rhetorical setting of Deuteronomy."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, New Census 1",Numbers 26:1-65
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, New Census 2","Out of the chaos of the wilderness, the element of order is reintroduced as we meet the new generation—which will conquer at least part of the land of Canaan. These children of slaves are now mustered, in the same tribal order as the census in Chap. 1. The purpose of the counting is set forth in vv.52–56: so that the Promised Land may be properly divided up, according to population. True to the scheme of Chap. 1, the Levites go through their own census (vv.57–62)—since they receive designated towns but not a large mass of land. The ending verses assure us that the census in this chapter does not include anyone of the Exodus generation, excluding Calev and Yehoshua. Thus we are on new ground."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, A Case of Inheritance; Daughters of Tzelofhad I; The Passing of Leadership 1",Numbers 27:1-23
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, A Case of Inheritance; Daughters of Tzelofhad I; The Passing of Leadership 2","If the land is to be apportioned by tribe, the question of inheritance becomes a major one for the future. In that vein, the text, in almost Talmudic fashion, brings a case with some difficulties: What if a father dies without sons but does leave daughters—may they inherit the ancestral land, given the context of a patriarchal society? Moshe is unable to solve the problem, but must leave it up to God, who rules that not only daughters but other relations as well may serve to keep the land in the family (an attendant question, how to keep land within a tribe’s territory, will be answered in Chap. 36). This section of the chapter is a good example of a law embedded in a narrative, or a narrative created for the sake of a law. It also has the effect of showing that the divine promise of land is about to be fulfilled, that all tribes must be included in the process, and that the growing biblical tradition allows for reinterpretation (Olson)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, A Case of Inheritance; Daughters of Tzelofhad I; The Passing of Leadership 3","From v.12 on, we are reminded that Moshe is about to die. In an expansive speech (vv.18–21), God designates Yehoshua as Moshe’s successor, and publicly the aging leader transfers authority to him. Given the structure of Part III of the book, which is bracketed by daughters of Tzelofhad sections, we might expect Moshe’s death to parallel the passage here, and thus come at the end of Chap. 36. But that will not be the case; his death is left for the end of the entire Torah, in Deuteronomy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, Festival Offerings 1",Numbers 28:1-29:39
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, Festival Offerings 2","With Chaps. 28–30 we return to a recurring phenomenon in the book of Numbers: the intrusion of priestly material. We would expect 28 and 29, which form a logical unit and enumerate the sacrifices brought on holy days, to be properly placed in Leviticus. In fact, Lev. 23 does set out a sacred calendar. The purpose of that passage, however, was to indicate the overlay of the holy on the cycle of the year; the material here neither creates the calendar itself nor has anything to do with either voluntary offerings or those brought for expiation of sin. It may have been inserted at this point, in this book, because in its drawn-out, formulaic rhetoric, it has the character of a list such as we often find in Numbers. Part III of the book is a logical setting for it, given that it concentrates on the “pilgrimage-festivals” that fit a settled, agricultural context, and these chapters deal with various issues arising from Israel’s immanent possession of the land."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, Festival Offerings 3","Interesting is the addition of the New Moon festival (vv.11ff.), not mentioned in Lev. 23. It was apparently a serious holy day, although the Bible does not forbid work on it. The New Moon fits in the general layout of the chapter, which is, first, according to frequency of sacrifice and then to calendar (Milgrom)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, Vows and Women 1",Numbers 30:1-17
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, Vows and Women 2","Taking its verbal cue from 29:39, this chapter focuses on the binding nature of vows, especially as regards women, whose legal status was typically bound up with that of their fathers or husbands (unless they were widows or otherwise adult and single; cf. Wegner 1988). In this respect it continues the priestly concern with women, who do not always fit the priestly categories as neatly as that class might have wished. The length of the chapter signals the importance, or rather the sacredness, of an oath in ancient Israel; it stood as uttered unless an annulment procedure was followed. Human words, and not only divine ones, were seen as having effects in the real world."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, Vows and Women 3","The chapter is built around repeating words, such as “vow,” “bind,” “establish,” “annul,” and “silent.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, War against Midyan 1",Numbers 31:1-54
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, War against Midyan 2","We return to preconquest war traditions, such as we encountered in Chap. 21. It is as if God permits Moshe a taste of conquest before he is to be “gathered to [his] kinspeople” (v.2). And it is unfinished business that he takes up here, since the Midyanites had been identified as the ones who lured the Israelites to sin at Baal Pe’or (25:16–18). Also notable in this long chapter is the detailed account of dividing the spoils (vv.25–54); this is both characteristic of Numbers, as a list, and an indication of an important issue that will need attention once the conquest proper proceeds. It also may be an indication of a later tradition; Levine sees in the allotment of spoils for sanctuary income a characteristic royal policy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, War against Midyan 3","The cruel aspect of this war, while not unusual by ancient standards, feels jarring to modern Jewish and Christian readers, who perhaps expect the Bible to be more peace-oriented. It is not, although it often “seeks peace,” and there are passages (e.g., Deut. 20 and 21:10–14) where an attempt is made to mute some of the harsh realities of ancient warfare."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, War against Midyan 4","Niditch has pointed out that this chapter presents an ideology of war slightly different from some other biblical accounts. The term “devote-to-destruction” is not used; virgin girls, who are not yet of the status of “the enemy,” are spared; and war is seen as a ritually defiling activity, i.e., contact with death. In other words, the text exhibits some ambiguity about war, which must then be dealt with via purifying rituals."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, The Two and a Half Tribes 2","Although most biblical traditions place the Promised Land west of the Jordan River, Numbers includes an unusual request by the tribes of Reu’ven, Gad, and half of the tribe of Menashe: Since they are shepherds, and have heard of the fertile grazing area east of the river, they wish to remain on the east bank. Moshe accedes to their wish, provided that they assist their fellow Israelites in conquering Canaan proper. The historical result of this settlement—which gives us a taste of settlement before the larger conquest in the book of Joshua—seems to have been a checkered one, with Moabites and Ammonites reclaiming land at various subsequent periods."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, The Two and a Half Tribes 3","Milgrom has demonstrated how the chapter is built by a select vocabulary of words repeated seven times; the whole may be summarized by the composite statement “If Gad and Reuben cross over as vanguard [Heb. <i>h-l-tz;</i> see below) before Y<small>HWH</small>, they will receive the land holdings (they desire).” The sevenfold “before Y<small>HWH</small>” of the chapter drums in the participation of the divine in the conquest (Milgrom also brings up the possibility that it suggests the Coffer’s presence at the battle)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, The Wilderness Marches 1",Numbers 33:1-56
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, The Wilderness Marches 2","Another list in the book of Numbers traces the full journey of the Israelites from Egypt—as the Egyptians are still burying their firstborn dead!—to a spot opposite Jericho by the Jordan. It would of course be ideal if we could map out the route, but the location of most of the places mentioned in the chapter has been lost over time. We are left with the rhythm of the place-names rather than a viable historical record."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, The Wilderness Marches 3","Vv.50ff. introduce a new note, appropriate in view of the preconquest situation. Before Moshe lays out the future borders of Israelite Canaan in the next chapter, he must warn his charges about the dangers of leaving the conquered peoples (and their religious culture) settled in the land. This concern is typical of Deuteronomy, and figures in later history (cf. Judg. 1), where the apparent failure to do what is demanded here is understood as having led to idol-worship in Israel."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, Parceling Out the Land 1",Numbers 34:1-29
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, Parceling Out the Land 2","Again appropriate in the context, the postconquest borders of the Promised Land are laid out here. Milgrom, following Mazar, characterizes these boundaries as matching no historically verifiable Israelite territories, but rather the map of Canaan as an Egyptian province before the conquest. Be that as it may, the chapter ends with a list of representatives who will parcel out the land—another one of Numbers’s leadership lists."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, Levitical Towns of Asylum 1",Numbers 35:1-34
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, Levitical Towns of Asylum 2","As a kind of appendix to the previous chapter, and for a last mention of the Levites in Numbers, we are given what the Torah regards as an important innovation: the institution of the Towns of Asylum (or Refuge), whereby an accidental manslayer could avoid the expected blood vengeance of the dead person’s family. Greenberg (1959) has claimed that the specified towns probably were a substitute for what in other ancient Near Eastern societies was banishment; in his view, the idea of internal banishment presented here affirms the high and nonnegotiable value put on human life in the Bible—even when it is ended by accident. Be that as it may, the law in this chapter puts a brake on a reality of ancient life."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, Levitical Towns of Asylum 3","It is likely that the towns in question were previously sacred Canaanite towns, and Frick has raised the interesting possibility that from that special character or status may have evolved the concept of citywide asylum (and not just at the altar, a temporary measure)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, A Case of Inheritance; Daughters of Tzelofhad II 1",Numbers 36:1-13
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, A Case of Inheritance; Daughters of Tzelofhad II 2","To round out both Part III and the entire book, the text returns to issues of inheritance, brought up first in Chap. 27. The decision rendered here (that the daughters of Tzelofhad may inherit their father’s holdings, but that they must agree to marry within their tribe) ties the final loose end relating to the land, and so we are able to leave the wilderness narratives and laws with a sense that the future in the Promised Land is both assured and orderly. All that remains is for Moshe to die—but first he has a series of speeches to deliver to his charges of half a lifetime. These will be introduced by the opening verse of the next book, “These are the words/speeches ….”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Numbers, Part III; The Preparations for Conquest, A Case of Inheritance; Daughters of Tzelofhad II 3","Fishbane (1988) terms this chapter a “responsum,” that is, an authoritative answer to a legal question, and notes how the original intent of the law in Chap. 27—to allow women to inherit property in certain circumstances—has been “subverted” by the ruling here. That is, male relatives ultimately inherit the land, as though there were no daughters! Thus the process of “inner-biblical interpretation,” whereby already in the Bible itself passages are subject to later scrutiny and recasting, makes its appearance; it will be exemplified by much of the material in the next book, Deuteronomy."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 1",Deuteronomy 1-34
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2","D<small>EUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE</small> literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 3","An ancient name for Deuteronomy, <i>mishne tora</i>—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 4","From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 5","The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 6","Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 7","Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 8","But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright,"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 9",the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 10","It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 11","That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 <small>B.C.E.</small>) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 12",It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.”
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 13","The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the L<small>ORD</small>.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the L<small>ORD</small> for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the L<small>ORD</small> … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version)"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 14","What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 15","directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the L<small>ORD</small>. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the L<small>ORD</small>, to follow the L<small>ORD</small>, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3)"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 16","The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 17","The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 18","The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 19","In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century <small>B.C.E.</small>, which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 20","Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 21","Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of <i>one God</i> for <i>one people</i> in <i>one land</i> observing <i>one cult</i>” (italics his)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 37",D   The End (34)
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 38","A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 39","It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview 1",Deuteronomy 1:1–4:43
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview 2","I<small>N THIS INTRODUCTORY SECTION, WHICH SOME SCHOLARS HAVE VIEWED AS A LATER</small> addition to the core of the book, Moshe reviews the journey of the Israelites from Mount Sinai (“Horev”) into the Negev, and from there up east of the Dead Sea to a spot opposite Jericho. Two things make this more than a mere itinerary: First, Moshe confines himself to the most important moments—the choosing of leaders, the sending of the spies (with all its disastrous consequences), the encounters with various nations, and the provisions made for the soon-to-occur conquest. Second, the text characterizes itself, not as a narrative per se, but as an “explanation” (1:5) of the “Instruction.” In other words, history is made to function as lesson here. That the account ends with Bet (Baal) Pe’or in 3:29 is surely not accidental; as 4:3 reminds us, this was the site of Israel’s great apostasy, the final negative act by a wayward generation that was not to live to enter the land of Israel. By means of this introduction, the new generation is warned about the failings of the old, and begins to be prepared for “entering and taking-possession of the land” promised to their ancestors (4:1)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview 3","The first four chapters of the book establish its character as a link: by recounting key events in Israel’s wanderings, they summarize the narratives of Exodus and Numbers; by demonstrating that disaster resulted from the people’s rebellions, they set the ideology that will permeate the so-called Deuteronomistic History, namely the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings (Nelson)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview 4","It should be realized that these chapters are not merely previous narratives repeated verbatim. They are in fact reworkings of earlier material, often with changes. Thus, to use Brettler’s example, 1:9–18 retells Ex. 18:13–26, with the change that this time, as Moshe appoints lower-level leadership for the people, he does so without his father-in-law Yitro (who had helped in the Exodus version), and chooses them on the basis of their capabilities (“wisdom”), not their piety. Brettler also points to the frequent use of the phrase “at that time” as an indicator of later additions to the text. For a comprehensive discussion of how these opening chapters differ from earlier accounts, see Tigay."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Setting Out 1",Deuteronomy 1:1-46
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Setting Out 2","After the narrator’s brief introduction, which places the Israelites at the very borders of the Promised Land, Moshe’s words bring the Israelites from Sinai to Kadesh, in the southern part of the land. He begins with his own problem, the burden of leadership; but the bulk of the chapter functions to explain why the Israelites that came out of Egypt were not privileged to enter the land itself. Stylistically interesting is Moshe’s constant use of quotations—he cites God, himself, and the Israelites. The effect is to make the narrative vivid and also authoritative in tone (cf. Polzin 1980)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Encountering the Nations 1",Deuteronomy 2:1-3:22
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Encountering the Nations 2","Moshe’s narrative moves the people toward their present location, east of Jericho, detailing their disappointments and triumphs in meetings with the indigenous peoples of the area. The account begins tentatively, with Israel warned not to antagonize their “cousins,” the Children of Esav, but ends with a foreshadowing of the conquest of Canaan—the successful war-making of the two and a half tribes (cf. Num. 32) that received land east of the Jordan."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Moshe's Personal Plea 1",Deuteronomy 3:23-29
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Moshe's Personal Plea 2","Before Moshe begins his appeal to the people of Israel to keep the covenant, he recalls his fervent prayer to God to be allowed into the land himself, a prayer that is, of course, answered in the negative. This recollection raises the emotional stakes of what is to come; the bulk of the book is now established as Moshe’s last words."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Transition 1",Deuteronomy 4:1-40
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Transition 2","Moshe, having narrated Israel’s wilderness travels up to the spot where they are standing, now launches into the main set of speeches that characterize Deuteronomy’s style, a series of exhortations to the people to follow God’s laws. This section is connected to the previous material by its evocation of past events (the sin at Baal Pe’or and the revelation at Sinai/Horev), but it also points to the future, by means of its vision of exile and return. Not surprisingly, the words “hear/hearken,” “see,” “laws (and regulations),” and “command” are all key expressions; these become increasingly important in the chapters to follow."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Transition 3","Ironic is the repeated warning, which appears here for the first time, not to add anything to the Instruction. Yet Deuteronomy itself does just that. But, as we have noted above, by closing the Torah after the end of the book, Deuteronomy is able to introduce innovations with the force of tradition, and seemingly guard against further overt revision."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Transition 4","Levenson (1975) sees this section, along with material in chapters 28–32, as providing a framework for the book for the Israelite community in exile, suggesting that return to God is still possible through keeping the commandments laid out within the framework."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Towns of Asylum 1",Deuteronomy 4:41-43
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part I; Historical Overview, Towns of Asylum 2","In a brief passage that seems utterly out of place amid the deep rhetoric of this section, Moshe carries out a command he had received in Num. 35:9–34 to make sure that an accidental manslayer has a special place(s) to flee to from an avenging family. Perhaps this has been placed here because it is one of the few “laws and regulations” in the Torah whose observance is mandated on the east bank of the Jordan River—and hence is one of the few that Moshe personally gets to carry out."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation 1",Deuteronomy 4:44–11:32
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation 2","T<small>HIS SECTION OF</small> D<small>EUTERONOMY IS A LONG PERSONAL AND EMOTIONAL PLEA ON BE</small>-half of the leader. Its rhetoric has become famous, as have several passages noted below. It is in this section that Moshe appears in his most classic Deuteronomistic mode, urging the people on to follow God’s rules and warning them against violating the covenant."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation 3","Recurring phrases in the section include “Hearken O Israel,” “And now, O Israel,” “When I bring you into the land …,” and “take-care.” In addition, the word “love,” which as noted above carries the connotation of “loyalty,” is important in these speeches."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation 4","After a brief geographical introduction in vv.44–49, which parallels the opening of the book and which, in the eyes of many, once served as the book’s actual beginning, the section presents a version of the so-called Ten Commandments, and a short recapitulation of the circumstances surrounding their being given on Sinai. In that sense, Chapter 5 is a continuation of the historical overview of the beginning of the book."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation 5","Another famous passage here is in Chapter 6, where Israel is enjoined to “love” God, warned about what will happen if they abandon him, and given a kind of script as answer to their children’s future question, “What (mean) the precepts, the laws and the regulations that Y<small>HWH</small> your God has commanded you?” (v.20)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation 6","Other important themes appear in these speeches. Israel is defined as a people that is not to intermarry with the indigenous peoples of Canaan; as a people chosen, not for its military power or large population, but because God “loved” them, and because he could not abide the Canaanites’ behavior. To prove his point that Israel possesses no inherent superiority, Moshe turns again to history, and retells the story of the Molten Calf (Ex. 32–34)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation 7","He ends (in Chap. 11) by reiterating the motif of God’s power and hence his ability to reward faithfulness with the gift of the good land. Israel is promised blessing and not curse, provided that they “take-care to observe” the laws which are now to be set before them."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Basic Rules 1",Deuteronomy 4:44-5:30
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Basic Rules 2","After a brief introduction, the text appears to begin the sequence of “laws and regulations” with the Ten Commandments. The latter, however, are quoted from Sinai (albeit in slightly altered form), and we are justified in viewing them, just as their counterpart in Ex. 20, as a kind of preamble to the laws themselves. They may even function as a narrated piece amid the pleas of Moshe. At any event, Chap. 5 uses key words we have previously encountered—“speak,” “command,” “hear”—but puts major emphasis on variations of the root “live.” The message would seem to be that those who heard God speaking at Sinai miraculously survived, and now will survive into the long term if they keep God’s covenant which he presented at the mountain."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Basic Rules 3","The Ten Commandments, of course, form a cornerstone of Western civilization—although a glance at them will reveal that they have not been very well followed over the past two millennia. But their language and their message remain an ideal. They served for a time as part of Jewish liturgy, but were ultimately removed from the Prayer Book out of fear that it would be thought that ten rules were the limit of one’s obligations to God."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Basic Rules 4","As in Chap. 4, where the audience is warned not to add anything to the revealed Instruction, Chap. 5 also reminds them that nothing was added at Sinai."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Centrality of Education 1",Deuteronomy 6:1-25
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Centrality of Education 2","Deuteronomy places particular emphasis on transmitting the meaning and practice of the laws. Crucial here is the concept that constant recital of key ideas and experiences, and making sure to pass them on to new generations, will insure the observance of the commandments and hence Israel’s good life on the promised soil. “Command” is the frequently used key word; the central passage is the so-called <i>Shema</i> (“Hearken [O Israel]”), already used in ancient times as both the core prayer in daily Jewish liturgy and the cry of martyrs (it is used as well as a prayer for retiring at night and as the core of the deathbed confession). Here memory is the key: the experience of slavery in Egypt, Israel’s trying behavior in the wilderness, and, above all, the constant rescuing grace of God. The idea that there should be constant reminders of the covenant became a staple of Jewish ritual practice, from the early education of children in the biblical text, to the <i>tefillin</i> (see below) worn in daily prayer, to the <i>mezuza</i> (a small box containing passages from Deuteronomy) on the doorpost. All three are mentioned in vv.7–9."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Centrality of Education 3","Vv. 5–9 have an oral, liturgical ring to them, with the tenfold repetition of the sound <i>ekha</i> (“your”). A good many sections of Deuteronomy in fact utilize this style, providing the book, despite its emphasis on the phenomenon of writing, with a distinctive sound."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, Israel and the Canaanites 1",Deuteronomy 7:1-26
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, Israel and the Canaanites 2","An important part of Israel’s self-understanding in Deuteronomy, as elsewhere in the Torah, is separation from other peoples—particularly from the inhabitants of the land they are to conquer. This chapter emphasizes the absolute avoidance of the Canaanites which the Israelites are to practice (it begins and ends with “devotion-to-destruction,” a kind of ritual ban or confiscation). The violence on the part of Israel spoken of in the opening verses, and the destruction wrought by God in the closing lines, frame a middle section that speaks of God’s “love” and “loyalty” toward Israel—again, in the mode of an ancient Near Eastern overlord. The emotional tone of the chapter strongly suggests a period of intense nationalism."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Land 1",Deuteronomy 8:1-20
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Land 2","Moshe now recounts the past—God’s care of Israel in the wilderness (the opening chapters stressed other aspects), in order to set up expectations for the future life of the people in the Promised Land. The reference to the past is to insure that Israel not attribute its success and happiness in the land to their own prowess; otherwise they will disappear like the peoples they are replacing."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Land 3","Appearing here, as it does frequently elsewhere in the Bible, is the idea of the “merit of the Fathers”—the concept that God is beneficent and forgiving toward the Israelites chiefly owing to the deeds of their ancestors. It survived as a key idea in classical Judaism."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Calf Incident 1",Deuteronomy 9:1-11:32
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, The Calf Incident 2","Continuing the argument of the last chapter—that Israel should take great care to remember who it was that led them—Moshe makes pointed reference to the great rebellion that took place at the foot of Sinai itself: the incident of the Golden (“Molten”) Calf in Ex. 32–34. In this he is recapitulating the rhetoric of the opening chapters of the book, as well as of the great poem in Chap. 32, which utilize the past to inform the future. The calf incident, in fact, paves the way for the passages that immediately follow."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, Concluding Exhortation 1",Deuteronomy 10:12-11:32
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part II; Opening Exhortation, Concluding Exhortation 2","To conclude his long introduction to the laws, Moshe returns to the theme of Y<small>HWH</small>’s love for Israel, expanding it to include Israel’s duty to love the stranger and also to love God. Once again the past is invoked, especially those parts of it that focus on God’s might. The intimate connection between people and land is stressed through Moshe’s wonderful description of Canaan (vv.11–12), and the polarity of blessing and curse rounds out his plea—just as a long blessing/curse cycle will round out the whole book in Chaps. 29 and 30. In fact, Chap. 11, both in its beginning (“you are to keep his charge, his laws, his regulations and his commandments”) and its ending (“you are to take-care to observe all the laws and the regulations that I place before you today”), form a fitting lead-in to the long sequence of laws that is about to commence."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant 1",Deuteronomy 12–28
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant 2","A<small>fter lengthy exhortation we are brought at last to the heart of Deu-</small> teronomy. Just as its corresponding Exodus section, Chapters 19–24, stands at the center of that book, and Gen. 22, Lev. 19, and Num. 19–20 place dramatic narratives or important laws at their core, the laws that we now encounter focus our attention on the object of Moshe’s main concern in Deut. 1–11 and 27–30: the “covenant” or pact between God and Israel. Israel is to demonstrate its love or loyalty to God by “taking-care to observe” the laws, and binds itself in a ceremony, at least in descriptive form, at the end of the section."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant 3","The subject matter of this long collection forms an interesting contrast to both the Covenant Code of Exodus (in the chapters just referred to) and other law collections in the ancient Near East. The Exodus material contains much that deals with property and damages, whereas Deuteronomy appears to focus more heavily on criminal and moral issues. Although neighboring civilizations had legal literature that parallels many of the cases before us (cf. Hallo for a discussion), Deuteronomy’s particular emphases suggest a shift away from personal property as the central area of society’s concern (Greenberg 1970). In addition, the biblical text here (as previously in the book) is generally cast in the second person singular, giving it a highly personal edge, and there is a higher percentage of “motive clauses”—explanations or justifications for the laws—than in other Near Eastern law codes. Sonsino has noted a strong similarity between the language of these chapters and the thrust of biblical “wisdom literature” such as the book of Proverbs; thus a major function of the material may well be didactic and not legal per se. This, interestingly, puts Deuteronomy more squarely within its Near Eastern setting; Fishbane (1988) characterizes both sets of systems as “stylized collections of typical cases.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant 4","Yet he also argues that whatever the original purpose of the laws in Chapters 12–26, they came already within the biblical period itself to be seen as actual “legislative texts,” and as such, subject to later interpretation much as any law code might spawn (this multiple function of the laws was noted by Weinfeld 1972a). In this connection it is clear that new attitudes have been adopted and changes made in specific cases. It is usually accepted that Deuteronomy has introduced a markedly humanistic tone into Israel’s legal system; in Weinfeld’s words (1993):"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant 5","… the author’s purpose was not to produce a civil-law book like the book of the covenant, treating of pecuniary matters, but to set forth a code of laws securing the protection of the individual and particularly of those persons in need of protection."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant 6",Some of the changes from earlier laws are noted in the Commentary and Notes below.
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant 7","Nelson has divided the laws into the following sections: Purity in Worship (12:1–14:21); Life in the New Land (14:22–16:17); The Structures of Society (16:18–20:20); and Interpreting Traditional Laws (21:1–26:19). In his view, the changes introduced into Israel’s legal culture are responses to changes in Israelite society, whether economic, political, or religious—changes that may well reflect the monarchic period. The attempt to find a logical pattern to the structure of the laws, however, does not always succeed. Levinson has shown how a better understanding of the sequencing of the laws may be found in the principle of response to the centralization of worship, the event that historically may have accompanied Deuteronomy’s promulgation. In this scheme, 12:1–16:17 is above all a response to how centralization affected the cultic (sacrifical worship) sphere, and 16:18–17:13 to how judicial process was similarly affected. At the same time, these changes appear to be woven into older material."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant 8","The phrase “And Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying: / Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them: …,” so common in the legal and cultic sections of Leviticus and Numbers, does not appear here. Neither does it appear in the Covenant Code; but in the context of Deuteronomy, the absence of the phrase supports the emphasis on Moshe as the central figure (in Exodus the legal portions are followed by the Tabernacle instructions, which indeed use the quoted formula)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant 9","Chapter 12 begins with “These are the laws and the regulations that you are to take-care to observe”; Chapter 28 ends with “These are the words of the covenant ….” As in Exodus, the laws are the terms of the covenant, not merely a set of rules to be followed. This is further supported by the framework into which these chapters have been placed. The first two parts of the book serve as a classic ancient Near Eastern introduction to a treaty, with their historical look back. In addition, the section ends with both a covenant ceremony (Chap. 27) and a series of blessings and curses (28), also typical in this genre. So far from being merely a dry list of laws, the core of Deuteronomy, with its reasoned tone and wide-ranging scope, serves both as a summing-up and as a basis for Israel’s life on the land. No wonder, then, that the exiles returning from Babylonia under Persian rule in the sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small> and later came to view the Torah as a real constitution."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, On Worship and Meat Eating 1",Deuteronomy 12:2-31
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, On Worship and Meat Eating 2","The extended section on laws begins with what sounds like a reference to Josiah’s reform—the smashing of idols, the abolition of the “high-places” (the pagan shrines which dotted the ancient landscape of Canaan), and the centralization of the cult in the place that “God chooses to have his name dwell.” Since this emphasis is central to the program of Deuteronomy in its final form, it is not surprising that it appears first in the legal section of the book—rather like the opening of the laws in Exodus 21–23, which centers around the situation of one of its central concerns and images, the slave (Levinson). A logical result of the centralization of the cult is the need to permit the eating of meat in local sites; previously it had been permitted only at the Dwelling (cf. Lev. 17), the portable sanctuary. But the old prohibition against eating blood, as symbolic of the life, is upheld."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, On Worship and Meat Eating 3","Vv.29–31, which mark a transition to the next chapter, round out Chap. 12’s stern proscription of improper worship—“indeed, even their sons and daughters they burn with fire to their gods!” (31)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, On Worship and Meat Eating 4","Christensen (1986) notes a stylistic peculiarity of this chapter which is typical of Deuteronomy: a shift between second person plural and singular. While others have tried to use this phenomenon to point to evidence of editing, he sees it as a stylistic way of marking metrical sections of the chapter."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Leading the People Astray 1",Deuteronomy 13:1-19
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Leading the People Astray 2","The subject is various scenarios under which Israelites might be lured to worship other gods; it has first been broached in Ex. 22:19, and will return in Deut. 17:2–7. Vv.2–6 deal with a religious visionary, 7–12 with a relative (both of whom seek to turn the Israelites to idols), and 13–19 with a whole town that has abandoned the covenant in favor of other gods. In all three cases, the penalty is death, with the chapter building up the sentences into a crescendo of destruction in vv.16–19. The opening verse of the chapter forms a fitting superscript for the bulk of the laws, and hints that Deuteronomy is a kind of final, closed, “canonical” dispensation."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Holiness 1",Deuteronomy 14:1-29
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Holiness 2","Chap. 14 looks back to a major priestly concern. Indeed, the word “holy” appears in v.2, just as it did in conjunction with Israel the “special treasure” (mentioned here as well) in Ex. 19:5–6. Holiness includes banning Canaanite practices regarding the dead, distinguishing between pure and impure animals, avoiding carcasses as a major source of ritual pollution, and following the rules concerning tithes. In regard to the latter, what seems to matter most in the text is not precisely what is due God—a narrowly religious concern—but rather the care one must take that the powerless members of society (sojourner, widow, orphan) are provided for—a much broader one."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Number Seven and the Matter of Debt 1",Deuteronomy 15:1-18
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Number Seven and the Matter of Debt 2","In Lev. 25, the Sabbatical year was explained in great detail, principally in regard to letting the land lie fallow. Similarly, the cycle of seven-times-seven years (plus one), the Jubilee (“Homebringing”) Year, was characterized as a time of land returning to its original owners. While the Leviticus text talks a good deal about poverty from v.35 on, most of it is about land and money. In Deuteronomy, on the other hand, the issue of the needy jumps to the fore from the beginning of the chapter, and remains central throughout. The result of such care is “blessing” from God, a theme word in the chapter."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Number Seven and the Matter of Debt 3","Vv.12–18 parallel Ex. 21:2–6, but utilize a more rational argument.

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Firstling 2","Linking up with the Passover passage that follows, this law combines the idea of the consecrated firstborn of animals with Deuteronomy’s new rules about eating sacrificial meat at home."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Firstling 3","Vv. 1–7, which deal with Passover, make clear how Deuteronomy reinterprets tradition in the light of its new program of centralization. As Levinson points out, this holiday, whose origin is clearly in the setting of the clan, is here broadened away from exclusive home observance and toward the sanctuary. To that end, animals other than lambs are now allowed to be sacrificed, and they may be boiled, not just roasted. In addition, the protective aspect of the animal’s blood, which was so central to the Exodus account, is de-emphasized."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Process of Judgment 2","Ancient Israel’s judicial process involved, not judge and jury, but elders or priests. In this setting, proper “inquiry” was crucial; the testimony of eyewitnesses was required in multiple; and priests provided a sort of appeals court, with their “instruction” serving as the final word on the case—on pain of death."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Process of Judgment 3","As part of the Deuteronomic program of centralizing authority, it should be noted that elders are replaced here by state officials in various matters of judgment (vv.8–11; see also 16:18) (Levinson)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Laws of Kingship 2","Deuteronomy here introduces a new note into the Torah, one which becomes familiar from I and II Samuel on. Ancient Israel had an interesting and at times ambivalent attitude toward monarchy: on the one hand, it viewed God as the sole king (cf. Judg. 8:22–23), and could roundly condemn monarchy’s excesses (cf. I Sam. 8:10–18). On the other hand, popular support for this common human institution was widespread in the face of the constant military threat, especially from the coast-dwelling and technologically superior Philistines. Once established, the monarchy was permanent."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Laws of Kingship 3","Our passage clearly demonstrates the controls on the institution desired by the biblical writers: limits on wealth and the stipulation that the king study God’s Instruction.

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Levites' Share 2","Their role established fully in the book of Numbers, the Levites functioned as assistants to their kinsmen, the priests, in a variety of capacities. In Deuteronomy, however, the Levite-priest distinction is not sharply drawn. As elsewhere, the Levites owned no land, and hence were supported by portions of various sacrifices and tithes."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Sorcery and False Prophecy 1",Deuteronomy 18:9-22
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Sorcery and False Prophecy 2","Picking up the theme of avoiding the magical practices of the Canaanites (cf. the briefer Ex. 22:17), the text continues into the topic of prophecy, which is viewed as the proper way to know the will of God. The safeguard against false prophecy, though—noting the nonfulfillment of the “prophet’s” word—was too shaky a basis for a stable system. Deuteronomy as a whole has a better overall answer than the one it gives here: it establishes the text as the authority, a process that the book appears to have inaugurated and that became central to the three Western religions."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Sorcery and False Prophecy 3","The passage on sorcery (vv.9–12) repeats “abomination” three times, to emphasize the Bible’s abhorrence of the practices enumerated here. This is not to imply that the Israelites did not believe in the efficacy of such phenomena; they simply viewed them as an unacceptable way of learning the divine will."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Witnesses 2","The need for multiple witnesses and proper inquiry establishes the seriousness of what is at stake in the justice system. In keeping with the biblical idea of “equity” (Heb. <i>tzedek</i>), that is, fairness and balance in judgment, a false witness suffers the same punishment as would have befallen the innocent person whom he accused. The “eye for an eye” punishment is thus to serve as a deterrent for a most abhorrent crime."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Laws of War 1",Deuteronomy 20:1-20
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Laws of War 2","As an example of Deuteronomy’s thinking and often humane approach, the rules of war have a reasoned tone compared even to the contemporary world. Many of them occur elsewhere in the ancient Near East. The first four verses stress the frequently appearing idea that God fights on the Israelites’ behalf. From there vv.5–7 help to maintain the values of an agricultural society by keeping new builders, new planters, and newlyweds at home for a while. Added to this are considerations of troop morale (vv.8–9), offers of peaceful surrender terms (10–11), and the end results of siege as commonly portrayed in the ancient world (12–14). A different outcome is to be striven for in the case of the native Canaanites, who are to be wiped out, that Israel not be led astray into their “abominable” practices (16–18). The latter passage, especially since it is followed by an ecologically compassionate one about fruit trees, seems genocidal and hence morally unacceptable today. Clearly it stems from a zealous time and strong feelings; whether it was carried out as described we do not know. Medieval Jews solved the problem of moral sensibilities for themselves by defining the Canaanites as long dead with no contemporary successors. But the troubling nature of the text remains."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Unsolved Murder 2","Another memorable addition to Israel’s law corpus, the case described here stands in stark contrast to the way things are done in contemporary society For us, an unsolved murder is a matter of intellectual curiosity, a puzzle to be unraveled on a television screen; in biblical Israel, innocent blood had to be atoned for by the entire group when the perpetrator went unfound. In the biblical view (as in that of other ancient societies), crime or wrongdoing was seen as completely disruptive, a threat to the well-being of the very cosmos. Here atonement is made via a public confession and the death of an animal—not with the usual “decontaminating” use of sacrificial blood but with a death that symbolically atones for the death of the murder victim."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Fair Captive 2","The situation of the female captive recalls the opening chapters of the <i>Iliad</i>, where it forms a key motif. Here, though, rather than the pride and anger of great warriors being at stake, it is the woman’s humanity that is central. She is allowed to mourn her family, and retains her dignity to the extent that she cannot be sold as a slave if her husband eventually rejects her."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Wives and Sons 2","A tension that is played out in the Jacob and Joseph stories in Genesis, the conflict between two wives and their sons must have been a troubling reality in the polygamous ancient Near East. This could be conventionally solved by a father’s selection of the “firstborn,” but note the brake put on the father’s absolute control (Frymer-Kensky 1992a)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Rebellious Son 2","Part of creating any ordered society involves continuity between the generations. Even so, this law seems to us to be “cruel and unusual punishment.” It becomes more understandable in the context of Deuteronomy’s transfer of power from parents (who have a choice here to report their son) to elders, that is, to society at large (see Marcus). The behavior of this son is regarded as a threat, not only to his family, but to the entire community (Frymer-Kensky 1992a). The law may also be, in its intensity, a reflection of the God-Israel relationship (see Psalms 78:8, Jer. 5:23) (Greenstein, personal communication)."

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Damaged Wife 3","Virginity for women at marriage was an important value in ancient Israel as elsewhere. Frymer-Kensky (1992a) notes that this case parallels the one of the rebellious son above: the parents’ status and welfare is jeopardized; the parents can bring about the child’s death; and the elders have the authority to make a ruling, while the public has the power to put the offender to death."

Here the law provides for the widow of a man who dies without heirs to provide one, through the institution of “levirate marriage”—whereby the man’s brother marries her, and the subsequent offspring bears the deceased brother’s name.

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Declaration of the Farmer 1",Deuteronomy 26:1-15
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Declaration of the Farmer 2","In a climactic set of ceremonies, those who work the land are to acknowledge God’s ownership of the soil. Through the offering of firstfruits, the memory of the Exodus and the gift of the land are kept immediate—“I have entered the land” (v.3). The descendants’ rootedness in “a land flowing with milk and honey” (9) is made to contrast with the ancestors’ wandering. This characterization of the land, and thanksgiving for its produce, is reiterated in the brief section about tithes (12–15). Thus the land is not taken for granted, and Israel celebrates, not the sexuality of the gods as the source of the soil’s fertility, but rather the gift of a God who has intervened in human history."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Declaration of the Farmer 3","This chapter is a fitting end to the sequence of laws in Deuteronomy; emphasizing the gift of the land (as Buber 1982 points out, “give” in various permutations occurs seven times) suggests that the gift may be revoked if the society does not uphold the covenant. Also notable is the sixfold use of the Hebrew root b-w-’(<i>bo</i>’), appearing here variously as “enter,” “produce,” “bring.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Summary 1",Deuteronomy 26:16-19
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, Summary 2","The chapter, and the laws proper, end with the general observation that a two-way covenant has been made, as in Ex. 19:5–6. The result takes a high nationalistic turn in v.19, which once again seems to fit primarily an age of monarchy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Covenant Ceremony 1",Deuteronomy 27:1-26
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Covenant Ceremony 2","As if to dramatize what has just concluded, the text at this point interpolates a ceremony that in location (Shechem) and theme anticipates what we find at the end of the book of Joshua (Chap. 24). It also encourages viewing Deuteronomy as a Northern document. Here the core is the series of curses uttered on Mount Eval in vv.15–26 (the blessings, curiously, do not appear). The curses, which do not introduce any new material as such, reflect the community’s fear that someone will sin in secret and not be found out, and the entire community will suffer as a result (Bellefontaine). The public pronouncement of threats was not unusual at the sealing of an agreement in the ancient Near East. As in previous legal sections, we are presented with a mixture of areas—criminal, sexual, and ritual—ending with the general provision that the “words of this Instruction” are to be carefully observed."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Consequences 1",Deuteronomy 28:1-69
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Consequences 2","Following the dramatic ceremony of Chap. 27, which, as an event placed in the future, feels somewhat artificial, is the more conventional listing of blessings and curses, parallel to Lev. 26. The latter functionally ends the book of Leviticus (Chap. 27 is obviously a kind of appendix), and our chapter here ends the long legal portion of Deuteronomy. A further parallel is the summary verses in each; Lev. 26 ends with “These are the laws, the regulations and the instructions that Y<small>HWH</small> gave / between himself and the Children of Israel at Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moshe,” while v.69 of our chapter is “These are the words of the covenant / that Y<small>HWH</small> commanded Moshe to cut with the Children of Israel / in the land of Moav, / aside from the covenant that he cut with them at Horev.”"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part III; The Terms of the Covenant, The Consequences 3","As is typical of this kind of literature, the curses seem to outweigh the blessings, not only in verse count (55 to 14) but in color of description as well. While later generations of Jews, horrified by the warnings of disaster, stipulated that this chapter be read in an undertone when it is a weekly public synagogue reading, it is fairly standard stuff in the context of ancient Near Eastern treaties."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 1",Deuteronomy 29–30
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2","T<small>HE FIRST TWO PARTS OF</small> D<small>EUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE</small> third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 3","This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 1",Deuteronomy 29:1-28
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 3","Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 1",Deuteronomy 30:1-20
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. <i>shuv</i> (“return / restore”)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 1",Deuteronomy 31–34
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2","A<small>S THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG</small> (E<small>XODUS THROUGH</small> D<small>euteronomy</small>) <small>ACCOUNT OF WAN</small>derings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 3","There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 4","This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36:"
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 5",Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia:

"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 1",Deuteronomy 31:1-30
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 3","It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, The Song of Moshe 1",Deuteronomy 32:1-43
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, The Song of Moshe 2","Especially in the ancient and medieval world, the death accounts of heroes tend to end with inspired visions. The inclusion of an ancient poem here is made to fit further into the context of Moshe’s exhortations in Deuteronomy—as a final warning to and witness against the people whom he has led. The “song” emphasizes the power and caring nature of God, which is contrasted with Israel’s pathetic response of unfaithfulness. God is likened to a nurturing parent and a protecting eagle; when Israel responds with idolatry, he turns into a destroyer. Much of this poem reminds one of other biblical literature, such as Psalm 78—also a reprise of Israel’s history. That poem is recited as a proof of God’s choosing the (southern) House of David; the political motivation behind Deut. 32, if there was one, is no longer clear to us."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, The Song of Moshe 3","Skehan notes that the number of verses in the song, 69, equals the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet (23) times three. Similar or related schemes appear elsewhere in the Bible, often in the form of acrostics (cf. Lamentations)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, The Song of Moshe 4","The song, which may predate Deuteronomy, may have been placed here as a traditional poem that meaningfully deals with catastrophe (Tigay). Despite the obscurity of some of its phrases, it stands as a witness to Israel’s self-understanding, albeit a negative one."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Some Final Words 1",Deuteronomy 32:44-52
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Some Final Words 2","Moshe’s last regular words to the people reiterate the theme of “life” noted earlier. On the other hand, God, at the end of Moshe’s life, cannot refrain from reminding him (and us) of the reason that the great leader may not enter the Promised Land (v.51)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, The Blessing of Moshe 1",Deuteronomy 33:1-29
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, The Blessing of Moshe 2","As if to balance Yaakov’s deathbed blessing of his sons at the end (Chap. 49) of Genesis, Moshe doubles his poetic vision and blesses Israel, tribe by tribe. The weighting of tribes is very different here from what it was in Genesis: Levi is quite strong, Shim’on has disappeared, and Yehuda, the tribe of David’s royal lineage, has a reduced role. Some scholars are therefore inclined to see a background of Northern ascendancy behind this poem, perhaps the days of Jeroboam II (early eighth century <small>B.C.E.</small>)."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, The Blessing of Moshe 3","For a useful comparison of this chapter with other tribal blessings in the Bible, see Plaut; for discussion of textual problems, Tigay is clear and helpful."
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, The End 1",Deuteronomy 34:1-12
"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, The End 2","Genesis concluded with the death of Yosef; Joshua will end with the death of the victorious general. Moshe’s passing provides the natural ending for the Torah; like that other great work of the first millennium <small>B.C.E.</small>, the <i>Iliad</i>, a funeral marks the end of the old generation and old circumstances. Israel, the narrated audience of the book of Deuteronomy, is now armed for what lies ahead, thanks to the leader’s orations that have comprised an entire book. The rhetorical force of Deuteronomy thus caps the stories, poems, and laws of Genesis through Numbers, and makes of the five books truly a “teaching” or Instruction."
