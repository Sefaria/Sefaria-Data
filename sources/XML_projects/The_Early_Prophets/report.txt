Joshua 2:12 -- footnote <b>Father’s House:</b> A social unit in ancient Israel, much like an extended family. not found.
Joshua 5:9 -- footnote 10–11 <b>sunset … Plains … yield:</b> Hawk (2000) notes the Hebrew play on words of the three nouns: <i>’erev … ’arevot … ’avur</i>. The main root signifies “crossing.” not found.
Joshua 9:23 -- footnote <b>servant:</b> See above note to 1:1. The Heb. <i>’eved</i> has a broad range of meanings, also including “vassal,” “slave,” and “worshipper” of a deity.  not found.
Joshua 12:4 -- footnote <b>southward:</b> Here, and in 13:, the text uses a different term for “south” (<i>teiman</i>).  not found.
Joshua 12:4 -- footnote <b>Pisga:</b> “Peak,” overlooking, from the east, the Jordan and indeed much of the land of Israel. The Bible marks it as the site of Moshe’s death.  not found.
Joshua 19:27 -- footnote 28–29 <b>Sidon … Tyre:</b> The inclusion of these key cities of Phoenicia (Heb. <i>Tzidon</i> and <i>Tzor</i>) betrays ideal rather than real boundaries on the part of the writer, as often happens in Joshua (Meyers 2004). not found.
Joshua 21:35 -- footnote 40–41 <b>these towns were … :</b> LXX adds text here about Yehoshua’s territory and the flint knives used for circumcision in Chap. 5. not found.
Joshua 24:4 -- footnote <b>Y<small>HWH</small></b> in the Bible.  not found.
Joshua 24:10 -- footnote 11–12 <b>they waged battle … :</b> Note that here, in contrast to the famous story in Chap. 6, the residents of Jericho put up a fight. So, as often happens in the Bible, two versions or traditions about an event appear in the same book. not found.
Judges 1:19 -- footnote <b>:</b> Missing in MT but present in some manuscripts. The restored text would then correspond to, for instance, Josh. 15:63, <i>lo’ yakhelu le-horisham.</i>  not found.
Judges 2:3 -- footnote <b>Josh.</b> 2:1 suggests that <i>tziddim</i> (“sides”) here may be short for “a whip in your sides” (Kimhi).  not found.
Judges 7:22 -- footnote <b>Bet-Shitta:</b> Location unknown; pronounced <i>bayt shee-TAH.</i>  not found.
Judges 7:22 -- footnote <b>border:</b> Lit. “lip,” used elsewhere for banks and shores. not found.

Judges 15:3 -- footnote 4–5 <b>So Shimshon went … :</b> The long string of verbs here, and in passages like 16:3, seems to reflect the hero’s precipitous action, so much a part of his character. <b>foxes:</b> It is not clear whether these or jackals are meant, as the distinction, sadly for me, is not always made in the Bible. Jackals, as social animals, would be more catchable in a naturalistic setting, whereas foxes, whose behavior is more solitary, suggest a miraculous, folktale background, perhaps more appropriate here. not found.
Judges 15:19 -- footnote <b>Ha-Korei:</b> This can also mean “the partridge,” likely the original signification of the name. The whole name is pronounced <i>AYN ha-ko-RAY.</i> not found.
Judges 16:17 -- footnote <b>all men:</b> Most translations from LXX on have “corrected” “all” to read “any” (<i>kol</i> to <i>ke-ahad</i>) as in the previous occurrences of the phrase. But the slight shift in wording here may give Delila a hint that Shimshon has cracked at last (see the double “<i>all</i> his heart” in the next verse). not found.
Judges 19:27 -- footnote <b>with her hands on the threshold:</b> A powerful and pathetic image of a victim who is unable to escape her tormentors and get inside the house, with no help forthcoming. Note that the text is reticent to reveal whether the woman is dead or alive at this point. not found.
I Samuel 1:2 -- footnote <b>Peninna:</b> Pronounced <i>pe-nin-NAH;</i> trad. English “Peninnah.” not found.
I Samuel 1:22 -- footnote <b>weaned:</b> Probably around the age of three. not found.
I Samuel 2:22 -- footnote <b>acting-as-a-workforce:</b> That is, serving at various tasks at the sanctuary.  not found.
I Samuel 2:31 -- footnote 32–33 <b>you will look … :</b> The text is unclear and difficult to reconstruct. not found.

I Samuel 6:3 -- footnote <b>reparation-offering:</b> Heb. <i>asham,</i> a biblical sacrifice, explained in Lev. 5 as financial restitution for wrong-doing, including unintentional actions. not found.
I Samuel 6:9 -- footnote 10, 12 <b>their young they shut up … lowing:</b> As Alter (1999) notes, the cows are forced to pull the Coffer against their natural inclination, which would be to suckle their young. Perhaps this detail underscores the power of the Coffer. not found.
I Samuel 7:1 -- footnote 3–4 <b>Astartes:</b> The main goddesses of Canaan, often referred to in the Early Prophets as the objects of the Israelites’ religious backsliding. They may also be terms used to denote local pagan gods in general (McCarter 1980). not found.
I Samuel 8:3 -- footnote 9, 11 <b>rule:</b> Or “practice.” I have followed Tsevat here in reproducing a pun in the Hebrew, where the stem <i>sh-p-t</i> can refer to both legal decision-making and leadership. not found.
I Samuel 9:5 -- footnote <b>Tzuf:</b> Shemuel’s home district.  not found.
I Samuel 9:24 -- footnote 25–26 <b>roof … :</b> The Hebrew is difficult here; once again, a chunk of text appears to be missing. not found.
I Samuel 12:3 -- footnote <b>crushed:</b> Or “mistreated, oppressed.”  not found.
I Samuel 17:28 -- footnote 29–30 <b>words:</b> Singular in the Hebrew. not found.
I Samuel 20:25 -- footnote <b>at-the-front:</b> Following LXX (reflecting <i>vykdm</i>); MT has <i>vykm,</i> “arose.” not found.
Ii Samuel 3:1 -- footnote 2–4 <b>Amnon … Avshalom … Adoniyya:</b> The three sons who will struggle for succession to David from II Sam. 13 to I Kings 2. None will ultimately survive to become king; that will fall to Shelomo (Solomon). Avshalom (<i>ahv-shah-LOME</i>) is trad. English “Absalom,” while Adoniyya (<i>ah-doe-nee-YAH</i>) is “Adonijah.” not found.
Ii Samuel 4:5 -- footnote 6–7 <b>And here … :</b> The Hebrew passage is confusing; I follow B-R. not found.
Ii Samuel 13:11 -- footnote 12–13 <b>such is not to be done … disgrace:</b> The same language is used in Gen. 34, the rape of Dina narrative. <b>vile thing … vile ones:</b> As in I Sam. 25; others understand as “foolishness … fools.” <b>he will not withhold me:</b> In order for her plea to have any force, such a thing must have been possible in royal society. Yet, as Sasson shows, it does not appear much outside of Egypt. He makes the intriguing conjecture that Tamar may have in fact been Avshalom’s daughter (see 14:27) and therefore Amnon’s niece, which would solve a number of the story’s problems. not found.
Ii Samuel 18:14 -- footnote 14–16 <b>thrust … sounded a thrusting-blast:</b> The Hebrew verb (<i>t-k-’</i>) is the same. not found.
Ii Samuel 20:11 -- footnote <b>Yoav … David:</b> Yoav’s servant in a sense restores his master’s standing by mentioning David in the same breath, even though Yoav has technically been replaced (Alter 1999).  not found.
I Kings 1:13 -- footnote <b>your handmaid:</b> An appropriate way for Bat-Sheva to refer to herself in court etiquette. not found.
I Kings 2:11 -- footnote <b>Hevron:</b> Pronounced <i>hev-ROHN;</i> trad. English “Hebron.” not found.
I Kings 4:19 -- footnote <b>Gil’ad:</b> Trad. English “Gilead.”  not found.
I Kings 9:13 -- footnote <b>brother: A</b> treaty term for an equal partner. not found.
I Kings 10:1 -- footnote <b>Sheba, Shelomo … she:</b> The Hebrew is even more alliterative, with <i>u-malkat sh’va shomaat et sheima shelomo le-sheim Y<small>HWH</small>.</i> I was tempted to use “shining-reports” in the translation, for that reason.  not found.
I Kings 11:31 -- footnote <b>ten … one:</b> See the note to v.13 above. LXX and other versions read “two” for the second number. not found.
I Kings 13:6 -- footnote <b>11 sons:</b> So LXX and other versions; MT uses the singular. The word may refer to disciples, not necessarily biological sons. <b>the man of God:</b> The anonymous prophet of the previous scene. not found.
I Kings 14:30 -- footnote <b>his mother’s name …</b> : This sentence is missing in LXX and Chronicles.  not found.
I Kings 14:30 -- footnote <b>Aviyyam:</b> Trad. English “Abijam.” Possibly a variation on “Y<small>HWH</small> Is My Father” (the alternative explanation, that Yamm, the Canaanite god of the sea, is included here, is unlikely).  not found.
I Kings 14:30 -- footnote <b>Avishalom:</b> A variant form of the name Avshalom (Absalom). If he is identical to the celebrated son of David from II Samuel, a more appropriate rendering of <i>bat</i> (here, “daughter”) would be “granddaughter.” not found.
Ii Kings 11:4 -- footnote 5–7 <b>guard the guarding:</b> An idiom for “keep guard.” not found.
Ii Kings 17:3 -- footnote <b>Shalman’eser:</b> Assyrian <i>Shalmanu asharedu</i>, “[The God] Shalman Is Exalted.” Sargon II is also mentioned in Assyrian records as the conqueror of Shomeron.  not found.
