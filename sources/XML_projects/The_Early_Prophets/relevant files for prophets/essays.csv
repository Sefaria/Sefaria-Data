"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part I; Preparations for Conquest",1,(1–5)
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part I; Preparations for Conquest",2,"<i>T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> J<small>OSHUA IS OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED WITH HOW THE</small> I<small>SRAELITES</small></i> came into the land of Canaan and, conquering its territory in battle, settled in it. But the writers had choices open to them, and elected to set the stage rather elaborately. The book begins by bringing leadership to the fore, through Y<small>HWH</small>’s charge to Yehoshua, in terms that vividly recall his predecessor, Moshe. The language is intensely Deuteronomistic, preparing the way for the entire four-book account of Israel’s history on its land. Also of immediate concern is the anomaly of two and a half tribes choosing to remain on the east side of the Jordan River, a problem solved, at least in the text, by their agreeing to fight with their brothers until the general conquest is over."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part I; Preparations for Conquest",3,"The text then appears to launch into military matters, with the account of the spies in Chap. 2. But this in fact serves as an opportunity to introduce two other important themes of the book: the natives’ terror of the Israelite God, whose reputation stemming from the events in the Exodus story has preceded him, and the survival of some Canaanites after the conquest, here in the person of the prostitute Rahav and her family."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part I; Preparations for Conquest",4,"What remains in this section is a series of events designed to bring the Israelites fully into the land as members of a newly created nation. It accomplishes this initially by means of a kind of ritual crossing of the Jordan, which is parted before the Israelites as the Reed Sea was in Exodus, minus the drowning enemy. Significantly, this narrative focuses on the holy Coffer (Ark) borne by the priests. Once the people as a whole have crossed over, a monument of stones is set up as a lasting memorial to the event. The people’s physical presence on the soil of the Promised Land, however, is not enough. The text proceeds to describe two dramatic acts which the people must accomplish in order to be fully Israelite. First, the new generation of males must be circumcised, and second, the people must observe the festival of Passover. With these prerequisites for inclusion in the nation fulfilled, the business of conquest may now proceed, with our attention initially turned back to the commander in chief. So the section ends with a fragmentary recommissioning of Yehoshua by a divine messenger, once again echoing the experience of Moshe in its language and imagery."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part II; Waging War",1,(6–12)
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part II; Waging War",2,"A<small>NCIENT</small> N<small>EAR</small> E<small>ASTERN KINGS TYPICALLY INSCRIBED INFLATED ACCOUNTS OF</small> their conquests on monuments and tablets. In the section of Joshua that is devoted to actual fighting, the book limits such language principally to one chapter (10), although traces appear in Chaps. 9 and 11–12, resembling what is found, for instance, in Assyrian inscriptions. More significantly, as I discussed in the Introduction, our text tends to play down the conquering role of the Israelites and their commander, keeping God and the covenant at the center of consciousness. Consequently, the vanquishing of Jericho does not come about as a result of the force of arms, and the victory at Ai can be won only after an Israelite offender has been punished for violating Y<small>HWH</small>’s rules of war, which had caused an initial defeat. Thus, of the seven chapters in this section, three focus directly on Israel’s relation to Y<small>HWH</small> instead of on straight military matters."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part II; Waging War",3,"The route taken thus far in Joshua moves due west, from the Jordan River crossing through Jericho to Ai, near modern Betin. At this point (Chap. 9), before the conquest moves forward, the Israelites are approached by the inhabitants of Giv’on, southwest of Ai, in a ruse that attempts to keep them out of armed conflict. Once the claim that they are poor and from far away is uncovered as deceit, and their future status as a subjugated people is established, the text turns to a major threat from an alliance of Canaanite kings (Chap. 10) who attack Giv’on. They are routed by the Israelite armies and driven west and then south all the way to Makkeda, a town probably to the west of Hevron. In the process, the text portrays the very heavens as aiding the Israelites (vv.12–14), with the sun and moon delaying their transit across the sky in order to allow time for the victory to take place. And the grisly death of the five enemy kings, normal enough in ancient Near Eastern practice, serves to presage the conquest that will follow."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part II; Waging War",4,"From here (v.29), the narrative settles into formulas, utilizing phrases such as “Yehoshua and all Israel crossed over,” “… and did battle with X,” “And Y<small>HWH</small> gave X into the hand of Israel,” “he struck it with the mouth of the sword,” “he left no survivor,” “just as he had done to the king of Y.” The geographical sequence in this extended part of Chap. 10 has been termed the “Southern Campaign” and involves towns situated principally in the lowlands (Heb. <i>shefela</i>) of Judah, with a swing at the end up into the highlands around Hevron."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part II; Waging War",5,"Chaps. 11 and 12 round out the picture, beginning with a victory in Upper Galilee (the “Northern Campaign”), continuing with an explanation of how, as Y<small>HWH</small> had done to Pharaoh in the book of Exodus, he makes the Canaanites’ heart “strong-willed” in order to hasten their destruction. It ends with an appropriate stylistic break: a list of conquered kings. Thus the account of the conquest is hardly uniform, and appears to have been composed from various sources."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part II; Waging War",6,"As scholars have pointed out, most of the action in the first twelve chapters of Joshua occurs in the territory of what became Benjamin, along with the sanctuary at Gilgal. Such geographic placement would seem to support the idea that northern traditions are principally at work here."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part III; Allotting the Land",1,(13–22)
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part III; Allotting the Land",2,"A<small>S MENTIONED EARLIER, THE BOUNDARIES LAID OUT IN THE FOLLOWING CHAP</small>ters appear to be idealized ones, painting a rosy picture of a twelve-tribe unity. The order of presentation is telling. After a general statement about land distribution, the text deals with the Philistine threat in the west and the trans-Jordanian territory to the east. The allotments of important tribes (Yehuda and Yosef), the respective bases of the future Southern and Northern Kingdoms, are then enumerated (Chaps. 14–15). This is followed by distribution for seven landowning tribes, then by the special case of the priestly tribe, Levi, and finally by a return to the troublesome issue of the land occupied east of the Jordan."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part III; Allotting the Land",3,"As the placement of these boundaries in the time of settlement is difficult to determine from the archaeological evidence, other scholars, such as Rainey/Notley, have suggested that in their present form they correspond to Shelomo’s (Solomon’s) administrative districts, some centuries after the events portrayed in Joshua. They also allow that such boundaries, at least in part, probably reflect older, established ones. More important is the fact that the text in this section of the book concentrates mainly on six tribes: Efrayim, Menashe, Binyamin, Zevulun, Asher, and Naftali—which, as Rainey/Notley notes, are the very ones summoned for battle by Devora (Deborah) in Judg. 6. So once again, the decidedly northern perspective in Joshua comes into play."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part III; Allotting the Land",4,"In the process of looking at the larger picture, we should not ignore the detailed description of boundaries that are so tempting for most modern readers to race through. These are significant not only for what they may tell us about ancient borders, but especially as a kind of legal language. Real estate deeds are always necessarily precise, and the seeming minutiae of land description in Joshua, even though they are incomplete in their present form (see below), may have had a similar function—staking out a claim, as it were, for later generations."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part III; Allotting the Land",5,"Alternatively, Hawk (2000), in an extensive discussion of the latter part of this section of Joshua, sees the boundaries as sometimes fragmentary and indistinct, as if to suggest an undercurrent of incompleteness in the conquest. By Chap. 21, he posits, Y<small>HWH</small> has held fast to his promises, but Israel’s actions in carrying out its task, especially in dividing up the northern part of the land, are less than ideal. This tension will be taken up again in the opening chapters of the next book, Judges, and permeates the Hebrew Bible in general."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part III; Allotting the Land",6,"The section begins by noting that Yehoshua is “old, advanced in years.” After the boundaries have been enumerated, the same theme and phrase will resume at the end of the book, in 23:1. Thus, almost half the Joshua text, Chaps. 13–22, presents itself as an insertion into the narrative. This is a common occurrence in the Bible (see, for example, Exod. 25–31, which is bracketed by passages laying out laws of the Sabbath) and is further evidence of a complex history for our texts."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part III; Allotting the Land",7,"Finally, it should be noted that the style of this half of the book seems to reflect different kinds of ancient, perhaps archival lists, with some including names of towns, as in the case of the two and a half Transjordanian tribes, and others, notably Efrayim and Menashe, mentioning borders only (Wazana 2011). And the tenses are sometimes “timeless” (Nelson)."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part IV; Last Words",1,(23–24)
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part IV; Last Words",2,"I<small>N THE SPIRIT OF</small> D<small>EUTERONOMY</small> (<small>SEE</small> M<small>OSHE’S FINAL SPEECHES TO THE</small> I<small>SRAEL</small>ites, Chaps. 32–33) and also of Genesis (Chaps. 49–50, which include the words of the dying Yaakov and Yosef), an aged leader here has final wisdom to impart. In the case of Joshua, there is likewise a double ending, and there will be another poetic one at the end of Samuel. Our Chap. 23 uses concentrated language drawn from Deuteronomy (see the comment to the chapter) as part of Yehoshua’s personal plea for the Israelites to remain faithful to God, including a warning at the end that the penalty for violating the pact is exile, the most feared of all punishments in the Bible."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part IV; Last Words",3,"In Chap. 24 Yehoshua appropriately summarizes Israel’s journey from earliest days, i.e., the period of Avraham the patriarch, for the purpose of exhorting the Israelites to keep their covenant with Y<small>HWH</small>."
"The Early Prophets, Joshua, Part IV; Last Words",4,"As so often happens in the Bible, the book ends with a death notice, here not only of Yehoshua but also of the last priestly representative of the older generation, El’azar. The wanderings are over, and the Israelites are home at last."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part I; Opening the Bracket",1,(1:1–3:6)
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part I; Opening the Bracket",2,"W<small>HILE</small> J<small>UDGES OPENS BY INVOKING THE NAME OF</small> Y<small>EHOSHUA, WHOSE DEATH IN</small> the previous book sealed the conquest of Canaan, it unexpectedly launches into an account of fighting and, more tellingly, a list of which territories the Israelites had <i>not</i> conquered. Immediately, then, the reader is plunged into a narrative situation of instability. Gone is the assurance of peaceful settlement and security, and the Israelites can expect military and cultural conflict, which is exactly what ensues throughout the book. Only the success of the tribe of Yehuda (Judah) at the beginning points to eventual ascendancy; the rest of the stories will oscillate among oppression, deliverance, and the recurrence of chaos."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part I; Opening the Bracket",3,"This is made clear in the pattern introduced by Chap. 2, undoubtedly the creation of a later editor in the Deuteronomistic mold. The sequence of Israel’s apostasy, God’s handing them over to enemies, his eventual sending of a dynamic leader, a period of peace, and then a relapse by the people, sets the stage for the action to follow."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part I; Opening the Bracket",4,"Once again, echoes from the past are understood not by invoking social, economic, or military causes, but through the lens of the covenant, especially as expressed in the language of Deuteronomy. And this message is delivered by a prophetic-type “messenger” of Y<small>HWH</small>. In contrast, the “judges” themselves will by and large be military types, who are more tied to strategy than ideology."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part IIa; Early Leaders; Israel Delivered",1,(3:7–8:32)
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part IIa; Early Leaders; Israel Delivered",2,"T<small>HE FIRST LEADERS WHOSE DEEDS ARE DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK STRIKE A GENER</small>ally positive note. Judges’ account of the human “deliverers” of Israel begins with a surprisingly brief example, that of Otniel. But his inclusion at this point is significant. The three verses which describe his activities are enough to establish his identity as a member of the tribe of Yehuda and to attribute his prowess in battle to the “rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small>” which infuses him."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part IIa; Early Leaders; Israel Delivered",3,"With Ehud, the twin aspects of bold human strategy and savage humor make their appearance. Apparently both are compatible with biblical literature, despite the divine overlay. It is almost as if the serious business, the message of Y<small>HWH</small>’s protection and the primacy of Judah, has been taken care of, and the audience can now enjoy a brief but fully fleshed out tale of triumph. This narrative also makes it clear that in Judges, violence, sometimes extreme, will be used unhesitatingly to extract Israel from its local and regional struggles. That it will spill over into Israelite private life in the second half of the book is not yet apparent."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part IIa; Early Leaders; Israel Delivered",4,"The Devora/Barak leadership, recounted in both a narrative account (Chap. 4) and a poetic version (Chap. 5), provides a high point in this section of Judges. The first telling, as it were, combines the dialogue of the leaders, focused on establishing divine credit for the coming victory, in a dramatic geographic setting, and concludes with the grisly story of the enemy general’s death. The ensuing poem takes up themes of ancient warriors, cosmic battle, and the contrast between triumphant females and bereaved ones. By the end of the two-chapter sequence, God is fully ensconced as the Divine Warrior who defeats Israel’s enemies by enlisting both the climate and the human agencies of sword and stealth. It is hard to imagine what can go wrong for Israel at this point."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part IIa; Early Leaders; Israel Delivered",5,"But as Chap. 2 posited, it is the Israelites themselves who consistently upset the delicate balance. By once again doing “what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>” as Chap. 6 opens, a long cycle of stories pertaining to the next judge, Gid’on, begins. These form an important fulcrum in the book in the eyes of many interpreters. After the militarily effective Ehud and the stalwart leadership of Devora, Gid’on introduces notes of doubt, contention, and even, it seems, a form of idolatry. While in the opening scene the new judge conventionally portrays himself as unworthy for the task, as Moshe before him had done, his questioning goes beyond personal qualifications to challenge God’s deliverance. Further, a number of times in the narrative, townspeople and other Israelites are portrayed in conflict with Gid’on; once, he even sneaks around them at night out of fear. True, he rejects the crown offered to him with the emblematic words, “<i>I</i> will not rule over you, / my son will not rule over you— / Y<small>HWH</small> will rule over you!” (8:23), but he follows this important gesture with a concession to Baal worship, the very thing that had caused God to turn his back on the Israelites several times already in the book."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part IIa; Early Leaders; Israel Delivered",6,"So the wheel in Judges begins to turn. On the one hand, there is a military rout, complete with a prophetic dream and psychological strategy, but on the other, the hero ends by building an image which winds up leading the Israelites astray. The book is heading in a dangerous direction."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part IIb; Later Leaders; Decline",1,(8:33–16:31)
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part IIb; Later Leaders; Decline",2,"A<small>S NOTED ABOVE, ALTHOUGH</small> G<small>ID’ON PROVIDES LONG-LASTING LEADERSHIP</small>, and properly turns down the tribes’ offer of a crown, his actions in connection with the worship of the <i>efod</i> at the end of Chap. 8 are troubling. Immediately upon his death, the Israelites turn back to Canaanite gods, and the usual cycle begins again. This time, however, the oppressor is one of their own, illegitimate though his birth may be. The long and violent tale of Gid’on’s son Avimelekh foreshadows Shakespeare’s Richard III as a monarch who seizes power violently and lives by the sword. The biblical villain meets an ignominious end, and the text makes no bones about his receiving his just deserts. Here, amid a book which elsewhere is clearly calling for the establishment of a monarchy, Chaps. 8 and 9 pose a negative lesson and imply an alternate vision, perhaps closer to the traditional Israelite one, in which God alone is to rule."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part IIb; Later Leaders; Decline",3,"Moving forward, the middle part of this section of the book is studded with brief references to “minor judges,” figures whose exploits are barely outlined but who perhaps provide a welcome breather between major stories. More important, their appearance also allows the compiler of the book to include all of the tribes of Israel."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part IIb; Later Leaders; Decline",4,"The last two judges spring from the realm of folklore—unlikely heroes because of birth or demeanor, whose deeds have been woven into Judges with an eye to explaining Israel’s decline. Yiftah is a rough figure of lowly origins whose dreadful miscalculation tarnishes his heroic image. Like Avimelekh the son of a concubine, he fits the classic pattern of exile, recall by kinsmen, leadership of a band of outcasts à la Robin Hood, and return to rescue his beleaguered countrymen, a pattern also remarked in the ancient stories of kings Idrimi of Alalakh and David of Israel (see Greenstein/Marcus). He also strikes an enigmatic and troubling note with the sacrifice of his daughter. Yiftah foreshadows the next judge, Shimshon, in that his general motivation is personal, a need to avenge his having been cast out of his society, rather than a desire to help to the people (Fewell)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part IIb; Later Leaders; Decline",5,"Shimshon himself, the ultimate trickster figure, breaks every rule in the book while still managing to kill thousands of Israel’s great enemy, the Philistines. Buber aptly characterized him as a “berserker,” a warrior whose rages lead him to perform superhuman feats. While Shimshon’s story is an entertaining one, his extreme individualism strikes an anomalous chord in a communal society. So by the time his cycle of stories ends in Chap. 16, we have fully experienced the rough-and-tumble of this transitional era, with strong signs of God’s intervention but also the crying need for a more centralized earthly authority."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, On the Shimshon Cycle",1,"O<small>F ALL THE NARRATIVES IN</small> J<small>UDGES, THE CYCLE WHICH FEATURES ITS LAST GREAT</small> figure, Shimshon, is the most puzzling at first blush. While the immediately preceding judge, Yiftah, was presented as flawed, he at least fit the book’s standard leadership profile by leading Israelite troops against their enemies. Shimshon, on the other hand, makes no inspiring speeches and heads no armies. The hero’s “call” in Chap. 13 consists mainly of a revelation to Shimshon’s parents before his birth, and his consciousness of any kind of broader mission in life seems severely limited. And what are we to make of the bizarre, even burlesque elements of the cycle, which include an angel who disappears in sacrificial fire, an enigmatic riddle about strength and sweetness, the hero’s slaughtering of a thousand Philistines with an ass’s jawbone, his over-the-top feat of strength after a visit to a prostitute, a seduction scene followed by the most famous haircut of all time, and a final violent spectacle that seems tailor-made for opera or film? Simply put, there is nothing quite like it in the Bible."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, On the Shimshon Cycle",2,"Thanks to such entertaining elements, audiences have delighted in these stories for centuries. At the same time, interpreters have struggled mightily with them. In the late nineteenth century it was fashionable to read the cycle as a “solar myth,” based, first, on the fact that the name Shimshon resembles <i>shemesh,</i> “sun,” and, second, that various motifs in the text, not to mention the name of the local town of Beit Shemesh, suggest an origin in pagan tales about the sun or sun god. Another school of interpretation has sought to locate the story in Greek traditions about Herakles (Hercules), whom Shimshon resembles in many respects, from his anger to his weakness for women, and in some of the details of the story. But these kinds of comparisons, while initially attractive, do not explain the distinctively Israelite character of the Shimshon tales. As so often happens, it may be more fruitful to look at the narrative through the Bible’s own thematics and wording."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, On the Shimshon Cycle",3,"Initially, the overarching theme of the cycle appears to be the breaking of the Nazirite vows laid out in Num. 6 and indicated in the opening lines of our story. In this biblical practice, a person could take on a special vow for a certain period, necessitating abstention from consuming alcohol, haircutting, and contact with the dead. Shimshon’s actions, however, systematically violate every Nazirite rule; by the end of the story, the reasons for his downfall are manifest. The theme of Naziriteship thus suggests that Shimshon is an individual in control of his own destiny. But despite the trappings of a hero story, the narrative makes it clear from the beginning that, as usual, it is really God who is at the center of events. All of Shimshon’s inappropriate behavior—his violations of the vow, his rages, his lusting after foreign women—serve in this text as vehicles for fulfillment of a divine plan. In what amounts to a classic biblical pattern, people act upon their own impulses and emotions, but the end result is what God, not they, had intended. Our text points to God’s hand behind the scenes: “Now his father and his mother did not know that it was from Y<small>HWH</small>, / for he was seeking a pretext from the Philistines” (14:4). Even more strikingly, as has often been noted, the hero’s selfish reasoning in 14:3, “Take <i>her</i> for me, for she is right in my eyes,” is integrated into the larger theme of Judges, premonarchical chaos, which appears several times in the subsequent, final chapters of the book, and notably at its very end (21:25): “In those days there was no king in Israel; / each one would do what was right in his eyes.”"
"The Early Prophets, Judges, On the Shimshon Cycle",4,"This tension between the divine and the human is maintained by the theme of secrecy, which permeates the entire narrative and holds it together. Everything points toward two dramatic revelations: uncovering the secret of Shimshon’s strength to Delila and its final fatal revelation to the assembled Philistines. On an ongoing basis, the thread of secrecy is underscored by the use of three major leading words in the text: “tell,” “know,” and “see.” Secrets are withheld from every major character at some point or other, from parents to women to enemies. Dominating them all is the muscle-bound figure of the hero, ironically the most unaware character in the entire cycle. Significantly, the narrator rarely uses the verb “know” in relation to Shimshon himself, preferring instead to utilize “seeing” as the central metaphor."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, On the Shimshon Cycle",5,"To stress “see” as a key word is to make a loaded choice. The “seer” in the Bible is usually the man of God (see Avraham and Moshe), one who is perfectly and painfully aware of what God wants of him. But Shimshon is more voyeur than visionary, rarely seeing beyond his anger or his lust. Not surprisingly, Talmudic interpreters felt that Shimshon’s downfall was connected to his sight; in their words, “he who was led astray by his eyes, lost them” (B. Sotah 9b)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, On the Shimshon Cycle",6,"So Shimshon is the perfect antihero, largely unconcerned with his obligations to his people or his God. Like Herakles, he is motivated chiefly by his sexual drive and his anger. But the quality of Shimshon’s obliviousness to the Bible’s main concern, the covenant between Israel and God, may be a clue to something else that is going on below the surface of the text. Greenstein (1981), in a perceptive analysis, has focused on Shimshon as a figure who mirrors the people of Israel as a whole. Like Shimshon with his Nazirite regulations, Israel has a defined series of rules. Just as Shimshon repeatedly breaks his vows, Israel is characterized in both the Torah and the Early Prophets as constantly backsliding and breaking the covenant. Indeed, notes Greenstein, the name “Shimshon,” so often linked to the Hebrew term for the sun, may also be punning on <i>shem,</i> “name,” and suggesting that Israel’s <i>identity</i> is the key issue of the story."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, On the Shimshon Cycle",7,"Also noteworthy in the vocabulary of the narrative, as suggested above, is the repetition of the verb “bind” (Heb. <i>’-s-r</i>), which first appears in the jawbone episode and is prominent in the Delila story. Not only is it used in the Bible to indicate physical restraint, but it also frequently carries the connotation of prohibition or the setting of rules. Viewed from that perspective, the Shimshon cycle is very much about a classic “wild man” who breaks society’s rules and lives by his own. If Greenstein (1981) is right, then the Bible has transformed an ancient hero into a symbol for the book’s “wild society,” which it will indeed prove to be in the chapters that follow Shimshon and conclude the book."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, On the Shimshon Cycle",8,"One last aspect of Shimshon is striking, already noticed by scholars such as Wellhausen. True to the chapters of Judges that follow it, the Shimshon cycle indirectly indicts a major character in the upcoming book of Samuel: King Sha’ul (Saul). Like Shimshon, he does not possess the character traits necessary for true and successful leadership. He can only lay the groundwork for the eventual defeat of the Philistines and the rise of a unified kingdom (similarly, Shimshon can only “begin” to defeat the Philistines). Both men, at least, are granted a heroic death, yet it is striking how similarly they are portrayed—a picture of the divine spirit gone awry. Neither man has control over his overwhelming gift, and both suffer personal tragedy. In Shimshon’s case, it is not the tragedy portrayed by later Western interpreters; as he appears in Judges, he is neither a symbol of despair turned into faith and resistance (Milton’s <i>Samson Agonistes</i>), nor a national liberator who sadly forgets himself in the bedroom (Saint-Saens’s opera <i>Samson et Dalila</i>). Instead, he functions in the end as the symbol of the straying, suffering, and, for the biblical writer, ultimately redeemed folk from which he stems. With the cycle of stories around Shimshon, the book of Judges is almost ready to draw to a close."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, On the Shimshon Cycle",9,"For a detailed look at the uses of verbal and thematic repetition in the Shimshon cycle, see “Judges, Appendix; the Sound and Structure of a Biblical Tale” at the end of Judges."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part III; Closing the Bracket",1,(17–21)
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part III; Closing the Bracket",2,"T<small>HE LAST SECTION OF</small> J<small>UDGES, WHICH CONSTITUTES ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE</small> book, does not fit the pattern established in Chap. 2, nor does it recount the great deeds of heroes, even ambiguous ones. For these reasons, interpreters sometimes consider it an appendix that has been tacked on to the book at a later date. From a more global point of view, this view is erroneous. These chapters constitute an appropriate and coherent ending to Judges, portraying a society in disarray and advancing some major ideological agendas."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part III; Closing the Bracket",3,"On the surface, Chaps. 17–18 are a series of narratives involving bad-faith dealings in finance, worship, hospitality, and tribal relations. A closer look, however, reveals a detailed description of priestly illegitimacy: first, a Levite conducting his own local form of worship, with an idol, and second, an entire tribe setting up its own sanctuary with that priest, whom they have hired away from the family with whom the section began. We may well be dealing here with a condemnation of worship outside of Jerusalem—an issue of more relevance to the time of King Josiah in the seventh century <small>B.C.E.</small> than to the period in which Judges is set—and a graphic portrayal of the idolatrous practices against which Deuteronomy and earlier passages in Judges had warned."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Part III; Closing the Bracket",4,"Chaps. 19–21, as we shall see, appear aimed at Israel’s first king, Sha’ul (Saul), who will make his entrance in the very next book, through condemning his home tribe of Binyamin. In a series of extremely violent narratives, involving the violation of the sacred rules of hospitality as well as a gang rape, dismemberment, civil war, and mass abduction, we are left with the strongest possible expression of a society that has reached its nadir. The career of a single judge would not have sufficed to paint this portrait. Chaps. 17–21 betoken a complete breakdown of the leadership which had at least tentatively enabled Israel to survive, with, once again, variations on the refrain that echoes throughout these chapters: “In those days there was no king in Israel; / each one would do what was right in his eyes.” It will take a good chunk of the next book, Samuel, to set matters aright."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Appendix; the Sound and Structure of a Biblical Tale",1,"T<small>HE STORIES ABOUT</small> S<small>HIMSHON CONSTITUTE AN OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE OF NAR</small>rative art in the Bible. Although Judg. 13–16 has sometimes been viewed as a loosely gathered series of tales about the hero (Brettler 2001a), it in fact exhibits a verbally tight structure, possibly indicating oral origins. More than perhaps any other cycle of stories in the Bible, it is built architectonically on the repetition of words and motifs. I have presented a list of these below. More could be adduced, but this sampling of thirty-nine elements will, I think, be sufficient to make the point that the entire cycle of stories has been carefully built up and knit together by means of repetition."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Appendix; the Sound and Structure of a Biblical Tale",2,"This technique, as many have observed, is one of the classic building blocks of biblical narrative, but the Shimshon material goes beyond its conventional use. Here, instead of simply using several key words or phrases to suggest important concerns in the text, we are treated to a stunning piece of ancient literary architecture. The storyteller, or, just as likely, a series of storytellers and creative “redactors,” has connected different episodes in a dizzying set of combinations. The fourth episode, for example, picks up twelve elements that have already appeared in the previous sections, but it also introduces three new ones of its own. Almost half of the words/ideas in the cycle make their first appearance in episode I; but it is episode VI, the Delila story, that contains the most of any single section in the text: twenty-four."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Appendix; the Sound and Structure of a Biblical Tale",3,"What this means is that the story of Shimshon and Delila, arguably the most famous section of the cycle and one that is unforgettable in its tension and dialogical richness, is constructed overwhelmingly out of pieces that have already been given to the audience. The previous five episodes have, as it were, paved the way for what is to come, contributing their building materials to the most important edifice. In the Delila account, everything comes together: strength, secrets, women, and enemies, but something new appears as well. For the first time, Shimshon himself acknowledges his special status as a “Consecrated One” (<i>nazir</i>)."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Appendix; the Sound and Structure of a Biblical Tale",4,"The example of the Shimshon cycle is an important one for understanding biblical narrative, for it demonstrates that, whatever the origin of the discrete pieces of the story, its present form has been tightly and beautifully woven together by means of sound. An ancient audience would no doubt have appreciated the story’s artistry, in conjunction with its humor, its irony, and its didactic intent."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Appendix; the Sound and Structure of a Biblical Tale",5,"The episodes in the chart below are as follows: I Birth = 13:2–25, II Wedding = 14:1–20, III Foxes = 15:1–8, IV Jawbone = 15:9–20, V Gaza = 16:1–3, VI Delila = 16:4–22, VII Death = 16:23–31."
"The Early Prophets, Judges, Appendix; the Sound and Structure of a Biblical Tale",6,"The basic structural characteristic of the cycle is that scene by scene, new elements are consistently added, while a liberal selection of older ones is retained. Episode II adds eleven; episode III, two; episode IV, three; episode V, two; and episode VI, likewise one. The final two scenes reprise thirty-one out of the thirty-nine elements, and even most of the missing ones (for instance, “deliver,” “spirit,” “Foreskinned Ones” / Philistine rule) are implied. They serve to bring together all the great facets of the farce-drama that is the Shimshon cycle: seeing and enticing, knowing and telling, deliverance and death. Thus viewed, Chap. 16, far from being a separate set of tales, integrates what has come before in a sophisticated and spectacular display of the Hebrew Bible’s narrative artistry."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part I; The Last Judges"": Eli and Shemuel",1,(I 1–7)
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part I; The Last Judges"": Eli and Shemuel",2,"T<small>HE BOOK THAT INTRODUCES THE INSTITUTION OF KINGSHIP INTO THE</small> B<small>IBLE</small> begins, appropriately, with a birth. As so often happens in this literature, human continuity is initially threatened by apparent infertility, but instead of starting merely with a biological fact, Samuel introduces the first of its great human portraits by imbuing the heroine with considerable depth of feeling and, not surprisingly, a gift for poetry. Hanna makes a telling contrast to the High Priest, Eli, continuing a pattern that recurs throughout Judges and Samuel, where women provide a foil and a profound sounding board for issues of power."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part I; The Last Judges"": Eli and Shemuel",3,"It is worth noting, as many have, that Hanna’s poem in Chap. 2, which is undoubtedly from an independent source, is a prelude to major themes of the book, especially the idea that God, the great Reverser, may choose to exalt the powerless. Y<small>HWH</small>, who “brings down … and brings up” (v.6), will be directing the fate of Israel and its early kings, and while he will in the end “give power to his king” (v.10), he will also make it clear that “not by might does a man prevail” (v.9)."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part I; The Last Judges"": Eli and Shemuel",4,"The priest-judge Eli, an ineffective leader, typifies an era that is coming to a close. His first act, mistaking Hanna’s deep inner religiosity for drunkenness, sets the tone. Unlike his young charge Shemuel, he is never in direct verbal contact with God; in addition, he is incapable of providing the military leadership of his predecessors, and, most tellingly, unable to control the highly inappropriate behavior of his sons. Barely noticeable amid Eli’s initial bluster in Chap. 1 is a striking detail: he sits on a kind of “throne” (Spina). The first part of this section of the book (Chaps. 1–4) will end with his death in that very seat, overturned when he hears the disastrous news of the Ark’s capture. The fall of the house of Eli gives way to the leadership of his judge-prophet successor, Shemuel."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part I; The Last Judges"": Eli and Shemuel",5,"A central feature of this part of the book, in fact, is narrative emphasis on the Ark (here “Coffer”). As the great biblical symbol of the divine presence, its physical location in these chapters emphasizes the desperate situation in which the Israelites find themselves—or rather, in the eyes of the biblical writer, the situation which they themselves have created. Bereft of God’s presence, the people have no chance of procuring either general blessing or military victory. The Coffer’s return, on the other hand, does not provide a full solution in their eyes. That they can envision only in the establishment of a monarchy."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part I; The Last Judges"": Eli and Shemuel",6,"At the same time, there is considerable irony in the Coffer’s loss in this section of the book, for it will be absent all throughout the reign of Sha’ul, the first king, strongly suggesting that God will not be with him as well (Sweeney 2012)."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part I; The Last Judges"": Eli and Shemuel",7,"Shemuel himself contains elements characteristic of the prophets who will be important in subsequent books. Like Yirmeyahu (Jeremiah) centuries later, he is called by God early in life; like all the great prophets, his relationship to monarchy is highly critical. He functions, as they do, as God’s mouthpiece, yet the text eventually finds room for his personal emotions, especially in his complex relationship with Sha’ul. This opening section of the book, which covers most of his career, gives only passing indication of an inner life; throughout the bulk of it, the writer seems mainly concerned with establishing Shemuel’s legitimacy. In contrast to Eli, he is the one with the vision. He vicariously leads the troops, and it is on his watch that the Coffer returns to Israel. And he functions as the last of the “judges,” at least judicially, in his circuit riding among central Israelite towns. We will encounter him as a character with deep feelings only in the transitional Chap. 8 and the events that follow it."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part I; The Last Judges"": Eli and Shemuel",8,"It should also be noted, as Hancock does in some detail, that aspects of Shemuel’s career, especially early on, parallel that of Moshe. This is only natural in a book that takes biblical leadership as one of its great themes."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part II; The Requested King",1,(I 8–15)
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part II; The Requested King",2,"T<small>HE NEXT SECTION OF</small> S<small>AMUEL RECOUNTS TRADITIONS ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF</small> the monarchy in ancient Israel and, in the process, sends a series of strong messages about how kingship was to be understood. Although framed partly as a portrait of Shemuel’s own frustrations, the stories that follow paint a picture of an institution which was considered necessary, even divinely sanctioned, but which was also to be regarded with reservations. Thus, before the selection of the first king can proceed, the people have to be cautioned about the possible abuses of kingship."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part II; The Requested King",3,"Shemuel’s warning in Chap. 8, which reads like an indictment of later kings’ behavior, forms an ominous backdrop out of which monarchy is to emerge. Many cultures’ traditions tend to stress from the outset a new king’s military exploits and charisma, choosing to build the monarchy on a firm popular foundation, but in the Bible, a note of misgiving is sounded before anything else happens. In this sense, Shemuel is both the last of the old-time practitioners of theocracy (rule by God) and the first of the prophetic critics of human kingship."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part II; The Requested King",4,"One of the great literary characterizations in the Bible, Sha’ul, the “Requested-One,” seems doomed from the beginning. Chosen only after Shemuel’s dire warning in Chap. 8, and its reiteration and expansion in Chap. 12, Sha’ul must meander about, looking for lost she-asses, until he is “found” (Chaps. 9 and 10)—and even then he is only anointed after being brought out from having “hidden himself among the gear” (10:22). Such a beginning is hardly auspicious. On the other hand, he is physically imposing and a great warrior, and even, to the surprise of his people, can at times be seized by the spirit of God “like-a-prophet” (10 and 19). It is, ironically, this latter endowment, also possessed by several of the Judges, that will eventually prove too much for him to handle: God’s spirit will depart, leaving an “evil spirit” in its wake (16:14)."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part II; The Requested King",5,"Sha’ul’s kingship is characterized by wrong turns and tragic misperceptions. Once past his initial success against the Ammonites, he runs afoul of both people and prophet. Although God in Chap. 8 had conceded the kingship by telling Shemuel to “hearken to their [the people’s] voice,” Sha’ul in short order jumps the gun thrice—by inappropriately offering sacrifices (Chap. 13), almost killing the heir to the throne (14), and disobeying God’s command (15), tellingly “hearken[ing] to [the people’s] voice” (15:24) instead of God’s. In this disobedience, according to the text, lies the reason for his family’s forfeiture of the throne, similar to the fate of many of the later kings of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, although their crime almost always was the practice of idolatry. This rather harsh judgment is perhaps appropriate given Sha’ul’s key position as Israel’s first king and the expectations raised by Shemuel and God, as well as by the book of Judges. Another perspective emphasized in our text is the ideology of writers who sought to justify David’s claim to the throne, and who thus had to portray Sha’ul as deeply flawed. Or it may, once again, be an indication of a concept of monarchy that is highly cautionary (Machinist 2000). To paraphrase Brettler (1995), in selecting Sha’ul as the first occupant of Israel’s throne God seems to be saying, “You want a king? All right, I’ll give you a king!”"
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part II; The Requested King",6,"At the same time, it should not be ignored that the Bible’s presentation of Sha’ul is not the portrait of a villain (for a black-and-white presentation of such a character, see, for instance, Judg. 9). This may be due to a desire to include northern traditions in the final text, but it may also be occasioned by the artistry of a great writer, who knows that tragedy is richer than melodrama. In any event, even at his lowest moments, Sha’ul somehow engages our sympathy."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part II; The Requested King",7,"The narrative in Chaps. 9–11 is at times confusing and contradictory. As McKenzie (2000) summarizes, we may be dealing here with what were originally three separate accounts—of Sha’ul seeking lost asses and being anointed by the prophet, of a public coronation ceremony, and of his acclamation as king following a stirring military victory. They bring with them a complex picture of Sha’ul as a man with undeniable talent, even charisma, but one who somehow fails to measure up to the task."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part III; The Rise of David and the Fall of Sha'ul",1,(I 16:1–31:13)
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part III; The Rise of David and the Fall of Sha'ul",2,"A<small>S THE CENTRAL AND MOST VITAL PERSONALITY IN THE</small> E<small>ARLY</small> P<small>ROPHETS</small>, D<small>AVID</small> will now occupy the bulk of the text in the book of Samuel. In the half of I Samuel that remains, the audience follows the young hero’s meteoric rise from the sheepfolds of Bethlehem to the court of Sha’ul, where he will excel as a musician and warrior. Although in the story of David’s selection as king (Chap. 16) God constantly admonishes Shemuel and the reader to ignore what is “seen,” namely, external appearance, it does not seem to hurt that David is handsome and talented. Everyone appears to fall at his feet without much exertion on his part: fearsome enemies, the crown prince, and women, including princesses. And Chap. 16 will focus on a prominent earlier theme in the Bible: the triumph of a younger or youngest son."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part III; The Rise of David and the Fall of Sha'ul",3,"It is entirely appropriate that the narrative about Golyat (Goliath) in Chap. 17 has been placed at the beginning of David’s achievements. Nothing less will do for the man who was to become Israel’s greatest king. The leisurely account, with greater detail than most biblical narratives, has imprinted itself on audiences of all periods, and remained symbolic of conflicts of all kinds throughout the centuries (in modern America it is often invoked regarding sports and politics). While the Commentary and Notes treat the chapter in detail below, David’s cutting off of the giant’s head may be singled out here, as touching on an overarching theme. As Polzin (1989) points out, Sha’ul and his son Ish-Boshet will lose theirs as well, which he sees as emblematic of the leadership problem in this book (see the Introduction to Samuel, above)."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part III; The Rise of David and the Fall of Sha'ul",4,"The narratives in these chapters center around several themes: Sha’ul’s pursuit of David (18–26); David in exile all over Judah and especially among the Philistine enemy (19–30); David’s opportunities to kill Sha’ul (24 and 26); and the desperation of the king’s last days (28,31). These are heightened by the powerfully drawn emotional triangle involving David, Sha’ul, and Yehonatan, and by the appearance of a number of secondary characters who help to set David’s sometimes opaque personality into sharper relief. Thus, for instance, it takes Golyat (17) to bring out his intense faith, and Avigayil (25) to blunt his not-so-restrained temper."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part III; The Rise of David and the Fall of Sha'ul",5,"Key words abound and evolve in this section. As previously noted, the account of David’s anointing in Chap. 16 centers around “seeing” (see Alter 1981). The oft-repeated threat of “death” in Chap. 19 will ironically be resolved by that of Sha’ul, not of David. The troubled king’s attempt to catch David in his “hand” (23, 24, 26) will fail, and he knows that in the end, “the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand” (24:21). Finally, as Dietrich has noted, the Sha’ul/David narratives contain numerous verbs for “fleeing” or “escape.” The reader should pay careful attention to all of these and other repeating words within individual chapters."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part III; The Rise of David and the Fall of Sha'ul",6,"As I Samuel closes, David is on the sidelines, and our attention focuses back on Sha’ul. As previously mentioned, despite his failures and his subsequent descent into a monomaniacal pursuit of David, there is a tone in the text that mutes readers’ reactions. Sha’ul is to be rejected not as evil but rather as tragically marred. The final stories about him, at En Dor (28) and in battle at Mount Gilboa (31), naturally elicit sympathy, reflected in the medium’s tender feeding of him in the former story and the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad’s care for his body in the latter. As eulogized in David’s resonant poem of II Sam. 1, Sha’ul is not a misfit but a “mighty” warrior who has fallen, surely not a cause for rejoicing."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part IV; David's Rule Consolidated",1,(II 2–8)
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part IV; David's Rule Consolidated",2,"T<small>HREE STAGES NOW CHARACTERIZE</small> D<small>AVID</small>’<small>S ASCENSION TO POWER AS</small> I<small>SRAEL</small>’<small>S</small> second king: the elimination of rivals, principally from the house of Sha’ul; the establishment of a capital; and the subduing of external enemies. The accomplishment of the first goal is marred by three violent deaths: one in battle (David’s nephew Asa’el), one standing by a gate (Sha’ul’s general Avner), and one in a bed (Sha’ul’s son Ish-Boshet). All of them, curiously, are struck “in the abdomen,” a notably gory death. While David absolves himself of all this bloodshed, one conclusion is inescapable: as Polzin (1993) notes, kingship in Israel is “a major cause of frequent fratricide on a tribal or national level.” It is a pattern that will be repeated within the royal house itself in the second half of the book."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part IV; David's Rule Consolidated",3,"The second part of this section relates the capture of Jerusalem, a previously unconquered and hence politically neutral site which had the advantages of central location and natural defenses. In a small fortified town, whose entirety would today be enveloped by the Arab village of Silwan directly south of the Old City, David establishes his capital, builds a palace, and brings the holy Coffer to its final and fitting resting place. At the last, his great moment of triumph and a remarkable blend of the political, the religious, and the personal, we see David in all his complexity: a conqueror who can bring the ancient tablets of God to the seat of royal power, a believer uninhibitedly religious enough to leap and whirl before God, and a man allied to Sha’ul’s house by marriage, who nevertheless acts on his own instincts. And it is to “house” that the text turns in the long, climactic Chap. 7 (see Bar-Efrat), with its emphasis on the seeming permanence of Temple and dynasty. It is punctuated by God’s use of the adjectives “secure” and “firm,” with David’s use of the root “great/greatness” in reply, and by the refrain “for the ages” resounding in both speeches. The David who emerges from this section is king of a dominant and unified nation, centered around a royal city and a dynasty that enjoy the blessing of God."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part IV; David's Rule Consolidated",4,"Finally, there is the matter of defeating surrounding military threats. The Bible sees David as Israel’s most successful military leader since Yehoshua (Joshua). He at long last subdues the Philistines, who have plagued the Israelites for generations, and establishes for his son Shelomo (Solomon) a territorial sphere of influence which far exceeds that of any previous or subsequent Israelite ruler. If historically accurate on some level, this would not be totally surprising, as the classic powerful empires of the ancient Near East, Egypt and Assyria, were at a temporary low ebb in the tenth century <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>. If, on the other hand, the boundaries set forth here do not reflect actual fact, they nevertheless represent an ancient longing, appropriately tied to the most loved and admired of Israel’s kings."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part IV; David's Rule Consolidated",5,"The section ends with a list of David’s court officials, as does Chap. 20. As mentioned in the Introduction, this may delineate an ancient unit of the text, yet another indication that biblical books such as Samuel may have a complicated textual history behind them."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part IV; David's Rule Consolidated",6,"Jerusalem, the city conquered by David in Chap. 5, is as topographically striking as it is famous in history. Built on two ridges that rose over three valleys in antiquity (the middle one was later to be filled in), with the only true access from the north, David’s Jerusalem was a hill sloping up to a kind of saddle, itself surrounded by a circle of slightly higher hills. It sat on the watershed, in a location that lay on a convergence of north-south and east-west axes. For all that, it was off the main ancient trade routes and had few natural resources, and so its choice as a capital city probably stemmed from the fact that it was readily defensible and could not be easily claimed by any Israelite tribe. It was thus relatively immunized from internal rivalries."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part IV; David's Rule Consolidated",7,"Despite its fame throughout history, furthered by artists’ imaginations in innumerable drawings and paintings, David’s Jerusalem would have actually been quite small, covering only the limited area of the southern slope and housing only a few thousand inhabitants. The westward expansion that would give the city its more familiar shape would not come until two centuries later, under the impetus of Assyrian invasion, when the Judeans needed to reinforce its fortifications and make room for refugees from both the surrounding communities and the besieged north."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part IV; David's Rule Consolidated",8,"The name of the city has come under much speculation, but most likely its original meaning was “Foundation of Shalem,” that is, belonging to a local deity. The popular etymology, “City of Peace,” probably reflects deeply held wishes more than linguistic accuracy, and is, to say the least, ironic, given Jerusalem’s history. Although the Bible terms its former inhabitants <i>Yevusim</i> (Jebusites), that group is not thought to have occupied the site for very long previously."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part V; David in Control and Out of Control",1,(II 9–12)
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part V; David in Control and Out of Control",2,"T<small>HIS SECTION BEGINS WITH DEMONSTRATIONS EVERYWHERE OF</small> D<small>AVID</small>’<small>S POWER</small>: he reduces the rival house of Sha’ul to one physically challenged adult who depends on him for his daily bread, and, amid a campaign against the neighboring Ammonites, he manages to win peace from the powerful Arameans. As the ruler of a small empire and the central figure in a military and political success story, David seems to be the king with everything, including the blessing of God, multiple wives, and sons to succeed him."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part V; David in Control and Out of Control",3,"It is precisely at this moment of triumph that the Bible inserts the turning point of II Samuel and one of the greatest of all biblical tales: the story of David and Bat-Sheva (Chaps. 11–12). The king, absent from battle for unknown reasons, acts like a typical monarch throughout history: he takes what is not his, in this case a married woman. While in the king’s mind his lust for a woman is a personal matter, it is not hidden from God, who makes sure that David understands its wider ramifications (see Commentary to those chapters). The punishment will not be wrought only on the offending couple, but will extend through the generation of heirs to the throne and ultimately to the very stability of the state. From this point on, the private life of David and the public life of Israel will never be the same. In that sense, the book of Samuel, with its portrayal of how individuals affect the nation as a whole, is a fitting lead-in to the book of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part V; David in Control and Out of Control",4,"It is notable that the parallel section of the much later book of Chronicles does not contain either this story or most of the subsequent chapters, which trace the revolt of David’s son Avshalom. That would not have suited the Persian-era Jewish community, which on some level longed for the restoration of the Davidic line. But the Samuel account, by then undoubtedly considered authoritative, could not be expunged, and remains as one of the Bible’s great acts of self-criticism."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",1,(II 13–20)
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",2,"W<small>HAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN IMAGINED ABOUT THE</small> D<small>AVID WHO SLEW</small> G<small>OLYAT</small>, outmaneuvered Sha’ul, conquered Jerusalem, and received God’s spirit and blessing now comes to pass. Beginning with an episode in which sexual transgression and violence immediately reappear, family ties are betrayed and destroyed, and David’s once “firm” kingdom—his “house”—totters. Jerusalem is no longer safe for him, and he is forced into exile across the very Jordan which had been the entry point for the Israelites at the time of the Conquest. Only intervention by God and continuing vigorous action by David’s ruthless general Yoav prevent the king from being permanently overthrown or assassinated."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",3,"This cycle of stories about his son Avshalom’s revolt concerns both David’s decline, which had begun pointedly in Chap. 11 with the Bat-Sheva episode, and the portrait of his rebel son. Avshalom is many things, but none so much as his father’s son, with his good looks, worldly wisdom, and charisma. It is as if David, in his maturity, is forced to relive what Sha’ul had experienced of him in his youth."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",4,"The rebellion account proper spans Chaps. 15–20, and, as Fokkelman (1999) has shown, it is arranged concentrically, like many biblical stories and cycles. In the weighty center is 17:24–18:18, the account of battle preparations, the battle itself, and the death of Avshalom."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",5,"The vocabulary of the cycle is striking and effective. The ebb and flow of David’s flight and restoration are traced through the repeated use of “cross” and “return” in Chaps. 15 and 19. The Amnon and Tamar story with which the cycle opens recalls some of the echoing words of the David and Bat-Sheva episode (“lie,” “nourish,” “dead”), but also introduces the leading wordplay of the entire cycle, consistent with the book’s concentration on body parts which I noted in the Introduction: variations on the word “heart.” A fuller explanation is appropriate here."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",6,"The tone is set already in the opening episode, the rape of Avshalom’s sister Tamar. Amnon, the crown prince, pretends to be ill and requests that his half sister make <i>levivot</i>, usually translated as “cakes,” for him. The noun occurs four times, and the root appears twice more in verbal form. But as some interpreters have noticed, the homonym (<i>levav</i>) means “heart,” and the verbal form of <i>l-b-b</i> (the biblical <i>v</i> and <i>b</i> are the same letter) occurs in the Song of Songs 4:9, “You have captured my heart” (NJPS). So a word connected in love poetry with seduction is appropriate enough in the mouth of the lovesick Amnon, and on this and other grounds (see Notes below) we are justified in understanding <i>levivot</i> as something like “heartcakes.”"
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",7,"From the opening culinary salvo we are prepared for permutations of the word throughout the story. Avshalom, on hearing that Amnon has raped Tamar, counsels his sister not to “take this thing to heart” (13:20); when the moment is right—Amnon’s “heart is merry with wine” (13:28)—Avshalom has his henchmen murder Amnon; King David, misled by the resulting outcry into thinking that all of his sons have been killed, is corrected by Yonadav, who informs him that Amnon alone is dead and tells him not to “take the matter to heart” (13:33); Yoav, David’s chief of staff, notices that the king’s “heart [is] toward Avshalom” (14:1), and reconciliation is therefore necessary; but eventually, of course, Avshalom rebels against David, and then meets his end at the hand of Yoav, who drives three rods “into Absalom’s heart” as he swings in “the heart of the oak” (18:14). There are several more idiomatic uses of the word in the story (14:13, 15:10, 16:3, 19:8, 20), but the significant ones occur in 15:6, where Avshalom “stole away the heart” of the men of Israel; in 19:8, where Yoav urges David to “speak to the hearts” of those same men; and in 19:15, where the king “inclined the heart of all the men of Judah” toward him."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",8,"This key word, which is usually translated out for idiomatic reasons (in NJPS it is variously rendered as “cakes … keep in mind … merry … think … mind … chest … hearts … placate … hearts,” respectively), is undoubtedly a “leading word” in Martin Buber’s definition, that is, one used thematically to point to a major message in the narrative. Its function here seems to be to highlight the issue of who will exercise leadership over Israel, David or Avshalom. In the language of the text, this comes down to who will command the hearts of the people—the king chosen by God or the upstart who has driven his own father out of Jerusalem, and who in words, at least, has sanctioned his murder. By presenting varying connotations of the leading word while retaining the repeated sound link between different passages, the text encourages readers themselves to “take to heart” the painful lessons of a narrative, a narrative that begins with a lovesick prince but whose roots lie in another affair of the heart, the Bat-Sheva incident."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",9,"To return to other uses of meaningful language in this section, Avshalom’s name (“Father is Peace”) undergoes significant development in the narrative. The king, after their initial reconciliation, tells his son to “go in peace” (15:9); Ahitofel advises Avshalom that he will personally kill the king, and thus bring about peace (17:3); David’s anxious question about his son, “Is there peace with the lad?” (18:29, 32, the conventional idiom for “Is he well?”), plays up the irony of what we know but he does not—that his “peaceful” Avshalom is dead. The king is finally able to return to his throne “in peace” (19:25, 31), but it is only through decisive, violent acts by Yoav and the “wise woman” of Avel (20:9, 19), cloaked in words of “peace” (20:9), that the kingdom will be secured at last."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",10,"It is worth noting that, just as the book opened with a woman, Hanna, as the character who expressed central emotions and ideas, this section, and much that has preceded it, turns on the deeds done to and by women. The Bat-Sheva incident is followed immediately by the rape of Tamar, which in turn gives way to the words of the “wise woman” of Tekoa as a vehicle for seeming reconciliation between David and Avshalom. It will take another such woman to bring the rebelling to a close in Chap. 21. Her counsel leads to the last of the book’s beheadings, a symbolic comment, perhaps, on the perils of leadership."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",11,"It is also notable that the story of the revolt is fleshed out by a large supporting cast of colorful characters: rebels, advisers, adherents, crafty men and women, and concubines. There are two clusters here, with some overlap, with one connected to David’s flight from Jerusalem and another to his return to power. Some of these characters have names that recall “brothers” (<i>Ahi</i>tofel, <i>Ahi</i>maatz), while others’ names betray their function (Ittai, the “accompanier,” and Hushai, the adviser who causes Avshalom to make a “hasty” and fatal decision). The words and deeds of all these secondary characters help to throw the protagonists’ sometimes impulsive, often agonized decisions into relief."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VI; The Great Rebellion",12,"In the end, as Flanagan has perceptively noticed, the rebellion story is not about succession, despite the fact that for decades scholars have referred to Chaps. 9–20 as “The Succession Narrative,” but rather about survival—notably, David’s. As Fokkelman (1981) reminds us, David, not Avshalom, occupies the bulk of space and concern in these chapters. And in this extended story, David resembles no other biblical character so much as Yaakov (Jacob) in Genesis. Like the patriarch, David is heavily involved with women; he is unable to control his sons’ behavior, which reflects some of his own; and his passivity in the face of impending disaster (13:21–39) strangely echoes that of Yaakov in Gen. 37. Both men, who are younger sons, experience exile and the threat of death, and neither, bereaved of beloved younger sons in their declining years, attains anything but the Bible’s ideal of the “fullness of days” typified by Avraham and Moshe."

T<small>HAT, AND THE</small> complex and once again violent machinations which accompany the accession of his son Shelomo to the throne, have been placed in the two opening chapters of the book of Kings, perhaps as the first throne succession story in a long sequence to follow in that book. Nevertheless, the final section of Samuel has its own integrity and sense. As has long been noted, Chaps. 21–24 are chiastic (ring-shaped) in structure: David’s two last poems (22:1–23:7) are surrounded first by accounts of his heroes’ exploits, and then by two stories of disaster (famine and plague) and resolution, in which God finally “lets-himself-be-entreated” (21:14, 24:25). This structure has been created by some chronological shifting, since Chap. 21 would have more properly fit with the battle scenes of Chap. 9."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VII; Final Matters",3,"The long poem in Chap. 22, of which a parallel text exists as Ps. 18, may be one of the oldest pieces in the Bible, as attested by its spelling and grammatical forms. It also uses ideas found both in other early Israelite poems (for example, Exod. 15 and Deut. 32–33) and in the literature of Ugarit, a city north of and flourishing earlier than Israel: a god’s impressive appearance and a king’s victory song (see Cross/Freedman for an extended treatment of our text). As with the poems at the end of Deuteronomy, the book thus moves toward its conclusion on a note of heightened rhetoric."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VII; Final Matters",4,"Likewise, David’s “last words” at the beginning of Chap. 23 present the picture of a king, not in decline, but supremely confident in his God and in himself. This short poem counterbalances the increasingly weakening figure of David, who, as the next book (Kings) opens, will be literally impotent and largely overshadowed by others in the palace."
"The Early Prophets, Samuel, Part VII; Final Matters",5,"The final narrative moments of Samuel bring some resolution to the issue of monarchy, as David accepts responsibility for the people’s suffering. They also portend a glorious future: like Avraham acquiring the Cave of Makhpela and hence a legal foothold in the land in Gen. 23, David acquires the site of the future Temple, which he had so fervently desired to build in II Sam. 7. The institution of kingship, whose rocky road the narratives of the book of Samuel have traced, seems finally to be accepted as part of the landscape, however grudgingly."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, The Kings of Israel in the Book of Kings",1,"T<small>HE EXACT CHRONOLOGY OF KINGS IN THE</small> B<small>IBLE IS NOT CERTAIN</small>. T<small>HERE HAVE</small> been many detailed attempts to square the numbers of southern and northern rulers and fix their dates; these typically deal with such issues as when in a given year a king’s reign began. Problems with the overall chronology of the kings have not been fully resolved, but a recent study by Hughes posits that this is due to there being essentially two kinds of chronologies in Kings: an earlier, fairly accurate one, based on existing chronicles, and later editorial reworkings, which may be termed “schematic.” The latter, rather than attempting to reconstruct facts, present Israel’s history as part of a divine plan, demonstrating through ordered chronology that history is meaningful. This mixture of chronologies reflects the complicated process through which the book came into being."

"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part I; Shelomo and His Kingdom",1,(I 1–11)
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part I; Shelomo and His Kingdom",2,"I<small>N</small> J<small>EWISH AND</small> C<small>HRISTIAN TRADITION</small>, S<small>HELOMO</small> (S<small>OLOMON</small>) <small>IS A FABULOUS</small> figure. Drawing not only from the Bible but also from the vast wealth of long-transmitted legends and folklore, later interpreters and the faithful masses saw in him the epitome of royal power, wealth, and, especially, wisdom. Volumes of legends were created to extol these virtues and to provide, especially for oppressed communities, a fabled past which they could dream about."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part I; Shelomo and His Kingdom",3,"Yet it is not only this morphing of Shelomo in the postbiblical period with which the reader of the book of Kings has to contend. It is the biblical portrayal itself. Typically for ancient accounts of kings, for whom there rarely existed unofficial chronicles, the Bible makes it difficult if not impossible to extract a well-rounded historical personage from the text. Additionally, the very nature of the book of Kings as a composite text presents many difficulties. And its ideological thrust naturally gets in the way of a more “objective” portrait. In the Bible, Shelomo <i>is</i> the wisest of all kings, perhaps even of all men; the material splendor he creates and amid which he reigns is unparalleled; he is ruthless, appropriately for antiquity, but pious; and he erects the most celebrated and glorious of temples."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part I; Shelomo and His Kingdom",4,"Despite the hyperbole, however, the writers of Kings have given us a picture that is at the same time somewhat balanced—perhaps not as much that of David, but evenhanded in its own way. In the spirit of Deuteronomistic writing, even this wisest of kings falters at the end, when it comes to women and idolatry. Magnifying the “good old days,” whether real or imagined, does not blind the final compiler to a larger view of the monarchic period, and in his eyes, Shelomo, as much as any of his successors, bears royal responsibility for the eventual downfall of Israel. Even amid such demonstrations as the dazzling display put on for the benefit of the Queen of Sheba, we are reminded that an Israelite king’s primary responsibility is to uphold the covenant with God. When Shelomo does this, in the earlier chapters of the book, he is praised beyond measure, but as soon as he neglects his covenantal role by worshipping gods other than Y<small>HWH</small>, the result of his marrying foreign princesses, his kingdom is “torn apart.” Ominously, this is the very verb that had been used to describe Sha’ul’s losing the crown in I Sam. 15."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part I; Shelomo and His Kingdom",5,"The reader would do well to bear in mind that Shelomo is more than simply the first fully described monarch in the book of Kings. Not only is he the son of the all-important David, but the account of his reign occupies over a quarter of the textual space of the book. So the Deuteronomistic editor(s) saw in his story a paradigm for those to come later and a reflection of both sides of kingship, the glorious and the regrettable."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part I; Shelomo and His Kingdom",6,"Concrete historical evidence is hard to come by regarding the tenth century <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>., when Shelomo is portrayed as having lived. Those who seek a solidly historical figure have long pointed to the remains of three great gates at Hazor, Gezer, and Megiddo, indications of a relatively large population, and therefore an appropriately organized bureaucracy, in Israel, and to other aspects of the biblical account—expanded borders, reports of international trade, and descriptions of the trappings of a great court—to make their case. At the other end of the spectrum, those who deny Shelomo’s historicity, whether completely or only partially, point to the difficulties of analyzing the textual and material evidence we have. Amid the general decline of Mediterranean civilizations during this time, shared also by the Near East, there is a scarcity of literary remains. The perishable nature of papyrus and parchment, which, regrettably, the Israelites tended to use rather than stone or clay, has probably rendered the possibility of discovering a written Solomonic text forever moot. At the same time, there is still some disagreement as to whether the massive building projects attributed to Shelomo belong in his century or slightly later. In any event, both the skeptics and the outright deniers see in the opening sections of Kings a projection of later generations’ own concerns and fantasies back upon an earlier time, with little reflection of an authentic tenth-century history."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part I; Shelomo and His Kingdom",7,"A possible breakthrough in the debate has recently occurred with the unearthing of a fairly sophisticated wall in the area of the Ophel in Jerusalem. This location, just above David’s city and south of the present Old City, corresponds to where Shelomo would have built, and some preliminary reports date the site to the tenth century. Whether the identification holds up, or more will be found, remains to be seen; but it is unlikely at this point that an archaeologist will discover the basement of the First Temple, or the dining room of Shelomo’s palace. And even digging at the presumed site of these buildings Kings, On the Temple Mount is so fraught with political explosiveness at present and into the foreseeable future that, should it ever occur, archaeology’s gain would surely be drowned in violence between Arabs and Israelis."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part I; Shelomo and His Kingdom",8,"We are therefore limited to our text. Like the book in which the account of Shelomo is embedded, our section in its present form, Chaps. 1-11, is arranged in a chiastic, ring arrangement. The king’s youthful accession and elderly misbehavior sit at the outer ends, with his wisdom and wealth further in, but it is finally his crowning achievement—the building of the Temple—that is solidly placed at the all-important center. That is what the biblical writers, or at least editors, wanted to emphasize."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On the Temple",1,"D<small>ESPITE THE ABSENCE OF MATERIAL REMAINS</small>, <small>THE FAMOUS STRUCTURE WHICH</small> the Bible attributes to Shelomo, known traditionally as Solomon’s Temple or the First Temple, is of central importance in the book of Kings and in Israelite thought, both before and after the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>. As encountered in I Kings 6–8 and elsewhere, the Temple had three main functions: <i>religious</i>, as a means for obtaining forgiveness and atonement from Y<small>HWH</small>; <i>political</i>, as a visible symbol of Shelomo’s grandeur; and <i>ideological</i>, as a locus for the important triad of God, king, and city."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On the Temple",2,"The purely religious aspect of the Temple is an echo of the extended description of the Dwelling (or Tabernacle) and its attendant sacrificial cult in the central sections of the Torah, Exod. 25–Num. 10 and beyond. (See “On Animal Sacrifice” in my <i>The Five Books of Moses</i>.) As was the case with the earlier sanctuary, the symmetry of the Temple structure is significant, pointing to the perfection of God through its use of balanced measurements. The basic scheme of the Temple is also identical to that of the Dwelling: a large rectangle divided into two squares, with the innermost one being the “Holiest Holy-Place” or Shrine, housing either the Coffer (Ark) or later, apparently, nothing at all, in contrast to the divine statuary of surrounding cultures. The Temple’s sacrificial system and priestly hierarchy also mirror the symbolism and function of the wilderness shrine. Our text contains a long prayer uttered by the king (I Kings 8), in which the rationale for the Temple’s existence is spelled out. Even though much of this chapter may have been written considerably later, it does function to set the Temple apart from the Dwelling on a rhetorical level."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On the Temple",3,"The key element in the Temple’s religious function is Israel’s relationship to its God through animal and grain sacrifice, with accompanying prayers. If not offered properly, or in their absence, the immediate result is understood to be the critical loss of communication between the human and divine. One can thus grasp the terrible despair experienced by the Israelites in the sixth-century <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>. Babylonian Exile, well expressed in books such as Lamentations, in which the community bewailed the loss of the Temple, seen as a chief means of contact with God."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On the Temple",4,"The reader of these chapters in Kings will not fail to note the very large dimensions and sizes of the objects described. The two great columns flanking the entrance to the Temple, for instance, are portrayed as being over thirty feet tall; the winged-sphinx throne in the inner sanctum would have been fifteen feet in height. This reflects a well-known tendency in ancient societies to construct the earthly abode of the gods as befitting their power; famously, a pagan temple unearthed in 1976 at ’Ain Dara in Syria has a giant footprint, presumably belonging to the goddess Ishtar, in front of the portal."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On the Temple",5,"Politically, Kings sets both the initial description of the building process and the Temple structure itself in the context of Shelomo’s wealth and accomplishments. Just as his table is sumptuous, his provisions massive, his borders expansive, his bureaucrats numerous, his wisdom world-famous, and his overall building plans ambitious, so too his Temple is portrayed as memorable on all counts. Prized cedar wood has to be imported in great quantities from Lebanon; the structure is inlaid with gold throughout; and all Israel is impressed into building service, with crucial agricultural manpower being depleted in order to fuel the building project. Thus, as with kings in all societies, ancient and medieval, the expense and magnificence of a religious building also function as a symbol of royal power."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On the Temple",6,"Perhaps most important in the larger ancient Near Eastern context is the Temple’s anchoring function as a great ideological symbol of the bond among deity, dynasty, and capital city. The Temple makes the royal house and Jerusalem inseparable in their confirmation by Y<small>HWH</small>. As Levenson (1987) has shown, the Temple Mount (Tziyyon/Zion) comes to substitute totally for Mount Sinai, where Y<small>HWH</small> had come down in fire to speak to the Israelites and give them his laws. In other words, the city on a hill now takes the place of the sacred mountain of revelation, and the king in some sense takes the place of Moshe (alternatively, he serves as the earthly representative of the divine king). In smiling upon David’s dynasty, located in Jerusalem, the city of the “House of Y<small>HWH</small>,” God re-creates the idealized situation portrayed at Sinai. There, receiving and keeping the covenant was to protect the Israelites in their wanderings; here, the existence and functioning of the Temple is to preserve them in their land, betokening divine protection from hostile neighbors and assurance of material prosperity."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On the Temple",7,"Physically, the Temple as described in Kings would have been larger than any other contemporary building in the ancient Near East. Its size, combined with its central and elevated location in Jerusalem, must have given strong support to the idea that Y<small>HWH</small> was overseeing the king and the people and allowing his presence to dwell among them. This certainly would have strengthened the existing institutions of monarchy and priesthood, both of which were understood to uphold the stability of society, and assured their own power in the political realm. A similar arrangement prevailed all over the ancient Near East."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On the Temple",8,"With all the emphasis Kings, On the Temple as a potent, multifaceted symbol, some caution should be exercised as to its place in the hearts of average Israelites in the monarchic period. Some scholars have theorized that the Temple may have been quite secondary to these folk, focused as they were on the hardships of everyday existence on the not always fertile soil of Israel. Its version of the sacrificial cult may also not have been exactly what was done at local shrines, which, as the book of Kings and prophetic texts demonstrate, played an equally if not more significant role in daily life. Kings does not portray a centralized cult until the days of Hizkiyyahu’s reform in the late eighth century, and the Northern Kingdom’s appropriation of the Temple’s function in new sanctuaries at Dan and Bet-El, after Shelomo’s death, gives strong evidence of varied local traditions, identified in the Bible as pagan or at the very least syncretistic (combining gods from different systems). A stronger sense of common purpose probably obtained after the exiles returned from Babylonian Exile and rebuilt the Temple on a more modest scale, at the end of the sixth century. It was subsequently expanded into its more renowned form by Herod the Great in the late first century <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>. It is this “Second” Temple to which later, nascent Judaism and Christianity most readily related, especially after its destruction by the Romans in 70 <small>C</small>.<small>E</small>."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On the Temple",9,"The detailed description of the construction of the Temple in I Kings 6–7 has proved somewhat of a puzzle to interpreters, including modern scholars. For traditionalists, it is an exact blueprint, with final details to be filled in by ancient and medieval authorities. However, many of the technical terms used in the text are no longer clear, and it is difficult to come up with any kind of exact rendering. Over the centuries, artists have striven to portray the Temple, but more often than not they have created it in the architectural image of their own era. More fruitfully, other interpreters have focused on what are taken to be symbolic aspects of the structure and its appurtenances, noting, for instance, that the molten “sea” of I Kings 7:23–26 is not only a giant basin for the priests’ washing but may also be a representation of primeval cosmic waters, appropriate in a House of God. Others have connected such varied information as the conspicuous floral decorations, the winged-sphinxes on the Coffer (Ark), and the Gihon spring near Jerusalem to the appearance of these in the Garden of Eden story of Gen. 2–3, thus suggesting that the Temple recalls the “perfect” world before the expulsion of the First Parents."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On the Temple",10,"Recent help in conceptualizing the Temple physically comes from archaeology. Several sites excavated in Syria have uncovered structures which, while considerably smaller, conform to the basic features of the biblical Temple. Dever (2001) has listed the similarities, which include a three-part, successive floor plan, socalled dressed stones, alternating courses of stone and wood (to provide extra earthquake protection), decorations such as lions, “cherubs,” and pomegranates, and decorated braziers for providing light. These are but a few of the common features. Dever thus understands the Solomonic structure as strongly akin to regional Bronze and Iron Age temples, making it highly unlikely that it was “invented” in the fantasy of much later (i.e., Hellenistic) writers who, some have asserted, were seeking to restore Israel’s lost glory."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On the Temple",11,"But the Temple and its builder, as presented in the opening section of Kings, transcend whatever mundane realities may have existed in tenth-century Israel. The book has fixed them forever as potent symbols of a Golden Age, and, as such, they have fired the imagination of Jews and Christians for millennia."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part II; The Split; Kings North and South",1,(I 12:1–16:22)
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part II; The Split; Kings North and South",2,"S<small>HELOMO’S DEATH IS FOLLOWED BY AN EVENT THAT FLOWED FROM THE NATURAL</small> geographical and economic conditions of the land of Israel: the splitting of his little empire into two independent kingdoms. While the Bible’s overall explanation for this fateful event is Shelomo’s idolatry in old age, the immediate impetus for the political fracture is his son Rehav’am’s shortcomings as a ruler, following hard on the rigors of Shelomo’s extensive building program. But the writers are also at pains to make clear that the new king of the north, Yorov’am, commits a grave act of rebellion against Y<small>HWH</small> by establishing rival sanctuaries to the Jerusalem Temple and constructing molten calves of gold. Scholars note that, from the perspective of northern practice, these and other cultic acts of Yorov’am do not actually constitute idol worship, but the text is written from a southern point of view, and hence Yorov’am emerges as a kind of model sinner. From this point on in chronicling events in the north, the text will compare every one of its kings to this first one, emphasizing how virtually all of them continued in his nefarious tradition. And, as Cogan (2001) points out, only two of them will die a peaceful death: Omri and Yehu, both of whom will found dynasties. It is as if the Northern Kingdom is doomed from the start because of Yorov’am’s deeds."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part II; The Split; Kings North and South",3,"With the rift accomplished, the bulk of Israel’s history on the land is presented in the form of two parallel accounts which alternate but are at the same time interwoven. As background it should be noted that the Northern Kingdom of Israel, large, fertile, and prosperous, lay closer to the eastern lands of the Fertile Crescent, and thus was involved in greater economic and cultural interaction with other civilizations. In contrast, the Southern Kingdom of Judah, with its rocky hills and relative isolation, was, at least corresponding to this point in the narrative, less prominent in both text and historical record."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part II; The Split; Kings North and South",4,"The dynastic history of Israel recounted in Kings is a troubled one, marked by frequent changes in rulership brought about through coups and assassinations. While the standard Assyrian reference to the north by the name Bit Humri, “The House of Omri,” does not reflect the complex picture that emerges from biblical texts, it does demonstrate the prominence of that particular dynasty, and Kings is at pains to describe its rise and fall."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part II; The Split; Kings North and South",5,"This long middle section of the book, here encompassing Parts II–IV, is punctuated by so-called regnal formulas, the descriptions of kings’ accessions and deaths by means of standardized expressions. Thus a typical king of Israel is said to come to the throne in Year X of a corresponding king of Judah’s reign, and vice versa. We are given his age on accession, the length of his reign, and often his mother’s name—an important element in a society where kings, at least, could be polygamous. More important, from the Bible’s point of view, is the evaluation that usually follows: “He did what was evil/good in the eyes of Y<small>HWH”</small> (always with either Yorov’am or David as the measuring rod), a phrase which lets us know up front how the text wishes us to evaluate the king’s tenure. At the other end of a typical reign, three things are usually noted: first, mention is made of a mysterious “Record of Yearly Events (or Annals) of the Kings of ____” for any further information we may require; second, the king’s death, if peaceful, is described in the phrase “he lay beside his fathers”; and third, the name of his successor, usually his son, is noted. These formulaic phrases provide coherence to a long series of narratives, and also enable the text to occasionally moderate its black-and-white stance by deviating slightly from the standard phrasing. So, for example, there are passages such as II 14:3–4, where"
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part II; The Split; Kings North and South",6,He [Amatzyahu] did what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>—
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part II; The Split; Kings North and South",7,"however, not like David his father;"
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part II; The Split; Kings North and South",8,"exactly as Yoash his father had done, he did."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part II; The Split; Kings North and South",9,"However, the sanctuaries were not removed;"
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part II; The Split; Kings North and South",10,the people still were offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke at the sanctuaries.
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part III; Omrides and Prophets",1,(I 16:23–22:54)
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part III; Omrides and Prophets",2,(II 1-13)
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part III; Omrides and Prophets",3,"T<small>HE HEART OF THE BOOK OF</small> K<small>INGS CONCERNS THE RISE AND FALL OF ONE</small> northern dynasty, the House of Omri, and the careers of two great prophets, Eliyyahu and Elisha, who rail against it. These events and personalities dominate the bulk of the narratives about the ninth century, a period of complex interactions among the kingdoms of Israel, Judah, Moav, and Aram (Syria) and their attempt to cope with the threat of Assyria to the northeast."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part III; Omrides and Prophets",4,"The biblical text at this point is filled with battles, assassinations, and other events which are, however, not always clearly set out; as an example, scholarly opinion is somewhat divided on the identity of the king known as Yehoram or Yoram (II Kings 8). The Bible seems more interested in the prophetic figures than in the royal ones, perhaps out of a desire to show how the later prophets such as Isaiah and Jeremiah have a long and distinguished spiritual lineage."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part III; Omrides and Prophets",5,"The House of Omri were singularly accomplished as builders. To Omri himself is attributed the founding and building up of Shomeron (Samaria) as the capital of the north, into a city which archaeology has revealed to have been quite impressive. His son Ah’av (Ahab), famous for his confrontations with Eliyyahu, probably built the palaces and stables at Megiddo, and is credited with having constructed an ivory palace in I 22:39. The Bible grudgingly mentions these accomplishments, which could not be entirely ignored, but places more emphasis on these kings’ straying from the covenant, particularly so in the case of Ah’av, whose politically canny marriage with the Phoenician princess Izevel is condemned by the biblical text in the strongest possible terms. Thus Israel’s relations with foreign powers, so natural and necessary in everyday political and economic reality, is seen instead by the Bible as the source of idolatry and hence of most of Israel’s problems."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part III; Omrides and Prophets",6,"The narratives in this section are colorful and dramatic, and, amid all the male bravado, feature two powerful women as villainesses. Izevel, whose name (English, “Jezebel”) came to be synonymous with a dangerous female, is the very personification of the Enemy in the Bible, as she brings into her marriage hundreds of priests of Baal and Ashera. Those deities become Y<small>HWH’s</small> chief rivals for the hearts of the Israelites. In a text that rarely gives space to queens, Izevel is more than a match for most of the Israelite kings, including her husband. The other female figure, Atalya, demonstrates that a Queen Mother could occasionally come to power. Her six-year reign in Judah ends in her execution, as had the Israelite career of Izevel."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Eliyyahu and Elisha",1,(II 1-13)
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Eliyyahu and Elisha",2,"See also Kings I 17:1-22:54; I<small>T IS SIGNIFICANT THAT</small> E<small>LIYYAHU AND</small> E<small>LISHA LITERALLY OCCUPY CENTER STAGE</small> in the book of Kings. Central here too is the political setting, a plot which could be described as the Fall of the House of Omri (see Savran). The background is in fact both social and religious. This period of Israelite history has been described as a departure from the traditional control of Israelite society by small highland agrarian communities and clans in favor of a centralized urban elite seizing power. It is thus a story that, in one way or another, rings familiar in many societies up to the present day. Not surprisingly, in the biblical setting Eliyyahu and Elisha frequently represent the interests of the poor. Their stories are peopled with widows, the sick, and the mass of Israelites affected by famine and oppression (Renteria). In this sense they are most likely an authentic memory of a society in transition, and, rather than being a court-based narrative, may have their roots in a more popular reaction to events. Such accounts often feature miracle workers—the hallmark of what is sometimes called “popular religion”—who through their deeds stand in for the powerless peasants. One need only think of stories about saints in various cultures. In Kings, this intervention for the disenfranchised is always understood as coming from Y<small>HWH</small>, whereas the powers that be, the kings and nobles, are usually linked to Baal and other Canaanite deities such as Ashera. So the bitter struggles undergone by Eliyyahu and Elisha are an indication that religion is not merely a matter of theological principles. And the thrust of these stories suggests that they may have originated in prophetic circles, to be later incorporated in archival and other types of material that appear in Kings."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Eliyyahu and Elisha",3,"At the same time, it should be noted that they have not merely been placed in the middle of a narrative unthinkingly. The tales around Eliyyahu and Elisha also provide backing for the revolt and dynasty of Yehu. As Renteria shows, Elisha not only champions the poor but, in his dealings with royalty, also acts as a middleman between classes, in a time of transition."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Eliyyahu and Elisha",4,"Of all the figures that appear in Kings, none is as powerful, or mysterious, as the prophet Eliyyahu. He appears as if from nowhere, mediates miraculous deeds, and inserts the word of Y<small>HWH</small> into the political events of the region. Moreover, his final spectacular disappearance leads ultimately to his transformation for generations of Jews, Christians, and Muslims into an even larger figure in religious literature and folklore."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Eliyyahu and Elisha",5,"In the text of Kings, the portrayal of Eliyyahu touches on a number of themes. As a personality, he is utterly devoted to his task as prophet and is therefore, not surprisingly, a deeply solitary figure. He is constantly on the move, argues with God, and almost succumbs to despair. He also stands up to royalty, at peril of his life, especially in Chap. 21, the story of Navot’s vineyard. In all these aspects, he introduces the classic prophetic persona to Kings. While in this book we have previously encountered figures such as Natan and Ahiyya, they do not have the force of personality and stature we come to identify with the “literary” prophets such as Yirmiyahu (Jeremiah) and Yehezkel (Ezekiel). Eliyyahu, on the other hand, is clearly their forerunner."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Eliyyahu and Elisha",6,"At the same time, Eliyyahu belongs substantially to an earlier expression of prophecy well known in the ancient world, including in Greece. This takes the form not of long, inspired poetic speeches such as we find later in the Bible, but largely of ecstatic, “mantic” behavior. In the typical pattern, bands or guilds of holy men (see the last Eliyyahu chapter, II Kings 2, or the earlier accounts of Sha’ul in I Sam. 9 and 10) travel around and are frequently seized by the divine spirit, “ranting like prophets.” Eliyyahu’s sudden appearances and breathtaking travels, not to mention his other, often miraculous feats, likewise suggest mantic prophecy."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Eliyyahu and Elisha",7,"Looming in the background of the Eliyyahu stories is an earlier figure: Moshe. Especially toward the end of the cycle, in the prophet’s sojourn at Sinai and his final crossing of the divided waters of the Jordan, the text clearly recalls Israel’s great founder. Rather in the mode of modern political campaigns, the evoking of an earlier founding father appears intended to send a strong message to a generation in trouble."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Eliyyahu and Elisha",8,"The narratives about Eliyyahu give evidence of a memorable personality, solidly rooted in its early biblical setting. As noted above, in the Bible’s after-history his larger-than-life persona expanded to greater roles in the three Western religions. In Judaism, Eliyyahu took on the function of guardian angel, messenger of God, and settler of disputes, especially to the Talmudic rabbis and, over a millennium later, to the Hasidic masters. He also became a ubiquitous figure at ritual occasions, including circumcision and the Passover meal. Following later biblical imagery (in Mal. 4), he came to be seen as the herald of the Messiah. Christianity, principally in the New Testament, honors Eliyyahu as one of the figures present at Jesus’s Transfiguration; accompanied by Moshe, he is usually taken to represent the Prophets. Finally, Islam continues some of the biblical themes about Eliyyahu, and some traditions also identify him with Al-Khidr, “The Green One,” who is a transformative figure."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Eliyyahu and Elisha",9,"The prophet Elisha, who does not quite share Eliyyahu’s biblical and enduring charisma, nonetheless occupies more space than his master in the text of Kings. He does resemble Eliyyahu in his uncompromising nature; in addition, he works parallel miracles and similarly speaks truth to power. If anything, he is more stern than Eliyyahu, as witnessed by numerous episodes resulting in death—even of youngsters, if need be (II Kings 2:23–24). Despite all this, one could argue that Elisha has never fully taken root in postbiblical popular imagination. Perhaps this is due to the absence of scenes in which he is in dialogue with God, or to the plethora of other characters, major and minor, who draw attention away from him. Regardless, the stories about him in Kings deal with an important period in the history of the Northern Kingdom and further clarify prophetic concerns."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Eliyyahu and Elisha",10,"Elisha’s career spans the reigns of several northern kings and sees the fulfillment of a number of Eliyyahu’s tasks regarding royal succession. As Bergen points out, Elisha does not pose the threat to monarchy itself that his master does; rather, he serves to reinforce that monarchy is an acceptable system, within limits imposed by God. His miracles extend once again to the poor and even to prophetic guilds in trouble. A number of the narratives about him are quite brief but highlight desperate, life-and-death problems; the longer ones typically involve extended interactions with kings. Here too the prophet is depicted as a wonder worker and a master of symbolic actions."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Eliyyahu and Elisha",11,"The Elisha stories may have originated in the north (his and Elijah’s tales are written in a northern accent, so to speak) and been brought to Judah after Israel’s destruction in 722. In their present position, they certainly signal a strong prophetic presence in the overall stories of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part IV; Southern and Northern Kings; Destruction I",1,(II 14–17)
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part IV; Southern and Northern Kings; Destruction I",2,"W<small>ITH THE DEATH OF</small> E<small>LISHA AND THE FALL OF THE</small> O<small>MRIDE DYNASTY, THE TEXT</small> settles into narrating a depressing succession of rulers in both kingdoms, culminating with the fall of the Northern Kingdom after a revolt against Assyria in 722. Prominently featured are the formulas mentioned previously—dates, age at accession, length of reign, mother’s name, and, most important, whether or not the king did “what was good in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>.” The chief events reported are military ones, with occasional forays into palace coups. But there is not much material on the actual lives of the Israelites, or even of the kings themselves. This is striking, considering that for the first half of the eighth century, both Israel and Judah were ruled over for long periods of time by a single king apiece, Azarya in the south and Yorov’am II in the north. At the beginning of Chap. 15, the account of Azarya’s fifty-two-year reign mentions only two facts: that he did not remove the oft-condemned local sanctuaries, and that, as a result, he was stricken with a plague and confined to the royal palace for an untold period of time. Regarding Yorov’am as well, a king whose reign witnessed economic prosperity (for the rich, at any rate), there are only a few verses, mentioning his military exploits but, more important, condemning him for doing evil in God’s sight."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part IV; Southern and Northern Kings; Destruction I",3,"The pattern of synchronic, alternating histories such as we find in these chapters has a parallel in Assyrian records; just as there, Assyria takes primacy over Babylonia, so here Judah predominates over Israel (Cogan/Tadmor). And the events reported in this part of Kings are for the most part corroborated by other ancient Near Eastern sources."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part IV; Southern and Northern Kings; Destruction I",4,"The bulk of this section is devoted to Chap. 17, which, after a cursory description of the fall of Shomeron, goes on at great length about the meaning and aftermath of the Northern Kingdom’s demise (see Commentary to that chapter)."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part IV; Southern and Northern Kings; Destruction I",5,"Historically speaking, for several decades preceding the middle of the eighth century, Assyria had been in decline, but beginning with the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III in 742, there was a resumption of its military aggressiveness. As Hallo/Simpson note, it was not unusual for a revolt to follow a change of rulers, and this may have provided some impetus for the king’s western campaigns. The result would have been destruction of much of the Israelite Northern Kingdom before Tiglath-Pileser’s final act, the siege of Shomeron (Samaria)."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part V; Judah As Vassal and Rebel; Destruction II",1,(II 18–25)
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part V; Judah As Vassal and Rebel; Destruction II",2,"A<small>T THIS POINT, AS IS OBVIOUS FROM THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER, INTERNATIONAL</small> power politics play a dominant role in the history of ancient Israel. From 722 to 587 <small>B.C.E.</small>, the time period that covers all but the last paragraph of the book of Kings, Judah’s every political move is scrutinized and reacted to by the great empires of the ancient Near East. On the one hand, this means that the reader must pay close attention to whether a particular Judean king is cooperating with Assyria/Babylonia (or Egypt, also flexing its power) or trying to break free. On the other hand, the biblical text’s chief concern is still the degree to which a given Judean king is faithful to the covenant."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part V; Judah As Vassal and Rebel; Destruction II",3,"The historical setting at the beginning of this section is the Neo-Assyrian empire in its last century. Under its powerful kings Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal, Assyria extended its grip over much of the Near East, including what today is Iraq, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and parts of Iran, Turkey, and Armenia. Its spectacular capital at Nineveh, near modern Mosul in northern Iraq, which included one of the great libraries of antiquity, gave further evidence of its power; palace reliefs and sculptures testify to a high level of artistic accomplishment. Many of these pieces can be viewed today in the British Museum."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part V; Judah As Vassal and Rebel; Destruction II",4,"The book of Kings, for its own purposes, reflects both the language and the psychological force of Assyrian power in the speeches attributed to their officials before the gates of a besieged Jerusalem in II 18–19. But it also counters it with its own weapons, divine words, and action in the subsequent rescue of Jerusalem."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part V; Judah As Vassal and Rebel; Destruction II",5,"Kings chooses to remain largely silent on Assyria over the decades that follow the destruction of the Northern Kingdom, preferring instead to concentrate on the deeds of the three kings described below. But we know from Assyrian records that the seventh century saw both the zenith of their power and, after the death of Ashurbanipal in 627, a descent into internal chaos and external fragmentation. The Babylonians to the south, who held traumatic memories of the Assyrian capture of Babylon in 689, found their revenge in the sacking of Nineveh in 612."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part V; Judah As Vassal and Rebel; Destruction II",6,"Following the demise of the Assyrian Empire in 605 at the Battle of Carchemish, Babylonia succeeded to the role of dominant power in the area, lasting until its fall in turn to Persia two-thirds of a century later. Neo-Babylonian civilization was the heir to millennia of high culture, manifested in great literature such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, as well as in law, science, and architecture. It was quite possibly Babylonia where at least some of biblical literature was compiled, including the book of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part V; Judah As Vassal and Rebel; Destruction II",7,"True to type, the biblical account in these chapters is laced with reports of how one Judean king or another paid tribute to Babylonia or revolted against it. The result of the revolts was two fateful sieges of Jerusalem: a first one in 597, which resulted in both the exile of elite sections of the population and despoliation of Temple treasures, and a second one a decade later, which saw the Temple’s and the city’s destruction and thus the end of biblical Israel as a continuous independent entity."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, Part V; Judah As Vassal and Rebel; Destruction II",8,"The entire book ends with a postscript, openly dated a quarter of a century after the fall of Jerusalem. Its description of a Davidic king released from prison but not from exile holds open many possibilities, negative and positive, in keeping with the double-edged thrust of the book of Kings."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Three Kings of Judah",1,"A<small>LTHOUGH THE BOOK OF</small> K<small>INGS COVERS THE REIGNS OF THIRTY-NINE KINGS AND</small> one queen, three of Judah’s rulers who appear toward the end of the book occupy disproportionate space and thus have particular importance: Hizkiyyahu (Hezekiah), Menashe (Manasseh), and Yoshiyyahu (Josiah). While recovering precise historical information about these kings is difficult, given the ideological thrust of the biblical text and the vagueness of some passages, the way in which the Bible presents them has great interest for the overall narrative. Their portrayal in Kings posits that, despite the extensive reforms (especially the eradication of idol worship) enacted by Hizkiyyahu in the late eighth century and Yoshiyyahu in the late seventh, it is Menashe’s evil deeds which ultimately could not be overlooked or overcome, and Judah inevitably met its horrible fate of destruction and exile. In these texts one can feel a later historian, if not the wider culture itself, attempting to grapple with the question, “If Hizkiyyahu and Yoshiyyahu were so faithful and zealous in their observance of the covenant, why was Jerusalem destroyed in 587?”"
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Three Kings of Judah",2,"Historically, things may well not have been this cut and dried. Scholars note that the presentation of the three kings might be said to follow a classic ancient Near Eastern literary pattern, where good kings alternate with bad. Then, too, it is unclear how much the first reform under Hizkiyyahu has influenced the telling of the second under Yoshiyyahu, and possibly vice versa. We are thus left with, as usual, a series of memories that have been processed. The book of Chronicles, written later and perhaps using other sources, sees the history differently. It gives many more details on Hizkiyyahu’s reform, and presents a startling view of Menashe, absent in Kings, as an evildoer who, after being exiled, repented and restored his father’s covenantal loyalty."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Three Kings of Judah",3,"The reign of Hizkiyyahu, dated by many scholars from c. 715 to 687, encompasses at least two events of major importance to the biblical text: his attempt at wide- ranging religious reform and his rebellion against Assyria, which Jerusalem survived but which decimated much of the rest of Judah."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Three Kings of Judah",4,"The reform, outlined briefly at the beginning of Chap. 18, is described as involving the destruction of pagan altars around the country and the concentration of the sacrificial cult in the Jerusalem Temple. Since these ideas are central to the book of Deuteronomy, some scholars have been inclined to identify the period of Hizkiyyahu’s reign as the time of origin of much of the Deuteronomistic History (DH), which, as the reader will recall, is often bunched together with that fifth book of the Torah. This conclusion is buttressed by the undoubted emigration of northern refugees from the destruction of Israel in 722, a population which might well have brought with them the kind of northern-based traditions found in both Deuteronomy and portions of DH. In any event, it is not clear how successful Hizkiyyahu’s policy was; its accomplishments may have been played down by Josianic editors a century later, who sought to claim greater credit for their own reformer king, Yoshiyyahu (Rosenbaum)."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Three Kings of Judah",5,"Hizkiyyahu revolted against Assyria, as did some other sections of the empire such as Babylonia after the death of Sargon II in 705. This led to a ruthless campaign by the new king of Assyria, Sennacherib, who destroyed numerous Judean towns, as enduringly attested to in an astounding frieze, now displayed in the British Museum, which portrays the successful siege of the fortress city of Lachish. Assyrian texts compare Hizkiyyahu’s subsequent entrapment in a besieged Jerusalem to the situation of “a bird in a cage.” That the king and the city unexpectedly survived this potentially catastrophic situation seems to have been taken as a sign of divine favor, and may have contributed to Jerusalem’s false sense of security a century later under similarly trying circumstances."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Three Kings of Judah",6,"Another archaeological remnant of Hizkiyyahu’s kingship comprises many storage jars stamped <i>Imlk</i>, “belonging to the king,” which have been recovered at the northern and western borders of ancient Judah and dated to this period. They give evidence of preparations for the Assyrian invasion, as well as supporting the extent of the king’s control of the country, an element necessary for a major reform."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Three Kings of Judah",7,"Most intriguing, and historically valuable, are the two major material remains of the period: the Siloam water tunnel with its famous inscription describing the two teams of workers finally meeting (although some scholars have now dated this to Menashe’s reign), and the remnant of the so-called Broad Wall of Jerusalem, over twenty feet wide. It is clear that the defense preparation and expansion of the capital city are among the truly enduring of Hizkiyyahu’s accomplishments. Jerusalem as we come to know it in the Bible, substantially expanded up the western hill from the small city of David and Solomon, is basically Hizkiyyahu’s city."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Three Kings of Judah",8,"As indicated above, in Menashe the writers of Kings found their last great villain (earlier ones in the book had been Yorov’am and Ah’av). His reign encompasses most of the first half of the seventh century, in a time of relative quiet in the Assyrian Empire (the destruction of Babylon in 689 notwithstanding). Our book goes to great lengths to excoriate Menashe’s restoration of pagan worship in Jerusalem. This was undoubtedly a return to earlier popular forms of religion in Judah and not an attempt to curry favor with the Assyrians, who normally did not impose their religion on their foreign subjects. Whatever the historical realities, Menashe as we encounter him in Kings is, covenantally speaking, a monster; the fact that he also “filledjerusalem with blood” seems almost to be an afterthought. From DH’s standpoint, he is the inheritor of the heretical mantle of Ah’av, and seals Jerusalem’s fate, which will not be played out until over a half century after his death, just as Ah’av’s punishment was postponed onto the next generation. In both cases, one senses a writer or writers struggling to understand the meaning of historical events. The destruction of Jerusalem in 587 urgently needed an explanation, especially after Yoshiyyahu’s striking reform, and the memory of Menashe, sandwiched between that of the two great reformer kings, provided a focus. As mentioned above, the later book of Chronicles, with its own agenda, presents Menashe in a much better light, and lays the blame for the fall of Jerusalem on the generation of the destruction (see II Chron. 36:14–16)."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Three Kings of Judah",9,"With Yoshiyyahu, we encounter a figure whose importance in Israelite thought and history transcends his own time. The text has him come to the throne as a child, around 640; although he does not reach the age of forty, his reign witnesses a momentous historical shift in the entire region, including the fall of the Assyrian capital Nineveh and the rise of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. But the biblical text is most interested in Yoshiyyahu’s reform, which is described as sweeping and is studded with dramatic events: the destruction of pagan shrines, the observance of Passover after a centuries-long hiatus, and the cleaning up of the Temple, which includes the finding of the document termed “the Record of the Instruction of Moshe.”"
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Three Kings of Judah",10,"The reform itself seems ultimately to have failed; in any case, the great hopes pinned on Yoshiyyahu as the revived David were cut short by his ill-advised military move up to Megiddo, where the book of Kings reports that he was slain by the Egyptian king in an attempt to inject himself into international power politics."
"The Early Prophets, Kings, On Three Kings of Judah",11,"In Kings, Yoshiyyahu is the Last Great Hope of Judah. The praise heaped on him may reflect a new and strongly nationalistic energy in the wake of Assyria’s decline and fall, a development which has led many scholars to view his reign as the occasion for compiling the book of Joshua. Seen by the text as the incomparable echo of David, Yoshiyyahu is faithful to Y<small>HWH</small> in the extreme, in fulfillment of a prophecy which we encountered earlier (I Kings 13:2); his ruthless purging of non-Y<small>HWH</small> sanctuaries as the text describes it made a lasting impression on later Western culture as well. Equally important, the “discovery” of what may well have been the core of Deuteronomy (22:8ff.) suggests for many scholars that a good deal of what came to be the Early Prophets was written or edited during his reign. The debate rages on as to whether the writing/editing began under Hizkiyyahu, as I hinted at above, but the general circumstances favorable to the production of much of the text appears, in the mind of many scholars, to fit well in the waning days of monarchic Judah. Assessing the later contribution of the exilic period in this regard remains a matter of vigorous discussion among scholars."
