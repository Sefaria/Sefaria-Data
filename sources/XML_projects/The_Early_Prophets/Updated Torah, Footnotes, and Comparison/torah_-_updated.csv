Genesis 1 1,"At the beginning of God’s creating<br>of the heavens and the earth,"
Genesis 1 2,"when the earth was Confusion and Chaos,<br>darkness over the face of Ocean,<br>rushing-spirit of God hovering over the face of the waters—"
Genesis 1 3,God said: Let there be light! And there was light.
Genesis 1 4,God saw the light: that it was good.<br>God separated the light from the darkness.
Genesis 1 5,"God called the light: Day, and the darkness he called: Night.<br>There was setting, there was dawning: day one."
Genesis 1 6,"God said:<br>Let there be a dome amid the waters,<br>and let it separate waters from waters!"
Genesis 1 7,God made the dome<br>and separated the waters that were below the dome from the waters that were above the dome.<br>It was so.
Genesis 1 8,"God called the dome: The Heavens.<br>There was setting, there was dawning: second day."
Genesis 1 9,"God said:<br>Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one place,<br>and let the dry land be seen!<br>It was so."
Genesis 1 10,"God called the dry land: Earth, and the gathering of the waters he called: Seas.<br>And God saw that it was good."
Genesis 1 11,"God said:<br>Let the earth sprout forth with sprouting-growth,<br>plants seeding forth seeds, fruit trees yielding fruit, after their kind, in which is their seed, on the earth!<br>It was so."
Genesis 1 12,"The earth brought forth sprouting-growth,<br>plants seeding forth seeds, after their kind,<br>trees yielding fruit, in which is their seed, after their kind.<br>And God saw that it was good."
Genesis 1 13,"There was setting, there was dawning: third day."
Genesis 1 14,"God said:<br>Let there be lights in the dome of the heavens, to separate the day from the night,<br>that they may be for signs—for set-times, for days and years,"
Genesis 1 15,"and let them be for lights in the dome of the heavens, to provide light upon the earth!<br>It was so."
Genesis 1 16,"God made the two great lights,<br>the greater light for ruling the day and the smaller light for ruling the night,<br>and the stars."
Genesis 1 17,God placed them in the dome of the heavens
Genesis 1 18,"to provide light upon the earth, to rule the day and the night, to separate the light from the darkness.<br>And God saw that it was good."
Genesis 1 19,"There was setting, there was dawning: fourth day."
Genesis 1 20,"God said:<br>Let the waters swarm with a swarm of living beings, and let flying-birds fly above the earth, across the dome of the heavens!"
Genesis 1 21,"So God created the great sea-serpents<br>and all living beings that crawl about, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind,<br>and all winged birds after their kind.<br>And God saw that it was good."
Genesis 1 22,"And God blessed them, saying:<br>Bear fruit and be many and fill the waters in the seas,<br>and let the birds be many on earth!"
Genesis 1 23,"There was setting, there was dawning: fifth day."
Genesis 1 24,"God said:<br>Let the earth bring forth living beings after their kind,<br>herd-animals, crawling things, and the wildlife of the earth after their kind!<br>It was so."
Genesis 1 25,"God made the wildlife of the earth after their kind, and the herd-animals after their kind, and all crawling things of the soil after their kind.<br>And God saw that it was good."
Genesis 1 26,"God said:<br>Let us make humankind, in our image, according to our likeness!<br>They shall have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, animals, all the earth, and all crawling things that crawl about on the earth!"
Genesis 1 27,"So God created humankind in his image,<br>in the image of God did he create it,<br>male and female he created them."
Genesis 1 28,"God blessed them,<br>and God said to them:<br>Bear fruit and be many and fill the earth<br>and subdue it!<br>Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, and all living things that crawl about on the earth!"
Genesis 1 29,"And God said:<br>Here, I give you<br>all plants seeding forth seeds that are upon the face of all the earth,<br>and all trees in which there is tree fruit seeding forth seeds;<br>for you shall they be, for eating,"
Genesis 1 30,"and also for all the living things of the earth, for all the birds of the heavens, for all crawling about on the earth in which there is living being—<br>all green plants for eating.<br>It was so."
Genesis 1 31,"Now God saw all that he had made,<br>and here, it was exceedingly good!<br>There was setting, there was dawning: the sixth day."
Genesis 2 1,"Thus were finished the heavens and the earth, with all of their array."
Genesis 2 2,"God had finished, on the seventh day, his work that he had made,<br>and then he ceased, on the seventh day, from all his work that he had made."
Genesis 2 3,"God gave the seventh day his blessing, and he hallowed it,<br>for on it he ceased from all his work, that by creating, God had made."
Genesis 2 4,"These are the begettings of the heavens and the earth: their being created.<br> At the time of <small>YHWH</small> God’s making of earth and heaven,"
Genesis 2 5,"no bush of the field was yet on earth,<br>no plant of the field had yet sprung up,<br>for <small>YHWH</small> God had not made it rain upon the earth,<br>and there was no human/<i>adam</i> to work the ground/<i>adama</i>—"
Genesis 2 6,but a surge would well up from the earth and water all the face of the ground.
Genesis 2 7,"And <small>YHWH</small> God formed the human, of dust from the ground;<br>he blew into his nostrils the breath of life<br>and the human became a living being."
Genesis 2 8,"<small>YHWH</small> God planted a garden in Eden/Land-of-Pleasure, in the east,<br>and there he placed the human whom he had formed."
Genesis 2 9,"And <small>YHWH</small> God caused to spring up from the ground<br>every type of tree, desirable to look at and good to eat,<br>and the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden<br>and the Tree of the Knowing of Good and Evil."
Genesis 2 10,"Now a river goes out from Eden, to water the garden,<br>and from there it divides and becomes four stream-heads."
Genesis 2 11,"The name of the first one is Pishon/Spreader—that is the one that goes around all the land of Havila, where gold is;"
Genesis 2 12,"the gold of that land is good, there too are bdellium and the precious-stone carnelian."
Genesis 2 13,The name of the second river is Gihon/Gusher—that is the one that goes around all the land of Cush.
Genesis 2 14,The name of the third river is Hiddekel/Tigris—that is the one that goes to the east of Assyria.<br>And the fourth river—that is Perat/Euphrates.
Genesis 2 15,"<small>YHWH</small> God took the human and set him in the garden of Eden,<br>to work it and to watch it."
Genesis 2 16,"And <small>YHWH</small> God commanded concerning the human, saying:<br>From every [other] tree of the garden you may eat, yes, eat,"
Genesis 2 17,"but from the Tree of the Knowing of Good and Evil—<br>you are not to eat from it,<br>for on the day that you eat from it, you must die, yes, die!"
Genesis 2 18,<small>YHWH</small> God said:<br>It is not good for the human to be alone;<br>I will make him a helper corresponding to him.
Genesis 2 19,"So <small>YHWH</small> God formed from the ground all the wildlife of the field and all the birds of the heavens<br>and brought [each] to the human, to see what he would call it;<br>and whatever the human called it as a living being, that became its name."
Genesis 2 20,"The human called out names for all the herd-animals and for the birds of the heavens and for all the wildlife of the field,<br>but for the human, there could not be found a helper corresponding to him."
Genesis 2 21,"So <small>YHWH</small> God caused a deep slumber to fall upon the human, so that he slept;<br>then he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place."
Genesis 2 22,And <small>YHWH</small> God built the rib that he had taken from the human into a woman<br>and brought her to the human.
Genesis 2 23,"The human said:<br>This-time, she-is-it!<br>Bone from my bones<br>and flesh from my flesh!<br>She shall be called: Woman/<i>Isha,</i><br>for from Man/<i>Ish</i> she was taken!"
Genesis 2 24,"Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife,<br>and they become one flesh."
Genesis 2 25,"Now the two of them, the human and his wife, were nude, yet they were not ashamed."
Genesis 3 1,Now the snake was more shrewd than all the living-things of the field that <small>YHWH</small> God had made.<br>It said to the woman:<br>Even though God said: You are not to eat from any of the trees in the garden . . . !
Genesis 3 2,"The woman said to the snake:<br>From the fruit of the [other] trees in the garden we may eat,"
Genesis 3 3,"but from the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden,<br>God has said:<br>You are not to eat from it and you are not to touch it,<br>lest you die!"
Genesis 3 4,"The snake said to the woman:<br>Die, you will not die!"
Genesis 3 5,"Rather, God knows<br>that on the day that you eat from it, your eyes will be opened<br>and you will become like gods, knowing good and evil."
Genesis 3 6,"The woman saw<br>that the tree was good for eating<br>and that it was a delight to the eyes,<br>and the tree was desirable to contemplate.<br>She took from its fruit and ate<br>and gave also to her husband beside her,<br>and he ate."
Genesis 3 7,And the eyes of the two of them were opened<br>and they knew [then]<br>that they were nude.<br>They sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
Genesis 3 8,"They heard the sound of <small>YHWH</small> God [who was] walking about in the garden at the breezy-time of the day.<br>And the human and his wife hid themselves from the face of <small>YHWH</small> God, amid the trees of the garden."
Genesis 3 9,<small>YHWH</small> God called to the human and said to him:<br>Where are you?
Genesis 3 10,"He said:<br>I heard the sound of you in the garden and I was afraid, because I am nude,<br>and so I hid myself."
Genesis 3 11,"He said:<br>Who told you that you are nude?<br>From the tree about which I commanded you not to eat,<br>have you eaten?"
Genesis 3 12,"The human said:<br>The woman whom you gave to be beside me, she gave me from the tree,<br>and so I ate."
Genesis 3 13,"<small>YHWH</small> God said to the woman:<br>What, now, have you done?<br>The woman said:<br>The snake enticed me,<br>and so I ate."
Genesis 3 14,"<small>YHWH</small> God said to the snake:<br>Because you have done this,<br>cursed be you from all the animals and from all the wildlife of the field;<br>on your belly shall you walk and dust shall you eat, all the days of your life."
Genesis 3 15,"Enmity will I put between you and the woman, between your seed and her seed:<br>they will bruise you on the head, and you will bruise them in the heel!"
Genesis 3 16,"To the woman he said:<br>I will multiply, multiply your pain [from] your pregnancy;<br>with pains shall you bear children.<br>Toward your husband will be your lust, yet he will rule over you."
Genesis 3 17,"To Adam he said:<br>Because you hearkened to the voice of your wife<br>and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, saying:<br>You are not to eat from it!<br>Cursed be the ground on your account;<br>with painstaking-labor shall you eat from it, all the days of your life."
Genesis 3 18,"Thorn and sting-shrub let it spring up for you,<br>when you [wish to] eat the plants of the field!"
Genesis 3 19,"By the sweat of your nostrils shall you eat bread,<br>until you return to the ground,<br>for from it you were taken.<br>For you are dust, and to dust shall you return."
Genesis 3 20,"The human called his wife’s name: Havva/Life-giver,<br>for she became the mother of all the living."
Genesis 3 21,"<small>YHWH</small> God made Adam and his wife coats of skins, and he clothed them."
Genesis 3 22,"<small>YHWH</small> God said:<br>Here, the human has become like one of us, in knowing good and evil.<br>So now, lest he send forth his hand<br>and take also from the Tree of Life<br>and eat<br>and live throughout the ages . . . !"
Genesis 3 23,"So <small>YHWH</small> God sent him away from the garden of Eden, to work the ground from which he had been taken."
Genesis 3 24,"He drove the human out<br>and caused to dwell, east of the garden of Eden,<br>the winged-sphinxes and the flashing, ever-turning sword<br>to watch over the way to the Tree of Life."
Genesis 4 1,"The human knew Havva his wife;<br>she became pregnant and bore Kayin.<br>She said:<br><i>Kaniti</i>/I-have-gotten<br>a man, along with <small>YHWH</small>!"
Genesis 4 2,"And she continued bearing—his brother, Hevel.<br>Now Hevel became a shepherd of flocks, and Kayin became a worker of the ground."
Genesis 4 3,"It was, after the passing of days,<br>that Kayin brought, from the fruit of the ground, a gift to <small>YHWH</small>,"
Genesis 4 4,"while as for Hevel, he too brought—from the firstborn of his flock, from their fat-parts.<br><small>YHWH</small> had regard for Hevel and his gift,"
Genesis 4 5,but for Kayin and his gift he had no regard.<br>Kayin became exceedingly upset and his face fell.
Genesis 4 6,<small>YHWH</small> said to Kayin:<br>Why are you upset? Why has your face fallen?
Genesis 4 7,"Is it not [thus]:<br>if you intend good, bear-it-aloft,<br>but if you do not intend good,<br>at the entrance is sin, a crouching-demon,<br>toward you his lust—<br>but you can rule over him."
Genesis 4 8,"Kayin said to Hevel his brother . . .<br>But then it was, when they were out in the field<br>that Kayin rose up against Hevel his brother<br>and he killed him."
Genesis 4 9,<small>YHWH</small> said to Kayin:<br>Where is Hevel your brother?<br>He said:<br>I do not know. Am I the watcher of my brother?
Genesis 4 10,Now he said:<br>What have you done!<br>A sound—your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground!
Genesis 4 11,"And now,<br>cursed be you from the ground,<br>which opened up its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand."
Genesis 4 12,When you wish to work the ground<br>it will not henceforth give its strength to you;<br>wavering and wandering must you be on earth!
Genesis 4 13,Kayin said to <small>YHWH</small>:<br>My iniquity is too great to be borne!
Genesis 4 14,"Here, you drive me away today from the face of the ground,<br>and from your face I must conceal myself,<br>I must be wavering and wandering on earth—<br>now it will be:<br>whoever comes upon me will kill me!"
Genesis 4 15,"<small>YHWH</small> said to him:<br>No, therefore,<br>whoever kills Kayin, sevenfold will it be avenged!<br>So <small>YHWH</small> set a sign for Kayin,<br>so that whoever came upon him would not strike him down."
Genesis 4 16,"Kayin went out from the face of <small>YHWH</small><br>and settled in the land of Nod/Wandering, east of Eden."
Genesis 4 17,"Kayin knew his wife;<br>she became pregnant and bore Hanokh.<br>Now he became the builder of a city<br>and called the city’s name according to his son’s name, Hanokh."
Genesis 4 18,"To Hanokh was born Irad;<br>Irad begot Mehuyael,<br>Mehuyael begot Metushael,<br>Metushael begot Lemekh."
Genesis 4 19,"Lemekh took himself two wives:<br>the name of the [first] one was Ada, the name of the second was Tzilla."
Genesis 4 20,Ada bore Yaval&mdash;<br>he was the father of those who sit amid tent and herd.
Genesis 4 21,His brother’s name was Yuval&mdash;<br>he was the father of all those who play the lyre and the pipe.
Genesis 4 22,"And Tzilla bore as well—Tuval-Kayin,<br>burnisher of every blade of bronze and iron.<br>Tuval-Kayin’s sister was Naama."
Genesis 4 23,"Lemekh said to his wives:<br>Ada and Tzilla, hearken to my voice,<br>wives of Lemekh, give ear to my saying:<br>Aye—a man I kill for wounding me,<br>a lad for [only] bruising me!"
Genesis 4 24,"Aye—if sevenfold vengeance be for Kayin,<br>then for Lemekh, seventy-sevenfold!"
Genesis 4 25,"Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son.<br>She called his name: Shet/Granted-One,<br>meaning: God has granted me another seed in place of Hevel,<br>for Kayin killed him."
Genesis 4 26,To Shet as well a son was born;<br>he called his name: Enosh/Mortal.<br> At that time they first called out the name of <small>YHWH</small>.
Genesis 5 1,"This is the record of the begettings of Adam/Humankind.<br>At the time of God’s creating humankind,<br>in the likeness of God did he [then] make it,"
Genesis 5 2,male and female he created them<br>and gave blessing to them<br>and called their name: Humankind<br>on the day of their being created.
Genesis 5 3,"Adam lived thirty and a hundred years,<br>and then he begot one in his likeness, according to his image,<br>and called his name Shet."

Genesis 6 1,"Now it was when humans first became many on the face of the ground<br>and women were born to them,"
Genesis 6 2,"that the divine ones saw how fair the human women were,<br>so they took themselves wives, whomever they chose."
Genesis 6 3,"<small>YHWH</small> said:<br>My rushing-spirit shall not remain in humankind for ages, for they too are flesh;<br>let their days be then a hundred and twenty years!"
Genesis 6 4,"The giants were on earth in those days,<br>and afterward as well,<br>when the divine beings came in to the human women<br>and they bore them [children]—<br>they were the mighty-ones who were of ages [past], the men of name."
Genesis 6 5,<small>YHWH</small> saw<br>that great was humankind’s evildoing on earth<br>and every form of their heart’s planning was only evil all the day.
Genesis 6 6,"Then <small>YHWH</small> was sorry<br>that he had made humankind on earth,<br>and it pained his heart."
Genesis 6 7,"<small>YHWH</small> said:<br>I will blot out humankind, whom I created, from the face of the earth,<br>from man to beast, to crawling thing and to the birds of the heavens,<br>for I am sorry that I made them."

Genesis 6 17,"As for me,<br>here, I am about to bring on the Deluge, water upon the earth,<br>to bring ruin upon all flesh that has rush of life in it, from under the heavens;<br>all that is on earth will expire."
Genesis 6 18,"But I will establish my covenant with you:<br>you are to come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you,"
Genesis 6 19,"and from all living things, from all flesh, you are to bring two from all into the ark, to remain alive with you.<br>They are to be a male and a female [each],"
Genesis 6 20,"from birds after their kind, from herd-animals after their kind, from all crawling things of the ground after their kind,<br>two from all are to come to you, to remain alive."
Genesis 6 21,"As for you,<br>take for yourself from all edible-things that are eaten and gather it to you;<br>it shall be for you and for them, for eating."
Genesis 6 22,"Noah did it,<br>exactly as God commanded him, so he did."
Genesis 7 1,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Noah:<br>Come, you and all your household, into the ark!<br>For you I have seen as righteous before me in this generation."
Genesis 7 2,"From all [ritually] pure animals you are to take seven and seven [each], a male and his mate,<br>and from all the animals that are not pure, two [each], a male and his mate,"
Genesis 7 3,"and also from the birds of the heavens, seven and seven [each], male and female,<br>to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth."
Genesis 7 4,"For in another seven days<br>I will make it rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights<br>and will blot out all existing-things that I have made, from the face of the earth."
Genesis 7 5,"Noah did it, exactly as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded him."
Genesis 7 6,"Now Noah was six hundred years old when the Deluge occurred, water upon the earth;"
Genesis 7 7,"and Noah came, his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark before the waters of the Deluge."
Genesis 7 8,From the pure animals and from the animals that are not pure and from the birds and all that crawls about on the ground—
Genesis 7 9,"two and two [each] came to Noah, into the ark, male and female,<br>as God had commanded Noah."
Genesis 7 10,After the seven days it was<br>that the waters of the Deluge were upon the earth.
Genesis 7 11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month,<br>on that day:<br>then burst all the wellsprings of the great Ocean<br>and the sluices of the heavens opened up."
Genesis 7 12,The torrent was upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.
Genesis 7 13,"On that very day came Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Yefet, Noah’s sons, and Noah’s wife and his three sons’ wives with them, into the ark,"
Genesis 7 14,"they and all wildlife after their kind, all herd-animals after their kind, all crawling things that crawl on the earth after their kind, all birds after their kind: all chirping-things, all winged-things;"
Genesis 7 15,"they came to Noah, into the ark, two and two [each] from all flesh in which there is the rush of life."
Genesis 7 16,"And those that came, male and female from all flesh they came,<br>as God had commanded him.<br><small>YHWH</small> closed [the door] upon him."
Genesis 7 17,"Now the Deluge was forty days upon the earth.<br>The waters increased and lifted the ark, so that it was raised above the earth;"
Genesis 7 18,"the waters swelled and increased exceedingly upon the earth, so that the ark floated upon the face of the waters."
Genesis 7 19,"When the waters had swelled exceedingly, yes, exceedingly over the earth, all high mountains that were under all the heavens were covered."
Genesis 7 20,Fifteen cubits upward swelled the waters; thus the mountains were covered.
Genesis 7 21,"Then expired all flesh that crawls about upon the earth—birds, herd-animals, wildlife, and all swarming things that swarm on the earth,<br>and all humans;"
Genesis 7 22,"all that had the breath of the rush of life in their nostrils,<br>all that were on dry-land, died."
Genesis 7 23,"He blotted out all existing-things that were on the face of the ground,<br>from man to beast, to crawling thing and to birds of the heavens;<br>they were blotted out from the earth.<br>Noah alone remained, and those who were with him in the ark."
Genesis 7 24,The waters swelled upon the earth for a hundred and fifty days.
Genesis 8 1,"But God paid mind to Noah and all living-things, all the animals that were with him in the ark,<br>and God brought a rushing-wind across the earth, so that the waters abated."
Genesis 8 2,"The wellsprings of Ocean and the sluices of the heavens were dammed up,<br>and the torrent from the heavens was held back."
Genesis 8 3,"The waters returned from upon the earth, advancing and returning,<br>and the waters diminished at the end of a hundred and fifty days."
Genesis 8 4,"The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
Genesis 8 5,"Now the waters advanced and diminished until the tenth month.<br>In the tenth, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains could be seen."
Genesis 8 6,"It was at the end of forty days: Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made,"
Genesis 8 7,"and sent out a raven;<br>it went off, going off and returning, until the waters were dried up from upon the earth."
Genesis 8 8,"Then he sent out a dove from him, to see whether the waters had subsided from the face of the ground."
Genesis 8 9,"But the dove found no resting-place for the sole of her foot,<br>so she returned to him into the ark,<br>for there was water upon the face of all the earth.<br>He sent forth his hand and took her, and brought her to him into the ark."
Genesis 8 10,Then he waited yet another seven days<br>and sent out the dove yet again from the ark.
Genesis 8 11,"The dove came back to him at eventime,<br>and here, a freshly plucked olive leaf in her beak!<br>So Noah knew<br>that the waters had subsided from upon the earth."
Genesis 8 12,"Then he waited yet another seven days<br>and sent out the dove,<br>but she returned to him again no more."
Genesis 8 13,"And so it was in the six hundred and first year, in the beginning-month, on the first day of the month,<br>that the waters left dry-land upon the earth.<br>Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw:<br>here, the face of the ground had dried up."
Genesis 8 14,"Now in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry."
Genesis 8 15,"God spoke to Noah, saying:"
Genesis 8 16,"Go out of the ark, you and your wife, your sons and your sons’ wives with you."
Genesis 8 17,"All living-things that are with you, all flesh—birds, animals, and all crawling things that crawl about on the earth,<br>bring out with you,<br>that they may swarm on earth, that they may bear fruit and become many on the earth."
Genesis 8 18,"So Noah went out, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him,"
Genesis 8 19,"all living-things—all crawling things, and all birds, all that crawl about on the earth,:br> according to their clans they went out of the ark."
Genesis 8 20,Noah built a sacrificial-altar to <small>YHWH</small>.<br>He took from all pure animals and from all pure birds<br>and offered up offerings on the altar.
Genesis 8 21,"<small>YHWH</small> smelled the soothing savor<br>and <small>YHWH</small> said in his heart:<br>I will never curse the ground again on humankind’s account, since what the human heart forms is evil from its youth;<br>I will never again strike down all living-things, as I have done;"
Genesis 8 22,"[never] again, all the days of the earth, shall<br>sowing and harvest,<br>cold and heat,<br>summer and winter,<br>day and night<br>ever cease!"
Genesis 9 1,God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them:<br>Bear fruit and be many and fill the earth!
Genesis 9 2,"Fear-of-you, dread-of-you shall be upon all the wildlife of the earth and upon all the birds of the heavens,<br>all that crawls on the ground and all the fish of the sea—<br>into your hand they are given."
Genesis 9 3,"All things crawling about that live, for you shall they be, for eating;<br>as with the green plants, I now give you all."
Genesis 9 4,"However: flesh with its life, its blood, you are not to eat!"
Genesis 9 5,"However, too: for your blood, of your own lives, I will demand- satisfaction—<br>from all wild-animals I will demand it,<br>and from humankind, from each one [regarding] his brother,<br>demand-satisfaction for human life."
Genesis 9 6,"Whoever [now] sheds human blood,<br>for that human shall his blood be shed,<br>for in God’s image he made humankind."
Genesis 9 7,"As for you—bear fruit and be many, swarm on earth and become many on it!"
Genesis 9 8,"And God said to Noah and to his sons with him, saying:"
Genesis 9 9,"As for me—here, I am about to establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you,"
Genesis 9 10,"and with all living beings that are with you: birds, herd-animals, and all the wildlife of the earth with you,<br>all those going out of the ark, of all the living-things of the earth."
Genesis 9 11,"I will establish my covenant with you:<br>All flesh shall never be cut off again by waters of the Deluge; never again shall there be Deluge, to bring the earth to ruin!"
Genesis 9 12,"And God said:<br>This is the sign of the covenant which I set<br>between me and you and all living beings that are with you, for ageless generations:"
Genesis 9 13,"my bow I set in the clouds,<br>that it may serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth."
Genesis 9 14,"It shall be:<br>when I becloud the earth with clouds<br>and in the clouds the bow is seen,"
Genesis 9 15,"never again shall the waters become a Deluge, to bring all flesh to ruin!"
Genesis 9 16,"When the bow is in the clouds,<br>I will look at it,<br>to call to mind the age-old covenant<br>between God and all living beings—<br>all flesh that is upon the earth."
Genesis 9 17,God said to Noah:<br>This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
Genesis 9 18,"Noah’s sons who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Yefet;<br>Now Ham is the father of Canaan."
Genesis 9 19,"These three were Noah’s sons, and from these were scattered abroad all the earth-folk."
Genesis 9 20,Noah was the first man of the soil; he planted a vineyard.
Genesis 9 21,He drank from the wine and became drunk and exposed himself in the middle of his tent.
Genesis 9 22,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside."
Genesis 9 23,"Then Shem and Yefet took a cloak, they put it on the shoulders of the two of them,<br>and they walked backward, and covered their father’s nakedness.<br>—Their faces were turned backward, so their father’s nakedness they did not see."
Genesis 9 24,"Noah awoke from his wine, and it became known [to him] what his littlest son had done to him."
Genesis 9 25,He said:<br>Cursed be Canaan;<br>servant of servants may he be to his brothers!
Genesis 9 26,"And he said:<br>Blessed be <small>YHWH</small>, God of Shem,<br>but may Canaan be servant to them!"
Genesis 9 27,"May God extend/<i>yaft</i><br>Yefet;<br>let him dwell in the tents of Shem,<br>but may Canaan be servant to them!"
Genesis 9 28,Noah lived after the Deluge three hundred years and fifty years.
Genesis 9 29,Now all the days of Noah were nine hundred years and fifty years;<br>then he died.
Genesis 10 1,"Now these are the begettings of the sons of Noah,<br>Shem, Ham, and Yefet.<br>Sons were born to them after the Deluge."
Genesis 10 2,"The Sons of Yefet are Gomer and Magog, Madai, Yavan and Tuval, Meshekh and Tiras."
Genesis 10 3,"The Sons of Gomer are Ashkenaz, Rifat, and Togarma."
Genesis 10 4,"The Sons of Yavan are Elisha and Tarshish, Cittites and Dodanites."
Genesis 10 5,"From these the seacoast nations were divided by their lands,<br>each one according to its own tongue:<br>according to their clans, by their nations."
Genesis 10 6,"Now the Sons of Ham: Cush and Mitzrayim, Put and Canaan."
Genesis 10 7,"And the Sons of Cush: Seva and Havila, Savta, Ra’ma, and Savtekha;<br>and the Sons of Ra’ma: Sheva and Dedan."
Genesis 10 8,Now Cush begot Nimrod; he was the first mighty-one on earth.
Genesis 10 9,"He was a mighty hunter before <small>YHWH</small>;<br>therefore the saying is:<br>Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before <small>YHWH</small>."
Genesis 10 10,"His kingdom, at the beginning, was Bavel, and Erekh, Accad and Calne, in the land of Shin’ar."
Genesis 10 11,"From this land Ashur went forth and built Nineveh—along with the city squares and Calah,"
Genesis 10 12,and Resen between Nineveh and Calah—that is the great city.
Genesis 10 13,"Mitzrayim begot the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehavites, the Naftuhites,"
Genesis 10 14,"the Patrusites, and the Casluhites, from where the Philistines come, and the Caftorites."
Genesis 10 15,"Canaan begot Tzidon his firstborn and Het,"
Genesis 10 16,"along with the Yevusite, the Amorite and the Girgashite,"
Genesis 10 17,"the Hivvite, the Arkite and the Sinite,"
Genesis 10 18,"the Arvadite, the Tzemarite and the Hamatite.<br>Afterward the Canaanite clans were scattered abroad."
Genesis 10 19,"And the Canaanite territory went from Tzidon, then as you come toward Gerar, as far as Gaza, then as you come toward Sedom and Amora, Adma, and Tzevoyim, as far as Lasha."
Genesis 10 20,"These are the Sons of Ham according to their clans, according to their tongues, by their lands, by their nations."
Genesis 10 21,"[Children] were also born to Shem,<br>the father of all the Sons of Ever [and] Yefet’s older brother."
Genesis 10 22,"The Sons of Shem: Elam and Ashur, Arpakhshad, Lud, and Aram."
Genesis 10 23,"The Sons of Aram: Utz and Hul, Geter and Mash."
Genesis 10 24,"Arpakhshad begot Shelah, and Shelah begot Ever."
Genesis 10 25,"Two sons were born to Ever:<br>the name of the first one was Peleg/Splitting, for in his days the earth-folk were split up,<br>and his brother’s name was Yoktan."
Genesis 10 26,"Now Yoktan begot Almodad and Shelef, Hatzarmavet and Yera,"
Genesis 10 27,"Hadoram, Uzal and Dikla,"
Genesis 10 28,"Oval, Avimael and Sheva,"
Genesis 10 29,"Ofir, Havila, and Yovav—all these are the Sons of Yoktan."
Genesis 10 30,"Now their settlements went from Mesha, then as you come toward Sefar, to the highlands of the east."
Genesis 10 31,"These are the Sons of Shem according to their clans, according to their tongues, by their lands, according to their nations."
Genesis 10 32,"These are the clan-groupings of the Sons of Noah, according to their begettings, by their nations.<br>From these the nations were divided on earth after the Deluge."
Genesis 11 1,Now all the earth was of one language and one set-of-words.
Genesis 11 2,And it was when they migrated to the east that they found a valley in the land of Shin’ar and settled there.
Genesis 11 3,"They said, each one to his neighbor:<br>Come-now! Let us bake bricks and let us burn them well-burnt!<br>&mdash;For them brick-stone was like building-stone, and raw-bitumen was for them like red-mortar."
Genesis 11 4,"And they said:<br>Come-now! Let us build ourselves a city and a tower, its top in the heavens,<br>and let us make ourselves a name,<br>lest we be scattered over the face of all the earth!"
Genesis 11 5,But <small>YHWH</small> came down to look over the city and the tower that the humans were building.
Genesis 11 6,"<small>YHWH</small> said:<br>Here, [they are] one people with one language for them all, and this is [merely] the first of their doings—<br>now there will be no barrier for them in all that they scheme to do!"
Genesis 11 7,"Come-now! Let us go down and there let us baffle their language,<br>so that no one will understand the language of his neighbor."
Genesis 11 8,"So <small>YHWH</small> scattered them from there over the face of all the earth,<br>and they had to stop building the city."
Genesis 11 9,"Therefore its name was called Bavel/Babble,<br>for there <small>YHWH</small> baffled the language of all the earth-folk,<br>and from there, <small>YHWH</small> scattered them over the face of all the earth."
Genesis 11 10,"These are the begettings of Shem:<br>Shem was a hundred years old, and then he begot Arpakhshad, two years after the Deluge."
Genesis 11 11,"And Shem lived after he begot Arpakhshad five hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters."
Genesis 11 12,"Arpakhshad lived thirty-five years, and then he begot Shelah."
Genesis 11 13,"And Arpakhshad lived after he begot Shelah three years and four hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters."
Genesis 11 14,"Shelah lived thirty years, and then he begot Ever."
Genesis 11 15,"And Shelah lived after he begot Ever three years and four hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters."
Genesis 11 16,"Ever lived thirty-four years, and then he begot Peleg."
Genesis 11 17,"And Ever lived after he begot Peleg thirty years and four hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters."
Genesis 11 18,"Peleg lived thirty years, and then he begot Re’u."
Genesis 11 19,"And Peleg lived after he begot Re’u nine years and two hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters."
Genesis 11 20,"Re’u lived thirty-two years, and then he begot Serug."
Genesis 11 21,"And Re’u lived after he begot Serug seven years and two hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters."
Genesis 11 22,"Serug lived thirty years, and then he begot Nahor."
Genesis 11 23,"And Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters."
Genesis 11 24,"Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and then he begot Terah."
Genesis 11 25,"And Nahor lived after he begot Terah nineteen years and a hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters."
Genesis 11 26,"Terah lived seventy years, and then he begot Avram, Nahor, and Haran."
Genesis 11 27,"Now these are the begettings of Terah:<br>Terah begot Avram, Nahor, and Haran,<br>and Haran begot Lot."
Genesis 11 28,"Haran died in the living-presence of Terah his father in the land of his kindred, in Ur of the Chaldeans."
Genesis 11 29,"Avram and Nahor took themselves wives;<br>the name of Avram’s wife was Sarai,<br>the name of Nahor’s wife was Milca—daughter of Haran, father of Milca and father of Yisca."
Genesis 11 30,"Now Sarai was barren, she had no child."
Genesis 11 31,"Terah took Avram his son and Lot son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, wife of Avram his son;<br>they set out together from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go to the land of Canaan.<br>But [when] they had come as far as Harran, they settled there."
Genesis 11 32,"And the days of Terah were five years and two hundred years;<br>then Terah died,<br>in Harran."
Genesis 12 1,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Avram:<br>Go-you-forth<br>from your land,<br>from your kindred,<br>from your father’s house,<br>to the land that I will let you see."
Genesis 12 2,I will make a great nation of you<br>and will give-you-blessing<br>and will make your name great.<br>Be a blessing!
Genesis 12 3,"I will bless those blessing you,<br>while those insulting you, I will curse.<br>All the clans of the earth will find blessing through you!"
Genesis 12 4,"Avram went, as <small>YHWH</small> had spoken to him, and Lot went with him.<br>And Avram was five years and seventy years old when he went out of Harran."
Genesis 12 5,"Avram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, all their property that they had gained, and the persons whom they had made-their-own in Harran,<br>and they went out to go to the land of Canaan.<br>They came to the land of Canaan;"
Genesis 12 6,"and Avram passed through the land, as far as the Place of Shekhem, as far as the Oak of Moreh.<br>Now the Canaanite was then in the land."
Genesis 12 7,<small>YHWH</small> was seen by Avram and said:<br>I give this land to your seed!<br>He built an altar there to <small>YHWH</small> who had been seen by him.
Genesis 12 8,"He moved on from there to the highlands, east of Bet-El,<br>and spread his tent, Bet-El toward the sea and Ai toward the east.<br>There he built an altar to <small>YHWH</small><br>and called out the name of <small>YHWH</small>."
Genesis 12 9,"Then Avram journeyed on, continually journeying to the Negev."
Genesis 12 10,"Now there was a famine in the land,<br>and Avram went down to Egypt, to sojourn there,<br>for the famine was heavy in the land."
Genesis 12 11,"It was when he came near to Egypt that he said to Sarai his wife:<br>Now here, I know that you are a woman beautiful to look at."
Genesis 12 12,"It will be, when the Egyptians see you and say: She is his wife,<br>that they will kill me, but you they will allow to live."
Genesis 12 13,"Pray say that you are my sister<br>in order that it may go well with me on your account, and I myself may live thanks to you."
Genesis 12 14,"It was, when Avram came to Egypt, that the Egyptians saw how exceedingly beautiful the woman was;"
Genesis 12 15,"Pharaoh’s courtiers saw her, and they praised her to Pharaoh,<br>so the woman was taken away into Pharaoh’s house."
Genesis 12 16,"Now it went well with Avram on her account:<br>sheep and oxen, donkeys, servants and maids, she-asses and camels, became his."
Genesis 12 17,"But <small>YHWH</small> plagued Pharaoh with great plagues, and also his household, because of Sarai, Avram’s wife."
Genesis 12 18,"Pharaoh had Avram called, and said:<br>What, now, have you have done to me?<br>Why did you not tell me that she is your wife?"
Genesis 12 19,"Why did you say: She is my sister?<br>—So I took her for myself as a wife.<br>But now, here is your wife, take her and go!"
Genesis 12 20,"So Pharaoh put men in charge of him, who escorted him and his wife and all that was his."
Genesis 13 1,"Avram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that was his, and Lot with him, to the Negev."
Genesis 13 2,"And Avram was exceedingly heavily-laden with livestock, with silver and with gold."
Genesis 13 3,"He went on his journeyings from the Negev as far as Bet-El, as far as the place where his tent had been at the first, between Bet-El and Ai,"
Genesis 13 4,to the place of the altar that he had made there at the beginning.<br>There Avram called out the name of <small>YHWH</small>.
Genesis 13 5,"Now also Lot, who had gone with Avram, had sheep and oxen and tents."
Genesis 13 6,"And the land could not support them, to settle together,<br>for their property was so great that they were not able to settle together."
Genesis 13 7,So there was a quarrel between the herdsmen of Avram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock.<br>Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then settled in the land.
Genesis 13 8,"Avram said to Lot:<br>Pray let there be no quarreling between me and you, between my herdsmen and your herdsmen,<br>for we are brother men!"
Genesis 13 9,"Is not all the land before you?<br>Pray part from me!<br>If to the left, then I to the right,<br>if to the right, then I to the left."
Genesis 13 10,"Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the plain of the Jordan—<br>how well-watered was it all, before <small>YHWH</small> brought ruin upon Sedom and Amora,<br>like <small>YHWH’S</small> garden, like the land of Egypt, as you come toward Tzo’ar."
Genesis 13 11,"So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan.<br>Lot moved on eastward, and they parted, each from the other:"
Genesis 13 12,"Avram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the plain, and pitched-his-tent near Sedom."
Genesis 13 13,Now the men of Sedom were exceedingly wicked and sinful before <small>YHWH</small>.
Genesis 13 14,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Avram, after Lot had parted from him:<br>Pray lift up your eyes and see from the place where you are, to the north, to the Negev, to the east, to the Sea:"
Genesis 13 15,"indeed, all the land that you see, I give it to you <br>and to your seed, for the ages."
Genesis 13 16,"I will make your seed like the dust of the earth,<br>so that if a man were able to measure the dust of the earth, so too could your seed be measured."
Genesis 13 17,"Arise, walk about through the land in its length and in its breadth,<br>for I give it to you!"
Genesis 13 18,"Avram moved-his-tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are by Hevron.<br>There he built an altar to <small>YHWH</small>."
Genesis 14 1,"Now it was in the days of Amrafel king of Shinar, Aryokh king of Ellasar, Kedorla’omer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim:"
Genesis 14 2,"they prepared for battle against Bera king of Sedom, Birsha king of Amora, Shinav king of Adma, Shemever king of Tzevoyim, and the king of Bela—that is Tzo’ar."
Genesis 14 3,All these joined together in the valley of Siddim/Limestone—that is the Sea of Salt.
Genesis 14 4,"For twelve years they had been subservient to Kedorla’omer,<br>and in the thirteenth year they had revolted,"
Genesis 14 5,"but in the fourteenth year came Kedorla’omer and the kings who were with him;<br>they struck the Refa’ites in Ashterot-Karnayim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh-Kiryatayim,"
Genesis 14 6,"and the Horites in their highlands of Se’ir near El Paran, which is by the wilderness."
Genesis 14 7,"Then they returned and came to En Mishpat/Judgment Spring—that is Kadesh,<br>and struck all the territory of the Amalekites and also the Amorites, who were settled in Hatzatzon-Tamar."
Genesis 14 8,"Then out marched the king of Sedom, the king of Amora, the king of Adma, the king of Tzevoyim, and the king of Bela—that is Tzo’ar;<br>they set-their-ranks against them in war in the valley of Siddim,"
Genesis 14 9,"against Kedorla’omer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goyim, Amrafel king of Shinar, and Aryokh king of Ellasar—<br>four kings against the five."
Genesis 14 10,"Now the valley of Siddim is pit after pit of bitumen,<br>and [when] the kings of Sedom and Amora fled, they flung themselves therein,<br>while those who remained fled to the highlands."
Genesis 14 11,"And they took all the property of Sedom and Amora and all their food, and went off,"
Genesis 14 12,"and they took Lot and all his property—the son of Avram’s brother—and went off,<br>for he had settled in Sedom."
Genesis 14 13,"One who escaped came and told Avram the Hebrew—<br>he was dwelling by the Oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner;<br>they were Avram’s covenant-allies."
Genesis 14 14,"[When] Avram heard that his brother had been taken prisoner,<br>he drew out his retainers, his house born slaves, eighteen and three hundred, and went in pursuit as far as Dan."
Genesis 14 15,"He split up [his men] against them in the night, he and his servants, and struck them and pursued them as far as Hova, which is to the north of Damascus."
Genesis 14 16,"But he returned all the property, and he also returned his brother Lot and his property, and also the women and the [other] people."
Genesis 14 17,"The king of Sedom went out to meet him upon his return from the strike against Kedorla’omer and against the kings that were with him, to the valley of Shaveh—that is the King’s Valley."
Genesis 14 18,"Now Malki-Tzedek, king of Shalem, brought out bread and wine,<br>for he was priest of God Most-High,"
Genesis 14 19,"and blessed him and said:<br>Blessed be Avram by God Most-High,<br>Founder of Heaven and Earth!"
Genesis 14 20,"And blessed be God Most-High,<br>who has delivered your oppressors into your hand!<br>And he gave him a tenth of everything."
Genesis 14 21,"The king of Sedom said to Avram:<br>Give me the persons, and the property take for yourself."
Genesis 14 22,"Avram said to the king of Sedom:<br>I raise my hand in the presence of <small>YHWH</small>, God Most-High,<br>Founder of Heaven and Earth,"
Genesis 14 23,if from a thread to a sandal-strap—if I should take from anything that is yours . . . !<br>So that you should not say: I made Avram rich.
Genesis 14 24,"Nothing for me!<br>Only what the lads have consumed,<br>and the share of the men who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre;<br>let them take their share."
Genesis 15 1,"After these events <small>YHWH’S</small> word [came] to Avram in a vision,<br>saying:<br>Be not afraid, Avram,<br>I am a delivering-shield to you;<br>your reward is exceedingly great!"
Genesis 15 2,"Avram said:<br>My Lord, <small>YHWH</small>,<br>what would you give me?<br>For I am going [to die] accursed,<br>and the Son Domestic of My House is Damascan Eliezer!"
Genesis 15 3,"And Avram said:<br>Here, to me you have not given seed,<br>here, the Son of My House must be my heir!"
Genesis 15 4,"But here, <small>YHWH’S</small> word [came] to him, saying:<br>This one shall not be heir to you;<br>rather, the one that goes out from your body, <i>he</i> shall be heir to you."
Genesis 15 5,He brought him outside and said:<br>Pray look toward the heavens and count the stars;<br>are you able to count them?<br>And he said to him:<br>So shall your seed be.
Genesis 15 6,"Now he trusted in <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and he deemed it as righteous-merit on his part."
Genesis 15 7,"He said to him:<br>I am <small>YHWH</small><br>who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans<br>to give you this land, to possess it."
Genesis 15 8,"But he said:<br>My Lord <small>YHWH</small>,<br>by what shall I know that I will possess it?"
Genesis 15 9,"He said to him:<br>Fetch me a calf of three, a she-goat of three, a ram of three, a turtle-dove, and a fledgling."
Genesis 15 10,"He fetched him all these,<br>and he halved them down the middle and put each one’s half toward its neighbor,<br>but the birds he did not halve."
Genesis 15 11,"Vultures descended upon the carcasses,<br>but Avram drove them off."
Genesis 15 12,"Now it was, when the sun was coming in ,<br>that deep slumber fell upon Avram,<br>and here, a fright [and] great darkness falling upon him!"
Genesis 15 13,"And he said to Avram:<br>Know, yes, know<br>that your seed will be sojourners in a land not theirs;<br>they will put them in servitude and afflict them<br>for four hundred years."
Genesis 15 14,"But the nation to which they are in servitude—I will bring judgment on them,<br>and after that they will go out with great property."
Genesis 15 15,"As for you, you will go to your fathers in peace;<br>you will be buried at a good ripe-age."
Genesis 15 16,"But in the fourth generation they will return here,<br>for the iniquity of the Amorite has not reached full-measure heretofore."
Genesis 15 17,"Now it was, when the sun had come in,<br>that there was night-blackness,<br>and here, a smoking oven, a fiery torch<br>that crossed between those pieces."
Genesis 15 18,"On that day<br><small>YHWH</small> cut a covenant with Avram,<br>saying: I give this land to your seed,<br>from the River of Egypt to the Great River, the river Euphrates,"
Genesis 15 19,"the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite,"
Genesis 15 20,"and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Refa’ites,"
Genesis 15 21,and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Yevusite.
Genesis 16 1,"Now Sarai, Avram’s wife, had not borne him [children].<br>She had an Egyptian maid—her name was Hagar."
Genesis 16 2,"Sarai said to Avram:<br>Now here, <small>YHWH</small> has obstructed me from bearing.<br>Pray come in to my maid;<br>perhaps I may be built-up-with-sons through her!<br>Avram hearkened to Sarai’s voice:"
Genesis 16 3,"Sarai, Avram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian-woman, her maid,<br>at the end of ten years of Avram’s being settled in the land of Canaan,<br>and gave her to her husband Avram as a wife for him."
Genesis 16 4,"He came in to Hagar, and she became pregnant.<br>But [when] she saw that she was pregnant, her mistress became of light-worth in her eyes."
Genesis 16 5,"So Sarai said to Avram:<br>The wrong done me is on you!<br>I myself gave my maid into your bosom,<br>but now that she sees that she is pregnant, I have become of light-worth in her eyes.<br>May <small>YHWH</small> see-justice-done between me and you!"
Genesis 16 6,"Avram said to Sarai:<br>Here, your maid is in your hand, deal with her however seems good in your eyes.<br>Sarai afflicted her, so that she had to run away from her."
Genesis 16 7,"But <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur."
Genesis 16 8,"He said:<br>Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence do you come, whither are you going?<br>She said:<br>I am running away from Sarai my mistress."
Genesis 16 9,<small>YHWH’S</small> messenger said to her:<br>Return to your mistress and let yourself be afflicted under her hand!
Genesis 16 10,"And <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger said to her:<br>I will make your seed many, yes, many, it will be too many to count!"
Genesis 16 11,"And <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger said to her:<br>Here, you are pregnant,<br>you will bear a son;<br>you are to call his name: Yishmael/God Hearkens,<br>for God has hearkened to your being afflicted."
Genesis 16 12,"He shall be a wild-ass of a man,<br>his hand against all, hand of all against him,<br>yet in the presence of all his brothers shall he dwell."
Genesis 16 13,"Now she called the name of <small>YHWH</small>, the one who was speaking to her:<br>You God of Seeing!<br>For she said:<br>Have I actually gone on seeing here<br>after his seeing me?"
Genesis 16 14,"Therefore the well was called:<br>Well of the Living-One Seeing-Me.<br>Here, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
Genesis 16 15,"Hagar bore Avram a son,<br>and Avram called the name of the son whom Hagar bore: Yishmael."
Genesis 16 16,Avram was eighty years and six years old when Hagar bore Yishmael to Avram.
Genesis 17 1,Now when Avram was ninety years and nine years old<br><small>YHWH</small> was seen by Avram and said to him:<br>I am God Shaddai.<br>Walk in my presence! And be wholehearted!
Genesis 17 2,"I set my covenant between me and you,<br>I will make you exceedingly, exceedingly many."
Genesis 17 3,"Avram flung himself upon his face.<br>And God spoke with him,<br>saying:"
Genesis 17 4,"As for me,<br>here, my covenant is with you,<br>so that you will become the father of a throng of nations."
Genesis 17 5,"No longer shall your name be called Avram,<br>rather shall your name be Avraham,<br>for I will make you <i>Av Hamon Goyyim</i>/Father of a Throng of Nations!"
Genesis 17 6,"I will cause you to bear fruit exceedingly, exceedingly,<br>I will make nations of you;<br>kings will go out from you!"
Genesis 17 7,"I establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you, throughout their generations as a covenant for the ages,<br>to be God to you and to your seed after you."
Genesis 17 8,"I will give to you and to your seed after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, as a holding for the ages,<br>and I will be God to them."
Genesis 17 9,"God said to Avraham:<br>As for you,<br>you are to keep my covenant, you and your seed after you, throughout their generations."
Genesis 17 10,"This is my covenant which you are to keep, between me and you and your seed after you:<br>every male among you shall be circumcised."
Genesis 17 11,"You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin,<br>so that it may serve as a sign of the covenant between me and you."
Genesis 17 12,"At eight days old, every male among you shall be circumcised, throughout your generations,<br>whether house-born or bought with silver from any foreigner, who is not your seed."
Genesis 17 13,"Circumcised, yes, circumcised shall be your house-born and your silver-bought [slaves],<br>so that my covenant may be in your flesh as a covenant for the ages."
Genesis 17 14,"But a foreskinned male,<br>who does not have the foreskin of his flesh circumcised,<br>that person shall be cut off from his kinspeople—<br>he has violated my covenant!"
Genesis 17 15,"God said to Avraham:<br>As for Sarai your wife—you shall not call her name Sarai,<br>for Sara/Princess is her name!"
Genesis 17 16,"I will bless her, and I will give you a son from her;<br>I will bless her<br>so that she becomes nations&mdash;<br>kings of peoples shall come from her!"
Genesis 17 17,"But Avraham flung himself on his face and laughed,<br>and said in his heart:<br>To a hundred-year-old man shall there be [children] born?<br>Or shall ninety-year-old Sara give birth?"
Genesis 17 18,Avraham said to God:<br>If only Yishmael might live in your presence!
Genesis 17 19,"God said:<br>Nevertheless,<br>Sara your wife is to bear you a son,<br>you shall call his name: Yitzhak/He Laughs.<br>I will establish my covenant with him as a covenant for the ages, for his seed after him."
Genesis 17 20,"And as for Yishmael, I hearken to you:<br>here, I will make him blessed, I will make him bear fruit, I will make him exceedingly, exceedingly many—<br>he will beget twelve exalted-leaders, and I will make a great nation of him."
Genesis 17 21,"But my covenant I will establish with Yitzhak, whom Sara will bear to you at this set-time, in another year."
Genesis 17 22,"He finished speaking with Avraham,<br>and God went up, from beside Avraham."
Genesis 17 23,"Avraham took Yishmael his son and all those born in his house and all those bought with his silver,<br>all the males among Avraham’s household people,<br>and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins on that same day,<br>as God had spoken to him."
Genesis 17 24,"Now Avraham was ninety-nine years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised,"
Genesis 17 25,and Yishmael his son was thirteen years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised.
Genesis 17 26,"On that same day<br>were circumcised Avraham and Yishmael his son,"
Genesis 17 27,"and all his household people, whether house-born or bought with silver from a foreigner, were circumcised with him."
Genesis 18 1,<small>YHWH</small> was seen by him by the oaks of Mamre<br>as he was sitting at the entrance to his tent at the heat of the day.
Genesis 18 2,"He lifted up his eyes and saw:<br>here, three men standing over against him.<br>[When] he saw them, he ran to meet them from the entrance to his tent and bowed low to the earth"
Genesis 18 3,"and said:<br>My lords,<br>pray if I have found favor in your eyes,<br>pray do not pass by your servant!"
Genesis 18 4,"Pray let a little water be fetched, then wash your feet and recline under the tree;"
Genesis 18 5,"let me fetch a bit of bread, that you may refresh your hearts,<br>then afterward you may pass on—<br>for you have, after all, passed your servant’s way!<br>They said:<br>Do thus, as you have spoken."
Genesis 18 6,"Avraham hastened into his tent to Sara and said:<br>Make haste! Three measures of choice flour! Knead it, make bread-cakes!"
Genesis 18 7,"And Avraham ran to the oxen,<br>fetched a young ox, tender and fine, and gave it to a serving-lad, that he might hasten to make it ready;"
Genesis 18 8,"then he fetched cream and milk and the young ox that he had made ready, and placed it before them.<br>Now he stood over against them under the tree while they ate."
Genesis 18 9,They said to him:<br>Where is Sara your wife?<br>He said:<br>Here in the tent.<br>Now he said:
Genesis 18 10,"I will return, yes, return to you when time revives,<br>and Sara your wife will have a son!<br>Now Sara was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him."
Genesis 18 11,"And Avraham and Sara were old, advanced in days;<br>the path of women had ceased for Sara."
Genesis 18 12,"Sara laughed within herself, saying:<br>After I have become worn, is there to be pleasure for me? And my lord is old!"
Genesis 18 13,"But <small>YHWH</small> said to Avraham:<br>Now why does Sara laugh and say: Shall I really give birth, now that I am old?"
Genesis 18 14,"Is anything too wondrous for <small>YHWH</small>?<br>At that set-time I will return to you, when time revives, and Sara will have a son."
Genesis 18 15,"Sara pretended [otherwise], saying:<br>No, I did not laugh.<br>For she was afraid.<br>But he said:<br>No, indeed you laughed."
Genesis 18 16,"The men arose from there, and looked down upon the face of Sedom,<br>and Avraham went with them to escort them."
Genesis 18 17,Now <small>YHWH</small> had said [to himself]:<br>Shall I cover up from Avraham what I am about to do?
Genesis 18 18,"For Avraham is to become, yes, become a nation great and mighty [in number],<br>and all the nations of the earth will find blessing through him."
Genesis 18 19,"Indeed, I have known him,<br>in order that he may charge his sons and his household after him:<br>they shall keep the way of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>to do what is right and just,<br>in order that <small>YHWH</small> may bring upon Avraham what he spoke concerning him."
Genesis 18 20,So <small>YHWH</small> said:<br>The outcry in Sedom and Amora—how great it is!<br>And their sin—how exceedingly heavily it weighs!
Genesis 18 21,Now let me go down and see:<br>if they have done according to its cry that has come to me—<br>destruction!<br>And if not—<br>I wish to know.
Genesis 18 22,"The men turned from there and went toward Sedom,<br>but Avraham still stood in the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Genesis 18 23,Avraham came close and said:<br>Will you really sweep away the innocent along with the guilty?
Genesis 18 24,Perhaps there are fifty innocent within the city;<br>will you really sweep it away?<br>Will you not bear with the place because of the fifty innocent that are in its midst?
Genesis 18 25,"[Heaven] forbid for you to do a thing like this,<br>to deal death to the innocent along with the guilty,<br>that it should come about: like the innocent, like the guilty,<br>[Heaven] forbid for you!<br>The judge of all the earth—will he not do what is just?"
Genesis 18 26,"<small>YHWH</small> said:<br>If I find in Sedom fifty innocent within the city,<br>I will bear with the whole place for their sake."
Genesis 18 27,"Avraham spoke up, and said:<br>Now pray, I have ventured to speak to my Lord,<br>and I am but earth and ashes:"
Genesis 18 28,"Perhaps of the fifty innocent, five will be lacking—<br>will you bring ruin upon the whole city because of the five?<br>He said:<br>I will not bring ruin, if I find there forty-five."
Genesis 18 29,"But he continued to speak to him and said:<br>Perhaps there will be found there only forty!<br>He said:<br>I will not do it, for the sake of the forty."
Genesis 18 30,"But he said:<br>Pray let not my Lord be upset; I wish to speak:<br>Perhaps there will be found there only thirty! <br>He said:<br>I will not do it, if I find there thirty."
Genesis 18 31,"But he said:<br>Now pray, I have ventured to speak to my Lord:<br>Perhaps there will be found there only twenty!<br>He said:<br>I will not bring ruin, for the sake of the twenty."
Genesis 18 32,"But he said:<br>Pray let my Lord not be upset; I wish to speak just this one time:<br>Perhaps there will be found there only ten!<br>He said:<br>I will not bring ruin, for the sake of the ten."
Genesis 18 33,"<small>YHWH</small> went, as soon as he had finished speaking to Avraham, and Avraham returned to his place."
Genesis 19 1,"The two messengers came to Sedom at sunset,<br>as Lot was sitting at the gate of Sedom.<br>Lot saw them, arose to meet them and bowed low, nostrils to the earth."
Genesis 19 2,"and said:<br>Now pray, my lords,<br>pray turn aside to your servant’s house,<br>spend the night, wash your feet;<br>[starting-early] you may go on your way.<br>They said:<br>No, rather we will spend the night in the square."
Genesis 19 3,"But he pressed them exceedingly hard,<br>so they turned in to him and came into his house.<br>He made them a drinkfest and baked flat-cakes, and they ate."
Genesis 19 4,"They had not yet lain down, when the men of the city, the men of Sedom, encircled the house,<br>from young lad to old man, all the people [even] from the outskirts."
Genesis 19 5,They called out to Lot and said to him:<br>Where are the men who came to you tonight?<br>Bring them out to us&mdash;we want to know them!
Genesis 19 6,"Lot went out to them, to the entrance, and the door he shut behind him"
Genesis 19 7,"and said:<br>Pray, brothers, do not be so wicked!"
Genesis 19 8,"Now pray, I have two daughters who have never known a man,<br>pray let me bring them out to you, and you may deal with them however seems good in your eyes;<br>only to these men do nothing,<br>for they have, after all, come under the shadow of my roof-beam!"
Genesis 19 9,"But they said:<br>Step aside!<br>and said:<br>This one came to sojourn and would judge, play-the-judge?!<br>Now we will do more wickedly to you than [to] them!<br>And they pressed exceedingly hard against the man, against Lot, and stepped closer to break down the door."
Genesis 19 10,"But the men put out their hand and brought Lot in to them, into the house, and shut the door,"
Genesis 19 11,"while the men who were at the entrance to the house, they struck with dazzling-light—[all men] great and small,<br>so that they were unable to find the entrance."
Genesis 19 12,"The men said to Lot:<br>Whom else have you here—a son-in-law, sons, daughters?<br>Bring anyone whom you have in the city out of the place!"
Genesis 19 13,"For we are about to bring ruin on this place,<br>for how great is their outcry before <small>YHWH</small>!<br>And <small>YHWH</small> has sent us to bring it to ruin."
Genesis 19 14,"Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, those who had taken his daughters [in marriage], and said:<br>Up, out of this place, for <small>YHWH</small> is about to bring ruin on the city!<br>But in the eyes of his sons-in-law, he was like one jesting."
Genesis 19 15,"Now when the dawn came up,<br>the messengers pushed Lot on, saying:<br>Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here,<br>lest you be swept away in the iniquity of the city!"
Genesis 19 16,"But he lingered,<br>so the men seized his hand, his wife’s hand, and the hand of his two daughters,<br>since <small>YHWH’S</small> pity was upon him,<br>and brought him out and left him outside the city."
Genesis 19 17,"It was, when they had brought him outside, that [one of them] said:<br>Escape for your life, do not gaze behind you, do not stand still anywhere in the plain:<br>to the highlands escape, lest you be swept away!"
Genesis 19 18,"Lot said to them:<br>No, pray, my lord!"
Genesis 19 19,"Now pray, your servant has found favor in your eyes,<br>and you have shown great loyalty in how you have dealt with me, keeping me alive—<br>but I, I am not able to escape to the highlands,<br>lest the wickedness cling to me, and I die!"
Genesis 19 20,"Now pray, that town is near enough to flee to, and it is so tiny;<br>pray let me escape there—is it not tiny?—and stay alive!"
Genesis 19 21,"He said to him:<br>Here then, I lift up your face in this matter as well,<br>by not overturning this town of which you speak."
Genesis 19 22,"Make haste, escape there,<br>for I am not able to do anything until you come there.<br>Therefore the name of the town was called: Tzo’ar/Tiny."
Genesis 19 23,The sun was going out over the earth as Lot came to Tzo’ar.
Genesis 19 24,"And <small>YHWH</small> rained down brimstone and fire upon Sedom and Amora, coming from <small>YHWH</small>, from the heavens;"
Genesis 19 25,"he overturned those cities and all of the plain, all those settled in the cities and the vegetation of the ground."
Genesis 19 26,"But his wife gazed behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
Genesis 19 27,Avraham started-early in the morning to the place where he had stood in <small>YHWH’S</small> presence;
Genesis 19 28,"he looked down upon the face of Sedom and Amora and upon the whole face of the region of the plain<br>and saw:<br>here, the dense-smoke of the land went up like the dense-smoke of a furnace!"
Genesis 19 29,"Thus it was, when God brought ruin on the cities of the plain,<br>that God kept Avraham in mind and sent out Lot from the overturning,<br>when he overturned the cities where Lot had settled."
Genesis 19 30,"Lot went up from Tzo’ar and settled in the highlands, his two daughters with him,<br>for he was afraid to settle in Tzo’ar.<br>So he settled in a cave, he and his two daughters."
Genesis 19 31,"Now the firstborn said to the younger:<br>Our father is old,<br>and there is no man in the land to come in to us as befits the way of all the earth!"
Genesis 19 32,"Come, let us have our father drink wine and lie with him<br>so that we may keep seed alive by our father!"
Genesis 19 33,"So they had their father drink wine that night;<br>then the firstborn went in and lay with her father,<br>but he knew nothing of her lying down or her arising."
Genesis 19 34,"It was on the morrow that the firstborn said to the younger:<br>Here, yesternight I lay with Father.<br>Let us have him drink wine tonight as well,<br>then you go in and lie with him,<br>so that we may keep seed alive by our father."
Genesis 19 35,"They had their father drink wine that night as well,<br>and then the younger arose and lay with him,<br>but he knew nothing of her lying down or her arising."
Genesis 19 36,And Lot’s two daughters became pregnant by their father.
Genesis 19 37,"The firstborn bore a son and called his name: Moav/By Father,<br>&mdash;he is the tribal-father of Moav of today."
Genesis 19 38,"The younger also bore a son, and called his name: Ben-Ammi/Son of My Kinspeople,<br>&mdash;he is the tribal-father of the children of Ammon of today."
Genesis 20 1,"Avraham traveled from there to the Negev; he settled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."
Genesis 20 2,Avraham said of Sara his wife: She is my sister.<br>So Avimelekh king of Gerar sent and had Sara taken.
Genesis 20 3,"But God came to Avimelekh in a dream of the night and said to him:<br>Here, you must die because of the woman whom you have taken,<br>for she is a wedded wife!"
Genesis 20 4,"Avimelekh had not come near her. He said:<br>My Lord,<br>Would you kill a nation, though it be innocent?"
Genesis 20 5,"Did he not say to me: She is my sister,<br>and also she, she said: He is my brother!<br>With a whole heart and with clean hands have I done this."
Genesis 20 6,"God said to him in the dream:<br>I also know that it was with a whole heart that you did this,<br>and so I also held you back from being at fault against me;<br>therefore I did not let you touch her."
Genesis 20 7,"But now, return the man’s wife<br>—indeed, he is a prophet, he can intercede for you—<br>and live!<br>But if you do not return her:<br>know that you must die, yes, die, you and all that is yours!"
Genesis 20 8,"Early in the morning Avimelekh called all his servants,<br>he spoke all these words in their ears, and the men became exceedingly afraid."
Genesis 20 9,"Then Avimelekh had Avraham called and said to him:<br>What have you done to us?<br>In what did I fail you,<br>that you have brought me and my kingdom into such great fault?<br>Deeds which are not to be done, you have done to me!"
Genesis 20 10,"And Avimelekh said to Avraham:<br>What did you foresee, that you did this thing?"
Genesis 20 11,"Avraham said:<br>Indeed, I said to myself:<br>Surely there is no awe of God in this place;<br>they will kill me on account of my wife!"
Genesis 20 12,"Then, too, she is truly my sister, my father’s daughter,<br>however not my mother’s daughter—so she became my wife."
Genesis 20 13,"Now it was, when the power-of-God caused me to roam from my father’s house,<br>that I said to her:<br>Let this be the favor that you do me:<br>in every place that we come, say of me: He is my brother."
Genesis 20 14,"Then Avimelekh took sheep and oxen, servants and maids, and gave them to Avraham,<br>and returned Sara his wife to him."
Genesis 20 15,"Avimelekh said:<br>Here, my land is before you,<br>settle wherever seems good in your eyes."
Genesis 20 16,"And to Sara he said:<br>Here, I have given a thousand pieces of silver to your brother;<br>here, it shall serve you as a covering for the eyes for all who are with you<br>and with everyone, that you have been decided for."
Genesis 20 17,"Avraham interceded with God<br>and God healed Avimelekh: his wife and his slave-women, so that they gave birth."
Genesis 20 18,"For <small>YHWH</small> had obstructed, obstructed every womb in Avimelekh’s household<br>for the sake of Sara, the wife of Avraham."
Genesis 21 1,"And <small>YHWH</small> took account of Sara as he had said,<br><small>YHWH</small> dealt with Sara as he had spoken."
Genesis 21 2,"Sara became pregnant and bore Avraham a son in his old age,<br>at the set-time of which God had spoken to him."
Genesis 21 3,"And Avraham called the name of his son, who was born to him, whom Sara bore to him:<br>Yitzhak/He Laughs."
Genesis 21 4,"And Avraham circumcised Yitzhak his son at eight days old, as God had commanded him."
Genesis 21 5,Now Avraham was a hundred years old when Yitzhak his son was born to him.
Genesis 21 6,"Now Sara said:<br>God has made laughter for me,<br>all who hear of it will laugh for me!"
Genesis 21 7,"And she said:<br>Who would have declared to Avraham:<br>Sara will nurse sons?<br>Well, I have borne him a son in his old age!"
Genesis 21 8,"The child grew and was weaned,<br>and Avraham made a great drinkfest on the day that Yitzhak was weaned."
Genesis 21 9,"[Once] Sara saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian-woman, whom she had borne to Avraham, laughing. . . ."
Genesis 21 10,"She said to Avraham:<br>Drive out this maidservant and her son,<br>for the son of this maidservant shall not share-inheritance with my son, with Yitzhak!"
Genesis 21 11,The matter was exceedingly bad in Avraham’s eyes because of his son.
Genesis 21 12,"But God said to Avraham:<br>Do not let it be bad in your eyes concerning the lad and concerning your maidservant;<br>in all that Sara says to you, hearken to her voice,<br>for it is through Yitzhak that seed will be called by your [name]."
Genesis 21 13,"But also the son of the maidservant—a nation will I make of him,<br>for he is your seed."
Genesis 21 14,"Avraham started-early in the morning,<br>he took some bread and a skin of water<br>and gave them to Hagar—placing them upon her shoulder— together with the child and sent her away.<br>She went off and roamed in the wilderness of Be’er-Sheva."
Genesis 21 15,"The water in the skin came to an end, so she threw the child under one of the bushes,"
Genesis 21 16,"and went and sat by herself, at a distance, as far away as a bowshot,<br>for she said [to herself]:<br>Let me not see the child die!<br>So she sat at a distance, and lifted up her voice and wept."
Genesis 21 17,"But God heard the voice of the lad;<br>God’s messenger called to Hagar from heaven and said to her:<br>What [ails] you, Hagar? Do not be afraid,<br>for God has heard the voice of the lad there where he is."
Genesis 21 18,"Arise, lift up the lad and grasp him with your hand,<br>for a great nation will I make of him!"
Genesis 21 19,"God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water;<br>she went, filled the skin with water, and gave the lad to drink."
Genesis 21 20,"And God was with the lad as he grew up;<br>he settled in the wilderness, and became an archer, a bowman."
Genesis 21 21,"He settled in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took him a wife from the land of Egypt."
Genesis 21 22,"It was at about that time that Avimelekh, together with Pikhol the commander of his army, said to Avraham, saying:<br>God is with you in all that you do."
Genesis 21 23,"So now, swear to me here by God:<br>If you should ever deal falsely with me, with my progeny and my posterity . . . !<br>Rather, in loyalty, as I have dealt with you, deal with me, and with the land in which you have sojourned."
Genesis 21 24,Avraham said:<br>I so swear.
Genesis 21 25,But Avraham rebuked Avimelekh<br>because of a well of water that Avimelekh’s servants had seized.
Genesis 21 26,"Avimelekh said:<br>I do not know who did this thing,<br>nor have you ever told me, nor have I heard of it apart from today."
Genesis 21 27,"So Avraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Avimelekh,<br>and the two of them cut a covenant."
Genesis 21 28,Then Avraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock aside.
Genesis 21 29,Avimelekh said to Avraham:<br>What [mean] these seven ewe-lambs that you have set aside?
Genesis 21 30,"He said:<br>Indeed, these seven ewe-lambs you should take from my hand,<br>so that they may be a witness for me that I dug this well."
Genesis 21 31,"Therefore that place was called Be’er-Sheva/Well of the Seven-Swearing,<br>for there the two of them swore [an oath]."
Genesis 21 32,Thus they cut a covenant in Be’er-Sheva.<br>Then Avimelekh and Pikhol the commander of his army arose<br>and returned to the land of the Philistines.
Genesis 21 33,Now he planted a tamarisk in Be’er-Sheva<br>and there he called out the name: <small>YHWH</small> God of the Ages.
Genesis 21 34,And Avraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.
Genesis 22 1,Now after these events it was<br>that God tested Avraham<br>and said to him:<br>Avraham!<br>He said:<br>Here I am.
Genesis 22 2,"He said:<br>Pray take your son,<br>your only one,<br>whom you love,<br>Yitzhak,<br>and go-you-forth to the land of Moriyya/Seeing,<br>and offer him up there as an offering-up<br>on one of the mountains<br>that I will tell you of."
Genesis 22 3,"Avraham started-early in the morning;<br>he saddled his donkey,<br>he took his two serving-lads with him and Yitzhak his son,<br>he split wood for the offering-up<br>and arose and went to the place that God had told him of."
Genesis 22 4,On the third day Avraham lifted up his eyes<br>and saw the place from afar.
Genesis 22 5,"Avraham said to his lads:<br>You stay here with the donkey,<br>and I and the lad wish to go yonder;<br>we wish to bow down and then return to you."
Genesis 22 6,"Avraham took the wood for the offering-up,<br>and placed them upon Yitzhak his son,<br>while in his hand he took the fire and the knife.<br>Thus the two of them went together."
Genesis 22 7,"Yitzhak said to Avraham his father, he said:<br>Father!<br>He said:<br>Here I am, my son.<br>He said:<br>Here are the fire and the wood,<br>but where is the lamb for the offering-up?"
Genesis 22 8,"Avraham said:<br>God will see-for-himself to the lamb for the offering-up,<br>my son.<br>Thus the two of them went together."
Genesis 22 9,They came to the place that God had told him of;<br>there Avraham built the altar<br>and arranged the wood<br>and bound Yitzhak his son<br>and placed him on the altar atop the wood.
Genesis 22 10,"And Avraham stretched out his hand,<br>he took the knife to slaughter his son."
Genesis 22 11,But <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger called to him from heaven<br>and said:<br>Avraham! Avraham!<br>He said:<br>Here I am.
Genesis 22 12,"He said:<br>Do not stretch out your hand against the lad,<br>do not do anything to him!<br>For now I know<br>that you are in awe of God—<br>you have not withheld your son, your only one, from me."
Genesis 22 13,"Avraham lifted up his eyes and saw:<br>here, a ram caught behind in the thicket by its horns!<br>Avraham went,<br>he took the ram<br>and offered it up as an offering-up in place of his son."
Genesis 22 14,Avraham called the name of that place: <small>YHWH</small> Sees.<br>As the saying is today: On <small>YHWH’S</small> mountain [it] is seen.
Genesis 22 15,Now <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger called to Avraham a second time from heaven
Genesis 22 16,"and said:<br>By myself I swear<br>—<small>YHWH’S</small> utterance—<br>indeed, because you have done this thing, have not withheld your son, your only one,"
Genesis 22 17,"indeed, I will bless you, bless you,<br>I will make your seed many, yes, many,<br>like the stars of the heavens and like the sand that is on the shore of the sea;<br>your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies,"
Genesis 22 18,"and all the nations of the earth shall enjoy blessing through your seed,<br>in consequence that you hearkened to my voice!"
Genesis 22 19,Avraham returned to his lads;<br>they arose and went together to Be’er-Sheva.<br>And Avraham stayed in Be’er-Sheva.
Genesis 22 20,"Now after these events it was, that it was told to Avraham, saying:<br>Here, Milca too has borne, sons to Nahor your brother:"
Genesis 22 21,"Utz his firstborn and Buz his brother, Kemuel father of Aram,"
Genesis 22 22,"and Cesed, Hazo, Pildash, Yidlaf, and Betuel."
Genesis 22 23,"Now Betuel begot Rivka.—<br>These eight Milca bore to Nahor, Avraham’s brother."
Genesis 22 24,"And his concubine—her name was Re’uma—bore too: Tevah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maakha."
Genesis 23 1,"Now Sara’s life was one hundred years and twenty years and seven years, [thus] the years of Sara’s life."
Genesis 23 2,"Sara died in Arba-Town&mdash;that is Hevron, in the land of Canaan.<br>Avraham set about to lament for Sara and to weep over her;"
Genesis 23 3,"then Avraham arose from the presence of his dead<br>and spoke to the Sons of Het, saying:"
Genesis 23 4,"I am a sojourner settled among you;<br>give me [title to] a burial holding among you,<br>so that I may bury my dead from my presence."
Genesis 23 5,"The Sons of Het answered Avraham, saying to him:"
Genesis 23 6,"Hear us, my lord!<br>You are one exalted by God in our midst—<br>in the choicest of our burial-sites you may bury your dead;<br>no man among us will deny you his burial-site<br>for burying your dead!"
Genesis 23 7,"Avraham proceeded to bow low to the People of the Land, to the Sons of Het,"
Genesis 23 8,"and spoke with them, saying:<br>If it be then according to your wish<br>that I bury my dead from my presence,<br>hear me and interpose for me to Efron son of Tzohar,"
Genesis 23 9,"that he may give me [title to] the cave of Makhpela, that is his, that is at the edge of his field;<br>for the full silver-worth let him give me [title] in your midst for a burial holding."
Genesis 23 10,"Now Efron had a seat amidst the Sons of Het,<br>and Efron the Hittite answered Avraham in the ears of the Sons of Het,<br>of all who had entry to the council-gate of his city,<br>saying:"
Genesis 23 11,"Not so, my lord, hear me!<br>The field I give to you,<br>and the cave that is therein, to you I give it;<br>before the eyes of the Sons of My People I give it to you—<br>bury your dead!"
Genesis 23 12,Avraham bowed before the People of the Land
Genesis 23 13,"and spoke to Efron in the hearing of the People of the Land, saying:<br>But if you yourself would only hear me out!<br>I will give the silver-payment for the field;<br>accept it from me,<br>so that I may bury my dead there."
Genesis 23 14,"Efron answered Avraham, saying to him:"
Genesis 23 15,"My lord—hear me!<br>[A piece of] land worth four hundred silver weight,<br>what is that between me and you!<br>So your dead, bury!"
Genesis 23 16,Avraham hearkened to Efron:<br>Avraham weighed out to Efron the silver-worth<br>of which he had spoken in the hearing of the Sons of Het—<br>four hundred silver weight at the going merchants’ rate.
Genesis 23 17,"Thus was established the field of Efron, that is in Makhpela, that faces Mamre,<br>the field as well as the cave that is in it, and the trees that were in all the field, that were in all their territory round about,"
Genesis 23 18,"for Avraham as an acquisition,<br>before the eyes of the Sons of Het, of all who had entry to the council-gate of his city."
Genesis 23 19,"Afterward Avraham buried Sara his wife<br>in the cave of the field of Makhpela, facing Mamre&mdash;that is Hevron, in the land of Canaan."
Genesis 23 20,"Thus was established the field as well as the cave that is in it for Avraham as a burial holding, from the Sons of Het."
Genesis 24 1,"Now Avraham was old, advanced in days,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> had blessed Avraham in everything."
Genesis 24 2,"Avraham said to his servant, the elder of his household, who ruled over all that was his:<br>Pray put your hand under my thigh!"
Genesis 24 3,"I want you to swear by <small>YHWH</small>, the God of Heaven and the God of Earth,<br>that you will not take a wife for my son from the women of the Canaanites, among whom I am settled;"
Genesis 24 4,"rather, you are to go to my land and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son, for Yitzhak."
Genesis 24 5,"The servant said to him:<br>Perhaps the woman will not be willing to go after me to this land;<br>may I then bring your son back there,<br>back to the land from which you once went out?"
Genesis 24 6,Avraham said to him:<br>Take you care that you do not ever bring my son back there!
Genesis 24 7,"<small>YHWH</small>, the God of Heaven,<br>who took me from my father’s house and from my kindred,<br>who spoke to me,<br>who swore to me, saying:<br>I give this land to your seed—<br>he himself will send his messenger on before you,<br>so that you take a wife for my son from there."
Genesis 24 8,"Now if the woman is not willing to go after you,<br>you will be clear from this sworn-oath of mine;<br>only: You are not to bring my son back there!"
Genesis 24 9,"The servant put his hand under the thigh of Avraham his lord,<br>and swore to him [an oath] about this matter."
Genesis 24 10,"The servant took ten camels from his lord’s camels and went, all kinds of good-things from his lord in his hand,<br>and arose and went to Aram Of-Two-Rivers, to Nahor’s town."
Genesis 24 11,"He had the camels kneel outside the town at the water well<br>at sunset, at the time when the water-drawers go out,"
Genesis 24 12,"and said:<br>O <small>YHWH</small>, God of my lord Avraham,<br>pray let it happen today for me, and deal in loyalty with my lord Avraham!"
Genesis 24 13,"Here, I have stationed myself by the water spring as the women of the town go out to draw water."
Genesis 24 14,"May it be<br>that the maiden to whom I say: Pray lower your pitcher that I may drink,<br>and she says: Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink—<br>let her be the one whom you have decided on for your servant, for Yitzhak,<br>by means of her may I know that you have dealt in loyalty with my lord."
Genesis 24 15,"And it was: not yet had he finished speaking,<br>when here, Rivka came out,<br>who had been born to Betuel, son of Milca, wife of Nahor, brother of Avraham,<br>her pitcher on her shoulder."
Genesis 24 16,"Now the maiden was exceedingly fair to look at,<br>a nubile-girl—no man had known her.<br>She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher and came up again."
Genesis 24 17,And the servant ran to meet her and said:<br>Pray let me sip a little water from your pitcher!
Genesis 24 18,"She said:<br>Drink, my lord!<br>And in haste she let down her pitcher on her arm and gave him to drink."
Genesis 24 19,"[When] she had finished giving him to drink, she said:<br>I will also draw for your camels, until they have finished drinking."
Genesis 24 20,"And in haste she emptied her pitcher into the drinking-trough;<br>then she ran to the well again to draw,<br>and drew for all his camels."
Genesis 24 21,"The man kept staring at her,<br>[waiting] silently to find out whether <small>YHWH</small> had granted success to his journey or not."
Genesis 24 22,"It was, when the camels had finished drinking,<br>that the man took a gold nose-ring, a half-coin in weight, and two bracelets for her wrists, ten gold-pieces in weight,"
Genesis 24 23,and said:<br>Whose daughter are you? Pray tell me!<br>And is there perhaps in your father’s house a place for us to spend the night?
Genesis 24 24,"She said to him:<br>I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milca, whom she bore to Nahor."
Genesis 24 25,"And she said to him:<br>Yes, there is straw, yes, plenty of fodder with us, [and] yes, a place to spend the night!"
Genesis 24 26,The man did homage and bowed low before <small>YHWH</small>
Genesis 24 27,"and said:<br>Blessed be <small>YHWH</small>, God of my lord Avraham,<br>who has not relinquished his loyalty and his faithfulness from my lord!<br>While as for me, <small>YHWH</small> has led me on the journey to the house of my lord’s brothers!"
Genesis 24 28,The maiden ran and told her mother’s household according to these words.
Genesis 24 29,"Now Rivka had a brother, his name was Lavan.<br>Lavan ran to the man, outside, to the spring,"
Genesis 24 30,"and it was,<br>as soon as he saw the nose-ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists,<br>and as soon as he heard Rivka his sister’s words, saying: Thus the man spoke to me,<br>that he went out to the man—there, he was still standing by the camels, by the spring—"
Genesis 24 31,"and said:<br>Come, [you who are] blessed by <small>YHWH</small>, why are you standing outside?<br>I myself have cleared out the house and a place for the camels!"
Genesis 24 32,"The man came into the house and unbridled the camels,<br>and they gave straw and fodder to the camels<br>and water for washing his feet and the feet of the men that were with him."
Genesis 24 33,"[Food] was put before him to eat, but he said:<br>I will not eat until I have spoken my words.<br>He said: Speak!"
Genesis 24 34,He said:<br>I am Avraham’s servant.
Genesis 24 35,"<small>YHWH</small> has blessed my lord exceedingly, so that he has become great:<br>he has given him sheep and oxen, silver and gold, servants and maids, camels and donkeys."
Genesis 24 36,"Sara, my lord’s wife, bore my lord a son after she had grown old,<br>and he has given him all that is his."
Genesis 24 37,"Now my lord had me swear, saying:<br>You are not to take a wife for my son from the women of the Canaanites, in whose land I am settled!"
Genesis 24 38,"No! To my father’s house you are to go, to my clan,<br>and take a wife for my son."
Genesis 24 39,I said to my lord:<br>Perhaps the woman will not go after me!
Genesis 24 40,"He said to me:<br><small>YHWH</small>, in whose presence I have walked, will send his messenger with you;<br>he will grant success to your journey,<br>so that you take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father’s house."
Genesis 24 41,"Then will you be clear from my oath-curse:<br>when you come to my clan,<br>if they do not give her to you, you will be clear from my oath-curse."
Genesis 24 42,"So I came to the well today and said:<br><small>YHWH</small>, God of my lord Avraham,<br>pray, if you wish to grant success to the journey on which I am going,"
Genesis 24 43,"here, I have stationed myself by the water spring;<br>may it be<br>that the girl who comes out to draw,<br>to whom I say: Pray give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,"
Genesis 24 44,"and she says to me: You drink, and I will also draw for your camels—<br>let her be the woman whom <small>YHWH</small> has decided on for the son of my lord."
Genesis 24 45,"[And] I, even before I had finished speaking in my heart,<br>here, Rivka came out, her pitcher on her shoulder,<br>and she went down to the spring and drew.<br>I said to her: Pray give me to drink!"
Genesis 24 46,"And in haste she let down her pitcher from herself and said:<br>Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink.<br>I drank, and she also gave the camels to drink."
Genesis 24 47,"Then I asked her, I said: Whose daughter are you?<br>She said: The daughter of Betuel, son of Nahor, whom Milca bore to him.<br>So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists,"
Genesis 24 48,"and I did homage and bowed low before <small>YHWH</small>, and blessed <small>YHWH</small>, God of my lord Avraham,<br>who led me on the faithful journey to take the daughter of my lord’s brother for his son."
Genesis 24 49,"So now, if you wish to deal in loyalty and faithfulness with my lord, tell me,<br>and if not, tell me,<br>that I may turn right or left."
Genesis 24 50,"Lavan and Betuel answered, they said:<br>The matter has gone out from <small>YHWH</small>;<br>we cannot speak anything to you, evil or good."
Genesis 24 51,"Here is Rivka before you;<br>take her and go, that she may be a wife for the son of your lord,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> has spoken."
Genesis 24 52,"It was<br>when Avraham’s servant heard their words, that he bowed low to the earth before <small>YHWH</small>."
Genesis 24 53,"And the servant brought out objects of silver and objects of gold and garments, and gave them to Rivka,<br>and he gave presents to her brother and to her mother."
Genesis 24 54,"They ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and spent the night.<br>They arose at daybreak, and he said:<br>Send me off to my lord."
Genesis 24 55,"But her brother and her mother said:<br>Let the girl stay with us a few days, perhaps ten; after that she may go."
Genesis 24 56,"He said to them:<br>Do not delay me, for <small>YHWH</small> has granted success to my journey;<br>send me off, that I may go back to my lord."
Genesis 24 57,They said:<br>Let us call the girl and ask [for an answer from] her own mouth.
Genesis 24 58,They called Rivka and said to her:<br>Will you go with this man?<br>She said:<br>I will go.
Genesis 24 59,"So they sent off Rivka their sister with her nurse, and Avraham’s servant with his men,"
Genesis 24 60,"and they gave Rivka farewell-blessing and said to her:<br>Our sister, may you become thousandfold myriads!<br>May your seed possess the gate of those who hate him!"
Genesis 24 61,"Rivka and her maids arose, they mounted the camels and went after the man.<br>And the servant took Rivka and went off."
Genesis 24 62,"Now Yitzhak had gone out from where you come to the Well of the Living-One Seeing-Me, for he had settled in the Negev."
Genesis 24 63,"And Yitzhak went out to stroll in the field around the turning of sunset.<br>He lifted up his eyes and saw: here, camels coming!"
Genesis 24 64,And Rivka lifted up her eyes and saw Yitzhak;
Genesis 24 65,she got down from the camel and said to the servant:<br>Who is the man over there that is walking in the field to meet us?<br>The servant said:<br>That is my lord.<br>So she took a veil and covered herself.
Genesis 24 66,And the servant recounted to Yitzhak all the things that he had done.
Genesis 24 67,"Yitzhak brought her into the tent of Sara his mother;<br>he took Rivka and she became his wife, and he loved her.<br>Thus was Yitzhak comforted after his mother."
Genesis 25 1,Now Avraham had taken another wife&mdash;her name was Ketura.
Genesis 25 2,"She bore him Zimran and Yokshan, Medan and Midyan, Yishbak and Shuah."
Genesis 25 3,"Yokshan begot Sheva and Dedan,<br>Dedan’s sons: the Ashurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites."
Genesis 25 4,"Midyan’s sons: Efa, Efer, Hanokh, Avida, and Eldaa.<br>All these, Ketura’s sons."
Genesis 25 5,But Avraham gave over all that was his to Yitzhak.
Genesis 25 6,"And to the sons of the concubines that Avraham had, Avraham gave gifts, and he sent them away from Yitzhak his son while he was still alive, eastward, to the Eastland."
Genesis 25 7,"Now these are the days [and] years of the life of Avraham, which he lived:"
Genesis 25 8,"a hundred years and seventy years and five years; then he expired.<br>Avraham died at a good ripe-age, old and satisfied [in days],<br>and was gathered to his kinspeople."
Genesis 25 9,"Yitzhak and Yishmael his sons buried him, in the cave of Makhpela, in the field of Efron son of Tzohar the Hittite, that faces Mamre,"
Genesis 25 10,the field that Avraham had acquired from the Sons of Het.<br>There were buried Avraham and Sara his wife.
Genesis 25 11,"Now it was after Avraham’s death, that God blessed Yitzhak his son.<br>And Yitzhak settled by the Well of the Living-One Seeing-Me."
Genesis 25 12,"Now these are the begettings of Yishmael son of Avraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian-woman, Sara’s maid, bore to Avraham."
Genesis 25 13,"And these are the names of the sons of Yishmael, by their names after [the order of] their begettings:"
Genesis 25 14,"Yishmael’s firstborn, Nevayot; and Kedar, Adbe’el, Mivsam, Mishma, Duma, Massa,"
Genesis 25 15,"Hadad and Teima, Yetur, Nafish and Kedma."
Genesis 25 16,"These are the sons of Yishmael, these their names, in their farmsteads and in their corrals,<br>twelve leaders for their tribes."
Genesis 25 17,And these are the years of the life of Yishmael: a hundred years and thirty years and seven years; then he expired.<br>He died and was gathered to his kinspeople.
Genesis 25 18,"Now they dwelt from Havila to Shur, which faces Egypt, back to where you come toward Assyria;<br>in the presence of all his brothers did [his inheritance] fall."
Genesis 25 19,"Now these are the begettings of Yitzhak, son of Avraham.<br>Avraham begot Yitzhak."
Genesis 25 20,"Yitzhak was forty years old when he took Rivka daughter of Betuel the Aramean, from Paddan Aram, sister of Lavan the Aramean, for himself as a wife."
Genesis 25 21,"Yitzhak entreated <small>YHWH</small> on behalf of his wife, for she was barren,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> granted-his-entreaty:<br>Rivka his wife became pregnant."
Genesis 25 22,"But the children [almost] crushed one another inside her,<br>so she said:<br>If so,<br>why do I exist?<br>And she went to inquire of <small>YHWH</small>."
Genesis 25 23,"<small>YHWH</small> said to her:<br>Two nations are in your belly,<br>two tribes from your body shall be divided;<br>tribe shall be mightier than tribe,<br>elder shall be servant to younger!"
Genesis 25 24,"Her days were fulfilled for bearing, and here, twins were in her body!"
Genesis 25 25,"The first one came out ruddy, like a hairy mantle all over,<br>so they called his name: Esav/Rough-One."
Genesis 25 26,"After that his brother came out, his hand grasping Esav’s heel,<br>so they called his name: Yaakov/Heel-Holder.<br>Now Yitzhak was sixty years old when she bore them."
Genesis 25 27,"The lads grew up:<br>Esav became a man knowing the hunt, a man of the open-field,<br>while Yaakov was a plain man, staying among the tents."
Genesis 25 28,"Yitzhak grew to love Esav, for [he brought] hunted-game for his mouth,<br>but Rivka loved Yaakov."
Genesis 25 29,"[Once] Yaakov was boiling boiled-stew,<br>and Esav came in from the field, and he was weary."
Genesis 25 30,"Esav said to Yaakov:<br>Pray give me a gulp of the red-stuff, that red-stuff,<br>for I am so weary!<br>Therefore they called his name: Edom/Red-One."
Genesis 25 31,Yaakov said:<br>Sell me your firstborn-right here-and-now.
Genesis 25 32,"Esav said:<br>Here, I am on my way to dying, so what [good] to me now is a firstborn-right?"
Genesis 25 33,Yaakov said:<br>Swear to me here-and-now.<br>He swore to him and sold his firstborn-right to Yaakov.
Genesis 25 34,Yaakov gave Esav bread and boiled lentils;<br>he ate and drank and arose and went off.<br>Thus did Esav despise the firstborn-right.
Genesis 26 1,"Now there was a famine in the land, aside from the former famine which there had been in the days of Avraham,<br>so Yitzhak went to Avimelekh, king of the Philistines, to Gerar."
Genesis 26 2,And <small>YHWH</small> was seen by him and said:<br>Do not go down to Egypt;<br>[continue to] dwell in the land that I tell you of.
Genesis 26 3,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will give you blessing—<br>for to you and to your seed I give all these lands<br>and will fulfill the sworn-oath that I swore to Avraham your father:"
Genesis 26 4,"I will make your seed many, like the stars of the heavens,<br>and to your seed I will give all these lands;<br>all the nations of the earth shall enjoy blessing through your seed—"
Genesis 26 5,"in consequence that Avraham hearkened to my voice<br>and kept my charge: my commandments, my laws, and my instructions."
Genesis 26 6,So Yitzhak stayed in Gerar.
Genesis 26 7,"The men of the place asked about his wife, and he said: She is my sister,<br>for he was afraid to say: my wife—<br>[thinking]: Otherwise the people of the place will kill me on account of Rivka, for she is fair to look at!"
Genesis 26 8,"But it was, when he had been there a long time,<br>that Avimelekh, king of the Philistines, looked out through a window<br>and saw: there was Yitzhak laughing-and-loving with Rivka his wife!"
Genesis 26 9,"Avimelekh had Yitzhak called and said:<br>But here, she must be your wife!<br>Now how could you say: She is my sister?<br>Yitzhak said to him:<br>Indeed, I said to myself: Otherwise I will die on account of her!"
Genesis 26 10,"Avimelekh said:<br>What is this that you have done to us!<br>One of the people might well have lain with your wife,<br>and then you would have brought guilt upon us!"
Genesis 26 11,"And Avimelekh commanded the entire people, saying:<br>Whoever touches this man or his wife must be put to death, yes, death!"
Genesis 26 12,"Yitzhak sowed in that land, and reaped in that year a hundred measures;<br>thus did <small>YHWH</small> bless him."
Genesis 26 13,"The man became great [in wealth], and went on, went on becoming greater, until he was exceedingly great:"
Genesis 26 14,"he had herds of sheep and herds of oxen and a large retinue-of-servants,<br>and the Philistines envied him."
Genesis 26 15,"And all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Avraham his father, the Philistines stopped up and filled with earth."
Genesis 26 16,"Avimelekh said to Yitzhak:<br>Go away from us, for you have become exceedingly mightier [in number] than we!"
Genesis 26 17,"So Yitzhak went from there, he encamped in the wadi of Gerar<br>and settled there."
Genesis 26 18,"Yitzhak again dug up the wells of water which had been dug in the days of Avraham his father, the Philistines having stopped them up after Avraham’s death,<br>and he called them by the names, the same names, by which his father had called them."
Genesis 26 19,"Yitzhak’s servants also dug in the wadi, and found there a well of living water."
Genesis 26 20,"Now the shepherds of Gerar quarreled with the shepherds of Yitzhak, saying: The water is ours!<br>So he called the name of the well: Esek/Bickering, because they had bickered with him."
Genesis 26 21,"They dug another well, and quarreled also over it,<br>so he called its name: Sitna/Animosity."
Genesis 26 22,"He moved on from there and dug another well, but they did not quarrel over it,<br>so he called its name: Rehovot/Space,<br>and said: Indeed, now <small>YHWH</small> has made space for us, so that we may bear fruit in the land!"
Genesis 26 23,He went up from there to Be’er-Sheva.
Genesis 26 24,"Now <small>YHWH</small> was seen by him on that night and said:<br>I am the God of Avraham your father.<br>Do not be afraid, for I am with you,<br>I will bless you and will make your seed many, for the sake of Avraham my servant."
Genesis 26 25,"He built an altar there<br>and called out the name of <small>YHWH</small>.<br>He spread his tent there, and Yitzhak’s servants excavated a well there."
Genesis 26 26,"Now Avimelekh went to him from Gerar, along with Ahuzzat his aide and Pikhol the commander of his armed-forces."
Genesis 26 27,Yitzhak said to them:<br>For-what-reason have you come to me?<br>For you hate me and have sent me away from you!
Genesis 26 28,"They said:<br>We have seen, yes, seen that <small>YHWH</small> has been with you,<br>so we say: Pray let there be an oath-curse between us, between us and you;<br>we want to cut a covenant with you:"
Genesis 26 29,if ever you should deal badly with us . . . !<br>Just as we have not harmed you and just as we have only dealt well with you and have sent you away in peace—<br>you are now blessed by <small>YHWH</small>!
Genesis 26 30,"He made them a drinkfest, and they ate and drank."
Genesis 26 31,"Early in the morning they swore [an oath] to one another;<br>then Yitzhak sent them off, and they went from him in peace."
Genesis 26 32,Now it was on that same day<br>that Yitzhak’s servants came and told him about the well that they had been digging;<br>they said to him: We have found water!
Genesis 26 33,So he called it: Shiv’a/Swearing-Seven;<br>therefore the name of the city is Be’er-Sheva until this day.
Genesis 26 34,"[When] Esav was forty years old, he took to wife Yehudit daughter of B’eri the Hittite and Ba’semat daughter of Elon the Hittite."
Genesis 26 35,And they were a bitterness of spirit to Yitzhak and Rivka.
Genesis 27 1,"Now when Yitzhak was old and his eyes had become too dim for seeing,<br>he called Esav, his elder son, and said to him:<br>My son!<br>He said to him:<br>Here I am."
Genesis 27 2,"He said:<br>Now here, I have grown old, and do not know the day of my death."
Genesis 27 3,"So-now, pray pick up your weapons—your hanging-quiver and your bow,<br>go out into the field and hunt me down some hunted-game,"
Genesis 27 4,"and make me a tasty-dish, such as I love;<br>bring it to me, and I will eat it,<br>that I may give you my own blessing before I die."
Genesis 27 5,"Now Rivka was listening as Yitzhak spoke to Esav his son,<br>and Esav went off into the fields to hunt down hunted-game to bring [to him],"
Genesis 27 6,"so Rivka said to Yaakov her son, saying:<br>Here, I was listening as your father spoke to Esav your brother, saying:"
Genesis 27 7,"Bring me some hunted-game and make me a tasty-dish, I will eat it<br>and give you blessing before <small>YHWH</small>, before my death."
Genesis 27 8,"So now, my son, listen to my voice, to what I command you:"
Genesis 27 9,"pray go to the flock and take me two fine goats’ kids from there,<br>I will make them into a tasty-dish for your father, such as he loves;"
Genesis 27 10,"you bring it to your father, and he will eat,<br>so that he may give you blessing before his death."
Genesis 27 11,"Yaakov said to Rivka his mother:<br>Here, Esav my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man;"
Genesis 27 12,"perhaps my father will feel me—then I will be like a trickster in his eyes,<br>and I will bring a curse and not a blessing on myself!"
Genesis 27 13,"His mother said to him:<br>On me be your curse, my son!<br>Only: listen to my voice and go, take them for me."
Genesis 27 14,"He went and took and brought them to his mother, and his mother made a tasty-dish, such as his father loved."
Genesis 27 15,"Rivka then took the garments of Esav, her elder son, the choicest ones that were with her in the house,"
Genesis 27 16,"and clothed Yaakov, her younger son,<br>and with the skins of the goats’ kids, she clothed his hands and the smooth-parts of his neck."
Genesis 27 17,Then she placed the tasty-dish and the bread that she had made in the hand of Yaakov her son.
Genesis 27 18,"He came to his father and said:<br>Father!<br>He said:<br>Here I am. Which one are you, my son?"
Genesis 27 19,"Yaakov said to his father:<br>I am Esav, your firstborn.<br>I have done as you spoke to me;<br>pray arise, sit and eat from my hunted-game,<br>that you may give me your own blessing."
Genesis 27 20,"Yitzhak said to his son:<br>How ever did you find it so hastily, my son?<br>He said: Indeed, <small>YHWH</small> your God made it happen for me!"
Genesis 27 21,"Yitzhak said to Yaakov:<br>Pray come closer, that I may feel you, my son,<br>whether you are really my son Esav or not."
Genesis 27 22,"Yaakov moved closer to Yitzhak his father.<br>He felt him and said:<br>The voice is Yaakov’s voice, yet the hands are Esav’s hands—"
Genesis 27 23,"but he did not recognize him, for his hands were like the hands of Esav his brother, hairy.<br>Now he was about to bless him,"
Genesis 27 24,"[when] he said:<br>Are you he, my son Esav?<br>He said:<br>I am."
Genesis 27 25,"So he said: Bring it close to me, and I will eat from the hunted-game of my son,<br>in order that I may give you my own blessing.<br>He put it close to him and he ate;<br>he brought him wine and he drank."
Genesis 27 26,"Then Yitzhak his father said to him:<br>Pray come close and kiss me, my son!"
Genesis 27 27,"He came close and kissed him.<br>Now he smelled the smell of his garments<br>and blessed him and said:<br>See, the smell of my son<br>is like the smell of a field<br>that <small>YHWH</small> has blessed."
Genesis 27 28,"So may God give you<br>from the dew of the heavens,<br>from the fat of the earth,<br>[along with] much grain and new-wine!"
Genesis 27 29,"May peoples serve you,<br>may tribes bow down to you;<br>be master to your brothers,<br>may your mother’s sons bow down to you!<br>Those who damn you, damned!<br>Those who bless you, blessed!"
Genesis 27 30,"Now it was, when Yitzhak had finished blessing Yaakov,<br>yes it was—Yaakov had just gone out, out from the presence of Yitzhak his father—<br>that Esav his brother came back from his hunting."
Genesis 27 31,"He too made a tasty-dish and brought it to his father.<br>He said to his father:<br>Let my father arise and eat from the hunted-game of his son,<br>that you may give me your own blessing."
Genesis 27 32,"Yitzhak his father said to him:<br>Which one are you?<br>He said:<br>I am your son, your firstborn, Esav."
Genesis 27 33,Yitzhak trembled with exceedingly great trembling<br>and said:<br>Who then was he<br>that hunted down hunted-game and brought it to me—I ate it all before you came<br>and I gave him my blessing!<br>Now blessed he must remain!
Genesis 27 34,"When Esav heard the words of his father,<br>he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry,<br>and said to his father:<br>Bless me, me also, Father!"
Genesis 27 35,He said:<br>Your brother came with deceit and took away your blessing.
Genesis 27 36,"He said:<br>Is that why his name was called Yaakov/Heel-Sneak? For he has now sneaked against me twice:<br>my firstborn-right he took, and now he has taken my blessing!<br>And he said:<br>Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?"
Genesis 27 37,"Yitzhak answered, saying to Esav:<br>Here, I have made him master to you,<br>and all his brothers I have given him as servants,<br>with grain and new-wine I have invested him—<br>so for you, what then can I do, my son?"
Genesis 27 38,"Esav said to his father:<br>Have you [only] a single blessing, Father?<br>Bless me, me also, Father!<br>And Esav lifted up his voice and wept."
Genesis 27 39,"Then Yitzhak his father answered, saying to him:<br>Here, from the fat of the earth<br>must be your dwelling-place,<br>from the dew of the heavens above."
Genesis 27 40,"You will live by your sword,<br>you will serve your brother!<br>But it will be<br>that when you brandish it,<br>you will tear his yoke from your neck."
Genesis 27 41,Now Esav held a grudge against Yaakov because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him;<br>Esav said in his heart:<br>Let the days of mourning for my father draw near<br>and [then] I will kill Yaakov my brother!
Genesis 27 42,"Rivka was told of the words of Esav, her elder son.<br>So she sent and called for Yaakov, her younger son,<br>and said to him:<br>Here, Esav your brother is consoling himself about you, with [the thought of] killing you."
Genesis 27 43,"So now, my son, listen to my voice:<br>arise and flee to Lavan my brother in Harran,"
Genesis 27 44,"and stay with him for some time, until your brother’s fury has turned away,"
Genesis 27 45,until his anger turns away from you and he forgets what you did to him.<br>Then I will send and have you taken from there—<br>for should I be bereaved of you both in a single day?
Genesis 27 46,"So Rivka said to Yitzhak:<br>I loathe my life because of those Hittite women;<br>if Yaakov should take a wife from the Hittite women—like these, from the women of the land,<br>why should I have life?"
Genesis 28 1,"So Yitzhak called for Yaakov;<br>he blessed him and charged him, saying to him:<br>You are not to take a wife from the women of Canaan."
Genesis 28 2,"Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Betuel, your mother’s father,<br>and take yourself a wife from there, from the daughters of Lavan, your mother’s brother."
Genesis 28 3,"May God Shaddai bless you,<br>may he make you bear fruit and make you many,<br>so that you become a host of peoples."
Genesis 28 4,"And may he give you the blessing of Avraham,<br>to you and to your seed with you,<br>for you to inherit the land of your sojournings,<br>which God gave to Avraham."
Genesis 28 5,"So Yitzhak sent Yaakov off;<br>he went to Paddan Aram, to Lavan son of Betuel the Aramean,<br>the brother of Rivka, the mother of Yaakov and Esav."
Genesis 28 6,"Now Esav saw<br>that Yitzhak had given Yaakov farewell-blessing and had sent him off to Paddan Aram, to take himself a wife from there,<br>[and that] when he had given him blessing, he had charged him, saying: You are not to take a wife from the women of Canaan!"
Genesis 28 7,And Yaakov had listened to his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.
Genesis 28 8,"And Esav saw<br>that the women of Canaan were bad in the eyes of Yitzhak his father,"
Genesis 28 9,"so Esav went to Yishmael and took Mahalat daughter of Yishmael son of Avraham, sister of Nevayot, in addition to his wives as a wife for him."
Genesis 28 10,"Yaakov went out from Be’er-Sheva and went toward Harran,"
Genesis 28 11,"and encountered a certain place.<br>He had to spend the night there, for the sun had come in.<br>He took one of the stones of the place<br>and set it at his head<br>and lay down in that place."
Genesis 28 12,"And he dreamt:<br>here, a stairway was set up on the earth,<br>its top reaching the heavens,<br>and here, messengers of God were going up and down on it."
Genesis 28 13,"And here,<br><small>YHWH</small> was standing over against him.<br>He said:<br>I am <small>YHWH</small>,<br>the God of Avraham your father and the God of Yitzhak.<br>The land on which you lie<br>I give to you and to your seed."
Genesis 28 14,"Your seed will be like the dust of the earth;<br>you will burst forth, to the Sea, to the east, to the north, to the Negev.<br>All the clans of the soil will find blessing through you and through your seed!"
Genesis 28 15,"Here, I am with you;<br>I will watch over you wherever you go<br>and will bring you back to this ground;<br>indeed, I will not leave you<br>until I have done what I have spoken to you."
Genesis 28 16,"Yaakov awoke from his sleep<br>and said:<br>Why,<br><small>YHWH</small> is in this place,<br>and I, I did not know it!"
Genesis 28 17,"He was awestruck and said:<br>How awe-inspiring is this place!<br>This is none other than a house of God,<br>and that is the gate of heaven!"
Genesis 28 18,"Yaakov started-early in the morning,<br>he took the stone that he had set at his head<br>and set it up as a standing-pillar<br>and poured oil on top of it."
Genesis 28 19,"And he called the name of the place: Bet-El/House of God—<br>however, Luz was the name of the city in former times."
Genesis 28 20,"And Yaakov vowed a vow, saying:<br>If God will be with me<br>and will watch over me on this way that I go<br>and will give me food to eat and a garment to wear,"
Genesis 28 21,"and if I come back in peace to my father’s house—<br><small>YHWH</small> shall be God to me,"
Genesis 28 22,"and this stone that I have set up as a standing-pillar shall become a house of God,<br>and everything that you give me<br>I shall tithe, tithe it to you."
Genesis 29 1,Yaakov lifted his feet and went to the land of the Easterners.
Genesis 29 2,"He looked around him, and there: a well in the field, and there were three herds of sheep crouching near it,<br>for from that well they used to give the herds to drink.<br>Now the stone on the mouth of the well was large,"
Genesis 29 3,"so when all the herds were gathered there,<br>they used to roll the stone from the mouth of the well, give the sheep to drink, and put the stone back on the mouth of the well in its place."
Genesis 29 4,"Now Yaakov said to them:<br>Brothers, where are you from?<br>They said:<br>We are from Harran."
Genesis 29 5,"He said to them:<br>Do you know Lavan, son of Nahor?<br>They said:<br>We know him."
Genesis 29 6,He said to them:<br>Is all well with him?<br>They said:<br>It is well—<br>and here comes Rahel his daughter with the sheep!
Genesis 29 7,"He said:<br>Indeed, it is still broad daylight,<br>it is not time to gather in the livestock,<br>so give the sheep to drink and go back, tend them."
Genesis 29 8,"But they said:<br>We cannot, until all the herds have been gathered;<br>only then do they roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and then we give the sheep to drink."
Genesis 29 9,"While he was still speaking with them,<br>Rahel came with the sheep that were her father’s<br>—for she was a shepherdess."
Genesis 29 10,"Now it was when Yaakov saw Rahel, the daughter of Lavan his mother’s brother,<br>and the sheep of Lavan his mother’s brother,<br>that Yaakov came close,<br>he rolled the stone from the mouth of the well<br>and gave drink to the sheep of Lavan his mother’s brother."
Genesis 29 11,"Then Yaakov kissed Rahel, and lifted up his voice and wept."
Genesis 29 12,And Yaakov told Rahel<br>that he was her father’s brother and that he was Rivka’s son.<br>She ran and told her father.
Genesis 29 13,"Now it was, as soon as Lavan heard the tidings concerning Yaakov, his sister’s son,<br>that he ran to meet him, embraced him and kissed him, and brought him into his house.<br>And he recounted all these events to Lavan."
Genesis 29 14,"Lavan said to him:<br>Without doubt you are my bone, my flesh!<br>And he stayed with him the days of a month."
Genesis 29 15,"Lavan said to Yaakov:<br>Because you are my brother, should you serve me for nothing?<br>Tell me, what shall your wages be?"
Genesis 29 16,"Now Lavan had two daughters: the name of the elder was Le’a, the name of the younger was Rahel."
Genesis 29 17,"Le’a’s eyes were delicate, but Rahel was beautiful of form and beautiful of appearance."
Genesis 29 18,"And Yaakov fell in love with Rahel.<br>He said:<br>I will serve you seven years for Rahel, your younger daughter."
Genesis 29 19,Lavan said:<br>My giving her to you is better than my giving her to another man;<br>stay with me.
Genesis 29 20,"So Yaakov served seven years for Rahel,<br>yet they were in his eyes as but a few days, because of his love for her."
Genesis 29 21,"Then Yaakov said to Lavan:<br>Come-now, [give me] my wife, for my days-of-labor have been fulfilled,<br>so that I may come in to her."
Genesis 29 22,Lavan gathered all the people of the place together and made a drinkfest.
Genesis 29 23,"Now in the evening<br>he took Le’a his daughter and brought her to him,<br>and he came in to her."
Genesis 29 24,"Lavan also gave her Zilpa his maid,<br>for Le’a his daughter as a maid."
Genesis 29 25,"Now in the morning:<br>here, she was Le’a!<br>He said to Lavan:<br>What, now, have you done to me?<br>Was it not for Rahel that I served you?<br>Why have you deceived me?"
Genesis 29 26,"Lavan said:<br>Such is not done in our place, giving away the younger before the firstborn;"
Genesis 29 27,"fill out the bridal-week for this one, and we shall give you that one also,<br>for the service which you will serve me for yet another seven years."
Genesis 29 28,"Yaakov did so—he fulfilled the bridal-week for this one,<br>and he gave him Rahel his daughter as a wife."
Genesis 29 29,"And Lavan also gave Rahel his daughter Bilha his maid,<br>for her as a maid."
Genesis 29 30,"So he came in to Rahel also,<br>and he loved Rahel also,<br>more than Le’a.<br>Then he served him for yet another seven years."
Genesis 29 31,"<small>YHWH</small> saw that Le’a was hated,<br>so he opened her womb,<br>while Rahel was barren."
Genesis 29 32,"And Le’a became pregnant and bore a son;<br>she called his name: Re’uven/See, a Son!<br>for she said:<br>Indeed, <small>YHWH</small> has seen my being afflicted,<br>indeed, now my husband will love me!"
Genesis 29 33,"She became pregnant again and bore a son,<br>and said:<br>Indeed, <small>YHWH</small> has heard that I am hated,<br>so he has given me this one as well!<br>And she called his name: Shim’on/Hearing."
Genesis 29 34,"She became pregnant again and bore a son,<br>and said:<br>Now this time my husband will be joined to me,<br>for I have borne him three sons!<br>Therefore they called his name: Levi/Joining."
Genesis 29 35,"She became pregnant again and bore a son,<br>and said:<br>This time I will give thanks to <small>YHWH</small>!<br>Therefore she called his name: Yehuda/Giving-Thanks.<br>Then she stopped giving birth."
Genesis 30 1,"Rahel saw that she could not bear [children] to Yaakov,<br>and Rahel envied her sister.<br>She said to Yaakov:<br>Come-now, [give] me children!<br>If not, I will die!"
Genesis 30 2,"Yaakov’s anger flared up against Rahel;<br>he said:<br>Am I in place of God,<br>who has denied you fruit of the belly?"
Genesis 30 3,"She said:<br>Here is my slave-girl Bilha;<br>come in to her,<br>that she may give birth upon my knees, that I too may be built-up-with-sons through her."
Genesis 30 4,"She gave him Bilha her maid as a wife,<br>and Yaakov came in to her."
Genesis 30 5,And Bilha became pregnant and bore Yaakov a son.
Genesis 30 6,"Rahel said:<br>God has done-me-justice; yes, he has heard my voice!<br>He has given me a son!<br>Therefore she called his name: Dan/He-Has-Done-Justice."
Genesis 30 7,"And Bilha, Rahel’s maid, became pregnant again and bore a second son to Yaakov."
Genesis 30 8,"Rahel said:<br>A struggle of God have I struggled with my sister; yes, I have prevailed!<br>So she called his name: Naftali/My Struggle."
Genesis 30 9,"Le’a saw that she had stopped giving birth,<br>so she took Zilpa her maid and gave her to Yaakov as a wife."
Genesis 30 10,"And Zilpa, Le’a’s maid, bore Yaakov a son."
Genesis 30 11,Le’a said:<br>What fortune!<br>So she called his name: Gad/Fortune.
Genesis 30 12,"And Zilpa, Le’a’s maid, bore a second son to Yaakov."
Genesis 30 13,Le’a said:<br>What happiness!<br>For women will deem me happy.<br>So she called his name: Asher/Happiness.
Genesis 30 14,"Re’uven went in the days of the wheat-harvest and found some love-apples in the field,<br>and brought them to Le’a his mother.<br>Rahel said to Le’a:<br>Pray give me some of your son’s love-apples!"
Genesis 30 15,"She said to her:<br>Is your taking away my husband such a small thing<br>that you would now take away my son’s love-apples?<br>Rahel said:<br>Very well, he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son’s love-apples."
Genesis 30 16,"Yaakov came home from the field in the evening, and Le’a went out to meet him and said:<br>You must come in to me,<br>for I have hired, yes, hired you for my son’s love-apples.<br>So he lay with her that night."
Genesis 30 17,"And God hearkened to Le’a,<br>so that she became pregnant and bore Yaakov a fifth son."
Genesis 30 18,"Le’a said:<br>God has given me my hired-wages,<br>because I gave my maid to my husband!<br>So she called his name: Yissakhar/There-Is-Hire."
Genesis 30 19,"Once again Le’a became pregnant, and she bore a sixth son to Yaakov."
Genesis 30 20,"Le’a said:<br>God has presented me with a good present,<br>this time my husband will prize me,<br>for I have borne him six sons!<br>So she called his name: Zevulun/Prince."
Genesis 30 21,"Afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name: Dina."
Genesis 30 22,"But God kept Rahel in mind;<br>God hearkened to her and opened her womb,"
Genesis 30 23,so that she became pregnant and bore a son.<br>She said:<br>God has removed/<i>asaf</i><br>my reproach!
Genesis 30 24,"And she called his name: Yosef,<br>saying:<br>May <small>YHWH</small> add/<i>yosef</i><br>another son to me!"
Genesis 30 25,"Now it was, once Rahel had borne Yosef, that Yaakov said to Lavan:<br>Send me free, that I may go back to my place, to my land;"
Genesis 30 26,"give over my wives and my children,<br>for whom I have served you,<br>for I [wish to] go.<br>Indeed, you yourself know my service that I have served you!"
Genesis 30 27,"Lavan said to him:<br>Pray, if I have found favor in your eyes . . .<br>I have become wealthy,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> has blessed me on account of you."
Genesis 30 28,"And he said: Specify the wages due you from me, and I will give [them] to you."
Genesis 30 29,"He said to him:<br>You yourself know<br>how I have served you,<br>and how it has gone with your livestock in my keeping."
Genesis 30 30,"For you had but few before me,<br>and they have since burst out into a multitude.<br>Thus has <small>YHWH</small> blessed you at my [every] step!<br>But now, when may I too do something for my household?"
Genesis 30 31,"He said:<br>What shall I give you?<br>Yaakov said: <br>You are not to give me anything—<br>only do this thing for me,<br>then I will return, I will tend your flock, I will keep watch:"
Genesis 30 32,"let me go over your whole flock today<br>removing from there every speckled and dappled head,<br>and every dark head among the lambs, and each dappled and speckled one among the goats—they shall be my wages."
Genesis 30 33,"And may my honesty plead for me on a future day:<br>when you come-to-check my wages [that are] before you,<br>whatever is not speckled or dappled among the goats, or dark among the lambs,<br>[will be considered] as stolen by me."
Genesis 30 34,"Lavan said:<br>Good, let it be according to your words."
Genesis 30 35,"And on that day he removed the streaked and dappled he-goats<br>and every speckled and dappled she-goat, every one that had any white on it,<br>and every dark one among the lambs,<br>and handed them over to his sons."
Genesis 30 36,Then he put a three-days’ journey between himself and Yaakov.<br>Now Yaakov was tending Lavan’s remaining flock.
Genesis 30 37,"And Yaakov took himself rods from moist poplar, almond, and plane trees<br>and peeled white peelings in them, exposing the white that was on the rods;"
Genesis 30 38,"then he presented the rods that he had peeled in the gutters, in the water troughs where the flock would come to drink, in front of the flock.<br>Now they would be in heat as they came to drink;"
Genesis 30 39,"so the flock came to be in heat by the rods,<br>and the flock bore streaked, speckled, and dappled [young]."
Genesis 30 40,"But the sheep, Yaakov set apart,<br>and gave position among the flock to [each] streaked one and every dark one among Lavan’s flocks;<br>thus he made special herds for himself, but did not make them for Lavan’s flock."
Genesis 30 41,"So it was that whenever the robust flock-animals were in heat,<br>Yaakov would put the rods in sight of the flock-animals, in the gutters, to make them be in heat next to the rods."
Genesis 30 42,"But when the flock-animals were feeble, he would not put them there.<br>And so it was that the feeble ones became Lavan’s, and the robust ones, Yaakov’s."
Genesis 30 43,"The man burst forth [with wealth] exceedingly, yes, exceedingly&mdash;he came to have many flock-animals and maids and servants, and camels and donkeys."
Genesis 31 1,"Now he heard the words of Lavan’s sons, [that they] said:<br>Yaakov has taken away all that was our father’s,<br>and from what was our father’s he has made all this weighty-wealth!"
Genesis 31 2,"And Yaakov saw by Lavan’s face:<br>here, he was no longer with him as yesterday [and the] day-before."
Genesis 31 3,"And <small>YHWH</small> said to Yaakov:<br>Return to the land of your fathers, to your kindred!<br>I will be with you!"
Genesis 31 4,"So Yaakov sent and had Rahel and Le’a called to the field, to his animals,"
Genesis 31 5,"and said to them:<br>I see by your father’s face<br>that indeed, he is no longer toward me as yesterday [and] the day-before.<br>But the God of my father has been with me!"
Genesis 31 6,"You yourselves know that I have served your father with all my might,"
Genesis 31 7,"but your father has duped me and changed my wages ten times over,<br>yet God has not allowed him to do me ill."
Genesis 31 8,"If he said thus: The speckled ones shall be your wages,<br>all the animals would bear speckled ones,<br>and if he said thus: The streaked ones shall be your wages,<br>all the animals would bear streaked ones."
Genesis 31 9,So God has snatched away your father’s livestock and given them to me.
Genesis 31 10,"Now it was at the time of the animals’ being in heat<br>that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream:<br>here, all the he-goats that mount the animals—streaked, speckled, and spotted!"
Genesis 31 11,And God’s messenger said to me in the dream: Yaakov!<br>I said: Here I am.
Genesis 31 12,"He said:<br>Pray lift up your eyes and see:<br>all the he-goats that mount the animals—streaked, speckled, and spotted!<br>For I have seen all that Lavan is doing to you."
Genesis 31 13,"I am the God of Bet-El,<br>where you anointed the pillar,<br>where you vowed a vow to me.<br>So now, arise,<br>get out of this land,<br>return to the land of your kindred!"
Genesis 31 14,"Rahel and Le’a answered him, they said to him:<br>Do we still have a share, an inheritance in our father’s house?"
Genesis 31 15,"Is it not as strangers that we are thought of by him?<br>For he has sold us and eaten up, yes, eaten up our purchase-price!"
Genesis 31 16,"Indeed, all the riches that God has snatched away from our father—<br>they belong to us and to our children.<br>So now, whatever God has said to you, do!"
Genesis 31 17,"So Yaakov arose, he lifted his children and his wives onto the camels"
Genesis 31 18,"and led away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained,<br>the acquired-livestock of his own acquiring which he had gained in Paddan Aram,<br>to come home to Yitzhak his father in the land of Canaan."
Genesis 31 19,"Now Lavan had gone to shear his flock;<br>Rahel, meanwhile, stole the <i>terafim</i> that belonged to her father."
Genesis 31 20,"Now Yaakov stole the wits of Lavan the Aramean,<br>by not telling him that he was about to flee."
Genesis 31 21,"And flee he did, he and all that was his;<br>he arose and crossed the River, and set his face toward the highlands of Gil’ad."
Genesis 31 22,Lavan was told on the third day that Yaakov had fled;
Genesis 31 23,"he took his tribal-brothers with him and pursued him, a seven-days’ journey,<br>and caught up with him in the highlands of Gil’ad."
Genesis 31 24,"But God came to Lavan the Aramean in a dream of the night<br>and said to him:<br>Take you care,<br>lest you speak to Yaakov, good or ill!"
Genesis 31 25,"Lavan caught up with Yaakov,<br>—Yaakov had pegged his tent in the highlands, and Lavan along with his brothers had pegged [his tent] in the highlands of Gil’ad—"
Genesis 31 26,and Lavan said to Yaakov:<br>What did you mean to do<br>by stealing my wits and leading my daughters away like captives of the sword?
Genesis 31 27,"Why did you secretly flee and steal away on me, without even telling me,<br>—for I would have sent you off with joy and with song, with drum and with lyre—"
Genesis 31 28,and you did not even allow me to kiss my grandchildren and my daughters?<br>Now you have done foolishly!
Genesis 31 29,"It lies in my hand’s power to do [all of] you ill!<br>But yesterday night the God of your father said to me, saying:<br>Take you care<br>from speaking to Yaakov, good or ill!"
Genesis 31 30,"Well now, you had to go, yes, go, since you longed, longed for your father’s house—<br>why did you steal my gods?"
Genesis 31 31,"Yaakov answered and said to Lavan:<br>Indeed, I was afraid, for I said to myself: Perhaps you will even rob me of your daughters!"
Genesis 31 32,"With whomever you find your gods, he shall not live;<br>here in front of our brothers, [see if] you recognize anything of yours with me, and take it!<br>Yaakov did not know that Rahel had stolen them."
Genesis 31 33,"Lavan came into Yaakov’s tent and into Le’a’s tent and into the tent of the two maids, but he did not find [them].<br>Then he went out of Lea’s tent and came into Rahel’s tent."
Genesis 31 34,"Now Rahel had taken the <i>terafim</i> and had put them in the basket-saddle of the camels, and had sat down upon them.<br>Lavan felt all around the tent, but he did not find [them]."
Genesis 31 35,"She said to her father:<br>Do not let upset be in my lord’s eyes that I am not able to rise in your presence,<br>for the way of women is upon me!<br>So he searched, but he did not find the <i>terafim.</i>"
Genesis 31 36,"Now Yaakov became upset and took up quarrel with Lavan,<br>Yaakov spoke up, saying to Lavan:<br>What is my offense, what is my sin,<br>that you have dashed hotly after me,"
Genesis 31 37,"that you have felt all through my wares?<br>What have you found from all your household wares?<br>Set it here in front of your brothers and my brothers,<br>that they may decide between us two!"
Genesis 31 38,"It is twenty years now that I have been under you:<br>your ewes and your she-goats have never miscarried,<br>the rams from your flock I never have eaten,"
Genesis 31 39,"none torn-by-beasts have I ever brought you—<br>I would make good the loss,<br>at my hand you would seek it,<br>stolen by day or stolen by night."
Genesis 31 40,"[Thus] I was:<br>by day, parching-heat consumed me, and cold by night,<br>and my sleep eluded my eyes."
Genesis 31 41,"It is twenty years for me now in your house:<br>I have served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your animals,<br>yet you have changed my wages ten times over."
Genesis 31 42,"Had not the God of my father,<br>the God of Avraham and the Terror of Yitzhak,<br>been for me,<br>indeed, you would have sent me off now empty-handed!<br>But God has seen my being afflicted and the toil of my hands,<br>and yesterday night he decided."
Genesis 31 43,"Lavan answered; he said to Yaakov:<br>The daughters are my daughters,<br>the children are my children,<br>the animals are my animals—<br>all that you see, it is mine!<br>But to my daughters—what can I do to them today, or to their children whom they have borne?"
Genesis 31 44,"So-now, come,<br>let us cut a covenant, I and you,<br>and let [something here] serve as a witness between me and you."
Genesis 31 45,Yaakov took a stone and erected it as a standing-pillar.
Genesis 31 46,And Yaakov said to his brothers:<br>Collect stones!<br>They fetched stones and made a mound.<br>And they ate there by the mound.
Genesis 31 47,"Lavan called it: <i>Yegar Sahaduta,</i><br>while Yaakov called it: Gal-Ed."
Genesis 31 48,"Lavan said:<br>This mound is witness between me and you from today.<br>Therefore they called its name: Gal-Ed/Mound-Witness,"
Genesis 31 49,"and: Mitzpa/Guardpost,<br>because he said:<br>May <small>YHWH</small> keep guard between me and you, when we are hidden from one another!"
Genesis 31 50,"If you should ever afflict my daughters,<br>if you should ever take wives besides my daughters . . . !<br>No man is here with us,<br>[but] see, God is witness between me and you!"
Genesis 31 51,"And Lavan said to Yaakov:<br>Here is this mound, here is the pillar that I have sunk between me and you:"
Genesis 31 52,"witness is this mound, witness is the pillar<br>that I will not cross over this mound to you<br>and you will not cross over this mound and this pillar to me,<br>for ill!"
Genesis 31 53,May the God of Avraham and the God of Nahor keep-justice between us—the God of their father.<br>And Yaakov swore by the Terror of his father Yitzhak.
Genesis 31 54,Then Yaakov slew a sacrificial-meal on the mountain<br>and called his brothers to eat bread.<br>They ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.
Genesis 32 1,Lavan started-early in the morning and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them;<br>then Lavan went and returned to his place.
Genesis 32 2,"As Yaakov went on his way,<br>messengers of God encountered him."
Genesis 32 3,Yaakov said when he saw them:<br>This is a camp of God!<br>And he called the name of that place: Mahanayim/Double-Camp.
Genesis 32 4,"Now Yaakov sent messengers on ahead of him to Esav his brother in the land of Se’ir, in the territory of Edom,"
Genesis 32 5,"and charged them, saying:<br>Thus say to my lord, to Esav:<br>Thus says your servant Yaakov:<br>I have sojourned with Lavan and have tarried until now."
Genesis 32 6,"Ox and donkey, sheep and servant and maid have become mine.<br>So I have sent to tell my lord, to find favor in your eyes."
Genesis 32 7,"The messengers returned to Yaakov, saying:<br>We came to your brother, to Esav—<br>but he is already coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him!"
Genesis 32 8,Yaakov became exceedingly afraid and was distressed.<br>He divided the people that were with him and the sheep and the oxen and the camels into two camps;
Genesis 32 9,"he said [to himself]:<br>Should Esav come against the one camp and strike it, the camp that is left will be a remnant-that-escapes."
Genesis 32 10,"Then Yaakov said:<br>God of my father Avraham,<br>God of my father Yitzhak,<br>O <small>YHWH</small>,<br>who said to me: Return to your land, to your kindred, and I will deal well with you!—"
Genesis 32 11,"too small am I for all the loyalty and faithfulness that you have shown your servant.<br>For with [only] my rod did I cross this Jordan, and now I have become two camps."
Genesis 32 12,"Pray save me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esav!<br>For I am in fear of him,<br>lest he come and strike me down, mothers and children alike!"
Genesis 32 13,"But you, you have said:<br>I will deal well, well with you,<br>I will make your seed like the sand of the sea, which is too much to count!"
Genesis 32 14,"He spent the night there that night,<br>and took a gift from what was at hand, for Esav his brother:"
Genesis 32 15,"she-goats, two hundred, and kids, twenty,<br>ewes, two hundred, and rams, twenty,"
Genesis 32 16,"nursing camels and their young, thirty,<br>cows, forty, and bulls, ten,<br>she-asses, twenty, and colts, ten;"
Genesis 32 17,"he handed them over to his servants, herd by herd separately,<br>and said to his servants:<br>Cross on ahead of me, and leave room between herd and herd."
Genesis 32 18,"He charged the first group, saying:<br>When Esav my brother meets you<br>and asks you, saying: To whom do you belong, where are you going, and to whom do these ahead of you belong?"
Genesis 32 19,"Then say:<br>—to your servant, to Yaakov, it is a gift sent to my lord, to Esav,<br>and here, he himself is also behind us."
Genesis 32 20,"Thus he charged the second, and thus the third, and thus all that were walking behind the herds, saying:<br>According to this word shall you speak to Esav when you come upon him:"
Genesis 32 21,"you shall say: Also—here, your servant Yaakov is behind us.<br>For he said [to himself]:<br>I will wipe [the anger from] his face<br>with the gift that goes ahead of my face;<br>afterward, when I see his face,<br>perhaps he will lift up my face!"
Genesis 32 22,"The gift crossed over ahead of his face,<br>but he spent the night on that night in the camp."
Genesis 32 23,"He arose during that night<br>and took his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven children<br>to cross the Yabbok crossing."
Genesis 32 24,He took them and brought them across the river; he brought across what belonged to him.
Genesis 32 25,And Yaakov was left alone—<br>and a man wrestled with him until the coming up of dawn.
Genesis 32 26,"He saw that he could not prevail against him,<br>so he touched the socket of his thigh;<br>and the socket of Yaakov’s thigh was dislocated as he wrestled with him."
Genesis 32 27,"Then he said:<br>Let me go,<br>for dawn has come up!<br>But he said:<br>I will not let you go<br>unless you bless me."
Genesis 32 28,He said to him:<br>What is your name?<br>And he said: Yaakov.
Genesis 32 29,"Then he said:<br>Not as Yaakov/Heel-Sneak shall your name be henceforth uttered,<br>but rather as Yisrael/God-Fighter,<br>for you have fought with God and men<br>and have prevailed."
Genesis 32 30,"Then Yaakov asked and said:<br>Pray tell me your name!<br>But he said:<br>Why, now, do you ask about my name?<br>And he gave him farewell-blessing there."
Genesis 32 31,"Yaakov called the name of the place: Peniel/Face of God,<br>for: I have seen God,<br>face to face,<br>and my life has been saved!"
Genesis 32 32,"The sun rose on him as he crossed by Penuel,<br>and he was limping on his thigh."
Genesis 32 33,"—Therefore the Children of Israel do not eat the nerve sinew that is on the socket of the thigh until this day,<br>for he had touched the socket of Yaakov’s thigh at the nerve sinew."
Genesis 33 1,"Yaakov lifted up his eyes and saw:<br>there was Esav coming, and with him, four hundred men!<br>He divided the children among Le’a, Rahel, and the two maids:"
Genesis 33 2,"he put the maids and their children first,<br>Le’a and her children behind them,<br>and Rahel and Yosef behind them,"
Genesis 33 3,"while he himself advanced ahead of them.<br>And he bowed low to the earth seven times, until he had come close to him, to his brother."
Genesis 33 4,"Esav ran to meet him;<br>he embraced him, flung himself upon his neck, and kissed him.<br>And they wept."
Genesis 33 5,"Then he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said:<br>What are these to you?<br>He said:<br>—the children with whom God has favored your servant."
Genesis 33 6,"Then the maids came close, they and their children, and bowed low."
Genesis 33 7,Then Le’a and her children came close and bowed low.<br>Afterward Yosef and Rahel came close and bowed low.
Genesis 33 8,He said:<br>What to you is all this camp that I have met?<br>He said:<br>—To find favor in my lord’s eyes.
Genesis 33 9,"Esav said:<br>I have plenty, my brother, let what is yours remain yours."
Genesis 33 10,"Yaakov said:<br>No, I pray!<br>Pray, if I have found favor in your eyes,<br>then take this gift from my hand.<br>For I have, after all, seen your face, as one sees the face of God,<br>and you have been gracious to me."
Genesis 33 11,"Pray take my token-of-blessing that is brought to you,<br>for God has shown me favor—for I have everything.<br>And he pressed him, so he took it."
Genesis 33 12,"Then he said:<br>Let us move on and go, and I will go at your side."
Genesis 33 13,"But he said to him:<br>My lord knows<br>that the children are frail,<br>and the sheep and the oxen are suckling in my care;<br>if we were to push them for a single day, all the animals would die!"
Genesis 33 14,"Pray let my lord cross on ahead of his servant,<br>while as for me, I will travel slowly,<br>at the pace of the gear ahead of me and at the pace of the children,<br>until I come to my lord, at Se’ir."
Genesis 33 15,"Esav said:<br>Pray let me leave with you some of the people who are mine.<br>But he said:<br>Why, now?<br>May I only find favor in my lord’s eyes!"
Genesis 33 16,"So Esav started back that same day on his journey to Se’ir,"
Genesis 33 17,"while Yaakov traveled to Succot.<br>He built himself a house there, and for his livestock he made sheds.<br>Therefore they called the name of the place: Succot/Sheds."
Genesis 33 18,"Yaakov came home in peace to the city of Shekhem, which is in the land of Canaan,<br>on his homecoming from Paddan Aram,<br>and he encamped facing the city."
Genesis 33 19,"And he acquired the piece of territory where he had spread out his tent, from the Sons of Hamor, Shekhem’s father, for a hundred <i>kesitas</i>."
Genesis 33 20,"There he set up an altar<br>and called it:<br><i>El</i>/God, the God of Yisrael!"
Genesis 34 1,"Dina, Le’a’s daughter, whom she had borne to Yaakov, went out to see the women of the land."
Genesis 34 2,"And Shekhem son of Hamor the Hivvite, the prince of the land, saw her;<br>he took her and lay with her: he forced her."
Genesis 34 3,"But his feelings clung to Dina, Yaakov’s daughter—he loved the girl,<br>and he spoke to the heart of the girl."
Genesis 34 4,"So Shekhem said to Hamor his father, saying:<br>Take me this girl as a wife!"
Genesis 34 5,"Now Yaakov had heard that he had defiled Dina his daughter,<br>but since his sons were with his livestock in the fields, Yaakov kept silent until they came home."
Genesis 34 6,"Hamor, Shekhem’s father, went out to Yaakov, to speak with him."
Genesis 34 7,"But Yaakov’s sons came back from the fields when they heard,<br>and the men were pained, they were exceedingly upset,<br>for he had done a disgrace in Israel by lying with Yaakov’s daughter,<br>such [a thing] is not to be done!"
Genesis 34 8,"Hamor spoke with them, saying:<br>My son Shekhem—<br>his feelings are so attached to your daughter,<br>[so] pray give her to him as a wife!"
Genesis 34 9,"And make marriage-alliances with us:<br>give us your daughters, and our daughters take for yourselves,"
Genesis 34 10,"and settle among us!<br>The land shall be [open] before you:<br>settle down, travel about it, obtain holdings in it!"
Genesis 34 11,"And Shekhem said to her father and to her brothers:<br>May I only find favor in your eyes!<br>However much you say to me, I will give-in-payment;"
Genesis 34 12,"to whatever extreme you multiply the bride-price and the marriage-gift,<br>I will give however much you say to me—<br>just give me the girl as a wife!"
Genesis 34 13,Yaakov’s sons answered Shekhem and Hamor his father with deceit;<br>they spoke [thus] because he had defiled Dina their sister.
Genesis 34 14,"They said to them:<br>We cannot do this thing,<br>give our sister to a man who has a foreskin,<br>for that would be a reproach for us!"
Genesis 34 15,"Only on this [condition] will we comply with you:<br>if you become like us, by having every male among you circumcised."
Genesis 34 16,"Then we will give you our daughters, and your daughters we will take for ourselves,<br>and we will settle among you, so that we become a single people."
Genesis 34 17,"But if you do not hearken to us, to be circumcised,<br>we will take our daughter and go."
Genesis 34 18,"Their words seemed good in the eyes of Hamor and in the eyes of Shekhem son of Hamor,"
Genesis 34 19,"and the young man did not hesitate to do the thing,<br>for he took delight in Yaakov’s daughter.<br>Now he carried more weight than anyone in his father’s house."
Genesis 34 20,"Hamor and Shekhem his son came back to the gate of their city,<br>and they spoke to the men of their city, saying:"
Genesis 34 21,"These men are peaceably disposed toward us;<br>let them settle in the land and travel about in it,<br>for the land is certainly wide-reaching enough for them!<br>Let us take their daughters as wives for ourselves, and let us give them our daughters."
Genesis 34 22,"But only on this [condition] will the men comply with us, to settle among us, to become a single people:<br>that every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised."
Genesis 34 23,"Their acquired-livestock, their acquired-property and all their animals—will they not then become ours?!<br>Let us only comply with them, that they may settle among us!"
Genesis 34 24,"So they hearkened to Hamor and to Shekhem his son, all who go out [to war] from the gate of his city:<br>all the males were circumcised, all who go out [to war] from the gate of his city."
Genesis 34 25,"But on the third day it was, when they were still hurting,<br>that two of Yaakov’s sons, Shim’on and Levi, Dina’s full-brothers, took each man his sword, <br>they came upon the city [feeling] secure, and killed all the males,"
Genesis 34 26,and Hamor and Shekhem his son they killed by the sword.<br>Then they took Dina from Shekhem’s house and went off.
Genesis 34 27,"Yaakov’s [other] sons came up upon the corpses and plundered the city,<br>because they had defiled their sister."
Genesis 34 28,"Their sheep, their oxen, their donkeys—whatever was inside the city and out in the field, they took;"
Genesis 34 29,"all their riches, all their little-ones and their wives they captured and plundered,<br>as well as all that was in the houses."
Genesis 34 30,"But Yaakov said to Shim’on and to Levi:<br>You have stirred-up-disaster for me,<br>making me reek among the settled-folk of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites!<br>For I am menfolk few in number;<br>they will band together against me and strike me,<br>and I will be wiped out, I and my household!"
Genesis 34 31,But they said:<br>Should our sister then be treated like a whore?
Genesis 35 1,"Now God said to Yaakov:<br>Arise,<br>go up to Bet-El and stay there,<br>and construct an altar there<br>to the God/<i>El</i> who was seen by you when you fled from Esav your brother."
Genesis 35 2,Yaakov said to his household and to all who were with him:<br>Put away the foreign gods that are in your midst!<br>Purify yourselves! Change your garments!
Genesis 35 3,Let us arise and go up to Bet-El;<br>there I will construct an altar<br>to the God who answered me on the day of my distress<br>—he was with me on the way that I went!
Genesis 35 4,"So they gave Yaakov all the foreign gods that were in their hand, along with the sacred-rings that were in their ears,<br>and Yaakov concealed them under the oak/<i>ela</i> that is near Shekhem."
Genesis 35 5,"Then they moved on.<br>Now a dread from God lay upon the towns that were around them,<br>so that they did not pursue Yaakov’s sons."
Genesis 35 6,"So Yaakov came back to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan&mdash;that is Bet-El, he and all the people that were with him."
Genesis 35 7,"There he built an altar<br>and called the place:<br>Godhead/<i>El</i> of Bet-El!<br>For there had the power-of-God been revealed to him, when he fled from his brother."
Genesis 35 8,"Devora, Rivka’s nurse, died.<br>She was buried below Bet-El, beneath the oak,<br>so they called its name: Allon Bakhut/Oak of Weeping."
Genesis 35 9,"God was seen by Yaakov again, when he came back from Paddan Aram,<br>and he gave him blessing:"
Genesis 35 10,"God said to him:<br>Yaakov is your name&mdash;<br>Yaakov shall your name be called no more,<br>for Yisrael shall be your name!<br>And he called his name: Yisrael."
Genesis 35 11,"God said further to him:<br>I am God Shaddai.<br>Bear fruit and be many!<br>Nation, yes, a host of nations shall come from you;<br>kings shall go out from your loins!"
Genesis 35 12,"And the land<br>that I gave to Avraham and to Yitzhak,<br>to you I give it,<br>and to your seed after you I give the land."
Genesis 35 13,"God went up from beside him, at the place where he had spoken with him."
Genesis 35 14,"And Yaakov set up a standing-pillar at the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone;<br>he poured out a poured-offering on it and cast oil upon it."
Genesis 35 15,And Yaakov called the name of the place where God had spoken with him:<br>Bet-El/House of God!
Genesis 35 16,"They moved on from Bet-El.<br>But when there was still a stretch of land to come to Efrat,<br>Rahel began to give birth,<br>and she had a very hard birthing."
Genesis 35 17,"It was, when her birthing was at its hardest,<br>that the midwife said to her:<br>Do not be afraid,<br>for this one too is a son for you!"
Genesis 35 18,"It was, as her life was slipping away<br>—for she was dying—<br>that she called his name: Ben-Oni/Son-of-My-Woe.<br>But his father called him: Binyamin/Son-of-the-Right-Hand."
Genesis 35 19,So Rahel died;<br>she was buried along the way to Efrat—that is Bet-Lehem.
Genesis 35 20,Yaakov set up a standing-pillar over her burial-place;<br>that is Rahel’s burial pillar of today.
Genesis 35 21,Yisrael moved on and spread his tent beyond Migdal-Eder/Herd-Tower.
Genesis 35 22,"And it was when Yisrael was dwelling in that land, that Re’uven went and lay with Bilha, his father’s concubine.<br>And Yisrael heard—<br> Now the sons of Yaakov were twelve:"
Genesis 35 23,"The sons of Le’a: Yaakov’s firstborn, Re’uven; Shim’on, Levi and Yehuda, Yissakhar and Zevulun."
Genesis 35 24,The sons of Rahel: Yosef and Binyamin.
Genesis 35 25,"And the sons of Bilha, Rahel’s maid: Dan and Naftali."
Genesis 35 26,"And the sons of Zilpa, Lea’s maid: Gad and Asher.<br>These [were] Yaakov’s sons, who were born to him in Paddan Aram."
Genesis 35 27,"Yaakov came home to Yitzhak his father at Mamre, in the city of Arba—that is Hevron,<br>where Avraham and Yitzhak had sojourned."
Genesis 35 28,"And the days of Yitzhak were a hundred years and eighty years,"
Genesis 35 29,"then Yitzhak expired.<br>He died and was gathered to his kinspeople, old and satisfied in days.<br>Esav and Yaakov his sons buried him."
Genesis 36 1,And these are the begettings of Esav—that is Edom.
Genesis 36 2,"Esav took his wives from the women of Canaan:<br>Ada, daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholivama, daughter of Ana [and] granddaughter of Tziv’on the Hivvite,"
Genesis 36 3,"and Ba’semat, daughter of Yishmael and sister of Nevayot."
Genesis 36 4,"Ada bore Elifaz to Esav,<br>Ba’semat bore Re’uel,"
Genesis 36 5,"and Oholivama bore Ye’ush, Ya’lam, and Korah.<br>These are Esav’s sons, who were born to him in the land of Canaan."
Genesis 36 6,"Esav took his wives, his sons and his daughters, and all the persons in his household,<br>as well as his acquired-livestock, all his animals, and all his acquisitions that he had gained in the land of Canaan,<br>and went to [another] land, away from Yaakov his brother,"
Genesis 36 7,"for their property was too much for them to settle together;<br>the land of their sojourning could not support them, on account of their acquired-livestock."
Genesis 36 8,"So Esav settled in the highlands of Se’ir—Esav, that is Edom."
Genesis 36 9,"And these are the begettings of Esav, the tribal-father of Edom, in the highlands of Se’ir:"

Genesis 37 3,"Now Yisrael loved Yosef above all his sons,<br>for he was a son of old age to him,<br>so he made him an ornamented tunic."
Genesis 37 4,"His brothers saw that it was he whom their father loved above all his brothers,<br>so they hated him,<br>and could not speak to him in peace."
Genesis 37 5,"Yosef dreamt a dream, and told it to his brothers<br>—from then on they hated him still more—;"
Genesis 37 6,he said to them:<br>Pray hear this dream that I have dreamt:
Genesis 37 7,"Now here,<br>we were binding sheaf-bundles out in the field,<br>and here, my sheaf arose, and it was standing upright,<br>and here, your sheaves were circling round and bowing down to my sheaf!"
Genesis 37 8,"His brothers said to him:<br>Would you be king, yes, king over us?<br>Or would you really rule, yes, rule us?<br>From then on they hated him still more—for his dreams, for his words."
Genesis 37 9,"But he dreamt still another dream, and recounted it to his brothers;<br>he said:<br>Here, I have dreamt still [another] dream:<br>now here,<br>the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me!"
Genesis 37 10,"[When] he recounted it to his father and his brothers,<br>his father rebuked him and said to him:<br>What kind of dream is this that you have dreamt!<br>Shall we come, yes, come, I, your mother and your brothers,<br>to bow down to you to the ground?"
Genesis 37 11,"His brothers envied him,<br>while his father kept the matter in mind."
Genesis 37 12,Now his brothers went to tend their father’s sheep in Shekhem.
Genesis 37 13,"Yisrael said to Yosef:<br>Are not your brothers tending sheep in Shekhem?<br>Come, I will send you to them!<br>He said to him:<br>Here I am."
Genesis 37 14,"And he said to him:<br>Come, pray, look into the well-being of your brothers and into the well-being of the sheep,<br>and bring me back word.<br>So he sent him out from the valley of Hevron, and he came to Shekhem."
Genesis 37 15,"And a man came upon him—here, he was roaming in the field;<br>the man asked him, saying:<br>What do you seek?"
Genesis 37 16,"He said:<br>I seek my brothers,<br>pray tell me where they are tending-sheep."
Genesis 37 17,"The man said:<br>They have moved on from here;<br>indeed, I heard them say: Let us go to Dotan.<br>Yosef went after his brothers and came upon them in Dotan."
Genesis 37 18,"They saw him from afar,<br>and before he had gotten near them, they plotted-cunningly against him to cause his death."
Genesis 37 19,They said each man to his brother:<br>Here comes that master of dreams!
Genesis 37 20,"So now, come, let us kill him and throw him into one of these pits<br>and say: An ill-tempered beast devoured him!<br>Then we will see what becomes of his dreams!"
Genesis 37 21,"Re’uven heard it, and [tried to] rescue him from their hand; he said:<br>Let us not take his life!"
Genesis 37 22,"And Re’uven said to them:<br>Do not shed blood!<br>Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness,<br>but do not lay a hand upon him!<br>—in order that he might save him from their hand, to return him to his father."
Genesis 37 23,"So it was, when Yosef came to his brothers,<br>that they stripped Yosef of his tunic,<br>the ornamented tunic that he had on,"
Genesis 37 24,and took him and cast him into the pit.<br>Now the pit was empty—no water in it.
Genesis 37 25,"And they sat down to eat bread.<br> They lifted up their eyes and saw:<br>now here, a caravan of Yishmaelites coming from Gil’ad,<br>their camels carrying balm, balsam, and ladanum,<br>traveling to take them down to Egypt."
Genesis 37 26,Now Yehuda said to his brothers:<br>What gain is there<br>if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
Genesis 37 27,"Come, let us sell him to the Yishmaelites—<br>but let not our hand be upon him,<br>for he is our brother, our flesh!<br>And his brothers listened to him."
Genesis 37 28,"Meanwhile, some Midyanite men, merchants, passed by;<br>they hauled up Yosef from the pit<br>and sold Yosef to the Yishmaelites, for twenty pieces-of-silver.<br>And they brought Yosef to Egypt."
Genesis 37 29,"Re’uven returned to the pit,<br>and here, Yosef was no longer in the pit!<br>He rent his clothes"
Genesis 37 30,and returned to his brothers and said:<br>The child is no more!<br>And I—where am I to go?
Genesis 37 31,"But they took Yosef’s tunic,<br>they slaughtered a hairy goat<br>and dipped the tunic in the blood."
Genesis 37 32,Then they had the ornamented tunic sent out<br>and had it brought to their father and said:<br>We found this;<br>pray recognize<br>whether it is your son’s tunic or not!
Genesis 37 33,"He recognized it<br>and said:<br>My son’s tunic!<br>An ill-tempered beast has devoured him!<br>Yosef is ripped, ripped-to-pieces!"
Genesis 37 34,Yaakov tore his clothes;<br>he put sackcloth on his loins<br>and mourned his son for many days.
Genesis 37 35,"And all his sons and daughters arose to comfort him,<br>but he refused to be comforted;<br>he said:<br>No, <br>I will go down to my son<br>in mourning, to Sheol!<br>Thus his father wept for him."
Genesis 37 36,"Meanwhile, the Midyanites had sold him into Egypt<br>to Potifar, Pharaoh’s court-official,<br>the Chief of the [Palace] Guard."
Genesis 38 1,"Now it was at about that time<br>that Yehuda went down, away from his brothers<br>and turned aside to an Adullamite man—his name was Hira."
Genesis 38 2,There Yehuda saw the daughter of a Canaanite man—his name was Shua;<br>he took her [as his wife] and came in to her.
Genesis 38 3,"She became pregnant and bore a son, and he called his name: Er."
Genesis 38 4,"She became pregnant again and bore a son, and she called his name: Onan."
Genesis 38 5,"Once again she bore a son, and she called his name: Shela.<br>Now he was in Ceziv when she bore him."
Genesis 38 6,"Yehuda took a wife for Er, his firstborn—her name was Tamar."
Genesis 38 7,"But Er, Yehuda’s firstborn, did ill in the eyes of <small>YHWH</small>, <br>and <small>YHWH</small> caused him to die."
Genesis 38 8,"So Yehuda said to Onan:<br>Come in to your brother’s wife, do a brother-in-law’s duty by her,<br>and preserve seed for your brother!"
Genesis 38 9,"But Onan knew that the seed would not be his,<br>so it was, whenever he came in to his brother’s wife, he let it go to ruin on the earth,<br>so as not to provide seed for his brother."
Genesis 38 10,"What he did was ill in the eyes of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and he caused him to die as well."
Genesis 38 11,"So Yehuda said to Tamar his daughter-in-law:<br>Sit as a widow in your father’s house<br>until Shela my son has grown up.<br>For he said [to himself]:<br>Otherwise he will die as well, like his brothers!<br>So Tamar went and stayed in her father’s house."
Genesis 38 12,"And many days passed.<br> Now Shua’s daughter, Yehuda’s wife, died.<br>[When] Yehuda had been comforted,<br>he went up to his sheep-shearers, he and his friend Hira the Adullamite, to Timna."
Genesis 38 13,"And Tamar was told, saying:<br>Here, your father-in-law is going up to Timna to shear his sheep."
Genesis 38 14,"She removed her widow’s garments from her,<br>covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself,<br>and sat down by the entrance to Enayim/Two-Wells, which is on the way to Timna,<br>for she saw that Shela had grown up, yet she had not been given to him as a wife."
Genesis 38 15,"Yehuda saw her, and he took her for a whore, for she had covered her face,"
Genesis 38 16,"so he turned aside to her by the road and said:<br>Come-now, pray let me come in to you—<br>for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.<br>She said:<br>What will you give me for coming in to me?"
Genesis 38 17,"He said:<br>I myself will send out a goats’ kid from the flock.<br>She said:<br>[Only] if you give me a pledge, until you send it."
Genesis 38 18,"He said:<br>What is the pledge that I am to give you?<br>She said:<br>Your seal, your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.<br>He gave them to her and then he came in to her, and she became pregnant by him."
Genesis 38 19,She arose and went away;<br>then she put off her veil from her and clothed herself in her widow’s garments.
Genesis 38 20,"Now Yehuda sent the goats’ kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to fetch the pledge from the woman’s hand,<br>but he could not find her."
Genesis 38 21,"He asked the people of her place, saying:<br>Where is that prostitute, the one in Two-Wells by the road?<br>They said:<br>There has been no prostitute here!"
Genesis 38 22,"So he returned to Yehuda and said:<br>I could not find her; moreover, the people of the place said: There has been no prostitute here!"
Genesis 38 23,"Yehuda said:<br>Let her keep them for herself, lest we become a laughing-stock.<br>Here, I sent her this kid, but you, you could not find her."
Genesis 38 24,"Now it was, after almost three months,<br>that Yehuda was told, saying:<br>Tamar your daughter-in-law has played-the-whore,<br>in fact, she has become pregnant from whoring!<br>Yehuda said:<br>Bring her out and let her be burned!"
Genesis 38 25,"[But as] she was being brought out,<br>she sent a message to her father-in-law, saying:<br>By the man to whom these belong I am pregnant.<br>And she said:<br>Pray recognize—<br>whose seal and cords and staff are these?"
Genesis 38 26,"Yehuda recognized them<br>and said:<br>She is in-the-right more than I!<br>For after all, I did not give her to Shela my son!<br>And he did not know her again."
Genesis 38 27,"Now it was at the time of her birthing, that here, twins were in her belly!"
Genesis 38 28,"And it was, as she was giving birth, that [one] put out a hand;<br>the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying:<br>This one came out first."
Genesis 38 29,"But it was, as he pulled back his hand, here, his brother came out!<br>So she said:<br>What a breach you have breached for yourself!<br>So they called his name: Peretz/Breach."
Genesis 38 30,"Afterward his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread.<br>They called his name: Zerah."
Genesis 39 1,"Now when Yosef was brought down to Egypt,<br>Potifar, an official of Pharaoh, Chief of the Guard, an Egyptian man, acquired him from the hand of the Yishmaelites who brought him down there."
Genesis 39 2,"But <small>YHWH</small> was with Yosef, so that he became a man of success:<br>while he was in the house of his lord the Egyptian,"
Genesis 39 3,"his lord saw that <small>YHWH</small> was with him,<br>so that whatever he did, <small>YHWH</small> made succeed in his hands."
Genesis 39 4,"Yosef found favor in his eyes, and he waited upon him;<br>he appointed him over his house, and everything belonging to him he placed in his hands."
Genesis 39 5,"And it was, from when he had appointed him over his house and over everything that belonged to him,<br>that <small>YHWH</small> blessed the Egyptian’s house because of Yosef;<br><small>YHWH’S</small> blessing was upon everything that belonged to him, in the house and in the fields."
Genesis 39 6,"So he left everything that was his in Yosef’s hands,<br>and did not not concern himself about anything with him there except for the bread that he ate.<br>Now Yosef was beautiful of form and beautiful of appearance."
Genesis 39 7,Now after these events it was<br>that his lord’s wife fixed her eyes upon Yosef<br>and said:<br>Lie with me!
Genesis 39 8,"But he refused;<br>he said to his lord’s wife:<br>Here, my lord need not concern himself with me with aught in the house, <br>and everything that belongs to him, he has put in my hands."
Genesis 39 9,"He is no greater in this house than I<br>and has not withheld anything from me<br>except for yourself,<br>since you are his wife.<br>So how could I do this great ill?<br>I would be sinning against God!"
Genesis 39 10,"Now it was, as she would speak to Yosef day after day, that he would not hearken to her, to lie beside her, to be with her—"
Genesis 39 11,"and it was, on such a day,<br>that he came into the house to do his work,<br>and none of the house-people was there in the house—"
Genesis 39 12,"that she grabbed him by his garment, saying:<br>Lie with me!<br>But he left his garment in her hand and fled, and escaped outside."
Genesis 39 13,"Now it was, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,"
Genesis 39 14,"that she called in her house-people and said to them, saying:<br>See! He has brought to us<br>a Hebrew man to play around with us!<br>He came to me, to lie with me,<br>but I called out with a loud voice,"
Genesis 39 15,"and it was, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and called out<br>that he left his garment beside me and fled, and escaped outside!"
Genesis 39 16,"Now she kept his garment beside her, until his lord came back to the house."
Genesis 39 17,"Then she spoke to him according to these words, saying:<br>There came to me the Hebrew servant whom you brought to us, to play around with me;"
Genesis 39 18,"but it was, when I raised my voice and called out,<br>that he left his garment beside me and fled outside!"
Genesis 39 19,"Now it was, when his lord heard his wife’s words which she spoke to him,<br>saying: According to these words, your servant did to me!—<br>that his anger flared up;"
Genesis 39 20,"Yosef’s lord took him and put him in the dungeon house,<br>in the place where the king’s prisoners are imprisoned.<br>But while he was there in the dungeon house,"
Genesis 39 21,<small>YHWH</small> was with Yosef and extended kindness to him:<br>he put his favor in the eyes of the dungeon warden.
Genesis 39 22,"And the dungeon warden put in Yosef’s hands all the prisoners who were in the dungeon house;<br>whatever had to be done there, it was he that did it."
Genesis 39 23,"The dungeon warden did not need to see to anything at all in his hands,<br>since <small>YHWH</small> was with him,<br>and whatever he did, <small>YHWH</small> made succeed."
Genesis 40 1,"Now after these events it was<br>that the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt fell afoul of their lord, the king of Egypt."
Genesis 40 2,"Pharaoh became infuriated with his two officials, with the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,"
Genesis 40 3,"and he placed them in custody in the house of the chief of the guard, in the dungeon house, the place where Yosef was imprisoned."
Genesis 40 4,"The chief of the guard appointed Yosef for them, that he should wait upon them.<br>They were in custody for [many] days."
Genesis 40 5,"And then the two of them dreamt a dream, each man his own dream, in a single night,<br>each man according to his dream’s interpretation,<br>the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were imprisoned in the dungeon house."
Genesis 40 6,"Yosef came to them in the morning and saw them, and here, they were dejected!"
Genesis 40 7,"So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were with him in custody in the house of his lord, saying:<br>Why are your faces in such ill-humor today?"
Genesis 40 8,"They said to him:<br>We have dreamt a dream, and there is no interpreter for it!<br>Yosef said to them:<br>Are not interpretations from God?<br>Pray recount them to me!"
Genesis 40 9,"The chief cupbearer recounted his dream to Yosef; he said to him:<br>In my dream—<br>now here, a vine was in front of me,"
Genesis 40 10,"and on the vine, three winding-tendrils,<br>and just as it was budding, the blossom came up,<br>[and] its clusters ripened into grapes."
Genesis 40 11,Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand;<br>I picked the grapes<br>and squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup<br>and put the cup in Pharaoh’s palm.
Genesis 40 12,Yosef said to him:<br>This is its interpretation:<br>The three windings are three days—
Genesis 40 13,"in another three days<br>Pharaoh will lift up your head<br>and will restore you to your position<br>so that you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand<br>according to the former practice, when you were his cupbearer."
Genesis 40 14,"But keep me in mind with you, when it goes well for you;<br>pray deal in loyalty with me and call me to mind to Pharaoh,<br>so that you have me brought out of this house."
Genesis 40 15,"For I was stolen, yes, stolen from the land of the Hebrews,<br>and here too I have done nothing<br>that they should have put me in the pit."
Genesis 40 16,"The chief baker saw that he had interpreted for good,<br>so he said to Yosef:<br>I too, in my dream—<br>now here, three baskets of white-bread were on my head,"
Genesis 40 17,"and in the uppermost basket, all sorts of edibles for Pharaoh, baker’s work,<br>and birds were eating them from the basket, from off my head."
Genesis 40 18,"Yosef gave answer, he said:<br>This is its interpretation:<br>the three baskets are three days—"
Genesis 40 19,"in another three days<br>Pharaoh will lift up your head<br>from off you;<br>he will hang you on a stake,<br>and the birds will eat your flesh from off you."
Genesis 40 20,"And thus it was, on the third day,<br>Pharaoh’s birthday,<br>that he made a great drinkfest for all his servants,<br>and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker amidst his servants:"
Genesis 40 21,"he restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearership,<br>so that he put the cup in Pharaoh’s palm,"
Genesis 40 22,"but the chief baker he hanged,<br>just as Yosef had interpreted to them."
Genesis 40 23,But the chief cupbearer did not keep Yosef in mind;<br>he forgot him.
Genesis 41 1,"Now at the end of two years’-time it was<br>that Pharaoh dreamt:<br>now here, he was standing by the Nile-Stream,"
Genesis 41 2,"and here, out of the Nile, seven cows were coming up,<br>beautiful of appearance and well-nourished of flesh,<br>and they grazed in the reed-grass."
Genesis 41 3,"And here, seven other cows were coming up after them out of the Nile,<br>ill of appearance and lean of flesh,<br>and they stood beside the other cows on the bank of the Nile."
Genesis 41 4,"And the cows ill of appearance and lean of flesh ate up<br>the seven cows beautiful in appearance, the well-nourished ones.<br>Pharaoh awoke."
Genesis 41 5,"He fell asleep and dreamt a second time:<br>now here, seven ears-of-grain were going up on a single stalk, fat and good,"
Genesis 41 6,"and here, seven ears, lean and scorched by the east wind, were springing up after them."
Genesis 41 7,"And the lean ears swallowed up<br>the seven well-nourished and full ears.<br>Pharaoh awoke,<br>and here, [it was] a dream!"
Genesis 41 8,"But in the morning it was, that his spirit was stirred up,<br>so he sent and had all of Egypt’s magicians and all of its wise-men called.<br>Pharaoh recounted his dream to them,<br>but no one could interpret them to Pharaoh."
Genesis 41 9,"Then the chief cupbearer spoke up to Pharaoh, saying:<br>I must call my faults to mind today!"
Genesis 41 10,"Pharaoh was [once] infuriated with his servants<br>and placed me in custody, in the house of the chief of the guard,<br>myself and the chief baker."
Genesis 41 11,"And we dreamt a dream in a single night, I and he;<br>we dreamt each one according to the interpretation of his dream."
Genesis 41 12,"Now there was a Hebrew lad there with us, a servant of the chief of the guard.<br>We recounted them to him, and he interpreted our dreams to us;<br>for each-one according to his dream he interpreted."
Genesis 41 13,"And it was: as he interpreted to us, so it was—<br>I was restored to my position, and he was hanged."
Genesis 41 14,"Pharaoh sent and had Yosef called.<br>They quickly brought him out of the pit;<br>he shaved, changed his clothes, and came before Pharaoh."
Genesis 41 15,"Pharaoh said to Yosef:<br>I have dreamt a dream, and there is no interpreter for it!<br>But I have heard it said of you<br>that you [but] need to hear a dream in order to interpret it!"
Genesis 41 16,"Yosef answered Pharaoh, saying:<br>Not I!<br>God will answer what is for Pharaoh’s welfare."
Genesis 41 17,"Pharaoh spoke to Yosef:<br>In my dream—<br>here, I was standing on the bank of the Nile,"
Genesis 41 18,"and here, out of the Nile were coming up seven cows,<br>well-nourished of flesh and beautiful of form,<br>and they grazed in the reed-grass."
Genesis 41 19,"And here, seven other cows were coming up after them,<br>wretched and exceedingly ill of form and lank of flesh,<br>in all the land of Egypt I have never seen their like for ill-condition!"
Genesis 41 20,"Then the seven lank and ill-looking cows ate up<br>the first seven cows, the well-nourished ones."
Genesis 41 21,"They entered their innards, but you would not know that they had entered their innards, for they were as ill-looking as at the beginning!<br>And I awoke."
Genesis 41 22,"Then I saw in my dream:<br>now here, seven ears were going up on a single stalk, full and good,"
Genesis 41 23,"and here, seven ears, hardened, lean, and scorched by the east wind, were springing up after them."
Genesis 41 24,"Then the lean ears swallowed up<br>the seven good ears!<br>Now I have spoken with the magicians, but there is no one that can tell me [the answer]!"
Genesis 41 25,"Yosef said to Pharaoh:<br>Pharaoh’s dream is one.<br>What God is about to do, he has told Pharaoh."
Genesis 41 26,"The seven good cows<br>are seven years,<br>and the seven good ears<br>are seven years;<br>the dream is one."
Genesis 41 27,"And the seven lank and ill-looking cows that were coming up after them<br>are seven years,<br>and the seven ears, hollow and scorched by the east wind,<br>will be seven years of famine!"
Genesis 41 28,"That is the word that I spoke to Pharaoh:<br>what God is about to do, he has let Pharaoh see."
Genesis 41 29,"Here,<br>seven years are coming<br>of great plenty in all the land of Egypt."
Genesis 41 30,"But seven years of famine will arise after them,<br>when all the plenty in the land of Egypt will be forgotten.<br>The famine will destroy the land,"
Genesis 41 31,"and it will not be known, that plenty [that was] in the land,<br>because of that famine afterward,<br>for it will be exceedingly heavy."
Genesis 41 32,"Now as for the repetition of the dream to Pharaoh, twice over: [it means] that the matter is determined by God,<br>and God is hastening to do it."
Genesis 41 33,"So-now, let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man,<br>and set him over the land of Egypt."
Genesis 41 34,"Let Pharaoh do [this]: let him appoint appointed-overseers for the land,<br>and divide the land of Egypt into five parts during the seven years of plenty."
Genesis 41 35,"Let them collect all kinds of food from these good years that are coming,<br>and let them pile up grain under Pharaoh’s hand as food- provisions in the cities, and keep it under guard."
Genesis 41 36,"So the provisions will be an appointed-reserve for the land<br>for the seven years of famine that will occur in the land of Egypt,<br>so that the land will not be cut off by the famine."
Genesis 41 37,"The words seemed good in Pharaoh’s eyes and in the eyes of all his servants,"
Genesis 41 38,"and Pharaoh said to his servants:<br>Could we find another like him, a man in whom is the spirit of a god?"
Genesis 41 39,"Pharaoh said to Yosef:<br>Since a god has made you know all this,<br>there is none as wise and discerning as you;"
Genesis 41 40,you shall be [The One] Over My House!<br>To your orders shall all my people submit;<br>only by the throne will I be greater than you!
Genesis 41 41,"And Pharaoh said to Yosef:<br>See, I place you over all the land of Egypt!"
Genesis 41 42,"And Pharaoh removed his signet-ring from his hand and placed it on Yosef’s hand,<br>and he had him clothed in linen garments and put the gold chain upon his neck;"
Genesis 41 43,"he had him mount the chariot of his second-in-rank, and they called out before him: <i>Avrekh!</i>/Attention!<br>Thus he placed him over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis 41 44,"Pharaoh said to Yosef:<br>I am Pharaoh,<br>but without you, no man shall raise hand or foot in all the land of Egypt!"
Genesis 41 45,"And Pharaoh called Yosef’s name: <i>Tzafenat Pane’ah</i>/The God Speaks and He Lives,<br>and he gave him Asenat, daughter of Poti Fera, priest of On, as a wife.<br>And Yosef’s [influence] went out over the land of Egypt."
Genesis 41 46,"Now Yosef was thirty years old when he stood in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.<br>And Yosef went out from Pharaoh’s presence and crossed through all the land of Egypt."
Genesis 41 47,In the seven years of plenty the land produced in handfuls.
Genesis 41 48,"And he collected all kinds of provisions from those seven years that occurred in the land of Egypt,<br>and placed provisions in the towns.<br>The provisions from the fields of a town, surrounding it, he placed in it [as well]."
Genesis 41 49,"So Yosef piled up grain like the sand of the sea, exceedingly much, until they had to stop counting, for it was uncountable."
Genesis 41 50,"Now two sons were born to Yosef, before the year of famine came,<br>whom Asenat, daughter of Poti Fera, priest of On, bore to him."
Genesis 41 51,"Yosef called the name of the firstborn: Menashe/He-Who-Makes-Forget,<br>meaning: God has made-me-forget all my hardships, all my father’s house."
Genesis 41 52,"And the name of the second he called: Efrayim/Double-Fruit,<br>meaning: God has made me bear fruit in the land of my affliction."
Genesis 41 53,"There came to an end the seven years of plenty that had occurred in the land of Egypt,"
Genesis 41 54,"and there started to come the seven years of famine, as Yosef had said.<br>Famine occurred in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
Genesis 41 55,"Then all the land of Egypt felt the famine, and the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread,<br>so Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians:<br>Go to Yosef, whatever he says to you, do!"
Genesis 41 56,"Now the famine was over all the surface of the earth.<br>Yosef opened up all [storehouses] in which there was [grain], and gave-out-rations to the Egyptians,<br>since the famine was becoming stronger in the land of Egypt."
Genesis 41 57,"And all lands came to Egypt to buy rations, to Yosef,<br>for the famine was strong in all lands."
Genesis 42 1,"Yaakov saw that there were rations in Egypt,<br>so Yaakov said to his sons:<br>Why do you keep looking at one another?"
Genesis 42 2,"And he said:<br>Here, I have heard that there are rations in Egypt;<br>go down there and buy us rations from there,<br>that we may live and not die."
Genesis 42 3,"So Yosef’s brothers went down, ten [of them],<br>to buy some rationed grain from Egypt."
Genesis 42 4,"But Binyamin, Yosef’s brother, Yaakov would not send with his brothers,<br>for he said: Lest harm befall him!"
Genesis 42 5,"The sons of Yisrael came to buy-rations among those that came,<br>for the famine was in the land of Canaan."
Genesis 42 6,"Now Yosef was the governor over the land; it was he who supplied rations to all the people of the land.<br>And Yosef’s brothers came and bowed low to him, nostrils to the earth."
Genesis 42 7,"[When] Yosef saw his brothers, he recognized them,<br>but he pretended-no-recognition of them and spoke roughly with them.<br>He said to them:<br>From where do you come?<br>They said: From the land of Canaan, to buy food-rations."
Genesis 42 8,"Now Yosef recognized his brothers, but for their part, they did not recognize him."
Genesis 42 9,And Yosef was reminded of the dreams that he had dreamt of them.<br>He said to them:<br>You are spies!<br>[It is] to see the nakedness of the land that you have come!
Genesis 42 10,"They said to him: No, my lord!<br>Rather, your servants have come to buy food-rations."
Genesis 42 11,"We are all of us the sons of one man,<br>we are honest,<br>your servants have never been spies!"
Genesis 42 12,But he said to them:<br>No!<br>For [it is] the nakedness of the land that you have come to see!
Genesis 42 13,"They said:<br>Your servants are twelve,<br>we are brothers,<br>sons of one man in the land of Canaan:<br>the youngest is with our father now,<br>and one is no more."
Genesis 42 14,"Yosef said to them:<br>It is just as I spoke to you, saying: You are spies!"
Genesis 42 15,Hereby shall you be tested:<br>As Pharaoh lives!<br>You shall not depart from this [place]<br>unless your youngest brother comes here!
Genesis 42 16,"Send one of you to fetch your brother,<br>while [the rest of] you remain as prisoners.<br>Thus will your words be tested, whether there is truth in you or not—<br>as Pharaoh lives, indeed, you are spies!"
Genesis 42 17,He removed them into custody for three days.
Genesis 42 18,"Yosef said to them on the third day:<br>Do this, and stay alive,<br>for I hold God in awe:"
Genesis 42 19,"if you are honest,<br>let one of your brothers be held prisoner in the house of your custody,<br>and as for you, go, bring back rations for the famine-supply of your households."
Genesis 42 20,"Then bring your youngest brother back to me,<br>so that your words will be proven truthful, and you will not die.<br>They [prepared to] do so."
Genesis 42 21,"But they said, each one to his brother:<br>Truly,<br>we are guilty:<br>concerning our brother!<br>—that we saw his heart’s distress<br>when he pleaded with us,<br>and we did not listen.<br>Therefore this distress has come upon us!"
Genesis 42 22,"Re’uven answered them, saying:<br>Did I not say to you, say: Do not sin against the child!<br>But you would not listen,<br>so for his blood—now, [satisfaction] is demanded!"
Genesis 42 23,"Now they did not know that Yosef was listening, for a translator was between them."
Genesis 42 24,"But he turned away from them and wept.<br>Then he returned to them; he spoke to them and had Shim’on taken away from them, and imprisoned him before their eyes."
Genesis 42 25,"And Yosef commanded that they fill their vessels with grain and return their silver-pieces into each man’s sack,<br>and give them provisions for the journey.<br>They did so for them."
Genesis 42 26,Then they loaded their rations onto their donkeys and went from there.
Genesis 42 27,"But one opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the night-camp,<br>and he saw his silver—now here, it was in the mouth of his pack!"
Genesis 42 28,"He said to his brothers:<br>My silver has been returned—yes, here in my pack!<br>Their hearts gave way, and they trembled to one another, saying:<br>What, now, has God done to us?"
Genesis 42 29,"They came home to Yaakov their father, in the land of Canaan,<br>and told him all that had befallen them, saying:"
Genesis 42 30,"The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us,<br>he took us for those that spy on the land!"
Genesis 42 31,"Now we said to him: We are honest, we have never been spies!"
Genesis 42 32,"We are twelve, brothers all, sons of our father:<br>one is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan."
Genesis 42 33,"Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us:<br>Hereby shall I know whether you are honest:<br>leave one of your brothers with me,<br>and as for the famine-supply of your households, take it and go."
Genesis 42 34,"But bring your youngest brother to me,<br>so that I may know that you are not spies, that you are honest.<br>[Then] I will give your brother back to you, and you may travel about the land."
Genesis 42 35,"But it was, when they emptied their sacks: there was each man’s silver pouch in his sack!<br>They looked at their silver pouches, they and their father, and became frightened."
Genesis 42 36,"Yaakov their father said to them:<br><i>Me</i> you have bereaved!<br>Yosef is no more,<br>Shim’on is no more,<br>and Binyamin you would take away—<br>to me has all this happened!"
Genesis 42 37,"Re’uven said to his father, saying:<br>My two sons you may put to death<br>if I do not bring him back to you!<br>Place him in my hands, and I myself will return him to you."
Genesis 42 38,"But he said:<br>My son is not to go down with you!<br>For his brother is dead,<br>and he alone is left!<br>Should harm befall him on the journey on which you are going,<br>you will bring down my gray hair in grief to Sheol!"
Genesis 43 1,But the famine was heavy in the land.
Genesis 43 2,"And so it was, when they had finished eating the rations that they had brought from Egypt,<br>that their father said to them:<br>Return, buy us a little food."
Genesis 43 3,"But Yehuda said to him, saying:<br>The man warned, yes, warned us,<br>saying: You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you."
Genesis 43 4,"If you wish to send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you some food."
Genesis 43 5,"But if you do not wish to send him, we will not go down,<br>for the man said to us: You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you."
Genesis 43 6,"Yisrael said:<br>Why did you deal so ill with me, by telling the man that you have another brother?"
Genesis 43 7,"They said:<br>The man asked, he asked about us and about our kindred,<br>saying: Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?<br>So we told him, according to these words.<br>Could we know, know that he would say: Bring your brother down?"
Genesis 43 8,"Yehuda said to Yisrael his father:<br>Send the lad with me,<br>and we will arise and go,<br>that we may live and not die,<br>so we, so you, so our little-ones!"
Genesis 43 9,"<i>I</i> will act as his pledge,<br>at my hand you may seek him!<br>If I do not bring him back to you<br>and set him in your presence,<br>I will be culpable-for-sin against you all the days [to come]."
Genesis 43 10,"For had we not lingered, we would indeed have been back twice by now!"
Genesis 43 11,"Yisrael their father said to them:<br>If it must be so, then, do this:<br>take some of the produce of the land in your vessels<br>and bring them down to the man as a gift:<br>a little balsam, a little honey, balm and ladanum, pistachio nuts and almonds."
Genesis 43 12,"And silver two times over take in your hand,<br>and the silver that was returned in the mouth of your packs, return in your hand;<br>perhaps it was an oversight."
Genesis 43 13,"And as for your brother, take [him]!<br>Arise, return to the man,"
Genesis 43 14,"and may God Shaddai give you mercy before the man,<br>so that he releases your other brother to you, and Binyamin as well.<br>And as for me—if I must be bereaved, I must be bereaved!"
Genesis 43 15,"The men took this gift, and silver two times over they took in their hand<br>and Binyamin as well.<br>They arose and went down to Egypt<br>and stood in Yosef’s presence."
Genesis 43 16,"[When] Yosef saw Binyamin with them,<br>he said to [The One] Over his House:<br>Bring the men into the house, slaughter some slaughter-animals and prepare them,<br>for it is with me that these men shall eat at noon."
Genesis 43 17,The man did as Yosef had said: the man brought the men into Yosef’s house.
Genesis 43 18,"But the men were frightened that they had been brought into Yosef’s house, and said:<br>It is because of the silver that was returned in our packs before that we have been brought here,<br>for [them to] roll upon us, and fall upon us,<br>and take us into servitude, along with our donkeys!"
Genesis 43 19,"They came close to the man, to [The One] Over Yosef’s House, and spoke to him at the entrance to the house,"
Genesis 43 20,"they said: <br>Please, my lord!<br>We came down, came down previously to buy food-rations,"
Genesis 43 21,"but it was, when we came to the night camp and opened our packs,<br>there was each man’s silver in the mouth of his pack, our silver by its [exact] weight—<br>but we have returned it in our hand!"
Genesis 43 22,"And other silver as well we have brought down in our hand, to buy food.<br>We do not know who put back our silver in our packs!"
Genesis 43 23,"He said:<br>It is well with you&mdash;do not be afraid!<br>Your God, the God of your father, placed a treasure in your packs for you; your silver has come in to me.<br>And he brought Shim’on out to them."
Genesis 43 24,Then the man had the men come into Yosef’s house<br>and gave them water so that they might wash their feet<br>and gave them fodder for their donkeys.
Genesis 43 25,"They prepared the gift, until Yosef came back at noon,<br>for they understood that they were to eat bread there."
Genesis 43 26,"Yosef came into the house, and they brought him the gift that was in their hand, into the house,<br>and bowed low to him, to the earth."
Genesis 43 27,"He asked after their welfare and said:<br>Is your old father well, of whom you spoke?<br>Is he still alive?"
Genesis 43 28,"They said:<br>Your servant, our father, is well, he is still alive—<br>and they did homage and bowed low."
Genesis 43 29,"He lifted up his eyes and saw Binyamin his brother, his mother’s son,<br>and he said:<br>Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?<br>And he said:<br>May God show you favor, my son!"
Genesis 43 30,And in haste—for his insides were so kindled toward his brother that he had to weep—<br>Yosef entered an inner-room and wept there.
Genesis 43 31,"Then he washed his face and came out, restrained himself, and said:<br>Serve bread!"
Genesis 43 32,"They served him by himself and them by themselves and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves,<br>for Egyptians will not eat bread with Hebrews—for that is an abomination for Egyptians."
Genesis 43 33,But they were seated in his presence:<br>the firstborn according to his rank-as-firstborn and the youngest according to his rank-as-youngest.<br>And the men stared at each other in astonishment over it.
Genesis 43 34,"He had courses taken to them from his presence,<br>and Binyamin’s course was five times greater than all their courses.<br>And they drank and became drunk with him."
Genesis 44 1,"Then he commanded [The One} Over his House, saying:<br>Fill the men’s packs with food, as much as they are able to carry,<br>and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his pack."
Genesis 44 2,"And my goblet, the silver goblet, put in the mouth of the youngest’s pack, along with the silver for his rations.<br>He did according to Yosef’s word which he had spoken."
Genesis 44 3,"At the light of daybreak, the men were sent off, they and their donkeys;"
Genesis 44 4,"they were just outside the city—they had not yet gone far—when<br>Yosef said to [The One] Over his House:<br>Up, pursue the men, and when you have caught up with them, say to them:<br>Why have you paid back ill for good?"
Genesis 44 5,"Is not this [goblet] the one that my lord drinks with?<br>And he also divines, yes, divines with it!<br>You have wrought ill in what you have done!"
Genesis 44 6,"He caught up with them, and spoke those words to them."
Genesis 44 7,They said to him:<br>Why does my lord speak such words as these?<br>[Heaven] forbid for your servants to do such a thing!
Genesis 44 8,"Here, the silver that we found in the mouth of our packs, we returned to you from the land of Canaan,<br>so how could we steal silver or gold from the house of your lord?"
Genesis 44 9,"The one with whom it is found among your servants, he shall die,<br>and we also will become my lord’s servants!"
Genesis 44 10,"He said:<br>Now as well, according to your words, so be it:<br>the one with whom it is found shall become my servant, but <i>you</i> shall be clear."
Genesis 44 11,"With haste each one let down his pack to the ground, and each one opened his pack."
Genesis 44 12,And then he searched: with the eldest he started and with the youngest he finished—<br>and the goblet was found in Binyamin’s pack!
Genesis 44 13,"They rent their clothes,<br>and each one loaded up his donkey, and they returned to the city."
Genesis 44 14,Yehuda and his brothers came into Yosef’s house<br>—he was still there—<br>and flung themselves down before him to the earth.
Genesis 44 15,"Yosef said to them:<br>What kind of deed is this that you have done!<br>Do you not know that a man like me can divine, yes, divine?"
Genesis 44 16,"Yehuda said:<br>What can we say to my lord?<br>What can we speak, by what can we show ourselves innocent?<br>God has found out your servants’ crime!<br>Here we are, servants to my lord, so we, so the one in whose hand the goblet was found."
Genesis 44 17,"But he said:<br>[Heaven] forbid that I should do this!<br>The man in whose hand the goblet was found—he shall become my servant,<br>but you—go up in peace to your father!"
Genesis 44 18,"Yehuda came closer to him and said:<br>Please, my lord,<br>pray let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord,<br>and do not let your anger flare up against your servant,<br>for you are like Pharaoh!"
Genesis 44 19,"My lord asked his servants, saying: Do you have a father or [another] brother?"
Genesis 44 20,"And we said to my lord: We have an old father<br>and a young child of his old age,<br>whose brother is dead,<br>so that he alone is left of his mother,<br>and his father loves him."
Genesis 44 21,"And you said to your servants: Bring him down to me, I wish to set my eyes upon him."
Genesis 44 22,"But we said to my lord:<br>The lad cannot leave his father;<br>were he to leave his father, he would die!"
Genesis 44 23,"But you said to your servants: If your youngest brother does not come down with you, you shall not see my face again."
Genesis 44 24,"Now it was, when we went up to your servant, my father, we told him my lord’s words,"
Genesis 44 25,"and our father said: Return, buy us some food-rations."
Genesis 44 26,"But we said: We cannot go down;<br>if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down,<br>for we cannot see the man’s face if our youngest brother is not with us."
Genesis 44 27,"Now your servant, my father, said to us:<br>You yourselves know<br>that my wife bore two to me."
Genesis 44 28,"One went away from me;<br>I said: For sure he is torn, torn-to-pieces!<br>And I have not seen him again thus far."
Genesis 44 29,"Now should you take away this one as well from before my face, should harm befall him, you will bring down my gray hair in ill-fortune to Sheol!"
Genesis 44 30,"So now,<br>when I come back to your servant, my father, and the lad is not with us,<br>—with whose life his own life is bound up!—"
Genesis 44 31,"it will be, that when he sees that the lad is no more, he will die,<br>and your servant will have brought down the gray hair of your servant, our father, in grief to Sheol!"
Genesis 44 32,"For your servant pledged himself for the lad to my father,<br>saying: If I do not bring him back to you, I will be culpable-for-sin against my father all the days [to come]."
Genesis 44 33,"So now,<br>pray let your servant stay instead of the lad, as servant to my lord,<br>but let the lad go up with his brothers!"
Genesis 44 34,"For how can I go up to my father, when the lad is not with me?<br>Then would I see the ill-fortune that would come upon my father!"
Genesis 45 1,Yosef could no longer restrain himself in the presence of all who were stationed around him;<br>he called out:<br>Have everyone leave me!<br>So no one stood [in attendance upon] him when Yosef made himself known to his brothers.
Genesis 45 2,"He put forth his voice in weeping:<br>the Egyptians heard, and Pharaoh’s household heard."
Genesis 45 3,"Then Yosef said to his brothers:<br>I am Yosef. Is my father still alive?<br>But his brothers were not able to answer him,<br>for they were terrified before him."
Genesis 45 4,"Yosef said to his brothers:<br>Pray come close to me!<br>They came close.<br>He said:<br>I am Yosef your brother, whom you sold into Egypt."
Genesis 45 5,"But now, do not be pained,<br>and do not let upset be in your eyes that you sold me here!<br>For it was to save life that God sent me on before you."
Genesis 45 6,"For it is two years now that the famine has been in the midst of the land,<br>and there are still another five years in which there shall be no plowing or harvest."
Genesis 45 7,"So God sent me on ahead of you<br>to make you a remnant on earth,<br>to keep you alive as a great body-of-survivors."
Genesis 45 8,"So now,<br>it was not you that sent me here, but God!<br>He has made me Father to Pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt."
Genesis 45 9,"Make haste, go up to my father and say to him:<br>Thus says your son, Yosef:<br>God has made me lord of all Egypt;<br>come down to me, do not remain!"
Genesis 45 10,"You shall stay in the region of Goshen, you shall be near me,<br>you and your sons and the sons of your sons,<br>your sheep, your oxen, and all that is yours."
Genesis 45 11,"I will sustain you there,<br>for there are still five years of famine left<br>—lest you be as disinherited, you and your household and all that is yours."
Genesis 45 12,"Here, your eyes see, as well as my brother Binyamin’s eyes, that it is my mouth that speaks to you!"
Genesis 45 13,"So tell my father of all the weight I carry in Egypt, and of all that you have seen,<br>and make haste, bring my father down here!"
Genesis 45 14,"He flung himself upon his brother Binyamin’s neck and wept,<br>and Binyamin wept upon his neck."
Genesis 45 15,Then he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them.<br>After this his brothers spoke with him.
Genesis 45 16,The news was heard in Pharaoh’s household; they said:<br>Yosef’s brothers have come!<br>It was good in Pharaoh’s eyes and in the eyes of his servants.
Genesis 45 17,"And Pharaoh said to Yosef:<br>Say to your brothers:<br>Do this—<br>load your animals and go,<br>come back to the land of Canaan;"
Genesis 45 18,"fetch your father and your households<br>and come to me!<br>I will give you the good-things of the land of Egypt,<br>so that you will eat of the fat of the land!"
Genesis 45 19,"And you, you have been commanded:<br>Do this—<br>take you wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives,<br>and carry your father down<br>and come!"
Genesis 45 20,"Let not your eyes look-with-regret on your household-wares,<br>for the good-things of all the land of Egypt—they are yours!"
Genesis 45 21,The sons of Yisrael did so;<br>Yosef gave them wagons in accordance with Pharaoh’s orders<br>and gave them provisions for the journey.
Genesis 45 22,"To all of them, each man, he gave changes of clothes,<br>but to Binyamin he gave three hundred pieces-of-silver and five changes of clothes,"
Genesis 45 23,"and to his father he sent in like manner:<br>ten donkeys, carrying the good-things of Egypt,<br>and ten she-asses, carrying grain and bread,<br>and food for his father, for the journey."
Genesis 45 24,"Then he sent off his brothers, and they went;<br>he said to them:<br>Do not be agitated on the journey!"
Genesis 45 25,"They went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to <br>Yaakov their father,"
Genesis 45 26,"and they told him, saying:<br>Yosef is still alive!<br>Indeed, he is ruler of all the land of Egypt!<br>His heart failed,<br>for he did not believe them."
Genesis 45 27,"But they spoke to him all of Yosef’s words which he had spoken to them,<br>and he saw the wagons that Yosef had sent to carry him down,<br>and their father Yaakov’s spirit came back to life."
Genesis 45 28,Yisrael said:<br>Enough!<br>Yosef my son is still alive;<br>I must go and see him before I die!
Genesis 46 1,"Yisrael traveled with all that was his<br>and came to Be’er-Sheva,<br>and he sacrificed sacrifices to the God of his father Yitzhak."
Genesis 46 2,"And God said to Yisrael in visions of the night,<br>he said:<br>Yaakov! Yaakov!<br>He said:<br>Here I am."
Genesis 46 3,"Now he said:<br>I am <i>El</i>/God,<br>the God of your father.<br>Do not be afraid of going down to Egypt,<br>for a great nation will I make of you there."

Genesis 46 28,"Now Yehuda he had sent on ahead of him, to Yosef,<br>to give directions ahead of him to Goshen.<br>And they came to the region of Goshen."
Genesis 46 29,"Yosef had his chariot harnessed and went up to meet Yisrael his father, to Goshen.<br>[When] he caught sight of him,<br>and he flung himself upon his neck<br>and wept upon his neck continually."
Genesis 46 30,"Yisrael said to Yosef:<br>Now I can die,<br>since I have seen your face, that you are still alive!"
Genesis 46 31,"Yosef said to his brothers and to his father’s household:<br>I will go up, so that I may tell Pharaoh and say to him:<br>My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me."
Genesis 46 32,"The men are shepherds of flocks;<br>indeed, they have always been livestock men,<br>and their sheep and their oxen, all that is theirs, they have brought along."
Genesis 46 33,"Now it will be, when Pharaoh has you called and says: What [is it] that you do?"
Genesis 46 34,"Then say: Your servants have always been livestock men, from our youth until now, so we, so our fathers—<br>in order that you may settle in the region of Goshen.<br>For every shepherd of flocks is an abomination to the Egyptians."
Genesis 47 1,"So Yosef came and told Pharaoh, he said:<br>My father and my brothers, their sheep and their oxen and all that is theirs, have come from the land of Canaan,<br>and here, they are in the region of Goshen!"
Genesis 47 2,Now from the circle of his brothers he had picked out five men and had set them in Pharaoh’s presence.
Genesis 47 3,"Pharaoh said to his brothers:<br>What [is it] that you do?<br>They said to Pharaoh:<br>Your servants are shepherds of flocks, so we, so our fathers."
Genesis 47 4,"And they said to Pharaoh:<br>We have come to sojourn in the land,<br>for there is no grazing for the flocks that are your servants’,<br>for the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan.<br>So-now,<br>pray let your servants settle in the region of Goshen!"
Genesis 47 5,"Pharaoh said to Yosef, saying:<br>Your father and your brothers have come to you."
Genesis 47 6,"The land of Egypt is before you;<br>in the goodliest-part of the land, settle your father and your brothers;<br>let them settle in the region of Goshen.<br>And if you know that there are men of value among them,<br>make them chiefs of livestock over what is mine."
Genesis 47 7,Yosef brought Yaakov his father and had him stand in Pharaoh’s presence.<br>And Yaakov gave Pharaoh a blessing-of-greeting.
Genesis 47 8,Pharaoh said to Yaakov:<br>How many are the days [and] years of your life?
Genesis 47 9,Yaakov said to Pharaoh:<br>The days [and] years of my sojourn are thirty and a hundred years.<br>Few and ill-fated have been the days [and] years of my life;<br>they have not attained the days [and] years of my fathers’ lives in the days of their sojourn.
Genesis 47 10,Yaakov gave Pharaoh a blessing-of-farewell<br>and went out from Pharaoh’s presence.
Genesis 47 11,"So Yosef settled his father and his brothers;<br>he gave them holdings in the land of Egypt,<br>in the goodliest-part of the land, in the region of Ra’meses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
Genesis 47 12,"And Yosef sustained his father, his brothers, and his father’s entire household with bread, in proportion to the little-ones."
Genesis 47 13,"But bread there was none in all the land,<br>for the famine was exceedingly heavy,<br>and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted by the famine."
Genesis 47 14,"Yosef had collected all the silver that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, from the rations that they had bought,<br>and Yosef had brought the silver into Pharaoh’s house."
Genesis 47 15,"But the silver in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan ran out,<br>so all the Egyptians came to Yosef, saying:<br>Come-now, [let us have] bread! <br>Why should we die in front of you, because the silver is gone?"
Genesis 47 16,"Yosef said:<br>Come-now, [let me have] your livestock, and I will give you [bread] in exchange for your livestock, since the silver is gone."
Genesis 47 17,"So they brought their livestock to Yosef, and Yosef gave them bread in exchange for the horses, the sheep-livestock, the oxen-livestock, and the donkeys;<br>he got-them-through with bread in exchange for all their livestock in that year."
Genesis 47 18,"But that year ran out, and they came back to him in the second year and said to him:<br>We cannot hide from my lord<br>that if the silver has run out and the animal-stocks are my lord’s,<br>nothing remains for my lord except for our bodies and our land!"
Genesis 47 19,"Why should we die before your eyes, so we, so our land?<br>Acquire us and our land in exchange for bread,<br>and we and our land will become servants to Pharaoh.<br>Give [us] seed-for-sowing<br>that we may live and not die,<br>that the land may not become desolate!"
Genesis 47 20,"So Yosef acquired all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh<br>—for each of the Egyptians sold his field, for the famine was strong upon them—<br>and the land went over to Pharaoh."
Genesis 47 21,"As for the people, he transferred them into the cities, from one edge of Egypt’s border to its other edge."
Genesis 47 22,"Only the land of the priests he did not acquire,<br>for the priests had a prescribed-allocation from Pharaoh, and they ate from their allocation which Pharaoh had given them;<br>therefore they did not sell their land."
Genesis 47 23,"Yosef said to the people:<br>Now that I have acquired you and your land today for Pharaoh,<br>here, you have seed, sow the land!"
Genesis 47 24,"But it shall be at the ingatherings, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh,<br>while the four other parts shall be for you<br>as seed for the field and for your eating-needs, for those in your households, and for feeding your little-ones."
Genesis 47 25,They said:<br>You have saved our lives!<br>May we find favor in my lord’s eyes: we will become servants to Pharaoh.
Genesis 47 26,"And Yosef made it a prescribed-law until this day, concerning the land of Egypt: For Pharaoh every fifth part!<br>Only the land of the priests, that alone did not go over to Pharaoh."
Genesis 47 27,"Yisrael stayed in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen;<br>they obtained holdings in it, bore fruit, and became exceedingly many."
Genesis 47 28,"And Yaakov lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years.<br>And the days of Yaakov, the years of his life, were seven years and a hundred and forty years."
Genesis 47 29,"Yisrael’s days drew near to death,<br>so he called his son Yosef and said to him:<br>Pray, if I have found favor in your eyes,<br>pray put your hand under my thigh—<br>deal with me in loyalty and faithfulness:<br>pray do not bury me in Egypt!"
Genesis 47 30,"[When] I lie down with my fathers,<br>carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial-site!<br>He said:<br>I will do according to your words."
Genesis 47 31,"But he said:<br>Swear to me!<br>So he swore to him.<br>Then Yisrael bowed, at the head of the bed."
Genesis 48 1,"Now after these events it was<br>that they said to Yosef:<br>Here, your father has taken sick!<br>So he took his two sons with him, Menashe and Efrayim. . . ."
Genesis 48 2,"They told Yaakov, saying: Here, your son Yosef is coming to you,<br>so Yisrael gathered his strength and sat up in the bed."
Genesis 48 3,"Yaakov said to Yosef:<br>God Shaddai was seen by me<br>in Luz, in the land of Canaan;<br>he blessed me"
Genesis 48 4,"and he said to me:<br>Here, I will make you bear fruit and will make you many,<br>and will make you into a host of peoples;<br>I will give this land to your seed after you, as a holding for the ages!"
Genesis 48 5,"So-now,<br>your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt<br>before I came to you in Egypt,<br>they are mine;<br>Efrayim and Menashe,<br>like Re’uven and Shim’on, let them be mine!"
Genesis 48 6,"But your begotten sons, whom you will beget after them,<br>let them be yours;<br>by their brothers’ names let them be called, regarding their hereditary-property."
Genesis 48 7,"While I—<br>when I came back from Paddan,<br>Rahel died on me,<br>in the land of Canaan,<br>on the way, with still a stretch of land left to come to Efrat.<br>There I buried her, on the way to Efrat—that is now Bet-Lehem."
Genesis 48 8,And Yisrael saw Yosef’s sons; he said:<br>Who are these?
Genesis 48 9,"Yosef said to his father:<br>They are my sons, whom God has given me here.<br>He said:<br>Pray take them over to me, that I may give-them-blessing."
Genesis 48 10,"Now Yisrael’s eyes were heavy with age, and he was not able to see.<br>He brought them close to him,<br>and he kissed them and embraced them."
Genesis 48 11,"Yisrael said to Yosef:<br>I never thought to see your face [again],<br>and here, God has let me see your seed as well!"
Genesis 48 12,"Yosef took them from between his knees<br>and they bowed low, their nostrils to the earth."
Genesis 48 13,"Yosef took the two of them,<br>Efrayim with his right-hand, to Yisrael’s left,<br>and Menashe with his left-hand, to Yisrael’s right,<br>and brought them close to him."
Genesis 48 14,"But Yisrael stretched out his right-hand and put it on the head of Efrayim—yet he was the younger!—<br>and his left-hand on the head of Menashe;<br>he crossed his arms, although Menashe was the firstborn."
Genesis 48 15,"Then he blessed Yosef and said:<br>The God<br>in whose presence my fathers walked,<br>Avraham and Yitzhak,<br>the God<br>who has tended me<br>ever since I was [born], until this day—"
Genesis 48 16,"the messenger<br>who has redeemed me from all ill-fortune,<br>may he bless the lads!<br>May my name continue to be called through them<br>and the name of my fathers, Avraham and Yitzhak!<br>May they teem-like-fish to [become] many in the midst of the land!"
Genesis 48 17,"Now Yosef saw that his father had put his right hand on Efrayim’s head,<br>and it sat ill in his eyes,<br>so he laid hold of his father’s hand, to turn it from Efrayim’s head to Menashe’s head."
Genesis 48 18,"Yosef said to his father:<br>Not so, father, indeed, this one is the firstborn, place your hand on his head!"
Genesis 48 19,"But his father refused and said:<br>I know, my son, I know—<br>he too will be a people, he too will be great,<br>yet his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a full-measure of nations!"
Genesis 48 20,"So he blessed them on that day,<br>saying:<br>By you shall Israel give-blessings, saying:<br>God make you like Efrayim and Menashe!<br>Thus he made Efrayim go before Menashe."
Genesis 48 21,"Then Yisrael said to Yosef:<br>Here, I am dying,<br>but God will be with you;<br>he will have you return to the land of your fathers."

Exodus 2 5,"Pharaoh’s daughter went down to bathe at the Nile,<br>and her girls were walking along the Nile.<br>She saw the little-ark among the reeds<br>and sent her maid, and she took it."
Exodus 2 6,"She opened [it] and saw him, the child—<br>now here, a boy weeping!<br>She pitied him, and she said:<br>One of the Hebrews’ children is this!"
Exodus 2 7,"His sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter:<br>Shall I go and call a nursing woman from the Hebrews for you,<br>that she may nurse the child for you?"
Exodus 2 8,Pharaoh’s daughter said to her:<br>Go!<br>So the girl went and called the child’s mother.
Exodus 2 9,"Pharaoh’s daughter said to her:<br>Have this child go with you and nurse him for me,<br>and I myself will give you your wages.<br>So the woman took the child and she nursed him."
Exodus 2 10,"The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter,<br>and he became her son.<br>She called his name: Moshe/He-Who-Pulls-Out;<br>she said: For out of the water <i>meshitihu</i>/I-pulled-him."
Exodus 2 11,"Now it was some years later, Moshe grew up;<br>he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens.<br>And he saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man, [one] of his brothers."
Exodus 2 12,"He turned this-way and that-way, and saw that there was no man [there],<br>so he struck down the Egyptian<br>and buried him in the sand."
Exodus 2 13,"He went out again on the next day, and here: two Hebrew men scuffling!<br>He said to the guilty one:<br>Why do you strike your fellow?"
Exodus 2 14,He said:<br>Who made you prince and judge over us?<br>Do you mean to kill me<br>as you killed the Egyptian?<br>Moshe became afraid and said:<br>Surely the matter is known!
Exodus 2 15,Pharaoh heard of this matter and sought to kill Moshe.<br>But Moshe fled from Pharaoh’s face and settled in the land of Midyan;<br>he sat down by a well.
Exodus 2 16,"Now the priest of Midyan had seven daughters;<br>they came, they drew [water] and they filled the troughs,<br>to give-drink to their father’s sheep."
Exodus 2 17,"Shepherds came and drove them away.<br>But Moshe rose up, he delivered them and gave-drink to their sheep."
Exodus 2 18,"They came [home] to Re’uel their father, and he said:<br>For-what-reason have you come [home] so quickly today?"
Exodus 2 19,"They said:<br>An Egyptian man rescued us from the hand of the shepherds,<br>and also he drew, yes, drew for us and watered the sheep!"
Exodus 2 20,"He said to his daughters:<br>So-where-is-he?<br>Why, then, have you left the man behind?<br>Call him, that he may eat bread!"
Exodus 2 21,"Moshe agreed to settle down with the man,<br>and he gave Tzippora his daughter to Moshe."
Exodus 2 22,"She gave birth to a son,<br>and he called his name: Gershom/Sojourner There,<br>for he said: A sojourner have I become in a foreign land."
Exodus 2 23,"It was, many years later,<br>that the king of Egypt died.<br>But the Children of Israel groaned from the servitude,<br>and they cried out;<br>and their plea-for-help went up to God, from the servitude."
Exodus 2 24,"God hearkened to their moaning;<br>God called-to-mind his covenant with Avraham, with Yitzhak, and with Yaakov;"
Exodus 2 25,God saw the Children of Israel;<br>God knew.
Exodus 3 1,"Now Moshe was shepherding the flock of Yitro his father- in-law, priest of Midyan.<br>He led the flock behind the wilderness,<br>and came to the mountain of God, to Horev."
Exodus 3 2,"And <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger was seen by him<br>as the flame of a fire out of the midst of a bush.<br>He saw:<br>now here, the bush is burning with fire,<br>but the bush is not consumed!"
Exodus 3 3,Moshe said:<br>Now let me turn aside<br>that I may see this great sight—<br>for-what-reason does the bush not burn up?
Exodus 3 4,"<small>YHWH</small> saw that he turned aside to see,<br>so God called to him out of the midst of the bush;<br>he said:<br>Moshe! Moshe!<br>He said:<br>Here I am."
Exodus 3 5,"He said:<br>Do not come near to here;<br>put off your sandal from your foot,<br>for the place on which you stand—it is holy ground!"
Exodus 3 6,"And he said:<br>I am the God of your father,<br>the God of Avraham,<br>the God of Yitzhak,<br>and the God of Yaakov.<br>Moshe concealed his face,<br>for he was afraid to gaze upon God."
Exodus 3 7,"Now <small>YHWH</small> said:<br>I have seen, yes, seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt,<br>their cry I have heard in the face of their slave-drivers;<br>indeed, I have known their sufferings!"
Exodus 3 8,"So I have come down<br>to rescue it from the hand of Egypt,<br>to bring it up from that land<br>to a land, goodly and spacious,<br>to a land flowing with milk and honey,<br>to the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite,<br>of the Amorite and the Perizzite,<br>of the Hivvite and the Yevusite."
Exodus 3 9,"So-now,<br>here, the cry of the Children of Israel has come to me,<br>and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them."
Exodus 3 10,"So now, go,<br>for I send you to Pharaoh—<br>bring my people, the Children of Israel, out of Egypt!"
Exodus 3 11,"Moshe said to God:<br>Who am I<br>that I should go to Pharaoh,<br>that I should bring the Children of Israel out of Egypt?"
Exodus 3 12,"He said:<br>Indeed, I will be with you,<br>and this is the sign for you that I myself have sent you:<br>[when] you have brought the people out of Egypt,<br>you will [all] serve God by this mountain."
Exodus 3 13,"Moshe said to God:<br>Here, I will come to the Children of Israel<br>and I will say to them:<br>The God of your fathers has sent me to you,<br>but they will say to me: What is his name?—<br>what shall I say to them?"
Exodus 3 14,God said to Moshe:<br><small>EHYEH ASHER EHYEH</small>/I will be however I will be.<br>And he said:<br>Thus shall you say to the Children of Israel:<br><small>EHYEH/I-WILL-BE</small> has sent me to you.
Exodus 3 15,"And God said further to Moshe:<br>Thus shall you say to the Children of Israel:<br><small>YHWH</small>,<br>the God of your fathers,<br>the God of Avraham, the God of Yitzhak, and the God of Yaakov,<br>has sent me to you.<br>That is my name for the ages,<br>that is my title [from] generation to generation."
Exodus 3 16,"Go,<br>gather the elders of Israel<br>and say to them:<br><small>YHWH</small>, the God of your fathers, has been seen by me,<br>the God of Avraham, of Yitzhak, and of Yaakov,<br>saying:<br>I have taken account, yes, account of you and of what is being done to you in Egypt,"
Exodus 3 17,"and I have declared:<br>I will bring you up from the affliction of Egypt,<br>to the land of the Canaanite and of the Hittite,<br>of the Amorite and of the Perizzite,<br>of the Hivvite and of the Yevusite,<br>to a land flowing with milk and honey."
Exodus 3 18,"They will hearken to your voice,<br>and you will come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt<br>and say to him:<br><small>YHWH</small>, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us—<br>so now, pray let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness<br>and let us sacrifice to <small>YHWH</small> our God!"
Exodus 3 19,"But I, I know<br>that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go,<br>not [even] under a strong hand."
Exodus 3 20,So I will send forth my hand<br>and I will strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst—<br>after that he will send you free!
Exodus 3 21,"And I will give this people favor in the eyes of Egypt;<br>it will be that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed:"
Exodus 3 22,"each woman shall ask of her neighbor and of the sojourner in her house<br>objects of silver and objects of gold, and clothing;<br>you shall put [them] on your sons and on your daughters—<br>so shall you strip Egypt!"
Exodus 4 1,"Moshe spoke up, he said:<br>But they will not trust me, and will not hearken to my voice,<br>indeed, they will say: <small>YHWH</small> has not been seen by you. . . !"
Exodus 4 2,<small>YHWH</small> said to him:<br>What is that in your hand?<br>He said:<br>A staff.
Exodus 4 3,"He said:<br>Throw it to the earth!<br>He threw it to the earth, and it became a snake,<br>and Moshe fled from its face."
Exodus 4 4,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Send forth your hand! Seize it by its tail!<br>—He sent forth his hand and took hold of it, and it became a staff in his fist—"
Exodus 4 5,"so that they may trust that <small>YHWH</small>, the God of their fathers,<br>the God of Avraham, the God of Yitzhak, and the God of Yaakov, has been seen by you."
Exodus 4 6,"<small>YHWH</small> said further to him:<br>Pray put your hand in your bosom!<br>He put his hand in his bosom, and then he took it out,<br>and here: his hand had <i>tzaraat,</i> like snow!"
Exodus 4 7,"Now he said:<br>Return your hand to your bosom!<br>He returned his hand to his bosom; then he took it out of his bosom,<br>and here, it had returned [to be] like his flesh."
Exodus 4 8,"So it shall be, if they do not trust you, and do not hearken to the voice of the former sign,<br>that they will put their trust in the voice of the latter sign."
Exodus 4 9,"And it shall be, if they do not put their trust in even these two signs, and do not hearken to your voice,<br>then take some of the water of the Nile<br>and pour it out on the dry-land,<br>and the water that you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry-land."
Exodus 4 10,"Moshe said to <small>YHWH</small>:<br>Please, my Lord,<br>no man of words am I,<br>not from yesterday, not from the day-before, not [even] since you have spoken to your servant,<br>for heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue am I!"
Exodus 4 11,"<small>YHWH</small> said to him:<br>Who placed a mouth in human beings<br>or who [is it that] makes one mute or deaf<br>or open-eyed or blind?<br>Is it not I, <small>YHWH</small>?"
Exodus 4 12,"So now, go!<br>I myself will be with your mouth<br>and will instruct you as to what you are to speak."
Exodus 4 13,"But he said:<br>Please, my Lord,<br>pray send by whose hand you will send!"
Exodus 4 14,"<small>YHWH’S</small> anger flared up against Moshe;<br>he said:<br>Is there not Aharon your brother, the Levite—<br>I know that <i>he</i> can speak, yes, speak,<br>and here, he is even going out to meet you;<br>when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart."
Exodus 4 15,"You shall speak to him,<br>you shall put the words in his mouth!<br>I myself will be with your mouth and with his mouth,<br>and will instruct you [both] as to what you shall do."
Exodus 4 16,"He shall speak for you to the people;<br>he, he shall be a mouth for you, and you, you shall be a god for him."
Exodus 4 17,"And this staff, take in your hand,<br>with which you shall do the signs."
Exodus 4 18,"Moshe went and returned to Yitro his father-in-law<br>and said to him:<br>Now pray let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt,<br>that I may see whether they are still alive.<br>Yitro said to Moshe:<br>Go in peace!"
Exodus 4 19,"Now <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe in Midyan:<br>Go, return to Egypt,<br>for all the men who were seeking your life have died."
Exodus 4 20,"So Moshe took his wife and his sons and mounted them upon a donkey, to return to the land of Egypt,<br>and Moshe took the staff of God in his hand."
Exodus 4 21,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>When you go to return to Egypt,<br>see:<br>all the portents that I have put in your hand, you are to do before Pharaoh,<br>but I will make his heart strong-willed, so that he will not send the people free."
Exodus 4 22,"Then you are to say to Pharaoh:<br>Thus says <small>YHWH</small>:<br>My son, my firstborn, is Israel!"
Exodus 4 23,"I said to you: Send free my son, that he may serve me,<br>but you have refused to send him free,<br>[so] here, I will kill your son, your firstborn!"
Exodus 4 24,"Now it was on the journey, at the night-camp,<br>that <small>YHWH</small> encountered him and sought to make him die."
Exodus 4 25,"Tzippora took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin;<br>she touched it to his legs and said:<br>Indeed, a bridegroom of blood are you to me!"
Exodus 4 26,"And he released him.<br>Then she said, “a bridegroom of blood” upon the circumcision-cuttings."
Exodus 4 27,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Aharon:<br>Go to meet Moshe in the wilderness!<br>He went, he encountered him at the mountain of God<br>and he kissed him."
Exodus 4 28,And Moshe told Aharon all <small>YHWH’S</small> words with which he had sent him<br>and all the signs with which he had charged him.
Exodus 4 29,"Moshe and Aharon went;<br>they gathered all the elders of the Children of Israel,"
Exodus 4 30,"and Aharon spoke all the words which <small>YHWH</small> had spoken to Moshe,<br>and did the signs before the people’s eyes."
Exodus 4 31,"The people trusted;<br>they hearkened<br>that <small>YHWH</small> had taken account of the Children of Israel,<br>that he had seen their affliction.<br>And they did homage and bowed low."
Exodus 5 1,"Afterward Moshe and Aharon came and said to Pharaoh:<br>Thus says <small>YHWH</small>, the God of Israel:<br>Send free my people, that they may hold-a-festival to me in the wilderness!"
Exodus 5 2,"Pharaoh said:<br>Who is <small>YHWH</small>, that I should hearken to his voice to send Israel free?<br>I do not know <small>YHWH</small>,<br>moreover, Israel I will not send free!"
Exodus 5 3,"They said:<br>The God of the Hebrews has met with us;<br>now let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness,<br>and let us sacrifice to <small>YHWH</small> our God,<br>lest he confront us with the pestilence or the sword!"
Exodus 5 4,"The king of Egypt said to them:<br>Why, Moshe and Aharon,<br>would you let the people loose from their tasks?<br>Go back to your burdens!"
Exodus 5 5,"Pharaoh said:<br>Here, too many now are the people of the land,<br>and you would have them cease from their burdens!"
Exodus 5 6,"So that day Pharaoh commanded the slave-drivers of the people and its officers, saying:"
Exodus 5 7,You are no longer to give straw to the people to make the bricks as yesterday [and the] day-before;<br>let it be them that go and gather straw for themselves!
Exodus 5 8,"But the [same] measure of bricks that they have been making, yesterday [and the] day-before,<br>you are to impose on them;<br>you are not to subtract from it!<br>For they are lax—<br>therefore they cry out, saying: Let us go, let us sacrifice to our God!"
Exodus 5 9,"Let the servitude weigh-heavily on the men!<br>They shall have to do it, so that they pay no more regard to false words!"
Exodus 5 10,"The slave-drivers of the people and its officers went out<br>and said to the people, saying:<br>Thus says Pharaoh:<br>I will not give you straw:"
Exodus 5 11,"<i>You<i> go, get yourselves straw, wherever you can find [it];<br>indeed, not one [load] is to be subtracted from your servitude!"
Exodus 5 12,"The people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt,<br>gathering stubble-gatherings for straw."
Exodus 5 13,"But the slave-drivers pressed them hard, saying:<br>Finish your tasks, each-day’s work-load in its day, as when there was straw!"
Exodus 5 14,"And they were beaten, the officers of the Children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s slave-drivers had set over them; <br>they said [to them]:<br>For-what-reason have you not finished baking your allocation as yesterday [and the] day-before,<br>so yesterday, so today?"
Exodus 5 15,"So the officers of the Children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying:<br>Why do you do thus to your servants?"
Exodus 5 16,"No straw is being given to your servants, and as for bricks—they say to us, Make [them]!<br>Here, your servants are being beaten, and the fault is your people’s!"
Exodus 5 17,"But he said:<br>Lax are you, lax,<br>therefore you say: Let us go, let us sacrifice to <small>YHWH</small>—"
Exodus 5 18,"so-now, go, serve;<br>no straw will be given to you,<br>and the full-measure in bricks you must give back!"
Exodus 5 19,"The officers of the Children of Israel saw that they were in an ill-plight,<br>[having] to say: Do not subtract from your bricks each-day’s work-load in its day!"
Exodus 5 20,"They confronted Moshe and Aharon, stationing themselves to meet them when they came out from Pharaoh;"
Exodus 5 21,"they said to them:<br>May <small>YHWH</small> see you and judge,<br>for having made our smell reek in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants,<br>giving a sword into their hand, to kill us!"
Exodus 5 22,"Moshe returned to <small>YHWH</small> and said:<br>My Lord,<br>why have you dealt so ill with this people?<br>Why have you sent me?"
Exodus 5 23,"Since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has dealt only ill with this people,<br>and rescued—you have not rescued your people!"
Exodus 6 1,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh:<br>for with a strong hand he will send them free,<br>and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land."
Exodus 6 2,"God spoke to Moshe,<br>he said to him:<br>I am <small>YHWH</small>."
Exodus 6 3,"I was seen by Avraham, by Yitzhak, and by Yaakov<br>as God Shaddai,<br>but [by] my name <small>YHWH</small> I was not known to them."
Exodus 6 4,"I also established my covenant with them,<br>to give them the land of Canaan,<br>the land of their sojournings, where they had sojourned."
Exodus 6 5,"And I have also heard the moaning of the Children of Israel,<br>whom Egypt is holding-in-servitude,<br>and I have called-to-mind my covenant."
Exodus 6 6,"Therefore,<br>say to the Children of Israel:<br>I am <small>YHWH</small>.<br>I will bring you out<br>from beneath the burdens of Egypt;<br>I will rescue you<br>from servitude to them;<br>I will redeem you<br>with an outstretched arm, with great acts-of-judgment;"
Exodus 6 7,"I will take you<br>for me as a people,<br>and I will be for you<br>as a God;<br>and you shall know<br>that I am <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>who brings you out<br>from beneath the burdens of Egypt."
Exodus 6 8,"I will bring you<br>into the land [over] which I lifted my hand [in an oath] to give to Avraham, to Yitzhak, and to Yaakov.<br>I will give it to you as a possession,<br>I, <small>YHWH</small>."
Exodus 6 9,"Moshe spoke thus to the Children of Israel.<br>But they did not hearken to Moshe,<br>out of shortness of spirit and out of hard servitude."
Exodus 6 10,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Exodus 6 11,"Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt,<br>that he may send free the Children of Israel from his land."
Exodus 6 12,"Moshe spoke before <small>YHWH</small>, saying:<br>Here, [if] the Children of Israel do not hearken to me,<br>how will Pharaoh hearken to me?<br>And I am of foreskinned lips!"
Exodus 6 13,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon,<br>and charged them to the Children of Israel and to Pharaoh king of Egypt,<br>to bring the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt."

Exodus 6 25,"Elazar son of Aharon took himself one of Putiel’s daughters for himself as a wife,<br>and she bore him Pin’has.<br>These are the heads of the Levite father-groupings according to their clans."
Exodus 6 26,That is [the] Aharon and Moshe to whom <small>YHWH</small> said:<br>Bring the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their forces;
Exodus 6 27,"[it was] they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Children of Israel out of Egypt,<br>that Moshe and Aharon."
Exodus 6 28,"So it was on the day that <small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe in the land of Egypt,"
Exodus 6 29,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:<br>I am <small>YHWH</small>;<br>speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you."

Exodus 7 5,"Ansd the Egyptians will know that I am <small>YHWH</small>,<br>when I stretch out my hand over Egypt and bring the Children of Israel out from their midst!"
Exodus 7 6,"Moshe and Aharon did [it];<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded them, thus they did."
Exodus 7 7,"Now Moshe was eighty years old, and Aharon was eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh."
Exodus 7 8,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:"
Exodus 7 9,"When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying: Give, you, a portent,<br>then say to Aharon:<br>Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh&mdash;let it become a serpent!"
Exodus 7 10,"Moshe and Aharon came to Pharaoh,<br>and they did thus, as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded;<br>Aharon threw down his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent."
Exodus 7 11,"Pharaoh too called for the wise men and for the sorcerers,<br>that they too, the magicians of Egypt, should do thus with their occult-arts,"
Exodus 7 12,"and they threw down, each one, his staff, and these became serpents.<br>But Aharon’s staff swallowed up their staffs."
Exodus 7 13,"Yet Pharaoh’s heart remained strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had spoken."
Exodus 7 14,<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Pharaoh’s heart is heavy-with-stubbornness—he refuses to send the people free.
Exodus 7 15,"Go to Pharaoh in the morning: here, he goes out to the Nile.<br>Station yourself to meet him by the shore of the Nile,<br>and the staff that changed into a snake, take in your hand,"
Exodus 7 16,"and say to him:<br><small>YHWH</small>, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying:<br>Send free my people, that they may serve me in the wilderness!<br>But here, you have not hearkened thus far."
Exodus 7 17,"Thus says <small>YHWH</small>:<br>By this shall you know that I am <small>YHWH</small>:<br>here, I will strike—with the staff that is in my hand—upon the water that is in the Nile,<br>and it will change into blood!"
Exodus 7 18,"The fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will reek,<br>and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the Nile."
Exodus 7 19,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Say to Aharon:<br>Take your staff<br>and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their tributaries, over their Nile-canals, over their ponds and over all their bodies of water,<br>and let them become blood!<br>There will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt—in the wooden-containers, in the stoneware."
Exodus 7 20,"Moshe and Aharon did thus, as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded them.<br>He raised the staff and struck the water in the Nile, before the eyes of Pharaoh and before the eyes of his servants,<br>and all the water that was in the Nile changed into blood."
Exodus 7 21,"The fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile reeked,<br>and the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile;<br>the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus 7 22,"But the magicians of Egypt did thus with their occult-arts,<br>and Pharaoh’s heart remained strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had spoken."
Exodus 7 23,So Pharaoh faced about and came into his house; neither did he pay any mind to this.
Exodus 7 24,"But all Egypt had to dig around the Nile to drink water,<br>for they could not drink from the waters of the Nile."
Exodus 7 25,"Seven days were fulfilled, after <small>YHWH</small> had struck the Nile."
Exodus 7 26,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Come to Pharaoh and say to him:<br>Thus says <small>YHWH</small>:<br>Send free my people, that they may serve me!"
Exodus 7 27,"Now if you refuse to send them free,<br>here, I will smite your entire territory with frogs."
Exodus 7 28,"The Nile will swarm with frogs;<br>they will ascend, they will come<br>into your house, into your bedroom, upon your couch,<br>into your servants’ houses, in among your people,<br>into your ovens and into your dough-pans&mdash;"
Exodus 7 29,"onto you, onto your people, onto all your servants will the frogs ascend!"
Exodus 8 1,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Say to Aharon:<br>Stretch out your hand with your staff, over the tributaries, over the Nile-canals, and over the ponds,<br>and make the frogs ascend upon the land of Egypt!"
Exodus 8 2,"Aharon stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt,<br>the frog-horde ascended<br>and covered the land of Egypt."
Exodus 8 3,Now the magicians did thus with their occult-arts:<br>they made frogs ascend upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus 8 4,"Pharaoh had Moshe and Aharon called<br>and said:<br>Plead with <small>YHWH</small>, that he may remove the frogs from me and from my people,<br>and I will send the people free, that they may sacrifice to <small>YHWH</small>!"
Exodus 8 5,"Moshe said to Pharaoh:<br>Be praised over me:<br>For when shall I plead for you, for your servants, for your people,<br>to cut off the frogs from you and from your houses,<br>[so that] only in the Nile will they remain?"
Exodus 8 6,"He said:<br>For the morrow.<br>He said:<br>According to your words, [then]!<br>In order that you may know<br>that there is none like <small>YHWH</small> our God."
Exodus 8 7,"The frogs shall remove from you, from your houses, from your servants, from your people;<br>only in the Nile shall they remain."
Exodus 8 8,"Moshe and Aharon went out from Pharaoh,<br>and Moshe cried out to <small>YHWH</small><br>on account of the frogs that he had imposed upon Pharaoh."
Exodus 8 9,"And <small>YHWH</small> did according to Moshe’s words:<br>the frogs died away, from the houses, from the courtyards, and from the fields."
Exodus 8 10,"They piled them up, heaps upon heaps, and the land reeked."
Exodus 8 11,"But Pharaoh saw that there was breathing-room,<br>so he made his heart heavy-with-stubbornness, and did not hearken to them,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had spoken."
Exodus 8 12,<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Say to Aharon:<br>Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth;<br>it will become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt!
Exodus 8 13,"They did thus;<br>Aharon stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth,<br>and gnats were on man and on beast;<br>all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus 8 14,"Now the magicians did thus with their occult-arts, to bring forth the gnats, but they could not,<br>and the gnats were on man and on beast."
Exodus 8 15,"The magicians said to Pharaoh:<br>This is the finger of a god!<br>But Pharaoh’s heart remained strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had spoken."
Exodus 8 16,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Start-early in the morning, station yourself before Pharaoh—here, he goes out to the water&mdash;<br>and say to him:<br>Thus says <small>YHWH</small>:<br>Send free my people, that they may serve me!"
Exodus 8 17,"Indeed, if you do not send my people free,<br>here, I will send upon you, upon your servants, upon your people, upon your houses—<br>an insect-swarm,<br>the houses of Egypt will be full of the insects,<br>as well as the ground upon which they are!"
Exodus 8 18,"But I will make distinct, on that day, the region of Goshen, where my people is situated,<br>so that there will be no insects there,<br>in order that you may know that I am <small>YHWH</small> in the land."
Exodus 8 19,And I will put a ransom between my people and your people—<br>on the morrow will this sign occur.
Exodus 8 20,"<small>YHWH</small> did thus:<br>heavy insect-swarms came into Pharaoh’s house, into the houses of his servants, throughout all the land of Egypt;<br>the land was in ruins in the face of the insects."
Exodus 8 21,"Pharaoh had Moshe and Aharon called<br>and said:<br>Go, sacrifice to your god in the land!"
Exodus 8 22,"Moshe said:<br>It would not be wise to do thuswise:<br>for Egypt’s abomination is what we sacrifice to our God;<br>if we were to sacrifice Egypt’s abomination before their eyes,<br>would they not stone us?"
Exodus 8 23,"Let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness,<br>and we shall sacrifice to <small>YHWH</small> our God, as he has said to us."
Exodus 8 24,"Pharaoh said:<br>I will send you free,<br>that you may sacrifice to <small>YHWH</small> your God in the wilderness;<br>only: you are not to go far, too far!<br>Plead for me!"
Exodus 8 25,"Moshe said:<br>Here, when I go out from you, I will plead with <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and the insects will remove from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, on the morrow,<br>only: let not Pharaoh continue to deal-wantonly [with us],<br>by not sending the people free to sacrifice to <small>YHWH</small>!"
Exodus 8 26,Moshe went out from before Pharaoh and pleaded with <small>YHWH</small>.
Exodus 8 27,"And <small>YHWH</small> did according to Moshe’s words,<br>he removed the insects from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people&mdash;<br>not one remained."
Exodus 8 28,"But Pharaoh made his heart heavy-with-stubbornness this time as well,<br>and he did not send the people free."
Exodus 9 1,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Come to Pharaoh and speak to him:<br>Thus says <small>YHWH</small>, the God of the Hebrews:<br>Send free my people, that they may serve me!"
Exodus 9 2,"If you refuse to send [them] free, and continue to hold-on-strongly to them,"
Exodus 9 3,"here, <small>YHWH’S</small> hand will be on your livestock in the field,<br>on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep—<br>an exceedingly heavy pestilence!"
Exodus 9 4,And <small>YHWH</small> will make-a-distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt:<br>there will not die among all that belong to the Children of Israel a thing!
Exodus 9 5,"<small>YHWH</small> set an appointed-time, saying:<br>On the morrow, <small>YHWH</small> will do this thing in the land."
Exodus 9 6,"And <small>YHWH</small> did that thing on the morrow—<br>all the livestock of Egypt died,<br>but of the livestock of the Children of Israel, there died not one."
Exodus 9 7,"Pharaoh sent [to inquire], and here: there had not died of the livestock of the Children of Israel even one.<br>But Pharaoh’s heart remained heavy-with-stubbornness, and he did not send the people free."
Exodus 9 8,<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe and to Aharon:<br>Take yourselves fistfuls of soot from a furnace<br>and let Moshe toss it heavenward before Pharaoh’s eyes;
Exodus 9 9,"it will become fine-dust on all the land of Egypt,<br>and on man and on beast, it will become boils sprouting into blisters,<br>throughout all the land of Egypt!"
Exodus 9 10,"They took the soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moshe tossed it heavenward,<br>and it became boil blisters, sprouting on man and on beast."
Exodus 9 11,"Now the magicians could not stand before Moshe because of the boils,<br>for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all Egypt."
Exodus 9 12,"But <small>YHWH</small> made Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had said to Moshe."
Exodus 9 13,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Start-early in the morning, station yourself before Pharaoh and say to him:<br>Thus says <small>YHWH</small>, the God of the Hebrews:<br>Send free my people, that they may serve me!"
Exodus 9 14,"Indeed, this time I will send all my blows upon your heart, and against your servants, and against your people,<br>so that you may know that there is none like me throughout all the land;"
Exodus 9 15,"indeed, by now I could have sent out my hand and struck you and your people with the pestilence,<br>and you would have been effaced from the land;"
Exodus 9 16,"however, just on account of this I have allowed you to withstand,<br>to make you see my power.<br>and in order that they might recount my name throughout all the land."
Exodus 9 17,"[But] still you set yourself up over my people, by not sending them free—"
Exodus 9 18,"here, around this time tomorrow I will cause to rain down an exceedingly heavy hail,<br>the like of which has never been in Egypt from the days of its founding until now!"
Exodus 9 19,"So-now:<br>send [word]: give refuge to your livestock and to all that is yours in the field;<br>all men and beasts who are found in the field and who have not been gathered into the house—<br>the hail will come down upon them, and they will die!"
Exodus 9 20,"Whoever had awe for the word of <small>YHWH</small> among Pharaoh’s servants had his servants and his livestock flee into the houses,"
Exodus 9 21,but whoever did not pay any mind to the word of <small>YHWH</small> left his servants and his livestock out in the field.
Exodus 9 22,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Stretch out your hand toward the heavens,<br>and let there be hail throughout all the land of Egypt,<br>on man and on beast and on all the plants of the field, throughout the land of Egypt!"
Exodus 9 23,"Moshe stretched out his staff toward the heavens,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> gave forth thunder-sounds and hail, and fire went toward the earth,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> caused hail to rain down upon the land of Egypt."
Exodus 9 24,"There was hail and a fire taking-hold-of-itself amidst the hail, exceedingly heavy,<br>the like of which had never been throughout all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation."
Exodus 9 25,"The hail struck, throughout all the land of Egypt, all that was in the field, from man to beast;<br>all the plants of the field the hail struck, and all the trees of the field it broke down;"
Exodus 9 26,"only in the region of Goshen, where the Children of Israel were, was there no hail."
Exodus 9 27,"Pharaoh sent and had Moshe and Aharon called<br>and said to them:<br>This-time I have sinned!<br><small>YHWH</small> is the one-in-the-right, I and my people are the ones-in-the-wrong!"
Exodus 9 28,"Plead with <small>YHWH</small>,<br>for too much is the God-thunder and this hail!<br>Let me send you free—do not continue staying here!"
Exodus 9 29,"Moshe said to him:<br>As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to <small>YHWH</small>;<br>the thunder will stop and the hail will be no more—<br>in order that you may know that the land belongs to <small>YHWH</small>."
Exodus 9 30,"But as for you and your servants,<br>I know well that you do not yet stand-in-fear<br>before the face of <small>YHWH</small> God!"
Exodus 9 31,"—Now the flax and the barley were stricken, for the barley was in ears and the flax was in buds,"
Exodus 9 32,"but the wheat and the spelt were not stricken, for they are late-ripening.—"
Exodus 9 33,"Moshe went from Pharaoh, outside the city, and spread out his hands to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and the thunder and the hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down to earth."
Exodus 9 34,"Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had stopped,<br>so he continued to sin: he made his heart heavy-with-stubbornness, his and his servants’."
Exodus 9 35,"Pharaoh’s heart remained strong-willed, and he did not send the Children of Israel free,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had spoken through Moshe."
Exodus 10 1,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Come to Pharaoh!<br>For I have made his heart and the heart of his servants heavy-with-stubbornness,<br>in order that I may put these my signs among them"
Exodus 10 2,"and in order that you may recount in the hearing of your child and of your child’s child<br>how I have dealt-wantonly with Egypt,<br>and my signs, which I have placed upon them—<br>that you may know that I am <small>YHWH</small>."
Exodus 10 3,"Moshe and Aharon came to Pharaoh, they said to him:<br>Thus says <small>YHWH</small>, the God of the Hebrews:<br>Until when will you refuse to humble yourself before me?<br>Send free my people, that they may serve me!"
Exodus 10 4,"But if you refuse to send my people free,<br>here, on the morrow I will bring the locust-horde into your territory!"
Exodus 10 5,"They will cover the aspect of the earth, so that one will not be able to see the earth;<br>they will consume what is left of what escaped, of what remains for you from the hail,<br>and they will consume all the trees that spring up for you from the field."
Exodus 10 6,"They will fill your houses, the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all Egypt,<br>as neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen<br>from the day of their being upon the soil until this day.<br>He turned and went out from Pharaoh."
Exodus 10 7,"Pharaoh’s servants said to him:<br>Until when will this one be a snare to us?<br>Send the men free, that they may serve <small>YHWH</small> their God!<br>Do you not yet know that Egypt is lost?"
Exodus 10 8,"Moshe and Aharon were returned to Pharaoh,<br>and he said to them:<br>Go, serve <small>YHWH</small> your God!<br>—Who is it, who is it that would go?"
Exodus 10 9,"Moshe said:<br>With our young ones, with our elders we will go,<br>with our sons and with our daughters,<br>with our sheep and with our oxen we will go—<br>for it is <small>YHWH’S</small> pilgrimage-festival for us."
Exodus 10 10,"He said to them:<br>May <small>YHWH</small> be thus with you, the same as I mean to send you free along with your little-ones!<br>You see—yes, your faces are set toward ill!"
Exodus 10 11,"Not thus—go now, O males, and serve <small>YHWH</small>, for <i>that<i> is what you seek!<br>And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s face."
Exodus 10 12,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locust-horde,<br>and it will ascend over the land of Egypt and consume all the plants of the land, all that the hail allowed to remain."
Exodus 10 13,"Moshe stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> led in an east wind against the land<br>all that day and all night;<br>when it was daybreak, the east wind had borne in the locust-horde."
Exodus 10 14,"The locust-horde ascended over all the land of Egypt,<br>it came to rest upon all the territory of Egypt,<br>exceedingly heavy;<br>before it there was no such locust-horde as it, and after it there will be no such again."
Exodus 10 15,"It covered the aspect of all the earth, and the earth became dark;<br>it consumed all the plants of the land, and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left;<br>nothing at all green was left of the trees and of the plants of the field, throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus 10 16,Quickly Pharaoh had Moshe and Aharon called<br>and said:<br>I have sinned against <small>YHWH</small> your God and against you!
Exodus 10 17,"So now,<br>pray bear my sin just this one time!<br>And plead with <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>that he may only remove this death from me!"
Exodus 10 18,"He went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with <small>YHWH</small>,"
Exodus 10 19,and <small>YHWH</small> reversed an exceedingly strong sea wind<br>which bore the locusts away and dashed them into the Sea of Reeds;<br>not one locust remained throughout all the territory of Egypt.
Exodus 10 20,"But <small>YHWH</small> made Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, and he did not send the Children of Israel free."
Exodus 10 21,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Stretch out your hand toward the heavens,<br>and let there be darkness over the land of Egypt,<br>so that one will feel darkness!"
Exodus 10 22,"Moshe stretched out his hand toward the heavens,<br>and there was gloomy darkness throughout all the land of Egypt, for three days;"
Exodus 10 23,"no one could see his brother, and no one could arise from his spot, for three days.<br>But for all the Children of Israel, there was light in their settlements."
Exodus 10 24,"Pharaoh had Moshe called and said:<br>Go, serve <small>YHWH</small>;<br>only your sheep and your oxen shall be kept back&mdash;<br>even your little-ones may go with you!"
Exodus 10 25,"Moshe said:<br>You must also give sacrifices and offerings-up into our hand, so that we may make [sacrifice] to <small>YHWH</small> our God!"
Exodus 10 26,"Even our livestock must go with us; not a hoof may remain behind,<br>for some of them we must take to serve <small>YHWH</small> our God;<br>we—we do not know how we are to serve <small>YHWH</small><br>until we come there."
Exodus 10 27,"But <small>YHWH</small> made Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, so that he would not consent to send them free."
Exodus 10 28,"Pharaoh said to him:<br>Go from me!<br>Take you care:<br>You are not to see my face again,<br>for on the day that you see my face, you shall die!"
Exodus 10 29,Moshe said:<br>You have spoken well;<br>I will not henceforth see your face again!
Exodus 11 1,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>I will cause one more blow<br>to come upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt;<br>afterward he will send you free from here.<br>When he sends you free, it is finished—he will drive, yes, drive you out from here."
Exodus 11 2,"Pray speak in the hearing of the people:<br>they shall ask, each man of his neighbor, each woman of her neighbor, objects of silver and objects of gold."
Exodus 11 3,"So <small>YHWH</small> gave the people favor in the eyes of Egypt,<br>while the man Moshe was [considered] exceedingly great in the land of Egypt,<br>in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people."
Exodus 11 4,"Moshe said:<br>Thus says <small>YHWH</small>:<br>In the middle of the night<br>I will go forth throughout the midst of Egypt,"
Exodus 11 5,"and every firstborn shall die throughout the land of Egypt,<br>from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne<br>to the firstborn of the maid who is behind the handmill,<br>and every firstborn of beast."
Exodus 11 6,"Then shall there be a cry throughout all the land of Egypt,<br>the like of which has never been, the like of which will never be again."
Exodus 11 7,"But against all the Children of Israel, not a dog shall wag its tongue, against either man or beast,<br>in order that you may know that <small>YHWH</small> makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel."
Exodus 11 8,"Then all these your servants shall go down to me,<br>they shall bow to me, saying:<br>Go out, you and all the people who walk in your footsteps!<br>And afterward I will go out.<br>He went out from Pharaoh in flaming anger."
Exodus 11 9,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Pharaoh will not hearken to you,<br>in order that my portents may be many in the land of Egypt."
Exodus 11 10,"Now Moshe and Aharon had done all the portents in Pharaoh’s presence,<br>but <small>YHWH</small> had made Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, and he had not sent the Children of Israel free from his land."
Exodus 12 1,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe and to Aharon in the land of Egypt, saying:"
Exodus 12 2,"Let this month be for you the beginning of months,<br>the beginning-one let it be for you of the months of the year."
Exodus 12 3,"Speak to the entire community of Israel, saying:<br>On the tenth day of this month<br>they are to take them, each-man, a lamb, according to their Fathers’ House, a lamb per household."
Exodus 12 4,"Now if there be too few in the house for a lamb,<br>he is to take [it], he and his neighbor who is near his house, by the computation according to the [number of] persons;<br>each-man according to what he can eat you are to compute for the lamb."
Exodus 12 5,"A wholly-sound male, year-old lamb shall be yours; from the sheep and from the goats are you to take it."
Exodus 12 6,"It shall be for you in safekeeping, until the fourteenth day of this month,<br>and they are to slaughter it—the entire assembly of the community of Israel—between the setting-times."
Exodus 12 7,"They are to take some of the blood and put it onto the two posts and onto the lintel,<br>onto the houses in which they eat it."
Exodus 12 8,"And they are to eat the flesh on that night, roasted in fire,<br>and <i>matzot;</i><br>with bitter-herbs they are to eat it."
Exodus 12 9,"Do not eat any of it raw, or boiled, boiled in water,<br>but rather roasted in fire, its head along with its legs, along with its innards."
Exodus 12 10,"You are not to leave any of it until morning;<br>what is left of it until morning, with fire you are to burn."
Exodus 12 11,"And thus you are to eat it:<br>your hips girded, your sandals on your feet, and your sticks in your hand.<br>And you are to eat it in trepidation—<br>it is a Passover-Meal to <small>YHWH</small>."
Exodus 12 12,"I will proceed through the land of Egypt on this night<br>and will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast,<br>while on all the gods of Egypt I will render judgment,<br>I, <small>YHWH!</small>."
Exodus 12 13,"Now the blood will be a sign for you upon the houses where you are:<br>I will see the blood, and I will pass over you,<br>so that the blow will not become a bringer-of-ruin to you, when I strike down the land of Egypt."
Exodus 12 14,"Now this day shall be a reminder for you;<br>you are to celebrate it as a pilgrimage-celebration for <small>YHWH</small>;<br>throughout your generations, as a law for the ages you are to celebrate it!"
Exodus 12 15,"For seven days, <i>matzot</i> you are to eat;<br>already on the first day you are to get rid of leaven from your houses,<br>for anyone who eats what is fermented—from the first day until the seventh day—: that person shall be cut off from Israel!"
Exodus 12 16,"And on the first day, a proclamation of holiness,<br>and on the seventh day, a proclamation of holiness shall there be for you&mdash;<br>no kind of work is to be made on them;<br>only what belongs to every person to eat, that alone may be made-ready by you."
Exodus 12 17,And keep the [Festival of] <i>Matzot!</i><br>For on this same day<br>I have brought out your forces from the land of Egypt.<br>Keep this day throughout your generations as a law for the ages.
Exodus 12 18,"In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, at sunset, you are to eat <i>matzot,</i><br>until the twenty-first day of the month, at sunset."
Exodus 12 19,"For seven days, no leaven is to be found in your houses,<br>for whoever eats what ferments, that person shall be cut off from the community of Israel,<br>whether sojourner or native of the land."
Exodus 12 20,"Anything that ferments you are not to eat;<br>in all your settlements, you are to eat <i>matzot.</i>"
Exodus 12 21,"Moshe had all the elders of Israel called and said to them:<br>Pick out, take yourselves a sheep for your clans, and slaughter the Passover-animal."
Exodus 12 22,"Then take a band of hyssop, dip [it] in the blood which is in the basin,<br>and touch the lintel and the two posts with some of the blood which is in the basin.<br>Now you—you are not to go out, any man from the entrance to his house, until daybreak."
Exodus 12 23,"<small>YHWH</small> will proceed to deal-blows to Egypt,<br>and [when] he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two posts, <br><small>YHWH</small> will pass over the entrance,<br>and will not give the ruinbringer [leave] to come into your houses to deal-the-blow."
Exodus 12 24,"You are to keep this matter<br>as a law for you and for your children, into the ages!"
Exodus 12 25,"Now it will be,<br>when you come to the land which <small>YHWH</small> will give you, as he has promised,<br>you are to keep this service!"
Exodus 12 26,"And it will be,<br>when your children say to you: What does this service [mean] to you?"
Exodus 12 27,"then say:<br>It is the sacrificial-meal of Passover to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>who passed over the houses of the Children of Israel in Egypt,<br>when he dealt-the-blow to Egypt and our houses he rescued.<br>The people did homage and bowed low."
Exodus 12 28,"And the Children of Israel went and did [it];<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe and Aharon, thus they did."
Exodus 12 29,"Now it was in the middle of the night:<br><small>YHWH</small> struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt,<br>from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne<br>to the firstborn of the captive in the dungeon,<br>and every firstborn of beast."
Exodus 12 30,"Pharaoh arose at night,<br>he and all his servants and all Egypt,<br>and there was a great cry in Egypt,<br>for there was not a house in which there was not one dead."
Exodus 12 31,"He had Moshe and Aharon called in the night<br>and said:<br>Arise, go out from amidst my people, even you, even the Children of Israel!<br>Go, serve <small>YHWH</small> according to your words:"
Exodus 12 32,"even your sheep, even your oxen, take, as you have spoken, and go!<br>And bring-a-blessing even on me!"
Exodus 12 33,"Egypt pressed the people strongly, to send them out quickly from the land,<br>for they said: We are all dead!"
Exodus 12 34,"So the people loaded their dough before it had fermented, their kneading-troughs bound in their clothing, upon their shoulders."
Exodus 12 35,"Now the Children of Israel had done according to Moshe’s words:<br>they had asked of the Egyptians objects of silver and objects of gold, and clothing;"
Exodus 12 36,"<small>YHWH</small> had given the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians,<br>and they let themselves be asked of.<br>So did they strip Egypt."
Exodus 12 37,"The Children of Israel moved on from Ra’amses to Sukkot,<br>about six hundred thousand on foot, menfolk apart from little-ones,"
Exodus 12 38,"and also a mixed multitude went up with them,<br>along with sheep and oxen, an exceedingly heavy [amount of] livestock."
Exodus 12 39,"Now they baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into <i>matzot</i> cakes, for it had not fermented,<br>for they had been driven out of Egypt, and were not able to linger,<br>and neither had they made provisions for themselves."
Exodus 12 40,Now the settlement of the Children of Israel which they had settled in Egypt was thirty years and four hundred years.
Exodus 12 41,"It was at the end of thirty years and four hundred years,<br>it was on that same day:<br>all of <small>YHWH’S</small> forces went out from the land of Egypt."
Exodus 12 42,"It is a night of keeping-watch for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>to bring them out of the land of Egypt;<br>that is this night for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>a keeping-watch of all the Children of Israel, throughout their generations."
Exodus 12 43,<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe and Aharon:<br>This is the law of the Passover-meal:<br>Any foreign son is not to eat of it.
Exodus 12 44,"But any man’s serf who is acquired for silver—if you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it."
Exodus 12 45,Settler and hired-hand are not to eat of it.
Exodus 12 46,"In one house it is to be eaten;<br>you are not to bring out of the house any of the flesh, outside.<br>And you are not to break a bone of it."
Exodus 12 47,The entire community of Israel is to do it.
Exodus 12 48,"Now when a sojourner sojourns with you, and would make the Passover-meal to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>every male with him must be circumcised, then he may come near to make it, and will be [regarded] as a native of the land.<br>But any foreskinned-man is not to eat of it."
Exodus 12 49,One Instruction shall there be for the native and for the sojourner who sojourns in your midst!
Exodus 12 50,"All the Children of Israel did [it];<br>as <small>YHWH</small> commanded Moshe and Aharon, thus they did."
Exodus 12 51,It was on that same day:<br><small>YHWH</small> brought the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their forces.
Exodus 13 1,"<sc>YHWH<sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Exodus 13 2,"Hallow to me every firstborn,<br>breacher of every womb among the Children of Israel, of man or of beast&mdash;<br>it is mine."
Exodus 13 3,"Moshe said to the people:<br>Keep this day in mind,<br>on which you went out from Egypt, from a house of serfs,<br>for by strength of hand <small>YHWH</small> brought you out from here:<br>no fermentation is to be eaten."
Exodus 13 4,"Today you are going out, in the month of Ripe-Grain."
Exodus 13 5,"And it shall be,<br>when <small>YHWH</small> brings you to the land of the Canaanite,<br>of the Hittite, of the Amorite, of the Hivvite and of the Yevusite,<br>which he swore to your fathers to give you,<br>a land flowing with milk and honey,<br>you are to serve this service, in this month:"
Exodus 13 6,"for seven days you are to eat <i>matzot,</i><br>and on the seventh day is a pilgrimage-festival to <small>YHWH</small>."
Exodus 13 7,"<i>Matzot</i> are to be eaten for the seven days,<br>nothing fermented is to be seen with you; no leaven is to be seen with you, throughout all your territory."
Exodus 13 8,"And you are to tell your child on that day, saying:<br>It is because of what <small>YHWH</small> did for me, when I went out of Egypt."
Exodus 13 9,"It shall be for you for a sign on your hand and for a reminder between your eyes,<br>in order that <small>YHWH’S</small> Instruction may be in your mouth,<br>that by a strong hand did <small>YHWH</small> bring you out of Egypt."
Exodus 13 10,You are to keep this law at its appointed-time from year-day to year-day!
Exodus 13 11,"And it shall be,<br>when <small>YHWH</small> brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers,<br>and gives it to you,"
Exodus 13 12,"you are to transfer every breacher of a womb to <small>YHWH</small>, every breacher, offspring of a beast that belongs to you;<br>the males are for <small>YHWH</small>."
Exodus 13 13,"Every breacher of a donkey you are to redeem with a lamb;<br>if you do not redeem [it], you are to break-its-neck.<br>And every firstborn of men, among your sons, you are to redeem."
Exodus 13 14,"It shall be<br>when your child asks you on the morrow, saying: What does this [mean]?<br>you are to say to him:<br>By strength of hand <small>YHWH</small> brought us out of Egypt, out of a house of serfs."
Exodus 13 15,"And it was<br>when Pharaoh hardened [his heart] against sending us free,<br>that <small>YHWH</small> killed every firstborn throughout the land of Egypt,<br>from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beast.<br>Therefore I myself sacrifice to <small>YHWH</small> every breacher of a womb, the males,<br>and every firstborn of my sons I redeem."
Exodus 13 16,"It shall be for a sign on your hand and for headbands between your eyes,<br>for by strength of hand <small>YHWH</small> brought us out of Egypt."
Exodus 13 17,"Now it was, when Pharaoh had sent the people free,<br>that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, though it is nearer,<br>for God said [to himself]:<br>Lest the people regret it, when they see war,<br>and return to Egypt!"
Exodus 13 18,So God had the people swing about by way of the wilderness at the Sea of Reeds.<br>And the Children of Israel went up armed from the land of Egypt.
Exodus 13 19,"Now Moshe had taken Yosef’s bones with him,<br>for he had made the Children of Israel swear, yes, swear, saying:<br>God will take account, yes, account of you—so bring my bones up from here with you!"
Exodus 13 20,They marched on from Sukkot and encamped in Etam at the edge of the wilderness.
Exodus 13 21,"Now <small>YHWH</small> was going before them,<br>by day as a column of cloud, to lead them the way,<br>by night as a column of fire, to give light to them,<br>to [be able to] go by day and by night."
Exodus 13 22,There would not retire<br>the column of cloud by day<br>or the column of fire by night<br>from before the people.
Exodus 14 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Exodus 14 2,"Speak to the Children of Israel,<br>that they may turn back and encamp before Pi ha-Hirot, between Migdol and the sea;<br>before Baal-Tzefon, opposite it, you are to encamp by the sea."
Exodus 14 3,Now Pharaoh will say of the Children of Israel:<br>They are confused in the land! The wilderness has closed them in!
Exodus 14 4,"And I will make Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, so that he pursues them,<br>and I will be glorified through Pharaoh and all his army,<br>so that the Egyptians may know that I am <small>YHWH</small>.<br>They did thus."
Exodus 14 5,"The king of Egypt was told that the people fled,<br>and Pharaoh’s heart and [that of] his servants changed regarding the people, they said:<br>What, now, have we done, that we have sent free Israel from serving us?"
Exodus 14 6,"He had his chariot harnessed,<br>while his fighting-people he took with him,"
Exodus 14 7,"and he took six hundred selected chariots and every [kind of] chariot of Egypt,<br>teams-of-three upon them all."
Exodus 14 8,"And <small>YHWH</small> made the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt strong-willed, so that he pursued the Children of Israel,<br>while the Children of Israel were going out with a high hand."
Exodus 14 9,"The Egyptians pursued them and overtook them encamped by the sea,<br>all of Pharaoh’s chariot-horses, his riders, and his army,<br>by Pi ha-Hirot, before Baal-Tzefon."
Exodus 14 10,"As Pharaoh drew near, the Children of Israel lifted up their eyes:<br>now here, Egypt marching after them!<br>They were exceedingly afraid.<br>And the Children of Israel cried out to <small>YHWH</small>,"
Exodus 14 11,"they said to Moshe:<br>Is it because there are no graves in Egypt<br>that you have taken us out to die in the wilderness?<br>What, now, have you done to us, bringing us out of Egypt?"
Exodus 14 12,"Is this not the very word that we spoke to you in Egypt,<br>saying: Let us alone, that we may serve Egypt!<br>Indeed, better for us serving Egypt<br>than our dying in the wilderness!"
Exodus 14 13,"Moshe said to the people:<br>Do not be afraid!<br>Stand fast and see<br><small>YHWH’S</small> deliverance which he will work for you today,<br>for as you see Egypt today, you will never see it again for the ages!"
Exodus 14 14,"<small>YHWH</small> will do battle for you, and you—be still!"
Exodus 14 15,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Why do you cry out to me?<br>Speak to the Children of Israel, and let-them-march-forward!"
Exodus 14 16,"And you—<br>hold your staff high, stretch out your hand over the sea<br>and split it,<br>so that the Children of Israel may come through the midst of the sea upon the dry-land."
Exodus 14 17,"While I,<br>here, I will make Egypt’s heart strong-willed,<br>so that they come in after them,<br>and I will be glorified through Pharaoh and all his army,<br>his chariots and his riders;"
Exodus 14 18,"and the Egyptians shall know that I am <small>YHWH</small>,<br>when I am glorified through Pharaoh, his chariots and his riders."
Exodus 14 19,"The messenger of God that was going before the camp of Israel moved on and went behind them;<br>the column of cloud moved ahead of them<br>and stood behind them,"
Exodus 14 20,"and came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel.<br>Here were the cloud and the darkness,<br>and it lit up the night;<br>this one did not come near this one all night."
Exodus 14 21,"Moshe stretched out his hand over the sea,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> caused the sea to go back<br>with a fierce east wind all night,<br>and made the sea into firm-ground;<br>thus the waters split."
Exodus 14 22,"The Children of Israel came through the midst of the sea upon the dry-land,<br>the waters a wall for them on their right and on their left."
Exodus 14 23,"But the Egyptians pursued and came in after them,<br>all of Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots and his riders,<br>into the midst of the sea."
Exodus 14 24,"Now it was at the daybreak watch<br>that <small>YHWH</small> looked out against the camp of Egypt in the column of fire and cloud,<br>and he panicked the camp of Egypt;"
Exodus 14 25,"he loosened the wheels of his chariots and made them to drive with heaviness.<br>Egypt said:<br>I must flee before Israel,<br>for <small>YHWH</small> does battle for them against Egypt!"
Exodus 14 26,"Then <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Stretch out your hand over the sea,<br>and the waters shall return<br>upon Egypt—upon its chariots and upon its riders."
Exodus 14 27,"Moshe stretched out his hand over the sea,<br>and the sea returned, at the face of daybreak, to its original-place,<br>as the Egyptians were fleeing toward it.<br>And <small>YHWH</small> shook the Egyptians in the midst of the sea."
Exodus 14 28,"The waters returned;<br>they covered the chariots and the riders of all of Pharaoh’s army that had come after them into the sea,<br>not even one of them remained."
Exodus 14 29,"But the Children of Israel had gone upon dry-land, through the midst of the sea,<br>the waters a wall for them on their right and on their left."
Exodus 14 30,"So <small>YHWH</small> delivered Israel on that day from the hand of Egypt;<br>Israel saw Egypt dead by the shore of the sea,"
Exodus 14 31,and Israel saw the great hand that <small>YHWH</small> had wrought against Egypt.<br>The people held <small>YHWH</small> in awe;<br>they trusted in <small>YHWH</small> and in Moshe his servant.
Exodus 15 1,"Then sang Moshe and the Children of Israel<br>this song to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>they said, saying:<br> I will sing to <small>YHWH</small>, <br>for he has triumphed, yes, triumphed, <br>the horse and its charioteer he flung into the sea!"
Exodus 15 2,"My fierce-might and strength is <small>YAH</small>,<br>he has become deliverance for me!<br> This is my God—I laud him, <br>the God of my father—I exalt him!"
Exodus 15 3,"<small>YHWH</small> is a man of war,<br><small>YHWH</small> is his name!"
Exodus 15 4,"Pharaoh’s chariots and his army<br>he hurled into the sea, <br>his choicest teams-of-three<br>sank in the Sea of Reeds."
Exodus 15 5,"Oceans covered them, <br>they went down in the depths <br>like a stone."
Exodus 15 6,"Your right-hand, O <small>YHWH</small>, <br>majestic in power, <br>your right-hand, O <small>YHWH</small>, <br>shattered the enemy."
Exodus 15 7,"In your great triumph<br>you smashed your foes, <br>sent forth your flaming-anger, <br>consumed them like chaff."
Exodus 15 8,"By the breath of your nostrils <br>the waters piled up,<br>the gushing-streams stood up like a dam, <br>the oceans congealed in the heart of the sea."
Exodus 15 9,"Uttered the enemy: <br>I will pursue, <br>overtake, <br>and apportion the spoils, <br>my greed will be filled on them, <br>my sword I will draw, <br>my hand—dispossess them!"
Exodus 15 10,"You blew with your breath, <br>the sea covered them, <br>they plunged down like lead <br>in majestic waters."
Exodus 15 11,"Who is like you among the gods, O <small>YHWH</small>? <br>Who is like you, majestic among the holy-ones, <br>Feared-One of praises, Doer of Wonders?"
Exodus 15 12,"You stretched out your right-hand, <br>the Underworld swallowed them."
Exodus 15 13,"You led in your faithfulness <br>your people redeemed, <br>guided [them] in your fierce-might <br>to your holy pasture."
Exodus 15 14,"The peoples heard,<br>they shuddered; <br>writhing seized <br>Philistia’s inhabitants,"
Exodus 15 15,"and then, terrified, <br>Edom’s chieftains, <br>Moav’s “rams”— <br>trembling did seize them; <br>then they quivered, <br>all Canaan’s inhabitants."
Exodus 15 16,There fell upon them <br>dread and anguish; <br>before your arm’s great [power] <br>they grew dumb like stone.
Exodus 15 17,"Until they crossed—your people, O <small>YHWH</small>, <br>until they crossed—the people you fashioned. <br>You brought them, you planted them <br>on the mount of your heritage, <br>foundation of your [royal] seat <br>which you prepared, O <small>YHWH</small>, <br>the Holy-Shrine, O Lord, <br>founded by your hands."
Exodus 15 18,"May <small>YHWH</small> be king for the ages, eternity!"
Exodus 15 19,"For Pharaoh’s horses came with [their] chariots and riders into the sea,<br>but <small>YHWH</small> turned back the sea’s waters upon them,<br>and the Children of Israel went upon the dry-land<br>through the midst of the sea."
Exodus 15 20,"Miryam the prophetess, Aharon’s sister, took a timbrel in her hand,<br>and all the women went out after her, with timbrels and with dancing."
Exodus 15 21,"Miryam chanted to them: <br>Sing to <small>YHWH</small>, for he has triumphed, yes, triumphed, <br>the horse and its charioteer he flung into the sea!"
Exodus 15 22,"Moshe had Israel march on from the Sea of Reeds,<br>and they went out to the Wilderness of Shur.<br>They traveled through the wilderness for three days, and found no water."
Exodus 15 23,"They came to Mara,<br>but they could not drink water from Mara, because it was <i>mar</i>/bitter.<br>Therefore they called its name Mara."
Exodus 15 24,"And the people grumbled against Moshe, saying:<br>What are we to drink?"
Exodus 15 25,"He cried out to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> directed him [to some] wood;<br>he threw [it] into the water, and the water became sweet.—<br>There he imposed law and judgment for them, and there he tested them:"
Exodus 15 26,"he said:<br>If you will hearken, yes, hearken to the voice of <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>and what is right in his eyes will do,<br>and will give-ear to his commandments<br>and keep all his laws,<br>all the sicknesses which I have imposed upon Egypt, I will not impose upon you,<br>for I am <small>YHWH</small>, your healer!"
Exodus 15 27,"They came to Elim;<br>there were twelve springs of water<br>and seventy palms,<br>and they camped there by the water."
Exodus 16 1,"They marched on from Elim, and they came, the entire community of the Children of Israel, to the Wilderness of Syn, which is between Elim and Sinai,<br>on the fifteenth day of the second month after their going-out from the land of Egypt."
Exodus 16 2,"And they grumbled, the entire community of the Children of Israel, against Moshe and against Aharon in the wilderness."
Exodus 16 3,"The Children of Israel said to them:<br>Would that we had died by the hand of <small>YHWH</small> in the land of Egypt,<br>when we sat by the meat pots,<br>when we ate bread till [we were] satisfied!<br>For you have brought us into this wilderness<br>to bring death to this whole assembly by starvation!"
Exodus 16 4,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Here, I will make rain down upon you bread from the heavens;<br>the people shall go out and glean, each day’s amount in its day,<br>in order that I may test them, whether they will walk according to my Instruction or not."
Exodus 16 5,"But it shall be on the sixth day:<br>[when] they prepare what they have brought in,<br>it shall be a double-portion compared to what they glean day [after] day."
Exodus 16 6,Moshe and Aharon said to all the Children of Israel:<br>At sunset<br>you will know that it is <small>YHWH</small> who brought you out of the land of Egypt;
Exodus 16 7,"at daybreak<br>you will see the Glory of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>when he hearkens to your grumblings against <small>YHWH</small>—<br>and what are we, that you grumble against us?"
Exodus 16 8,"And Moshe said:<br>When <small>YHWH</small> gives you<br>meat to eat at sunset,<br>and at daybreak, bread to satisfy [yourselves];<br>when <small>YHWH</small> hearkens to your grumblings which you grumble against him&mdash;<br>and what are we?<br>Not against us are your grumblings, but against <small>YHWH</small>!"
Exodus 16 9,"Moshe said to Aharon:<br>Say to the entire community of the Children of Israel:<br>Come near, in the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>for he has hearkened to your grumblings!"
Exodus 16 10,"Now it was, when Aharon spoke to the entire community of the Children of Israel,<br>that they faced the wilderness,<br>and here,<br>the Glory of <small>YHWH</small> could be seen in the cloud."
Exodus 16 11,"And <small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Exodus 16 12,"I have hearkened to the grumblings of the Children of Israel—<br>speak to them, saying:<br>Between the setting-times you shall eat meat,<br>and at daybreak you shall be satisfied with bread,<br>and you shall know<br>that I am <small>YHWH</small> your God."
Exodus 16 13,Now it was at sunset<br>a horde-of-quail came up and covered the camp.<br>And at daybreak<br>there was a layer of dew around the camp;
Exodus 16 14,"and [when] the layer of dew went up,<br>now here, upon the surface of the wilderness,<br>[something] fine, scaly,<br>fine as hoar-frost upon the land."
Exodus 16 15,"The Children of Israel saw it<br>and they said, each one to his brother:<br><i>Mahn hu</i>/What is it?<br>For they did not know what it was.<br>Moshe said to them:<br>It is the bread that <small>YHWH</small> has given you for eating."
Exodus 16 16,"This is the matter that <small>YHWH</small> has commanded:<br>Glean from it, each according to what he can eat,<br>an <i>omer</i> per capita, according to the number of your persons;<br>each one, for those in his tent, you are to take."
Exodus 16 17,"The Children of Israel did thus;<br>they gleaned, the-one-more and the-one-less,"
Exodus 16 18,"but when they measured by the <i>omer,</i><br>no surplus had the-one-more, and the-one-less had no shortage;<br>each had gleaned according to what he could eat."
Exodus 16 19,Moshe said to them:<br>No one shall leave any of it until daybreak!
Exodus 16 20,"But they did not hearken to Moshe,<br>and [several] men left some of it until daybreak;<br>it became wormy with maggots and reeked.<br>And Moshe became furious with them."
Exodus 16 21,"They gleaned it at daybreak, [every] daybreak, each in accordance with what he could eat,<br>but when the sun heated up, it melted."
Exodus 16 22,"Now it was on the sixth day<br>that they gleaned a double-portion of bread, two <i>omers</i> for [each] one.<br>All the exalted-leaders of the community came and told it to Moshe."
Exodus 16 23,"He said to them:<br>It is what <small>YHWH</small> spoke about:<br>tomorrow is a Sabbath/Ceasing, a Sabbath of Holiness for <small>YHWH</small>.<br>Whatever you wish to bake—bake, and whatever you wish to boil—boil,<br>while all the surplus, put aside for yourselves in safekeeping until morning."
Exodus 16 24,"They put it aside until morning, as Moshe had commanded,<br>and it did not reek, neither were there any maggots in it."
Exodus 16 25,"Moshe said:<br>Eat it today,<br>for today is a Sabbath for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>today you will not find it in the field."
Exodus 16 26,"For six days you are to glean,<br>but on the seventh day is Sabbath, there will not be [any] on it."
Exodus 16 27,"But it was on the seventh day<br>that some of the people went out to glean, and they did not find."
Exodus 16 28,<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Until when will you refuse to keep my commandments and my instructions?
Exodus 16 29,"[You] see<br>that <small>YHWH</small> has given you the Sabbath,<br>therefore on the sixth day, he gives you bread for two days.<br>Stay, each one, in his spot;<br>no one is to go out from his place on the seventh day!"
Exodus 16 30,So the people ceased on the seventh day.
Exodus 16 31,"And the House of Israel called its name: <i>Mahn.</i><br>—It is like coriander seed, whitish,<br>and its taste is like [that of] a wafer with honey.—"
Exodus 16 32,"Moshe said:<br>This is the matter that <small>YHWH</small> has commanded:<br>an <i>omer</i>-ful of it for safekeeping throughout your generations,<br>in order that they may see the bread that I had you eat in the wilderness<br>when I brought you out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus 16 33,"And Moshe said to Aharon:<br>Take a vat and put an <i>omer</i>-ful of <i>mahn</i> in it,<br>and put it aside in the presence of <small>YHWH</small>, in safekeeping throughout your generations."
Exodus 16 34,"As <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe, Aharon put it aside before the Testimony, in safekeeping."
Exodus 16 35,"And the Children of Israel ate the <i>mahn</i> for forty years, until they came to settled land;<br>the <i>mahn</i> they ate, until they came to the edge of the land of Canaan."
Exodus 16 36,Now an <i>omer</i>—it is a tenth of an <i>efa</i>.
Exodus 17 1,"They marched on, the whole community of the Children of Israel, from the Wilderness of Syn,<br>by their marching-stages, at <small>YHWH’S</small> bidding.<br>They encamped at Refidim,<br>but there was no water for the people to drink!"
Exodus 17 2,"The people quarreled with Moshe, they said:<br>Give us water, that we may drink!<br>Moshe said to them:<br>Why do you quarrel with me?<br>Why do you test <small>YHWH</small>?"
Exodus 17 3,"The people thirsted for water there,<br>and the people grumbled against Moshe, and said:<br>Why, now, did you bring us up from Egypt,<br>to bring death to me, to my children and to my livestock by thirst?"
Exodus 17 4,"Moshe cried out to <small>YHWH</small>, saying:<br>What shall I do with this people?<br>A little more and they will stone me!"
Exodus 17 5,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Proceed before the people;<br>take some of the elders of Israel with you,<br>and your staff with which you struck the Nile, take in your hand,<br>and go!"
Exodus 17 6,"Here, I stand before you there on the rock at Horev;<br>you are to strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people shall drink.<br>Moshe did thus, before the eyes of the elders of Israel."
Exodus 17 7,"And he called the name of the place: <i>Massa</i>/Testing, and <i>Meriva</i>/Quarreling,<br>because of the quarreling of the Children of Israel,<br>and because of their testing of <small>YHWH</small>, saying:<br>Is <small>YHWH</small> in our midst, or not?"
Exodus 17 8,Now Amalek came and did battle with Israel in Refidim.
Exodus 17 9,"Moshe said to Yehoshua:<br>Choose us men,<br>and go out, wage battle against Amalek!<br>On the morrow I will station myself on top of the hill, with the staff of God in my hand."
Exodus 17 10,"Yehoshua did as Moshe had said to him,<br>to wage battle against Amalek.<br>Now Moshe, Aharon and Hur went up to the top of the hill,"
Exodus 17 11,"and it would be, whenever Moshe raised his hand, Israel prevailed, and whenever he set down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
Exodus 17 12,"Now Moshe’s hands were heavy,<br>so they took a stone and placed it under him, and he sat down on it,<br>while Aharon and Hur supported his hands, one on this-side and one on this-side.<br>So his hands remained steadfast, until the sun came in."
Exodus 17 13,"And Yehoshua weakened Amalek and his people, with the edge of the sword."
Exodus 17 14,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Write this as a memorial in a record<br>and put it in Yehoshua’s hearing:<br>Yes, I will wipe out, wipe out the memory of Amalek from under the heavens!"
Exodus 17 15,Moshe built an altar<br>and called its name: <small>YHWH</small> My Banner.
Exodus 17 16,"He said:<br>Yes,<br>hand on <small>YAH’S</small> throne!<br>Battle for <small>YHWH</small> against Amalek<br>generation after generation!"
Exodus 18 1,"Now Yitro, the priest of Midyan, Moshe’s father-in-law, heard<br>about all that God had done for Moshe and for Israel his people,<br>that <small>YHWH</small> had brought Israel out of Egypt."
Exodus 18 2,"Yitro, Moshe’s father-in-law,<br>took Tzippora, Moshe’s wife—after she had been sent home—"
Exodus 18 3,"and her two sons,<br>of whom the first one’s name was Gershom/Sojourner There,<br>for he had said: I have become a sojourner in a foreign land,"
Exodus 18 4,"and the other’s name was Eliezer/God’s-Help, for: the God of my father is my help, he rescued me from Pharaoh’s sword;"
Exodus 18 5,"and Yitro, Moshe’s father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moshe, to the wilderness, where he was encamped,<br>at the mountain of God."
Exodus 18 6,"He [had it] said to Moshe:<br>I, your father-in-law Yitro, am coming to you, and your wife and her two sons with her."
Exodus 18 7,"Moshe went out to meet his father-in-law,<br>he bowed low and kissed him, and each asked after the other’s welfare;<br>then they came into the tent."
Exodus 18 8,"And Moshe related to his father-in-law<br>all that <small>YHWH</small> had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt on Israel’s account,<br>all the hardships that had befallen them on the journey,<br>and [how] <small>YHWH</small> had rescued them."
Exodus 18 9,"And Yitro was jubilant because of all the good that <small>YHWH</small> had done for Israel, that he had rescued him from the land of Egypt."
Exodus 18 10,"Yitro said:<br>Blessed be <small>YHWH</small>,<br>who has rescued you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of Pharaoh,<br>who has rescued the people from under the hand of Egypt!"
Exodus 18 11,"[So] now I know:<br>yes, <small>YHWH</small> is greater than all gods—<br>yes, in just that matter in which they were presumptuous against them!"
Exodus 18 12,"And Yitro, Moshe’s father-in-law, took an offering-up and sacrifices for God,<br>and Aharon and all the elders of Israel came to eat bread with Moshe’s father-in-law, before the presence of God."
Exodus 18 13,"Now it was on the morrow<br>that Moshe sat to judge the people,<br>and the people stood before Moshe from daybreak until sunset."
Exodus 18 14,"Moshe’s father-in-law saw all that he had to do for the people;<br>he said:<br>What kind of matter is this that you do for the people—<br>why do you sit alone, while the entire people stations itself around you<br>from daybreak until sunset?"
Exodus 18 15,"Moshe said to his father-in-law:<br>When the people comes to me to inquire of God,"
Exodus 18 16,"—when it has some legal-matter, it comes to me—<br>I judge between a man and his neighbor<br>and make known God’s laws and his instructions."
Exodus 18 17,"Then Moshe’s father-in-law said to him:<br>Not good is this matter, as you do it!"
Exodus 18 18,"You will become worn out, yes, worn out, so you, so this people that are with you,<br>for this matter is too heavy for you;<br>you cannot do it alone."
Exodus 18 19,"So now, hearken to my voice:<br>I will advise you, so that God may be with you:<br>Be, yourself, for the people in relation to God.<br>You yourself should have the matters come to God;"
Exodus 18 20,"You should make clear to them the laws and the instructions,<br>you should make known to them the way they should go, and the deeds that they should do;"
Exodus 18 21,"but you—you are to have the vision [to select] from all the people men of value, holding God in awe,<br>men of truth, hating gain;<br>you should set [them] over them<br>as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens,"
Exodus 18 22,"so that they may render judgment for the people at all times.<br>So shall it be:<br>every great matter they shall bring before you,<br>but every small matter they shall judge by themselves.<br>Make [it] light upon you, and let them bear [it] with you."
Exodus 18 23,"If you do this matter,<br>[when] God commands you [further], you will be able to stand,<br>and also this people will come to its place in peace."
Exodus 18 24,Moshe hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law;<br>he did it all as he had said:
Exodus 18 25,"Moshe chose men of value from all Israel;<br>he placed them as heads over the people,<br>as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens."
Exodus 18 26,"They would render judgment for the people at all times:<br>the difficult matters they would bring before Moshe,<br>but every small matter they would judge by themselves."
Exodus 18 27,"Moshe sent his father-in-law off,<br>and he went home to his land."
Exodus 19 1,"In the third month after the going-out of the Children of Israel from the land of Egypt,<br>on that day<br>they came to the Wilderness of Sinai."
Exodus 19 2,"They moved on from Refidim and came to the Wilderness of Sinai,<br>and encamped in the wilderness.<br>There Israel encamped, opposite the mountain."
Exodus 19 3,"Now Moshe went up to God,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> called out to him from the mountain,<br>saying:<br>Say thus to the House of Yaakov,<br>[yes,] tell the Children of Israel:"
Exodus 19 4,"You yourselves have seen<br>what I did to Egypt,<br>how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to me."
Exodus 19 5,"So now,<br>if you will hearken, yes, hearken to my voice<br>and keep my covenant,<br>you shall be to me a special-treasure from among all peoples.<br>Indeed, all the earth is mine,"
Exodus 19 6,"but you, you shall be to me<br>a kingdom of priests,<br>a holy nation.<br>These are the words that you are to speak to the Children of Israel."
Exodus 19 7,"Moshe came, and had the elders of the people called,<br>and he set before them these words, with which <small>YHWH</small> had commanded him."
Exodus 19 8,"And all the people answered together, they said:<br>All that <small>YHWH</small> has spoken, we will do.<br>And Moshe reported the words of the people to <small>YHWH</small>."
Exodus 19 9,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Here, I am coming to you in a thick cloud,<br>so that the people may hear when I speak with you,<br>and also that they may have trust in you for ever.<br>And Moshe told the words of the people to <small>YHWH</small>."
Exodus 19 10,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Go to the people,<br>make them holy, today and tomorrow,<br>let them scrub their clothes,"
Exodus 19 11,"that they may be ready for the third day,<br>for on the third day<br><small>YHWH</small> will come down before the eyes of all the people, upon Mount Sinai."
Exodus 19 12,"Fix-boundaries for the people all around, saying:<br>Take you care against going up the mountain or against touching its border!<br>Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death, yes, death;"
Exodus 19 13,"no hand is to touch him,<br>but he is to be stoned, yes, stoned, or shot, yes, shot&mdash;<br>whether beast or man, he is not to live!<br>When the [sound of the] ram’s-horn is drawn out, they may go up on the mountain."
Exodus 19 14,"Moshe went down from the mountain to the people;<br>he made the people holy, and they scrubbed their clothes."
Exodus 19 15,Then he said to the people:<br>Be ready for three days; do not approach a woman!
Exodus 19 16,"Now it was on the third day, when it was daybreak:<br>There were thunder-sounds, and lightning,<br>a heavy cloud on the mountain<br>and an exceedingly strong <i>shofar</i> sound.<br>And all of the people that were in the camp trembled."
Exodus 19 17,"Moshe brought the people out toward God, from the camp,<br>and they stationed themselves beneath the mountain."
Exodus 19 18,"Now Mount Sinai emitted-smoke all over,<br>since <small>YHWH</small> had come down upon it in fire;<br>its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace,<br>and all of the mountain trembled exceedingly."
Exodus 19 19,"Now the <i>shofar</i> sound was growing exceedingly stronger<br>—Moshe kept speaking,<br>and God kept answering him in the sound [of a voice]—"
Exodus 19 20,"and <small>YHWH</small> came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain.<br><small>YHWH</small> called Moshe to the top of the mountain,<br>and Moshe went up."
Exodus 19 21,"And <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Go down, warn the people,<br>lest they break through to <small>YHWH</small> to see, and many of them fall;"
Exodus 19 22,"even the priests who approach <small>YHWH</small> must make themselves holy,<br>lest <small>YHWH</small> burst out against them!"
Exodus 19 23,"But Moshe said to <small>YHWH</small>:<br>The people are not able to go up to Mount Sinai,<br>for you yourself warned us, saying: Fix boundaries for the mountain and make it holy."
Exodus 19 24,"<small>YHWH</small> said to him:<br>Go, get down,<br>and then come up, you and Aharon with you,<br>but the priests and the people must not break through to go up to <small>YHWH</small>, lest he burst out against them!"
Exodus 19 25,Moshe went down to the people and said to them
Exodus 20 1,"God spoke all these words,<br>saying:"
Exodus 20 2,"I am <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>who brought you out<br>from the land of Egypt, from a house of serfs."
Exodus 20 3,You are not to have<br>any other gods<br>before my presence.
Exodus 20 4,"You are not to make yourself a carved-image<br>or any figure<br>that is in the heavens above, that is on the earth beneath, that is in the waters beneath the earth;"
Exodus 20 5,"you are not to bow down to them<br>and you are not to serve them,<br>for I, <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>am a zealous God,<br>calling-to-account the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, to the third and the fourth [generation]<br>of those hating me,"
Exodus 20 6,"but showing loyalty to the thousandth<br>of those loving me,<br>of those keeping my commandments."
Exodus 20 7,"You are not to take up<br>the name of <small>YHWH</small> your God for emptiness,<br>for <small>YHWH</small> will not clear anyone<br>who takes up his name for emptiness."
Exodus 20 8,"Be mindful<br>of the Sabbath day, to hallow it."
Exodus 20 9,"For six days, you are to serve, and are to make all your work,"
Exodus 20 10,"but the seventh day<br>is Sabbath for <small>YHWH</small> your God:<br>you are not to make any work,<br>you, and your son, and your daughter,<br>your servant, and your maid, and your beast,<br>and your sojourner who is within your gates."
Exodus 20 11,"For in six days<br><small>YHWH</small> made<br>the heavens and the earth,<br>the sea and all that is in it,<br>and he rested on the seventh day;<br>therefore <small>YHWH</small> gave the Sabbath day his blessing, and he hallowed it."

Exodus 20 13,You are not to murder!<br>You are not to adulter!<br>You are not to steal!<br>You are not to testify<br>against your neighbor as a false witness!
Exodus 20 14,"You are not to desire<br>the house of your neighbor,<br>you are not to desire the wife of your neighbor,<br>or his servant, or his maid, or his ox, or his donkey,<br>or anything that is your neighbor’s!"
Exodus 20 15,"Now all of the people were seeing<br>the thunder-sounds,<br>the flashing-torches,<br>the <i>shofar</i> sound,<br>and the mountain emitting-smoke;<br>the people saw,<br>and they faltered<br>and stood far off."
Exodus 20 16,"They said to Moshe:<br><i>You</i> speak with us, and we will hearken,<br>but let not God speak with us, lest we die!"
Exodus 20 17,"Moshe said to the people:<br>Do not be afraid!<br>For it is to test you that God has come,<br>to have awe of him be upon you,<br>so that you do not sin."
Exodus 20 18,"The people stood far off,<br>while Moshe approached the fog where God was."
Exodus 20 19,<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Say thus to the Children of Israel:<br>You yourselves have seen<br>that it was from the heavens that I spoke with you.

Exodus 20 22,"And if an altar of stones you make for me,<br>you are not to build it smooth-hewn,<br>for if you hold-high your iron-tool over it, you will have profaned it."

Exodus 31 11,"and oil for anointing<br>and fragrant smoke for the holy-offerings—<br>exactly as I have commanded you, they are to make."
Exodus 31 12,Now <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:
Exodus 31 13,"And you, speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>However: my Sabbaths you are to keep!<br>For it is a sign<br>between me and you, throughout your generations,<br>to know that I, <small>YHWH</small>, hallow you."
Exodus 31 14,"You are to keep the Sabbath,<br>for it is holiness for you,<br>whoever profanes it is to be put to death, yes, death!<br>For whoever makes work on it—<br>that person is to be cut off from among his kinspeople."
Exodus 31 15,"For six days is work to be made,<br>but on the seventh day<br>[is] Sabbath, Sabbath-Ceasing, holiness for <small>YHWH</small>;<br>whoever makes work on the Sabbath day is to be put to death, yes, death!"
Exodus 31 16,"The Children of Israel are to keep the Sabbath,<br>to make the Sabbath-observance throughout their generations<br>as a covenant for the ages."
Exodus 31 17,"Between me and the Children of Israel<br>it is a sign for the ages,<br>for in six days<br><small>YHWH</small> made the heavens and the earth,<br>but on the seventh day<br>he ceased and paused-for-breath."
Exodus 31 18,"He gave to Moshe<br>when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai<br>the two tablets of the Testimony,<br>tablets of stone,<br>written by the finger of God."
Exodus 32 1,"Now the people saw that Moshe was shamefully-late in coming down from the mountain,<br>so the people assembled against Aharon<br>and said to him:<br>Arise, make us a god who will go before us,<br>for this Moshe, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt,<br>we do not know what has become of him!"
Exodus 32 2,"Aharon said to them:<br>Break off the gold rings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters,<br>and bring [them] to me!"
Exodus 32 3,"All the people broke off the gold rings that were in their ears,<br>and brought [them] to Aharon."
Exodus 32 4,"He took from their hand,<br>fashioned it with a graving-tool,<br>and made it into a molten calf.<br>Then they said:<br>This is your God, O Israel,<br>who brought you up from the land of Egypt!"
Exodus 32 5,"[When] Aharon saw [this], he built an altar before it,<br>and Aharon called out and said:<br>Tomorrow is a festival to <small>YHWH</small>!"
Exodus 32 6,"They started-early on the morrow,<br>offered offerings-up<br>and brought <i>shalom</i>-offerings;<br>the people sat down to eat and drink<br>and proceeded to revel."
Exodus 32 7,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Go, get down!<br>for your people<br>whom you brought up from the land of Egypt<br>has wrought ruin!"
Exodus 32 8,"They have been quick to turn aside from the way that I commanded them:<br>they have made themselves a molten calf,<br>they have bowed to it, they have sacrificed to it,<br>and they have said: This is your God, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!"
Exodus 32 9,"And <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>I see this people—<br>and here, it is a hard necked people!"
Exodus 32 10,"So now,<br>let me be, that my anger may flare up against them<br>and I may destroy them—<br>but you I will make into a great nation!"
Exodus 32 11,"Moshe soothed the face of <small>YHWH</small> his God;<br>he said:<br>Why,<br>O <small>YHWH</small>,<br>should your anger flare up against your people<br>whom you brought out of the land of Egypt<br>with great power,<br>with a strong hand?"
Exodus 32 12,"Why<br>should the Egyptians [be able to] say, yes, say:<br>With evil intent he brought them out,<br>to kill them in the mountains,<br>to destroy them from the face of the earth?<br>Turn away from your flaming anger,<br>repent of the evil [intended] against your people!"
Exodus 32 13,"Recall Avraham, Yitzhak and Yisrael your servants,<br>to whom you swore by yourself<br>when you spoke to them:<br>I will make your seed many<br>as the stars of the heavens,<br>and all this land which I have promised,<br>I will give to your seed,<br>that they may inherit [it] for the ages!"
Exodus 32 14,And <small>YHWH</small> repented of the evil<br>that he had spoken of doing to his people.
Exodus 32 15,"Moshe faced about to come down from the mountain,<br>the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand,<br>tablets written on both their sides:<br>on this one and on this one they were written;"
Exodus 32 16,"and the tablets were God’s making,<br>and the writing was God’s writing,<br>engraved upon the tablets."
Exodus 32 17,"Yehoshua heard the sound of the people as it shouted, so he said to Moshe:<br>The sound of battle is in the camp!"
Exodus 32 18,"But he said:<br>Not the sound of the song of prevailing,<br>not the sound of the song of failing,<br>sound of choral-song is what I hear!"
Exodus 32 19,"And it was,<br>when he neared the camp<br>and saw the calf and the dancing,<br>that Moshe’s anger flared up;<br>he threw the tablets from his hands<br>and smashed them beneath the mountain."
Exodus 32 20,"He took the calf that they had made<br>and burned it with fire<br>and ground it up until it was thin-powder,<br>and strewed it on the surface of the water<br>and made the Children of Israel drink it."
Exodus 32 21,Then Moshe said to Aharon:<br>What did this people do to you<br>that you have brought upon it [such] a great sin!
Exodus 32 22,"Aharon said:<br>Let not my lord’s anger flare up!<br>You yourself know this people, how set-on-evil it is."
Exodus 32 23,"They said to me: Make us a god who will go before us,<br>for this Moshe, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt,<br>we do not know what has become of him!"
Exodus 32 24,"So I said to them: Who has gold?<br>They broke it off and gave it to me;<br>I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."
Exodus 32 25,"Moshe saw the people: that it had gotten loose,<br>for Aharon had let it loose for whispering among their foes,"
Exodus 32 26,so Moshe took-up-a-stand at the gate of the camp<br>and said:<br>Whoever is for <small>YHWH</small>—to me!<br>And there gathered to him all the Sons of Levi.
Exodus 32 27,"He said to them:<br>Thus says <small>YHWH</small>, the God of Israel:<br>Put everyone his sword on his thigh,<br>proceed and go back-and-forth from gate to gate in the camp,<br>and kill<br>everyone his brother, everyone his neighbor, everyone his relative!"
Exodus 32 28,The Sons of Levi did according to Moshe’s words.<br>And there fell of the people on that day some three thousand men.
Exodus 32 29,"Moshe said:<br>Be-mandated to <small>YHWH</small> today,<br>even though it be every-man at the cost of his son, at the cost of his brother,<br>to bestow blessing upon you today!"
Exodus 32 30,"It was on the morrow<br>that Moshe said to the people:<br>You, you have sinned a great sin!<br>So now, I will go up to <small>YHWH</small>;<br>perhaps I may be able to purge away your sin."
Exodus 32 31,"Moshe returned to <small>YHWH</small> and said:<br>Ah now,<br>this people has sinned a great sin,<br>they have made themselves gods of gold!"
Exodus 32 32,"So now,<br>if you would [only] bear away their sin—!<br>But if not,<br>pray blot me out of the record that you have written!"
Exodus 32 33,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Whoever sins against me,<br>I blot him [alone] out of my record."
Exodus 32 34,"So now,<br>go,<br>lead the people to where I have spoken to you.<br>Here, my messenger will go before you,<br>but on the day of my calling-to-account,<br>I will call-them-to-account for their sin!"
Exodus 32 35,And <small>YHWH</small> plagued the people<br>because they made the calf that Aharon made.
Exodus 33 1,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Go, up from here,<br>you and the people that you brought up from the land of Egypt,<br>to the land of which I swore to Avraham, to Yitzhak and to Yaakov, saying:<br>I will give it to your seed."
Exodus 33 2,"I will send a messenger before you<br>and will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite, the Hivvite and the Yevusite—,"
Exodus 33 3,"to a land flowing with milk and honey.<br>But: I will not go up in your midst,<br>for a hard necked people are you,<br>lest I destroy you on the way!"
Exodus 33 4,"[When] the people heard this evil word<br>they mourned,<br>and no man put on his ornaments [again]."
Exodus 33 5,"And <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Say to the Children of Israel:<br>You are a hard necked people—<br>if for one moment I were to go up in your midst,<br>I would destroy you!<br>So now, take down your ornaments from yourselves,<br>that I may know what I am to do with you."
Exodus 33 6,So the Children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Sinai on.
Exodus 33 7,"Now Moshe would take the Tent<br>and pitch it for himself outside the camp, going-far from the camp.<br>He called it the Tent of Appointment.<br>And it was,<br>whoever besought <small>YHWH</small><br>would go out to the Tent of Appointment that was outside the camp."
Exodus 33 8,"And it was:<br>whenever Moshe would go out to the Tent,<br>all the people would rise;<br>they would station themselves, each at the entrance to his tent,<br>and would gaze after Moshe<br>until he had come into the Tent."
Exodus 33 9,"And it was:<br>whenever Moshe would come into the Tent,<br>the column of cloud would come down<br>and stop at the entrance to the Tent,<br>and he would speak with Moshe."
Exodus 33 10,"And all the people would see<br>the column of cloud<br>standing at the entrance to the Tent,<br>and all the people would rise;<br>they would bow down,<br>each at the entrance to his tent."
Exodus 33 11,"And <small>YHWH</small> would speak to Moshe<br>face to face,<br>as one speaks to his neighbor.<br>Now when he would return to the camp,<br>his attendant, the lad Yehoshua,<br>would not depart from within the Tent."

Leviticus 1 3,"If an offering-up is his near-offering, from the herd,<br>male, wholly-sound, let him bring it near;<br>to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment let him bring it near,<br>as acceptance for him, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 1 4,"He is to lean his hand on the head of the offering-up,<br>that there may be acceptance on his behalf, to effect-ransom for him."
Leviticus 1 5,"He is to slaughter the herd-animal [for sacrifice] before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and the Sons of Aharon, the priests, are to bring near the blood<br>and are to dash the blood against the altar, all around,<br>that is at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment."
Leviticus 1 6,"Then he is to flay the offering-up, and is to section it into its sections."
Leviticus 1 7,Now the Sons of Aharon the priest are to put fire on the altar<br>and are to arrange wood on the fire.
Leviticus 1 8,"The Sons of Aharon, the priests, are to arrange the sections, the head and the suet,<br>on the wood that is on the fire, that is on the altar,"
Leviticus 1 9,"while its innards and its shins he is to wash in water;<br>and the priest is to turn all-of-it into smoke upon the altar,<br>for an offering-up, a fire-offering of soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>."

Leviticus 1 14,"Now if from birds is his offered-up near-offering for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>he is to bring near from turtledoves or from young pigeons as his near-offering."
Leviticus 1 15,"The priest is to bring it near on the altar<br>and pinch off its head;<br>he is to turn it into smoke on the altar,<br>and its blood is to be drained out against the side-wall of the altar."
Leviticus 1 16,"He is to remove its crissum by means of its plumage<br>and is to fling it next to the altar, eastward,<br>into the place of the ashes."
Leviticus 1 17,"He is to tear it open by its wings—he is not to divide [it]!—<br>and the priest is to turn it into smoke upon the altar, on the wood that is on the fire:<br>it is an offering-up,<br>a fire-offering of soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 2 1,"Now a person—when he brings near a near-offering of a grain-gift for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>of [proper] flour shall his near-offering be.<br>He is to pour oil on it and is to put frankincense on it;"
Leviticus 2 2,"then he is to bring it to the Sons of Aharon, the priests.<br>He is to scoop from there a scoopful from its flour and from its oil, along with all its frankincense;<br>the priest is to turn its reminder-portion into smoke upon the altar,<br>a fire-offering of soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 2 3,"Now what is left of the grain-gift is Aharon’s and his sons’,<br>a holiest holy-portion from the fire-offerings of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 2 4,"When you bring near a near-offering of a grain-gift baked in an oven,<br>[it is to be] of flour: <i>matza</i>/unleavened cakes mixed with oil, <i>matza</i> wafers spread with oil."

Leviticus 2 9,The priest is to set-aside its remindee-portion from the grain-gift<br>and is to turn it into smoke on the altar;<br>a fire-offering of soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>.
Leviticus 2 10,"And what is left of the grain-gift is Aharon’s and his sons’,<br>a holiest holy-portion from the fire-offerings of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 2 11,"Every grain-gift that you bring near to <small>YHWH</small>&mdash;it is not to be made leavened,<br>for any fermentation and any date-honey—you may not turn [any] of it into smoke as a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small>;"
Leviticus 2 12,"as a near-offering of premier-fruits you may bring them near to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>but on the altar they are not to offer them up as a soothing savor."
Leviticus 2 13,All your near-offerings of a grain-gift you are to salt with salt;<br>you are not to omit the salt of your God’s covenant from atop your grain-gift&mdash;<br>atop all your near-offerings you are to bring near salt.
Leviticus 2 14,"Now if you bring near a grain-gift of firstfruits to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>budding-grain, parched with fire, grits of fresh-grain you are to bring near as your grain-gift of firstfruits."
Leviticus 2 15,"You are to put oil on it,<br>you are to place frankincense on it:<br>it is a grain-gift."

Leviticus 3 2,"He is to lean his hand on the head of his near-offering,<br>and he is to slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment,<br>and the Sons of Aharon, the priests, are to dash the blood against the altar, all around."
Leviticus 3 3,"Then he is to bring near from the sacrifice of <i>shalom,</i> a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small>:<br>the fat that covers the innards and all the fat that is about the innards,"
Leviticus 3 4,"the two kidneys and the fat that is about them, that is on the tendons,<br>and the extension on the liver—along with the kidneys he is to remove it."

Leviticus 4 18,"And some of the blood he is to put on the horns of the altar that is before the presence of <small>YHWH</small><br>that is in the Tent of Appointment;<br>as for all the [rest of the] blood, he is to pour it out at the foundation of the altar of offering-up<br>that is at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment."
Leviticus 4 19,"As for all its fat, he is to set it [all] aside from it<br>and turn it into smoke on the altar."
Leviticus 4 20,"He is to do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the <i>hattat-</i>offering, thus is he to do with it;<br>the priest shall effect-purgation on their behalf, and they shall be granted-pardon."
Leviticus 4 21,"He is to take the bull outside the camp,<br>and he is to burn it just as one burned the first bull;<br>it is a <i>hattat-</i>offering for the assembly!"
Leviticus 4 22,"Where a leader sins,<br>by doing any one of [the things] regarding the commandments of <small>YHWH</small> his God that should not be done, in error,<br>and so incurs-guilt,"
Leviticus 4 23,"or it is made known to him his sin that he has sinned:<br>he is to bring as his near-offering: a hairy-one of goats, male, wholly-sound."
Leviticus 4 24,"He is to lean his hand on the head of the hairy-one<br>and it is to be slaughtered at the place where the offering-up is slaughtered, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>;<br>it is a <i>hattat-</i>offering."
Leviticus 4 25,The priest is to take some of the blood of the <i>hattat</i> with his finger<br>and is to put [it] on the horns of the altar of offering-up;<br>its blood he is to pour out at the foundation of the altar of offering-up.
Leviticus 4 26,"All its fat he is to turn into smoke upon the altar,<br>like the fat of the sacrifice of <i>shalom;</i><br>thus the priest is to effect-purgation for him from his sin,<br>and he shall be granted-pardon."
Leviticus 4 27,"Now if any person sins in error, from among the people of the land,<br>by doing one [thing] regarding the commandments of <small>YHWH</small> that should not be done,<br>and so incurs-guilt,"
Leviticus 4 28,"or it is made known to him the sin that he sinned:<br>he is to bring as his near-offering a hairy-one of goats, wholly-sound, female, for the sin whereby he sinned."
Leviticus 4 29,"He is to lean his hand on the head of the <i>hattat-</i>offering<br>and is to slaughter the <i>hattat-</i>offering<i>,</i> at the place of the offering-up."
Leviticus 4 30,The priest is to take some of the blood of the <i>hattat-</i>offering with his finger<br>and is to put [it] on the horns of the altar of offering-up;<br>all [the rest of] its blood he is to pour out at the foundation of the altar of offering-up.
Leviticus 4 31,"All of its fat, he is to remove, as the fat was removed from upon the sacrifice of <i>shalom,</i><br>and the priest is to turn it into smoke upon the altar,<br>as a soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>;<br>thus the priest is to effect-purgation for him,<br>and he shall be granted-pardon."
Leviticus 4 32,"If [it is] a sheep he brings as his near-offering for a <i>hattat-</i>offering,<br>a female, wholly-sound, he is to bring."
Leviticus 4 33,"He is to lean his hand on the head of the <i>hattat-</i>offering<i>,</i><br>and it is to be slaughtered as a <i>hattat-</i>offering in the place where the offering-up is slaughtered."
Leviticus 4 34,The priest is to take some of the blood of the <i>hattat-</i>offering with his finger<br>and is to put [it] on the horns of the altar of offering-up;<br>all [the rest] of its blood he is to pour out at the foundation of the altar of offering-up.
Leviticus 4 35,"All of its fat he is to remove, as the fat of the sheep was removed from the sacrifice of <i>shalom,</i><br>and the priest is to turn them into smoke upon the altar, along with the fire-offerings of <small>YHWH</small>.<br>Thus the priest is to effect-purgation for him for his sin whereby he sinned,<br>and he shall be granted-pardon."
Leviticus 5 1,"Now a person—when he sins:<br>should he hear the public-voice [carrying] a threat<br>and though he was a witness, either seeing or knowing,<br>he does not tell,<br>he is to bear his iniquity;"
Leviticus 5 2,"or a person that touches anything <i>tamei,</i><br>either the carcass of a <i>tamei</i> wild-animal or the carcass of a <i>tamei</i> domestic-animal or the carcass of a <i>tamei</i> swarming-creature,<br>and though [the fact] is hidden from him,<br>he has become-<i>tamei,</i> and so has incurred-guilt;"
Leviticus 5 3,"or when he touches human <i>tum’a</i>, including any <i>tum’a</i> whereby one can become-<i>tamei</i>—<br>and though [the fact] is hidden from him,<br>he [later] comes-to-know that he incurred-guilt;"
Leviticus 5 4,"or a person—when he swears rashly with his lips, to-do-ill or to-do-good, including whatever a human might say-rashly in swearing—<br>and though [the fact] is hidden from him,<br>he comes-to-know that he incurred-guilt in [any] one of these matters:"
Leviticus 5 5,"it shall be, when he realizes-guilt in [any] one of these,<br>and confesses how he has sinned thereby,"
Leviticus 5 6,"that he is to bring his <i>asham</i>/guilt-offering to <small>YHWH</small>, for the sin whereby he has sinned:<br>a female from the flock, a she-lamb or a hairy she-goat, as a <i>hattat-</i>offering<i>,</i><br>and the priest is to effect-purgation for him from his sin."
Leviticus 5 7,"Now if his hand cannot reach enough [means] for a sheep,<br>he is to bring as his <i>asham</i>-offering [for] what he sinned:<br>two turtledoves or two young pigeons, to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>one for a <i>hattat</i>-offering and one for an offering-up;"
Leviticus 5 8,"he is to bring them to the priest,<br>and he is to bring-near the one for the <i>hattat</i>-offering first,<br>and pinch off its head opposite the back-of-the-neck—he is not to divide [it]!"
Leviticus 5 9,"He is to sprinkle some of the blood of the <i>hattat</i>-offering against the side-wall of the altar;<br>what remains of the blood is to be drained out at the foundation of the altar,<br>it is a <i>hattat</i>-offering<i>.</i>"
Leviticus 5 10,"And the second one he is to make as an offering-up, according to regulation;<br>the priest is to effect-purgation on his behalf from the sin whereby he sinned,<br>and he shall be granted-pardon."
Leviticus 5 11,"Now if his hand cannot reach [means for] two turtledoves or two young pigeons,<br>he is to bring as his near-offering [for] what he sinned<br>a tenth of an <i>efa</i> of flour, for a <i>hattat</i>-offering;<br>he is not to put oil on it, and he is not to place frankincense on it,<br>for it is a <i>hattat</i>-offering."
Leviticus 5 12,"He is to bring it to the priest,<br>the priest is to scoop out with his fist a fistful of some of it, as a reminder-portion,<br>and is to turn it into smoke on the altar, along with the fire-offerings of <small>YHWH</small>:<br>it is a <i>hattat</i>-offering<i>.</i>"
Leviticus 5 13,"So the priest is to effect-purgation for him for his sin whereby he sinned, in [any] one of these,<br>and he shall be granted-pardon.<br>And it shall be for the priest, like the grain-gift."
Leviticus 5 14,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 5 15,"A person—when he breaks-faith, yes, faith, and sins in error regarding any of the holy-things of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>he is to bring as his <i>asham</i>/penalty to <small>YHWH</small>: a ram, wholly-sound, from the flock,<br>by your assessment in silver <i>shekels</i> by the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel,</i> as an <i>asham</i>."
Leviticus 5 16,"For that whereby he sinned regarding the holy-things, he is to pay, and its fifth he is to add to it, and give it to the priest;<br>then the priest is to effect-purgation on his behalf with the ram of <i>asham,</i><br>and he shall be granted-pardon."
Leviticus 5 17,"But if a person—when he sins,<br>by doing any one of the commandments of <small>YHWH</small> that are not to be done,<br>[even] if he did not know that he incurred-guilt,<br>he must bear his iniquity:"
Leviticus 5 18,"he is to bring a ram, wholly-sound, from the flock,<br>by your assessment, as an <i>asham</i>-offering, to the priest;<br>the priest is to effect-purgation on his behalf for the error whereby he erred, [even] if he did not know,<br>and he shall be granted-pardon."
Leviticus 5 19,"It is an <i>asham</i>/guilt-offering—he incurred-guilt, yes, guilt before <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 5 20,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 5 21,"A person—when one sins and breaks-faith, yes, faith against <small>YHWH</small>:<br>he denies his fellow’s [charges] regarding a deposit, or what is placed in one’s hand [for safekeeping], or robbery,<br>or withholds [property] from his fellow;"
Leviticus 5 22,"or finds a lost-object and denies it,<br>or swears falsely regarding one of anything that a human may do, to sin by the aforementioned—"
Leviticus 5 23,"it shall be, when he has sinned and realized-his-guilt,<br>he is to return the robbed-object that he robbed<br>or the withheld [property] that he withheld<br>or the deposit that was deposited with him<br>or the lost-object that he found,"
Leviticus 5 24,"or anything [else] about which he swore falsely;<br>he is to repay it in its capital-amount, and its fifth he is to add to it.<br>To the one whose it is, he is to give it at the time of his being-proven-guilty."
Leviticus 5 25,"And as his <i>asham</i>-offering he is to bring to <small>YHWH</small>:<br>a ram, wholly-sound, from the flock, by your assessment, for an <i>asham</i>-offering, to the priest;"
Leviticus 5 26,"the priest is to effect-purgation for him, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and he shall be granted-pardon,<br>for [whichever] one of all [the things] that he may have done to incur-guilt thereby."
Leviticus 6 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 6 2,"Command Aharon and his sons, saying:<br>This is the Instruction [regarding] the offering-up—<br>that is what goes-up on the blazing-hearth on the altar all night, until daybreak,<br>while the fire of the altar is kept blazing on it:"
Leviticus 6 3,"the priest is to clothe himself in his wide-raiment of linen,<br>with breeches of linen he is to clothe himself, over his “flesh”;<br>he is to set-aside the ashes from which the fire has consumed the offering-up on the altar,<br>and is to put them beside the altar."
Leviticus 6 4,"Then he is to strip off his garments and clothe himself in other garments,<br>and he is to bring the ashes outside the camp, to a ritually-pure place."
Leviticus 6 5,"Now the fire on the altar is to be kept-blazing upon it—it must not go out!—<br>and the priest is to stoke on it [pieces-of-]wood, in the morning, [every] morning,<br>and he is to arrange on it the offering-up,<br>and is to turn into smoke on it the fat-parts of the <i>shalom</i>-offerings."
Leviticus 6 6,A regular fire is to be kept-blazing on the altar—it is not to go out!
Leviticus 6 7,"Now this is the Instruction [regarding] the grain-gift:<br>Aharon’s sons must bring it near, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>in front of the altar."
Leviticus 6 8,"There shall be set-aside from it, by the handful, some of the flour of the grain-gift and some of its oil, with all the frankincense that is on the grain-gift,<br>and it is to be turned into smoke on the altar, as a soothing savor, as its reminder-portion to <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 6 9,"What is left of it, Aharon and his sons are to eat;<br>unleavened it is to be eaten, in a holy place,<br>in the courtyard of the Tent of Appointment they are to eat it."
Leviticus 6 10,"It is not to be baked with leaven;<br>as their portion I have given it from my fire-offerings<br>—it is a holiest holy-portion, like the <i>hattat</i>-offering and like the <i>asham</i>-offering."
Leviticus 6 11,"Any male among the Children of Aharon may eat it,<br>[as] an allotment for the ages, throughout your generations, from the fire-offerings of <small>YHWH</small>;<br>whatever touches it becomes holy [property]."
Leviticus 6 12,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 6 13,"This is the near-offering of Aharon and his sons that they are to bring near to <small>YHWH</small> at the time of his being anointed:<br>a tenth-measure of an <i>efa</i> of flour as a regular grain-gift, half of it at daybreak and half of it at sunset."
Leviticus 6 14,"On a griddle, with oil, it is to be made,<br>well-stirred are you to bring it,<br>as baked crumbled-bits of grain you are to bring-it-near,<br>a soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 6 15,"Thus shall the priest anointed in his stead, from [among] his sons, make it,<br>a law for the ages, for <small>YHWH</small>:<br>completely it is to be turned into smoke."
Leviticus 6 16,"And every grain-gift of a priest, completely-offered shall it be;<br>it is not to be eaten."
Leviticus 6 17,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 6 18,"Speak to Aharon and to his sons, saying:<br>This is the Instruction [regarding] the <i>hattat</i>-offering<i>:</i><br>in the place where the offering-up is slaughtered, the <i>hattat</i> is to be slaughtered,<br>before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>&mdash;<br>it is a holiest holy-portion."
Leviticus 6 19,"The priest who sacrifices-the-<i>hattat</i>-offering is to eat of it;<br>in a holy place it is to be eaten, in the courtyard of the Tent of Appointment."
Leviticus 6 20,"Whatever touches its flesh becomes holy [property].<br>And if some of its blood is spattered on a garment,<br>[the spot] on which it is spattered is to be scrubbed in a holy place."
Leviticus 6 21,"Now a vessel of earthenware in which it was boiled is to be broken;<br>if [it was] in a copper vessel that it was boiled, it is to be scoured and rinsed with water."
Leviticus 6 22,Any male among the priests may eat it&mdash;<br>it is a holiest holy-portion.
Leviticus 6 23,"But any <i>hattat</i>-offering from whose blood is brought to the Tent of Appointment, to effect-purgation in the Holy-Shrine, shall not be eaten;<br>in fire it is to be burned."
Leviticus 7 1,Now this is the Instruction [regarding] the <i>asham</i>-offering:<br>it is a holiest holy-portion.
Leviticus 7 2,"In the place where they slaughter the offering-up, they are to slaughter the <i>asham</i>-offering,<br>and its blood is to be dashed against the altar, all around."
Leviticus 7 3,"Now from all its fat is to be brought near:<br>the thick tail and the fat that covers the innards,"
Leviticus 7 4,"the two kidneys and the fat that is about them [and] that is on the tendons,<br>and the extension on the liver, along with the kidneys is to be removed."
Leviticus 7 5,"The priest is to turn them into smoke upon the altar, a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>it is an <i>asham</i>-offering."
Leviticus 7 6,"Any male among the priests may eat it,<br>in a holy place it is to be eaten&mdash;<br>it is a holiest holy-portion!"
Leviticus 7 7,"Like the <i>hattat</i>-offering, so the <i>asham</i>-offering—<br>one Instruction for them;<br>the priest who effects-purgation through it, his shall it be."
Leviticus 7 8,"And the priest who brings-near the offering-up of a [lay]man,<br>the skin of the offering-up that he brings-near is for the priest—his shall it be."
Leviticus 7 9,"And any grain-gift that is baked in an oven, and any that is prepared in a frying pan or on a griddle,<br>for the priest that brings-it-near—his shall it be."
Leviticus 7 10,"But any grain-gift mixed with oil, or dry,<br>for any of the Sons of Aharon shall it be, each one like his brother."
Leviticus 7 11,Now this is the Instruction [regarding] the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> that is brought-near for <small>YHWH</small>:
Leviticus 7 12,"if [it is] on account of thanksgiving that he brings-it-near,<br>he is to bring-near along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving:<br><i>matza</i> cakes, mixed with oil, <i>matza</i> wafers smeared with oil,<br>and flour well-stirred into cakes, mixed with oil."
Leviticus 7 13,"Along with cakes of leavened bread he is to bring-near his near-offering,<br>along with his thanksgiving sacrifice of <i>shalom</i>."
Leviticus 7 14,He is to bring near from it one of each [kind of] near-offering as a contribution for <small>YHWH</small>;<br>[it is] for the priest who dashes the blood of the <i>shalom</i>-offering—his shall it be.
Leviticus 7 15,"As for the flesh of his thanksgiving sacrifice of <i>shalom,<br>at the time of his bringing it near it is to be eaten,<br>he may not leave [any] of it until morning."
Leviticus 7 16,"Now if a vow-offering or a freewill-offering is his sacrificed near-offering,<br>at the time of his bringing near his sacrifice it is to be eaten;<br>on the morrow, what is left of it may be eaten."
Leviticus 7 17,"And what is left of the flesh of the sacrifice—<br>on the third day, in fire it is to be burned."
Leviticus 7 18,"Now should there be eaten, yes, eaten any of the flesh of his sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> on the third day, it is not acceptable [for] him that brings it near, it will not be reckoned to him.<br>Tainted-meat shall it be [considered],<br>and the person who eats of it—his iniquity he shall bear!"
Leviticus 7 19,"Flesh that touches anything <i>tamei</i> is not to be eaten, in fire it is to be burned.<br>As for [other] flesh: anyone ritually-pure may eat the flesh."
Leviticus 7 20,"But the person who eats flesh from the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> that is <small>YHWH’S</small><br>while his <i>tum’a</i> is upon him,<br>cut-off shall that person be from his kinspeople!"
Leviticus 7 21,"And a person—when he touches anything <i>tamei,</i> human <i>tum’a</i> or a <i>tamei</i> animal or any <i>tamei</i> detestable-creature,<br>and eats from the flesh of the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> that is <small>YHWH’S</small>,<br>cut off shall that person be from his kinspeople!"
Leviticus 7 22,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 7 23,"Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>Any fat of an ox or a lamb or a goat, you are not to eat."
Leviticus 7 24,"Now fat from a carcass, fat from a torn-animal may be used for any work-purpose,<br>but eating—you are not to eat it!"
Leviticus 7 25,"For whoever eats fat from an animal from which a fire-offering may be brought-near for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>cut-off shall the person be that eats [thus], from his kinspeople!"
Leviticus 7 26,"And any blood you are not to eat throughout all your settlements, [either] of a bird or of a domestic-animal."
Leviticus 7 27,Any person that eats any blood—<br>cut-off shall that person be from his kinspeople!
Leviticus 7 28,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 7 29,"Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>He who brings near his sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> for <small>YHWH</small><br>is to bring his near-offering [himself] to <small>YHWH</small>, from his sacrifice of <i>shalom;</i>"
Leviticus 7 30,"his [own] hands are to bring the fire-offerings for <small>YHWH</small>.<br>The fat—along with the breast he is to bring it,<br>the breast for elevating it as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 7 31,And the priest is to turn the fat into smoke upon the altar.<br>And the breast is to be Aharon’s and his sons’.
Leviticus 7 32,"Now the right thigh you are to give as a contribution to the priest, from your sacrifices of <i>shalom</i>."
Leviticus 7 33,"He who brings near the blood of the <i>shalom</i>-offerings and the fat, from among the Sons of Aharon—his shall it be,<br>the right thigh as a portion."
Leviticus 7 34,"For the breast of the elevation-offering and the thigh of the contribution, I take from the Children of Israel, from their sacrifices of <i>shalom,</i><br>and I give them to Aharon the priest and to his sons, as an allotment for the ages, from the Children of Israel."
Leviticus 7 35,"This is the anointed-share of Aharon and the anointed-share of his sons from the fire-offerings of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>from the time he brought them near to be-priests for <small>YHWH</small>,"
Leviticus 7 36,"which <small>YHWH</small> commanded to be given them from the time of his anointing them, from the Children of Israel—<br>as a law for the ages, throughout their generations."
Leviticus 7 37,"This is the Instruction<br>concerning the offering-up, concerning the grain-gift,<br>concerning the <i>hattat</i>-offering and concerning the <i>asham</i>-offering,<br>concerning the mandate-offering and concerning the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i>"
Leviticus 7 38,"that <small>YHWH</small> commanded Moshe at Mount Sinai<br>at the time of his commanding the Children of Israel to bring near their near-offerings to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>in the wilderness of Sinai."
Leviticus 8 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 8 2,"Take Aharon and his sons with him,<br>the garments and the oil for anointing,<br>the bull for the <i>hattat</i>-offering, the two rams and the basket of <i>matzot</i>;"
Leviticus 8 3,"and the entire community, assemble at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment."
Leviticus 8 4,Moshe did as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded him;<br>the community assembled at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.
Leviticus 8 5,Then Moshe said to the community:<br>This is the thing that God has commanded to be done.
Leviticus 8 6,Moshe brought near Aharon and his sons<br>and washed them with water;
Leviticus 8 7,"he put on him the robe,<br>he girded him with the sash,<br>he clothed him in the tunic,<br>he put on him the <i>efod</i>-vest,<br>he girded him with the designed-band of the <i>efod,</i> and invested him in it,"
Leviticus 8 8,"he placed on him the breastpiece,<br>he put into the breastpiece the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Tummim,</i>"
Leviticus 8 9,"he placed the turban on his head,<br>he placed on the turban, in front of his face, the plate of gold, the sacred-diadem of holiness,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Leviticus 8 10,"Then Moshe took the oil for anointing and anointed the dwelling and all that was in it,<br>making-them-holy."
Leviticus 8 11,"He sprinkled some of it on the altar, seven times,<br>and anointed the altar, all its vessels, the basin and its pedestal,<br>to make-them-holy."
Leviticus 8 12,"He poured some of the oil for anointing on the head of Aharon, anointing him,<br>to make-him-holy."
Leviticus 8 13,"Then Moshe brought near the sons of Aharon,<br>he clothed them in tunics,<br>he girded them with sash[es],<br>and wound them caps,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Leviticus 8 14,"He brought forward the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering,<br>and Aharon and his sons leaned their hands upon the head of the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering,"
Leviticus 8 15,"and it was slaughtered.<br>Moshe took the blood<br>and put it on the horns of the altar, all around, with his finger, and [thus] decontaminated the altar;<br>while the blood he poured out at the foundation of the altar.<br>So he made-it-holy, for effecting-purgation upon it."
Leviticus 8 16,"Then he took all the fat that is about the innards,<br>the extension of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat,<br>and Moshe turned [them] into smoke upon the altar."
Leviticus 8 17,"The [rest of the] bull, its skin, its flesh and its dung,<br>he burned in fire, outside the camp,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Leviticus 8 18,"near the ram for the offering-up;<br>Aharon and his sons leaned their hands upon the head of the ram,"
Leviticus 8 19,"and it was slaughtered.<br>Moshe dashed the blood against the altar, all around."
Leviticus 8 20,"Then the ram he sectioned into its sections,<br>and Moshe turned into smoke the head, the sections and the suet."
Leviticus 8 21,"Now the innards and the shins he washed in water,<br>and Moshe turned the entire ram into smoke upon the altar.<br>It [was] an offering-up, for a soothing savor,<br>it [was] a fire-offering for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Leviticus 8 22,"Then he brought near the second ram, the ram for giving-mandate.<br>Aharon and his sons leaned their hands on the head of the ram."
Leviticus 8 23,"and it was slaughtered.<br>And Moshe took some of its blood and put it on the ridge of the right ear of Aharon, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the thumb-toe of his right foot."
Leviticus 8 24,"Then he brought near the sons of Aharon,<br>and Moshe put some of the blood on the ridge of their right ear, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the thumb-toe of their right foot;<br>then Moshe dashed the blood on the altar, all around."
Leviticus 8 25,"He took the fat—the broad-tail and all the fat that is about the innards,<br>the extension of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh;"
Leviticus 8 26,"and from the basket of <i>matzot</i> that was before the presence of <small>YHWH</small><br>he took one cake of <i>matza</i> and one cake of oil bread, and one wafer<br>and put [them] on the fat-parts and on the right thigh."
Leviticus 8 27,"He placed all [of them] on the palms of Aharon and on the palms of his sons,<br>and they elevated them as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 8 28,"Then Moshe took them from their palms<br>and turned them into smoke upon the altar, along with the offering-up.<br>They are mandate-offerings, for a soothing savor&mdash;<br>it is a fire-offering for <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 8 29,"Then Moshe took the breast and elevated it as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>from the ram of mandating—for Moshe it was a portion,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Leviticus 8 30,"Now Moshe took some of the oil for anointing and some of the blood that was on the altar<br>and sprinkled [it] on Aharon, on his garments, on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him;<br>[thus] he made-holy Aharon, his garments, his sons and the garments of his sons with him."
Leviticus 8 31,"Moshe said to Aharon and to his sons:<br>Boil the flesh at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment;<br>there you are to eat it, along with the bread that is in the basket of mandating,<br>as I have commanded, saying: Aharon and his sons are to eat it!"
Leviticus 8 32,"What is left of the flesh and of the bread, in fire you are to burn [it]."
Leviticus 8 33,"Now from the entrance to the Tent of Appointment you are not to go out, for seven days,<br>until the time of fulfilling the days of full-mandating.<br>For seven days [it takes] to fill your hands [in mandating]."
Leviticus 8 34,"As has been done this day, <small>YHWH</small> commanded to be done, to effect-purgation for you."
Leviticus 8 35,"At the entrance to the Tent of Appointment you are to stay, day and night, for seven days;<br>you are to keep the charge of <small>YHWH</small>, so that you do not die,<br>for thus I have been commanded."
Leviticus 8 36,And Aharon and his sons did all the things that <small>YHWH</small> had commanded by the hand of Moshe.
Leviticus 9 1,"Now it was on the eighth day:<br>Moshe called Aharon and his sons and the elders of Israel,"
Leviticus 9 2,"and he said to Aharon:<br>Take yourself a calf, a young of the herd, as a <i>hattat</i>-offerings, and a ram as an offering-up, wholly-sound,<br>and bring-them-near, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 9 3,"And to the Children of Israel you are to speak, saying:<br>Take a hairy-one of goats as a <i>hattat</i>-offering<br>and a calf and a lamb, year-old ones, wholly-sound, as an offering-up,"
Leviticus 9 4,"and an ox and a ram as a <i>shalom</i>-offering,<br>to sacrifice before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and a grain-gift mixed with oil;<br>for today, <small>YHWH</small> will make-himself-seen by you!"
Leviticus 9 5,"So they took what Moshe had commanded, to the front of the Tent of Appointment,<br>and the entire community came near and stood before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 9 6,"And Moshe said:<br>This is the word that <small>YHWH</small> has commanded [that] you do,<br>that the Glory of <small>YHWH</small> may be seen by you!"
Leviticus 9 7,"And Moshe said to Aharon:<br>Come-near to the altar and make your <i>hattat</i>-offering and your offering-up,<br>effecting-atonement on behalf of yourself and on behalf of the people,<br>and make the near-offering of the people, effecting-atonement on their behalf,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> has commanded."
Leviticus 9 8,So Aharon came-near to the altar<br>and slaughtered the calf for the <i>hattat</i>-offering that was his.
Leviticus 9 9,"Then the sons of Aharon brought-near the blood to him,<br>he dipped his finger in the blood and placed [it] on the horns of the altar.<br>The [remaining] blood he poured out at the foundation of the altar."
Leviticus 9 10,"Now the fat and the kidneys and the extension from the liver, from the <i>hattat</i>-offering,<br>he turned into smoke upon the altar,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe;"
Leviticus 9 11,"the flesh and the skin he burned in fire, outside the camp."
Leviticus 9 12,"Then he slaughtered the offering-up,<br>and the sons of Aharon handed the blood to him, and he dashed it against the altar, all around."
Leviticus 9 13,"The offering-up they handed to him in its sections, as well as the head,<br>and he turned [them] into smoke on the altar."
Leviticus 9 14,"He washed the innards and the shins,<br>and turned [them] into smoke, along with the offering-up, upon the altar."
Leviticus 9 15,"Then he brought near the near-offering of the people.<br>He took the hairy-goat for the <i>hattat</i>-offering that was the people’s;<br>he slaughtered it, and performed-the-<i>hattat</i>-offering, like the first-one."
Leviticus 9 16,"Then he brought near the offering-up, and made it according to regulation."
Leviticus 9 17,"Then he brought near the grain-gift, and filled his palm with some of it;<br>and he turned it into smoke upon the altar—aside from the morning offering-up."
Leviticus 9 18,"Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram of the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> that was the people’s;<br>the sons of Aharon handed the blood to him,<br>and he dashed it against the altar, all around,"
Leviticus 9 19,"along with the fat-parts of the ox and of the ram:<br>the broad-tail and what covers the kidneys, and the extension of the liver."
Leviticus 9 20,They put the fat-parts over the breasts<br>and he turned the fat-parts into smoke upon the altar;
Leviticus 9 21,"the breasts and the right thigh, Aharon elevated as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>as he had commanded Moshe."
Leviticus 9 22,"And Aharon lifted his hands toward the people, and he blessed them;<br>then he came down from making the <i>hattat</i>-offering, the offering-up and the <i>shalom</i>-offering."
Leviticus 9 23,"Now Moshe and Aharon had entered the Tent of Appointment;<br>they came out and they blessed the people,<br>and the Glory of <small>YHWH</small> was seen by the entire people."
Leviticus 9 24,"And fire went out from the presence of <small>YHWH</small><br>and consumed, on the altar, the offering-up and the fat-parts;<br>all the people saw, and they shouted and flung themselves on their faces."
Leviticus 10 1,"Aharon’s sons, Nadav and Avihu, took each one his pan,<br>placed fire in them, put smoking-incense on it,<br>and brought near, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>, outside fire,<br>such as he had not commanded them."
Leviticus 10 2,"And fire went out from the presence of <small>YHWH</small><br>and consumed them, so that they died, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 10 3,"Moshe said to Aharon:<br>It is what <small>YHWH</small> spoke [about], saying:<br>Through those permitted-near to me, I will be-proven-holy,<br>before all the people, I will be-accorded-honor!<br>Aharon was silent."
Leviticus 10 4,"Now Moshe called Mishael and Eltzafan, the sons of Uzziel uncle of Aharon,<br>and said to them:<br>Come near, carry your brothers from in front of the Holy-Shrine to beyond the camp."
Leviticus 10 5,"They came near and carried them, by their tunics, beyond the camp,<br>as Moshe had spoken."
Leviticus 10 6,"Now Moshe said to Aharon and to Elazar and Itamar his sons:<br>Your heads, do not bare,<br>your garments, you are not to tear,<br>so that you do not die<br>and he be furious with the entire community!<br>Your brothers, the entire House of Israel, are to weep over the burning that <small>YHWH</small> caused-to-burn."
Leviticus 10 7,"And from the entrance to the Tent of Appointment, do not go out, lest you die,<br>for the oil of anointing of <small>YHWH</small> is upon you!<br>They did according to the word of Moshe."
Leviticus 10 8,"Now <small>YHWH</small> spoke to Aharon, saying:"
Leviticus 10 9,"Wine and beer, do not drink, you and your sons with you,<br>when you enter the Tent of Appointment,<br>so that you do not die—<br>a law for the ages, throughout your generations:"
Leviticus 10 10,"and so that there be-separation between the holy and the profane, between the <i>tamei</i> and the pure,"
Leviticus 10 11,and so that [you] might instruct the Children of Israel in all the laws that <small>YHWH</small> spoke to them through the hand of Moshe.
Leviticus 10 12,"Moshe spoke to Aharon and to Elazar and to Itamar, his sons that were left:<br>Take the grain-gift that is left of the fire-offerings of <small>YHWH</small><br>and eat it unleavened next to the altar,<br>for it is a holiest holy-portion."
Leviticus 10 13,"You are to eat it in a holy place,<br>for it is for your allotment and your sons’ allotment, from the fire-offerings of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>for thus have I been commanded."
Leviticus 10 14,"But the breast of the elevation-offering and the thigh of the contribution, you may eat in [any] pure place, you and your sons and your daughters with you,<br>for as your allotment and your children’s allotment they have been given [you], from the sacrifices of <i>shalom</i> of the Children of Israel."
Leviticus 10 15,"The thigh of the contribution and the breast of the elevation-offering, along with the gifts of the fat-parts, they are to bring to elevate as an elevation-offering before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>;<br>it is to be for you and for your sons with you as an allotment for the ages,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> has commanded."
Leviticus 10 16,"Now about the hairy-goat of <i>hattat</i> Moshe inquired, yes, inquired, and here: it had been burned!<br>And he became furious at Elazar and Itamar, the sons of Aharon that were left, saying:"
Leviticus 10 17,"For-what-reason did you not eat the <i>hattat</i>-offering in the place of the Holy-Shrine?<br>For it is a holiest holy-portion,<br>and he has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the community, to effect-purgation for them, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 10 18,"Here, its blood was not brought into the Holy-Shrine, inside;<br>you should have eaten, yes, eaten it in the Holy-Shrine, as I commanded!"
Leviticus 10 19,"But Aharon said to Moshe:<br>Here, today they brought-near their <i>hattat</i>-offering and their offering-up, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and such [things] as these have happened to me!<br>Had I eaten the <i>hattat</i>-offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of <small>YHWH</small>?"
Leviticus 10 20,"Moshe hearkened, and it was good in his eyes."
Leviticus 11 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying to them:"
Leviticus 11 2,"Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>These are the living-creatures that you may eat, from all the domestic-animals that are upon the earth:"
Leviticus 11 3,"any one having a hoof, cleaving a cleft in [its] hooves,<br>bringing up the cud, among the animals—<br>that-one you may eat."
Leviticus 11 4,"However, these you are not to eat<br>from those bringing up the cud, or from those having a hoof:<br>the camel, for it brings up the cud, but a hoof it does not have,<br>it is <i>tamei</i> for you;"
Leviticus 11 5,"the hyrax, for it brings up the cud, but a hoof it does not have,<br>it is <i>tamei</i> for you;"
Leviticus 11 6,"the hare, for it brings up the cud, but a hoof it does not have,<br>it is <i>tamei</i> for you;"
Leviticus 11 7,"the pig, for it has a hoof and cleaves a cleft in the hoof, but [as for] it—the cud it does not chew up,<br>it is <i>tamei</i> for you."
Leviticus 11 8,"From their flesh you are not to eat, their carcasses you are not to touch,<br>they are <i>tamei</i> for you!"
Leviticus 11 9,"These you may eat from all that are in the water:<br>any one that has fins and scales in the water, [whether] in the seas or in the streams,<br>them you may eat."
Leviticus 11 10,"But any one that does not have fins and scales,<br>[whether] in the seas or in the streams,<br>from all swarming-things in the water, from all living beings that are in the water—<br>they are detestable-things for you!"
Leviticus 11 11,"And they shall remain detestable-things for you:<br>from their flesh you are not to eat, their carcasses you are to detest."
Leviticus 11 12,Any one that does not have fins and scales in the water—<br>it is a detestable-thing for you!
Leviticus 11 13,"Now these you are to hold-detestable from birds<br>—they are not to be eaten, they are detestable-things:<br>the eagle, the bearded-vulture and the black-vulture,"
Leviticus 11 14,"the kite and the falcon after its kind,"
Leviticus 11 15,every [sort of] raven after its kind;
Leviticus 11 16,"the desert owl, the screech owl and the sea gull,<br>and the falcon after its kind;"
Leviticus 11 17,"the little-owl, the cormorant, and the great owl;"
Leviticus 11 18,"the barn-owl, the pelican, and the Egyptian-vulture;"
Leviticus 11 19,"the stork, the heron after to its kind,<br>the hoopoe and the bat."
Leviticus 11 20,Any flying swarming-creature that goes about on all fours—<br>it is a detestable-thing for you!
Leviticus 11 21,"However, these you may eat from any flying swarming-creature that goes about on all fours:<br>[those] that have jointed-legs above their feet, with which to leap on the earth;"
Leviticus 11 22,"as for these, from them you may eat:<br>the locust afterits kind, the bald-locust after its kind;<br>the cricket after its kind, the grasshopper after its kind."
Leviticus 11 23,"But every [other] flying swarming-creature that has four legs,<br>it is a detestable-thing for you!"
Leviticus 11 24,"Now from these you can become <i>tamei</i><br>—whoever touches their carcass shall be <i>tamei</i> until sunset,"
Leviticus 11 25,"whoever carries [any part] of their carcass is to scrub his garments, and remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset:"
Leviticus 11 26,"every animal that divides a divided-hoof, but cleaving does not cleave it through, and its cud does not bring up;<br>they are <i>tamei</i> for you,<br>whoever touches them is <i>tamei!</i>"
Leviticus 11 27,"And any one that goes about on its paws, among all animals that go about on all fours,<br>they are <i>tamei</i> for you,<br>whoever touches their carcass is <i>tamei</i> until sunset;"
Leviticus 11 28,"one who carries their carcass is to scrub one’s garments and remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset,<br>they are <i>tamei</i> for you."
Leviticus 11 29,"Now these are for you the ones <i>tamei</i><br>among the swarming-creatures that swarm on the earth:<br>the weasel, the mouse, and the great-lizard after its kind;"
Leviticus 11 30,"the gecko, the monitor and the lizard,<br>the sand-lizard and the chameleon."
Leviticus 11 31,"These are the ones <i>tamei</i> for you among all the swarming-creatures;<br>whoever touches them when they are dead shall be <i>tamei</i> until sunset,"
Leviticus 11 32,"anything upon which one of them should fall when they are dead shall be <i>tamei</i>,<br>whether any vessel of wood or cloth or skin or sackcloth<br>—any vessel that can be used in work—<br>it is to be put through water;<br>it remains-<i>tamei</i> until sunset,<br>and then it is pure."
Leviticus 11 33,"And [regarding] any earthen vessel into which one of them falls, within it,<br>everything within it shall be <i>tamei,</i><br>and it—you are to break [it]!"
Leviticus 11 34,"As for any food that might be eaten,<br>should water come in [contact with] it, it shall be <i>tamei;</i><br>and any beverage that might be drunk,<br>[if] in any vessel, it shall be <i>tamei</i>."
Leviticus 11 35,"Anything [else] on which their carcass falls shall be <i>tamei;</i><br>an oven or a two-pot-stove is to be demolished—<br>they are <i>tamei,</i><br>they shall remain <i>tamei</i> for you."
Leviticus 11 36,"However, a spring or a cistern [for] gathering water shall remain pure,<br>but one who touches their carcass shall be <i>tamei</i>."
Leviticus 11 37,"Now if [part] of their carcass falls upon any sowing seed that is to be sown,<br>it remains-pure."
Leviticus 11 38,"But if water is put on the seed and [part] of their carcass falls on it,<br>it is <i>tamei</i> for you."
Leviticus 11 39,"If there should die one of the animals that are [permitted] to you for eating,<br>one who touches its carcass shall remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset."
Leviticus 11 40,"And one who eats from its carcass is to scrub his garments, and remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset,<br>and one who carries its carcass is to scrub his garments, and remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset."
Leviticus 11 41,"Any swarming-creature that swarms upon the earth:<br>it is a detestable-thing, it is not to be eaten."
Leviticus 11 42,"Anything going about on its belly, anything going about on all fours, up to anything with many legs, among all swarming-creatures that swarm upon the earth:<br>you are not to eat them,<br>for they are detestable-things!"
Leviticus 11 43,"Do not make yourselves detestable through any swarming-thing that swarms;<br>you are not to make yourselves <i>tamei</i> through them, and so become <i>tamei</i> through them!"
Leviticus 11 44,"For I am <small>YHWH</small> your God:<br>you are to hallow yourselves and be holy,<br>for holy am I;<br>you are not to make yourselves <i>tamei</i> through any swarming-creature that crawls about upon the earth."
Leviticus 11 45,"For I am <small>YHWH</small>, the one bringing you up from the land of Egypt, to be God to you;<br>you are to be holy, for holy am I!"
Leviticus 11 46,"This is the Instruction [regarding] animals, birds and all living beings that stir in the water, all beings that swarm upon the earth,"
Leviticus 11 47,"that there may be-separation between the <i>tamei</i> and the pure,<br>between the living-creatures that may be eaten and the living-creatures that you are not to eat."
Leviticus 12 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 12 2,"Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>A woman—when she produces-seed and bears a male,<br>she remains-<i>tamei</i> for seven days;<br>like the days of her infirmity of discharge she shall remain-<i>tamei;</i>"
Leviticus 12 3,"and on the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin is to be circumcised."
Leviticus 12 4,"For thirty days and three days she is to stay in her period of blood purification;<br>any holy-thing she is not to touch, the Holy-Area she is not to enter,<br>until the fulfilling of the days of her purification."
Leviticus 12 5,"Now if [it is] a female [that] she bears,<br>she remains-<i>tamei</i> for two-weeks, like her [time of] discharge;<br>and for sixty days and six days she is to stay for [a period of] blood purification."
Leviticus 12 6,"And at the fulfilling of the days of her purification, for a son or for a daughter,<br>she is to bring a lamb, in its [first] year, as an offering-up,<br>and a young pigeon or a turtledove, as a <i>hattat</i>-offering,<br>to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment, to the priest."
Leviticus 12 7,"He is to bring it near, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>, and is to effect-purgation for her,<br>and she will be purified from her source of blood.<br>This is the Instruction [regarding] one giving-birth, [whether] to a male or to a female."
Leviticus 12 8,"But if her hand does not find enough [means] for a sheep,<br>she is to take two turtledoves or two young pigeons,<br>one for an offering-up and one for a <i>hattat</i>-offering;<br>when the priest effects-purgation for her,<br>then she is pure."
Leviticus 13 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:"
Leviticus 13 2,"[Any] person—when there is on the skin of his body a swelling or a scab or a shiny-spot<br>and it becomes on the skin of his body an affliction of <i>tzaraat,</i><br>he is to be brought to Aharon the priest or to one of his sons the priests."
Leviticus 13 3,"The priest is to look at the affliction on the skin of the flesh;<br>should hair in the afflicted-area have turned white, and the look of the affliction is deeper than the skin of his flesh,<br>it is an affliction of <i>tzaraat;</i><br>the priest is to look at it, and is to declare-him-<i>tamei</i>."
Leviticus 13 4,"Now if it is a white spot on the skin of his flesh, and deeper its look is not than the skin,<br>and the hair has not turned white,<br>the priest is to shut up the afflicted-one for seven days."
Leviticus 13 5,"The priest is to look at him on the seventh day,<br>and here, should the affliction be at a standstill in his eyes,<br>—the affliction not spread on the skin—<br>the priest is to shut him up for seven days a second time."
Leviticus 13 6,"The priest is to look at him on the seventh day a second time,<br>and here, should the affliction have faded, and the affliction has not spread on the skin,<br>the priest is to declare-him-pure<br>—it is [only] a scab—<br>when he scrubs his garments, he is pure."
Leviticus 13 7,"But if the scab has spread, yes, spread on the skin<br>after he has had the priest look at him, for declaring-him-pure,<br>he is to have the priest look at him a second time."
Leviticus 13 8,"The priest is to look, and here, should the scab have spread on the skin,<br>the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei&mdash;</i><br>it is <i>tzaraat!</i>"
Leviticus 13 9,"An affliction of <i>tzaraat</i>—when it shows on a human-being, and he is brought to the priest,"
Leviticus 13 10,"and the priest looks, and here, a white swelling is on the skin, and it has turned into white hair,<br>with a live-patch of “live” flesh in the swelling:"
Leviticus 13 11,"it is mature <i>tzaraat</i> in the skin of his body,<br>and the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei;</i><br>he is not to shut him up, for he is <i>tamei</i>."
Leviticus 13 12,"Now if the <i>tzaraat</i> sprouts, yes, sprouts on the skin<br>so that the <i>tzaraat</i> covers all the skin of the afflicted-one, from his head to his feet,<br>wherever the priest’s eyes look:"
Leviticus 13 13,"the priest is to look, and here, should the <i>tzaraat</i> have covered all his flesh,<br>he is to declare the afflicted-one pure<br>—all of it has turned white,<br>and he is pure!"
Leviticus 13 14,"But at the time of there reappearing on him live flesh, he is to be considered-<i>tamei</i>."
Leviticus 13 15,"When the priest looks at the live flesh, he is to declare-him-<i>tamei;</i><br>the live flesh—it is <i>tamei</i>, it is <i>tzaraat</i>."
Leviticus 13 16,"Or when the live flesh recurs and turns back to white,<br>he is to come to the priest;"
Leviticus 13 17,"the priest is to look at it, and here, should the affliction have turned back to white,<br>the priest is to declare the afflicted one pure&mdash;<br>he is pure."
Leviticus 13 18,"Now flesh—when there is in its skin a boil, and it heals,"
Leviticus 13 19,but there is in place of the boil a white swelling or a white [and] reddish shiny-spot:<br>he is to have the priest look at him.
Leviticus 13 20,"The priest is to look, and here, should its look be lower than the skin,<br>and its hair has turned white,<br>the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei;</i><br>it is an affliction of <i>tzaraat</i>, in the boil it has sprouted."
Leviticus 13 21,"But if the priest looks at it, and here, there is not in it any white hair,<br>and it is not lower than the skin, but it has faded,<br>the priest is to shut him up for seven days."
Leviticus 13 22,"Now if it should spread, yes, spread on the skin,<br>the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei</i>—<br>it is an affliction."
Leviticus 13 23,"But if, under it, the affliction is at-a-standstill, not having spread,<br>it is the inflammation of the boil;<br>the priest is to declare-him-pure."
Leviticus 13 24,"Or flesh—when there is on the skin a burn by fire<br>and on the live-patch of the burn is a shiny-spot, white [and] reddish, or white,"
Leviticus 13 25,"and the priest looks at it, and here, hair has turned white in the shiny-spot,<br>and its look is deeper than the skin,<br>it is <i>tzaraat</i>, in the burn it has sprouted;<br>the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei</i>—<br>it is an affliction of <i>tzaraat!</i>"
Leviticus 13 26,"But if the priest looks at it, and here, there is not in the bright-spot any white hair, and lower it is not than the skin, and it has faded,<br>the priest is to shut him up for seven days."
Leviticus 13 27,"Then the priest is to look at him on the seventh day:<br>if it has spread, yes, spread on the skin, the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei</i>—<br>it is an affliction of <i>tzaraat</i>."
Leviticus 13 28,"But if, under it, the shiny-spot is at-a-standstill&mdash;it has not spread on the skin, and it has faded&mdash;<br>it is a swelling from the burn;<br>the priest is to declare-him-pure,<br>for it is an inflammation from the burn."
Leviticus 13 29,Now a man or a woman—when they have an affliction on the head or on the [site of the] beard:
Leviticus 13 30,"and the priest looks at the affliction, and here, its look is deeper than the skin,<br>and in it there is thin yellow hair,<br>the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei</i>—<br>it is a scall, it is <i>tzaraat</i> of the head or of the beard."
Leviticus 13 31,"But when the priest looks at the affliction of the scall, and here, its look is not deeper than the skin,<br>and black hair there is none on it,<br>the priest is to shut up the one afflicted with the scall for seven days."
Leviticus 13 32,"Then the priest is to look at the affliction on the seventh day, and here, should the scall not have spread, and there is not in it [any] yellow hair,<br>and the look of the scall is not deeper than the skin,"
Leviticus 13 33,"he is to shave himself,<br>but the scall he is not to shave,<br>and the priest is to shut up the scall-bearer for seven days a second time."
Leviticus 13 34,"Then the priest is to look at the scall on the seventh day, and here, should the scall not have spread on the skin,<br>and its look is not deeper than the skin,<br>the priest is to declare-him-pure;<br>he is to scrub his garments, and then he is pure."
Leviticus 13 35,"But if the scall has spread, yes, spread on the skin, after his being-purified,"
Leviticus 13 36,"and the priest looks at him, and here, the scall has spread on the skin,<br>the priest need not examine [him] for the yellow hair;<br>he is <i>tamei</i>."
Leviticus 13 37,"Now if in his eyes the scall is at-a-standstill, and black hair has sprouted in it,<br>the scall has healed,<br>he is pure,<br>and the priest is to declare-him-pure."
Leviticus 13 38,"Now a man or a woman—<br>when there is in the skin of their flesh shiny-spots, white shiny-spots,"
Leviticus 13 39,"and the priest looks, and here, in the skin of their flesh [are] shiny-spots, faded [or] white,<br>it is a rash, it has sprouted on the skin,<br>he is pure."
Leviticus 13 40,"Now a man—when his head becomes smooth, he is bald,<br>he is pure."
Leviticus 13 41,"And if on the edge of his face his head becomes smooth, he is forehead-bald;<br>he is [still] pure."
Leviticus 13 42,"But when there is on the bald spot or on the forehead an affliction, white [and] reddish,<br>it is sprouting <i>tzaraat</i>, on his bald spot or on his forehead."
Leviticus 13 43,"The priest is to look at him, and here, [if] the swelling of the affliction is white [and] reddish, on his bald spot or on his forehead,<br>like the look of <i>tzaraat</i> on the skin of flesh:"
Leviticus 13 44,"he is a man with <i>tzaraat</i>, he is <i>tamei</i>;<br>[yes], <i>tamei</i>, <i>tamei</i> shall the priest [declare] him, on his head is his affliction."
Leviticus 13 45,"Now the one with <i>tzaraat</i> that has the affliction,<br>his garments are to be torn,<br>his head is to be made-bare,<br>and his upper-lip is to be covered;<br><i>Tamei! Tamei!</i> he is to cry out."
Leviticus 13 46,"All the days that the affliction is on him, he shall remain-<i>tamei;</i><br><i>tamei</i> is he,<br>alone shall he stay, outside of the camp is his staying-place."
Leviticus 13 47,"Now a cloth:<br>when there is on it an affliction of <i>tzaraat,</i><br>on a cloth of wool or a cloth of linen,"
Leviticus 13 48,"or in the woof or in the warp of the linen or of the wool,<br>or in an animal-skin or in anything worked of skin:"
Leviticus 13 49,"if the affliction is greenish or reddish on the cloth or the skin, or on the woof or on the warp, or in any vessel of skin,<br>it is an affliction of <i>tzaraat,</i><br>and he is to have the priest look at it."
Leviticus 13 50,"[When] the priest looks at the affliction,<br>he is to shut up the afflicted-item for seven days;"
Leviticus 13 51,"he is to look at the affliction on the seventh day;<br>if the affliction has spread on the cloth or on the woof or on the warp or on the skin,<br>for whatever might be done with the skin for work:<br>the affliction is acute <i>tzaraat,</i><br>it is <i>tamei</i>."
Leviticus 13 52,"It is to be burned, the cloth, or the woof or the warp in the wool or in the linen, or in any vessel of skin that has in it any affliction,<br>for it is acute <i>tzaraat,</i> in fire it is to be burned."
Leviticus 13 53,"But if the priest looks, and here, the affliction has not spread in the cloth<br>—whether in the woof or in the warp, or in any vessel of skin—"
Leviticus 13 54,"the priest is to command that they scrub that which contains the affliction,<br>and he is to shut it up for seven days a second time."
Leviticus 13 55,"The priest is to look, after the afflicted-thing has been scrubbed, and here,<br>should the affliction not have changed its aspect, the affliction not have spread—<br>it is <i>tamei,</i> in fire you are to burn it;<br>it is decay, on its “bald-spot” or on its “forehead.”"
Leviticus 13 56,"But if the priest looks, and here, the affliction has faded, after it has been scrubbed,<br>he is to tear it from the cloth or from the skin or from the woof or from the warp,"
Leviticus 13 57,"and if it is seen again on the cloth—whether in the woof or in the warp, or in any vessel of skin,<br>it is a sprouting-thing, in fire you are to burn it, anything in which there is the affliction."
Leviticus 13 58,"But the cloth or the woof or the warp or any vessel of skin that you have scrubbed, so that the affliction disappears from them,<br>when it is scrubbed a second time,<br>then it is pure."
Leviticus 13 59,"This is the Instruction [regarding] the affliction of <i>tzaraat</i> in cloth of wool or linen, or the warp or the woof, or any vessel of skin,<br>for declaring-it-purified or for declaring-it-<i>tamei</i>."
Leviticus 14 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 14 2,"This is to be the Instruction [regarding] the one-with-<i>tzaraat,</i> at the time of his being purified:<br>he is to be brought to the priest."
Leviticus 14 3,"The priest is to go outside the camp;<br>the priest is to look, and here, should the affliction of <i>tzaraat</i> have healed on the one-with-<i>tzaraat,</i>"
Leviticus 14 4,"the priest is to command that they take for the one-to-be-purified two birds, live, pure,<br>and wood of cedar and scarlet of the worm and hyssop."
Leviticus 14 5,"Then the priest is to command that they slaughter the one bird<br>in an earthen vessel, [held] above living water,"
Leviticus 14 6,"and the live bird—he is to take it, and the cedar wood, the scarlet of the worm and the hyssop,<br>and is to dip them and the live bird in the blood of the slaughtered bird, [held] above living water."
Leviticus 14 7,"Then he is to sprinkle [it] over the one-to-be-purified of <i>tzaraat</i> seven times, and declare-him-pure,<br>and is to send out the live bird into the open field."
Leviticus 14 8,"The one-being-purified is to scrub his garments, shave his entire [head of] hair and wash in water,<br>then he is pure;<br>afterward he may enter the camp,<br>and stay outside his tent for seven days."
Leviticus 14 9,"And it shall be on the seventh day: he is to shave all his hair—his head, his beard and his eyebrows,<br>all his body-hair he is to shave—<br>and scrub his garments and wash his flesh in water,<br>then he is pure."
Leviticus 14 10,"On the eighth day he is to take two lambs, wholly-sound, and one lamb in its [first] year, wholly-sound,<br>and three tenth-measures of flour as a grain-gift, mixed with oil, and one <i>log</i> of oil."
Leviticus 14 11,"The priest making-purification is to stand the man to-be-purified and them<br>before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>, at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment;"
Leviticus 14 12,"the priest is to take the one lamb and is to bring it near as an <i>asham</i>-offering, with the <i>log</i> of oil,<br>and is to elevate them as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 14 13,"Then he is to slaughter the lamb in the place where one slaughters the <i>hattat</i>-offering and the offering-up,<br>in a holy place,<br>for like the <i>hattat</i>-offering, the <i>asham</i>-offering is the priest’s,<br>it is a holiest holy-portion."
Leviticus 14 14,"Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the <i>asham</i><br>and the priest is to place it on the ridge of the right ear of the one-being-purified, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the thumb-toe of his right foot."
Leviticus 14 15,And the priest is to take some of the <i>log</i> of oil and is to pour it on the left palm of the priest.
Leviticus 14 16,"Then the priest is to dip his right finger in some of the oil that is on his left palm<br>and is to sprinkle some of the oil with his finger, seven times, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 14 17,"From the remainder of oil that is on his palm, the priest is to place some on the ridge of the right ear of the one-being-purified, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the thumb-toe of his right foot,<br>on top of the blood of the <i>asham</i>-offering."
Leviticus 14 18,"And what remains of the oil that is on the palm of the priest<br>he is to place upon the head of the one-being-purified;<br>then the priest is to effect-purgation for him, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 14 19,"Then the priest is to make the <i>hattat</i>-offering and is to effect-purgation for the one-being-purified from his <i>tum’a</i>,<br>and afterward he is to slaughter the offering-up."
Leviticus 14 20,"And the priest is to offer-up the offering-up and the grain-gift upon the altar,<br>and the priest is to effect-purgation for him;<br>then he is pure."
Leviticus 14 21,"But if he is poor and his hand does not reach [far],<br>he is to take one lamb as an <i>asham,</i> for elevating, for effecting-purgation for him,<br>and one tenth-measure of flour, mixed with oil, as a grain-gift, and a <i>log</i> of oil,"
Leviticus 14 22,"and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, [as far as] his hand can reach,<br>the one shall be the <i>hattat</i>-offering and the other, the offering-up."

Leviticus 14 33,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:"
Leviticus 14 34,"When you enter the land of Canaan, that I am giving you as a holding,<br>and I place an affliction of <i>tzaraat</i> on a house in the land of your holding,"
Leviticus 14 35,"there shall come the one whose house it is<br>and report to the priest, saying:<br>[Something] like an affliction has been seen by me on the house!"
Leviticus 14 36,"Then the priest is to command that the house be cleaned before the priest enters to look at the affliction,<br>so that nothing that is in the house becomes-<i>tamei;</i><br>after that the priest may enter to look at the house."
Leviticus 14 37,"He is to look at the affliction, and here, should the affliction be on the walls of the house [as] greenish or reddish eruptions,<br>with their look lower than the wall,"
Leviticus 14 38,"the priest is to go out of the house, to the entrance of the house,<br>and is to have the house shut up for seven days."
Leviticus 14 39,"The priest is to return on the seventh day,<br>and is to look, and here, should the affliction have spread on the walls of the house,"
Leviticus 14 40,"the priest is to command that they pull out the stones on which the affliction is<br>and throw them outside the city, into a <i>tamei</i> place;"
Leviticus 14 41,"the house someone shall scrape inside, all around,<br>and they are to pour the dried-mud that was scraped off outside the city, into a <i>tamei</i> place."
Leviticus 14 42,"Then they are to take other stones and bring them in place of the [original] stones,<br>other dried-mud they are to take, and are to replaster the house."
Leviticus 14 43,"Now if the affliction returns and sprouts in the house<br>after one has pulled out the stones,<br>and after the house’s being-scraped, and after its having-been-plastered,"
Leviticus 14 44,"the priest is to enter,<br>and look, and here, should the affliction have spread in the house,<br>it is acute <i>tzaraat</i> in the house, it is <i>tamei</i>."
Leviticus 14 45,"Then one is to demolish the house—its stones, its wood and all the dried-mud on the house,<br>and one is to take [it] outside the town, to a <i>tamei</i> place."
Leviticus 14 46,One who enters the house [during] all the days of its being shut up<br>is to remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset;

Leviticus 16 8,"Aharon is to place upon the two hairy [goats] lots,<br>one lot for <small>YHWH</small> and one lot for Azazel."
Leviticus 16 9,"Then Aharon is to bring near the hairy one for which the lot for <small>YHWH</small> came up,<br>and is to designate it as a <i>hattat</i>-offering,"
Leviticus 16 10,"and the hairy-one for which the lot of Azazel came up is to be left standing-alive, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>to effect-atonement upon it,<br>to send it away to Azazel into the wilderness."
Leviticus 16 11,"Then Aharon is to bring near the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering that is his,<br>and effect-atonement on behalf of himself and on behalf of his household;<br>he is to slaughter the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering that is his,"
Leviticus 16 12,"and is to take a panful of fiery coals from atop the altar, from before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and [two] fistfuls of fragrant-incense, finely-ground,<br>and is to bring [it] inside the curtain."
Leviticus 16 13,"Then he is to place the incense on the fire, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>so that the cloud [from] the incense covers the Purgation-Cover that is over the Testimony,<br>so that he does not die."
Leviticus 16 14,"Then he is to take [some] of the blood of the bull<br>and sprinkle [it] with his finger on the front of the Purgation-Cover<i>,</i> eastward,<br>and before the Purgation-Cover he is to sprinkle, seven times, some of the blood with his finger."
Leviticus 16 15,"Then he is to slaughter the hairy-goat of the <i>hattat</i>-offering that is the people’s,<br>and bring its blood inside the curtain,<br>doing with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull:<br>he is to sprinkle it on the Purgation-Cover<i>,</i> and before the Purgation-Cover."
Leviticus 16 16,"So he is to effect-purgation for the Holy-Shrine<br>from the <i>tum’ot</i> of the Children of Israel, from their transgressions, for all of their sins,<br>and thus he is to do with the Tent of Appointment, which dwells with them in the midst of their <i>tum’ot</i>."
Leviticus 16 17,"No human is to be in the Tent of Appointment when he enters it to effect-atonement in the Holy-Shrine, until he goes out.<br>He is to effect-atonement on behalf of himself and on behalf of his household, and on behalf of the entire assembly of Israel."

Leviticus 16 19,he is to sprinkle on it from [the rest of] the blood with his finger seven times;<br>he is to purify it and he is to hallow it<br>from the <i>tum’ot</i> of the Children of Israel.
Leviticus 16 20,"[When] he has finished purging the Holy-Shrine and the Tent of Appointment and the altar,<br>he is to bring near the live hairy [goat],"
Leviticus 16 21,"Aharon is to lean his two hands on the head of the live hairy [goat]<br>and is to confess over it<br>all the iniquities of the Children of Israel, all their transgressions, for all of their sins;<br>then he is to place them upon the head of the hairy [goat]<br>and is to send it free by the hand of a man for the occasion, into the wilderness."
Leviticus 16 22,"The hairy [goat] is to bear upon itself all their iniquities, to a land cut off;<br>he is to send free the hairy [goat] in the wilderness."
Leviticus 16 23,"Then Aharon is to enter the Tent of Appointment and is to strip off his linen garments in which he dressed when he entered the Holy-Shrine,<br>and is to leave them there;"
Leviticus 16 24,"then he is to wash his flesh in water, in a holy place, and is to dress in his garments,<br>he is to go out and make his offering-up and the offering-up of the people;<br>so shall he effect-atonement on behalf of himself and on behalf of the people."
Leviticus 16 25,And the fat of the <i>hattat</i>-offering he is to turn-into-smoke upon the altar.
Leviticus 16 26,Now the one who sent free the hairy [goat] for Azazel is to scrub his garments and wash his flesh in water;<br>after that he may reenter the camp.
Leviticus 16 27,"And the bull of <i>hattat</i> and the hairy [goat] of <i>hattat</i> whose blood was brought in to effect-purgation in the Holy-Shrine are to be taken outside the camp,<br>and in fire are to be burned their skins, their flesh, and their dung."
Leviticus 16 28,And [each] one who burns them is to scrub his garments and wash his flesh in water;<br>after that he may reenter the camp.
Leviticus 16 29,"And it shall be for you a law for the ages:<br>in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month,<br>you are to afflict your selves;<br>any-kind of work you are not to do—<br>[both] the native and the sojourner that sojourns in your midst."

Leviticus 22 10,"Any outsider is not to eat the holy-donation;<br>a settler [belonging] to a priest, or a hired-hand, is not to eat the holy-donation;"
Leviticus 22 11,"but a priest, when he purchases a person through his purchase of silver—he may eat of it,<br>and one born into his household, they may eat of his food."
Leviticus 22 12,"The daughter of a priest—when she belongs [in marriage] to a man, an outsider,<br>she—of the raised holy-donations she is not to eat."
Leviticus 22 13,"And the daughter of a priest—if she is a widow or a divorcée, and seed-offspring she has none,<br>when she returns to her father’s house, as in her youth, from her father’s food-offering she may eat,<br>and any outsider may not eat of it;"
Leviticus 22 14,"but a [lay]man—if he eats a holy-donation in error, he is to add its fifth to it, giving to the priest the holy-donation."
Leviticus 22 15,"They are not to profane the holy-donations of the Children of Israel, that they set aside for <small>YHWH</small>,"
Leviticus 22 16,"by causing them to bear iniquity [requiring an] <i>asham</i>-offering by eating their holy-donations,<br>for I am <small>YHWH</small>, the one-who-hallows you!"
Leviticus 22 17,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 22 18,"Speak to Aharon and to his sons and to all the Children of Israel,<br>and say to them:<br>Any-man, any-man of the House of Israel or of the sojourners in Israel<br>who brings near his near-offering—including any of their vow-offerings or including any of their freewill-offerings that they bring near to <small>YHWH</small>, as an offering-up—"
Leviticus 22 19,"for your acceptance<br>[they must be]: wholly-sound, male among the cattle, among the sheep or among goats;"
Leviticus 22 20,"any-one in whom is a defect, you are not to bring-near,<br>for not for acceptance will it be-considered on your behalf."
Leviticus 22 21,"A man—when he brings near a sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> to <small>YHWH</small>—<br>for making a vow-offering or for a freewill-offering—among the herd or among the flock:<br>wholly-sound must it be, for acceptance,<br>any defect there must not be in it."
Leviticus 22 22,"[One that is] blind or broken, or mutilated or [with] spotted-eye or scab or eruptions,<br>you are not to bring near [any of] these to <small>YHWH</small>;<br>a fire-offering you may not place from [any of] them, on the altar to <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 22 23,"But an ox or a sheep, [too] long-limbed or stunted,<br>you may make it as a freewill-offering,<br>but for a vow-offering it will not be accepted."
Leviticus 22 24,[One that is] bruised or smashed or torn-up or cut out [in the testicles]<br>you are not to bring-near to <small>YHWH</small>;<br>in your land these may not be made [as sacrifice].
Leviticus 22 25,"And from the hand of a foreigner you are not to bring-near the food of your God from any of these,<br>for their ruin is in them, a defect is in them;<br>they will not be accepted on your behalf!"
Leviticus 22 26,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 22 27,"An ox or a sheep or a goat, when it is born,<br>shall remain seven days under its mother,<br>and from the eighth day and forward it will be accepted as a near-offering, as a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 22 28,And an ox or a sheep—it and its young you are not to slaughter on one day.
Leviticus 22 29,"When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>for acceptance for you, you are to sacrifice it:"
Leviticus 22 30,on that day it is to be eaten&mdash;<br>you are not to let [any] of it remain until morning;<br>I am <small>YHWH</small>!

Leviticus 22 32,"You are not to profane my holy name,<br>that I may be hallowed amid the Children of Israel;<br>I am <small>YHWH</small>, the one-who-hallows you,"
Leviticus 22 33,"who is bringing you out of the land of Egypt, to be a God for you;<br>I am <small>YHWH</small>!"
Leviticus 23 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 23 2,"Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>The appointed-times of <small>YHWH</small>, which you are to proclaim to them [as] proclamations of holiness—<br>these are they, my appointed-times:"
Leviticus 23 3,"For six days may work be done,<br>but on the seventh day [is] Sabbath, Sabbath-Ceasing, a proclamation of holiness:<br>any-kind of work you are not to do.<br>It is Sabbath to <small>YHWH</small>, throughout all your settlements."
Leviticus 23 4,"These are the appointed-times of <small>YHWH</small>, proclamations of holiness, which you are to proclaim at their appointed-times:"
Leviticus 23 5,"in the first month, on the fourteenth of the month, between the setting-times<br>[is] Passover to <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 23 6,"And on the fifteenth day of this month<br>[is] the pilgrimage-festival of <i>Matzot</i> to <small>YHWH</small>:<br>for seven days, <i>matzot</i> you are to eat!"
Leviticus 23 7,On the first day<br>a proclamation of holiness shall there be for you;<br>any-kind of servile work you are not to do.
Leviticus 23 8,"You are to bring near a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small>, for seven days;<br>on the seventh day [is] a proclamation of holiness:<br>any-kind of servile work you are not to do."
Leviticus 23 9,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 23 10,"Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>When you enter the land that I am giving you,<br>and you harvest its harvest,<br>you are to bring the premier sheaf of your harvest to the priest."
Leviticus 23 11,"He is to elevate the sheaf before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>, for acceptance for you;<br>on the morrow of the Sabbath the priest is to elevate it."
Leviticus 23 12,"You are to make [as sacrifice] on the day of your elevating the sheaf:<br>a sheep, wholly-sound, in its [first] year, as an offering-up to <small>YHWH</small>,"
Leviticus 23 13,"and its grain-gift: two tenth-measures of flour mixed with oil, a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small>, of soothing savor;<br>and its poured-offering of wine: a fourth of a <i>hin.</i>"
Leviticus 23 14,"Now bread or parched-grain or groats, you are not to eat, until that same day,<br>until you have brought the near-offering of your God—<br>[it is] a law for the ages, into your generations, throughout all your settlements."
Leviticus 23 15,"And you are to number for yourselves, from the morrow of the Sabbath, from the day that you bring the elevated sheaf,<br>seven Sabbaths-of-days,<br>whole [weeks] are they to be;"
Leviticus 23 16,"until the morrow of the seventh Sabbath you are to number—fifty days,<br>then you are to bring near a grain-gift of new-crops to <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 23 17,"From your settlements you are to bring bread as an elevation-offering,<br>two [loaves of] two tenth-measures of flour are they to be,<br>leavened you are to bake them,<br>as firstfruits to <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 23 18,"And you are to bring near along with the bread seven sheep, wholly-sound, a year old,<br>and one bull, a young of the herd, and rams, two;<br>they shall be an offering-up for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>with their grain-gift and their poured-offerings,<br>a fire-offering of soothing savor to <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 23 19,"And you are to make [as sacrifice]: one hairy goat for a <i>hattat,</i><br>and two sheep, a year old, for a sacrifice of <i>shalom</i>."
Leviticus 23 20,"The priest is to elevate them, together with the bread of the firstfruits<br>as an elevation-offering before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>together with the two sheep;<br>they shall be a holy-portion for <small>YHWH</small>, for the priest."
Leviticus 23 21,"And you are to make-proclamation on that same day;<br>a proclamation of holiness shall there be for you:<br>any-kind of servile work you are not to do—<br>a law for the ages, throughout your settlements, into your generations."
Leviticus 23 22,"Now when you harvest the harvest of your land,<br>you are not to finish-off the edge of your field when you harvest [it],<br>the full-gleaning of your harvest you are not to glean;<br>for the afflicted and for the sojourner you are to leave them,<br>I am <small>YHWH</small> your God!"
Leviticus 23 23,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 23 24,"Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>In the seventh month, on [day] one of the month,<br>you are to have Sabbath-ceasing,<br>a reminder by [horn-]blasting, a proclamation of holiness."
Leviticus 23 25,Any-kind of servile work you are not to do;<br>you are to bring near a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small>.
Leviticus 23 26,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 23 27,"Mark, on the tenth of this seventh month,<br>it is the Day of Atonement;<br>a proclamation of holiness shall there be for you.<br>You are to afflict your selves,<br>and you are to bring-near a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small>;"
Leviticus 23 28,"any-kind of work you are not to do on that same day,<br>for it is the Day of Atonement, to effect-atonement for you before the presence of <small>YHWH</small> your God."
Leviticus 23 29,"Indeed, if any person does not afflict-himself on that same day,<br>he is to be cut-off from his kinspeople,"
Leviticus 23 30,and if any person does any-kind of work on that same day—<br>I will cause that person to perish from amid his kinspeople!
Leviticus 23 31,"Any-kind of work you are not to do—<br>a law for the ages, into your generations, throughout all your settlements."
Leviticus 23 32,"It is Sabbath, a Sabbath-ceasing for you,<br>you are to afflict your selves;<br>on the ninth of the month, at sunset,<br>from sunset to sunset, you are to make-a-ceasing of your ceasing!"
Leviticus 23 33,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 23 34,"Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>On the fifteenth day of this seventh month:<br>the pilgrimage-festival of Huts, for seven days, to <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 23 35,On the first day [is] a proclamation of holiness:<br>any-kind of servile work you are not to do.
Leviticus 23 36,"For seven days you are to bring near a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small>;<br>on the eighth day, a proclamation of holiness shall there be for you;<br>you are to bring near a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small><br>—it is [a day of] Restraint:<br>any-kind of servile work you are not to do."
Leviticus 23 37,"These are the appointed-times of <small>YHWH</small>, which you are to proclaim as proclamations of holiness,<br>to bring near fire-offerings to <small>YHWH</small>—offering-up, grain-gift, sacrifice and pour-offerings,<br>each-day’s protocol in its day,"
Leviticus 23 38,"aside from the Sabbaths of <small>YHWH</small>, aside from your presents,<br>aside from all your vow-offerings and aside from all your freewill-offerings that you give to <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 23 39,"Mark, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month,<br>when you have gathered in the produce of the land,<br>you are to celebrate-as-pilgrimage the pilgrimage-festival of <small>YHWH</small>, for seven days:<br>on the first day [is] a Sabbath-ceasing and on the eighth day [is] a Sabbath-ceasing."
Leviticus 23 40,"You are to take yourselves, on the first day, the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palms,<br>and boughs of thick tree-foliage, and willows of the brook.<br>And you are to rejoice before the presence of <small>YHWH</small> your God for seven days;"
Leviticus 23 41,"you are to celebrate-it-as pilgrimage, a pilgrimage-festival to <small>YHWH</small>, for seven days a year—<br>a law for the ages, throughout your generations:<br>in the seventh month you are to celebrate-it-as-pilgrimage"
Leviticus 23 42,"—in huts you are to stay for seven days,<br>every native in Israel is to stay in huts—"
Leviticus 23 43,in order that your generations may know that in huts I had the Children of Israel stay<br>when I brought them out of the land of Egypt;<br>I am <small>YHWH</small> your God!
Leviticus 23 44,So Moshe declared the appointed-times of <small>YHWH</small> to the Children of Israel.
Leviticus 24 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 24 2,"Command the Children of Israel,<br>that they take you oil of olives, clear, beaten, for lighting,<br>to draw up lampwicks, regularly."
Leviticus 24 3,"Outside the Curtain of the Testimony, in the Tent of Appointment, Aharon is to arrange it,<br>from sunset to daybreak, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>, regularly—<br>a law for the ages, throughout your generations."
Leviticus 24 4,"On the pure lampstand he is to arrange the lampwicks, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>, regularly."
Leviticus 24 5,You are to take flour and are to bake it [into] twelve loaves;<br>two tenth-measures shall be the one loaf.
Leviticus 24 6,"You are to put them [into] two arranged-rows, six per row,<br>on the pure table, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 24 7,"And you are to place on [each] row clear frankincense;<br>it shall be for the bread as a reminder-portion, a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 24 8,"Sabbath day [by] Sabbath day he is to arrange it before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>, regularly,<br>from the Children of Israel as a covenant for the ages."
Leviticus 24 9,"They are to be Aharon’s and his sons’;<br>they are to eat them in a holy place,<br>for they are a holiest holy-portion for him, from the fire-offerings of <small>YHWH</small>—an allotment for the ages."
Leviticus 24 10,"Now the son of an Israelite woman went out<br>—he was [also] the son of an Egyptian man—<br>amid the Children of Israel;<br>and they scuffled in the camp,<br>the son of the Israelite-woman and a [fully] Israelite man."
Leviticus 24 11,"Now the son of the Israelite woman reviled the Name, and insulted [it],<br>so they brought him to Moshe<br>—now the name of his mother [was] Shelomit daughter of Divri, of the tribe of Dan—"
Leviticus 24 12,"and they put him under guard, to clarify it for them by order of <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 24 13,"And <small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 24 14,"Take out the insulter, outside the camp,<br>let all those who heard [the curse] lean their hands on his head<br>and let the entire community pelt him!"
Leviticus 24 15,"And to the Children of Israel you are to speak, saying:<br>Anyone, anyone who insults his god—<br>he shall bear his sin!"
Leviticus 24 16,"But whoever blasphemes the name of <small>YHWH</small><br>is to be put to death, yes, death,<br>the entire community is to pelt, yes, pelt him;<br>as the sojourner, so the native,<br>when he reviles the Name, he is to be put to death!"
Leviticus 24 17,"Now a man—when he strikes down any human life,<br>he is to be put to death, yes, death!"
Leviticus 24 18,"One who strikes the life of an animal is to pay for it, life in place of life."
Leviticus 24 19,"And a man—when he causes a defect in his fellow:<br>as he has done, thus is to be done to him—"
Leviticus 24 20,"break in place of break, eye in place of eye, tooth in place of tooth;<br>as he has caused a defect in [another] human, thus is to be caused in him."
Leviticus 24 21,"Whoever strikes down an animal is to pay for it,<br>but one who strikes down a human is to be put to death."
Leviticus 24 22,"One standard-of-judgment shall there be for you;<br>as the sojourner, so shall the native be,<br>for I am <small>YHWH</small> your God!"
Leviticus 24 23,"Thus spoke Moshe to the Children of Israel.<br>They took out the insulter, outside the camp<br>and they pelted him with stones;<br>so the Children of Israel did as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Leviticus 25 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe at Mount Sinai, saying:"
Leviticus 25 2,"Speak to the Children of Israel, and say to them:<br>When you enter the land that I am giving you,<br>the land is to cease, a Sabbath-ceasing to <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 25 3,"For six years you are to sow your field,<br>for six years you are to prune your vineyard,<br>then you are to gather in its produce,"
Leviticus 25 4,"but in the seventh year<br>there shall be a Sabbath of Sabbath-ceasing for the land,<br>a Sabbath to <small>YHWH</small>:<br>your field you are not to sow,<br>your vineyard you are not to prune,"
Leviticus 25 5,"the aftergrowth of your harvest you are not to harvest,<br>the grapes of your consecrated-vines you are not to amass;<br>a year of Sabbath-ceasing shall there be for the land!"
Leviticus 25 6,"Now the Sabbath-yield of the land is for you, for eating,<br>for you, for your servant and for your handmaid,<br>for your hired-hand and for your resident-settler who sojourn with you;"
Leviticus 25 7,"and for your domestic-animal and the wild-beast that are in your land<br>shall be all its produce, to eat."
Leviticus 25 8,"Now you are to number yourselves seven Sabbath-cycles of years<br>—seven years, seven times—<br>so the time of the seven Sabbath-cycles of years will be for you [a total of] nine and forty years."
Leviticus 25 9,"Then you are to give-forth a blast [on the] <i>shofar</i>;<br>in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month, on the Day of Atonement,<br>you are to give[-blast on the] <i>shofar</i> throughout all your land."
Leviticus 25 10,"You are to hallow the year, the fiftieth year,<br>and proclaim freedom throughout the land and to all its inhabitants;<br>it shall be Homebringing for you:<br>you are to return, each-man to his holding,<br>each-man to his clan you are to return."
Leviticus 25 11,"It is Homebringing, the fiftieth year—it shall be [thus] for you:<br>you are not to sow,<br>you are not to harvest its aftergrowth,<br>you are not to gather its consecrated-grapes,"
Leviticus 25 12,"for it is Homebringing, holy shall it be for you,&mdash;<br>[only] from the field may you eat its produce;"
Leviticus 25 13,"in this Year of Homebringing you are to return, each-man to his holding."
Leviticus 25 14,"Now when you sell property-for-sale to your fellow<br>or purchase [it] from the hand of your fellow,<br>do not maltreat, any-man, his brother!"
Leviticus 25 15,"By the number of years after the Homebringing<br>you are to purchase [it] from your fellow,<br>by the number of years of produce [left] he is to sell it to you:"
Leviticus 25 16,"according to the many years [left], you may charge-him-much for his purchase,<br>according to the few years [left], you may charge-him-little for his purchase,<br>since a [certain] number of harvests is what he is selling to you."
Leviticus 25 17,"So you are not to maltreat any-man his fellow,<br>rather, you are to hold your God in awe,<br>for I am <small>YHWH</small> your God!"
Leviticus 25 18,"You are to observe my laws,<br>my regulations you are to keep, and observe them,<br>that you may be settled on the land in security,"
Leviticus 25 19,"that the land may give forth its fruit<br>and that you may eat to being-satisfied,<br>and be settled in security upon it."
Leviticus 25 20,"Now if you should say [to yourselves]:<br>What are we to eat in the seventh year?<br>—[for] here, we may not sow, we may not gather our produce!"
Leviticus 25 21,Then I will dispatch my blessing for you during the sixth year<br>so that it yields produce for three years;
Leviticus 25 22,"you may sow the eighth year[’s yield], but you must eat of the old produce until the ninth year;<br>until its produce comes in, you must eat what-is-old."
Leviticus 25 23,"But the land is not to be sold in-harness, for the land is mine&mdash;<br>for you are sojourners and resident-settlers with me;"
Leviticus 25 24,"throughout all the land of your holdings, you are to allow for redemption of the land."
Leviticus 25 25,"When your brother sinks down [in poverty] and has to sell some of his holding,<br>his redeemer nearest-in-kin to him is to come<br>and redeem the sold-property of his brother."
Leviticus 25 26,"Now a man—if he has no redeemer,<br>but his hand reaches [means] and finds enough to redeem with,"
Leviticus 25 27,"he is to reckon the years since its sale,<br>and return the surplus to the man to whom he sold it,<br>and it is to return to his holding."
Leviticus 25 28,"But if his hand does not find enough [means] for returning it,<br>what he sold is to remain in the hand of the one purchasing it, until the Year of Homebringing;<br>it is to go-free in the Homebringing-Year, and it is to return to his holding."
Leviticus 25 29,"A man—if he sells a residential house in a walled town,<br>its redemption-period until the end of the year of its sale;<br>a year-of-days shall be its redemption-period."
Leviticus 25 30,"If it is not redeemed before a whole year of it has been fulfilled,<br>the house that is in the town that has a wall shall be established, in-harness, for him who purchases it, throughout his generations;<br>it is not to go-free in the Homebringing-Year."
Leviticus 25 31,"But houses in villages that do not have a wall around them,<br>as open-fields of the land are they to be reckoned;<br>there may be redemption for them,<br>and in the Homebringing-Year they may go free."
Leviticus 25 32,"Now [as for] the towns of the Levites, the houses in the towns of their holding—<br>redemption-right for the ages is to belong to the Levites."
Leviticus 25 33,"[That] which is redeemed from the Levites:<br>it is to go free, the house sold in the town of their holding, in the Homebringing-Year,<br>for houses of Levitical towns, they are their holding amid the Children of Israel."
Leviticus 25 34,"But pasture-land of the field [near] their towns is not to be sold,<br>for it is a holding for the ages for them."
Leviticus 25 35,"Now when your brother sinks down [in poverty]<br>and his hand falters beside you,<br>then shall you hold him<br>as [though] a sojourner and resident-settler,<br>and he is to live beside you."
Leviticus 25 36,"Do not take from him biting-interest or profit,<br>but hold your God in awe,<br>that your brother may live beside you!"
Leviticus 25 37,"Your silver you are not to give him at interest,<br>for profit you are not to give [him] your food;"
Leviticus 25 38,"I <small>YHWH</small> am your God<br>who brought you out of the land of Egypt<br>to give you the land of Canaan,<br>to be a God for you!"
Leviticus 25 39,"And when your brother sinks down [in poverty] beside you, and sells himself to you,<br>you are not to make him serve the servitude of a serf&mdash;"
Leviticus 25 40,"as a hired-hand, as a resident-settler is he to be beside you;<br>[only] until the Year of Homebringing is he to serve beside you."
Leviticus 25 41,"Then he is to go-free from beside you,<br>he and his children beside him;<br>he may return to his clan,<br>and to the holding of his fathers he may return."
Leviticus 25 42,For my servants are they<br>whom I brought out of the land of Egypt;<br>they are not to be sold as the sale of serfs.
Leviticus 25 43,"You are not to dominate him with crushing-labor;<br>rather, you are to hold your God in awe!"
Leviticus 25 44,"Your servant and your maid that belong to you from the nations surrounding you, from them you may purchase serf and maid;"
Leviticus 25 45,"also from the sons of the residents who sojourn beside you, from them you may purchase [slaves],<br>or from their clans that are beside you, that they beget in your land,<br>and they shall become your holdings."
Leviticus 25 46,"You may keep-them-as-an-inheritance for your children after you,<br>for [them to] possess as holdings;<br>for the ages you may make them serve you.<br>But among your brothers, the Children of Israel, each one toward his brother,<br>you are not to dominate him with crushing-labor!"
Leviticus 25 47,"Now if the hand of a resident sojourner reaches [means] beside you,<br>and your brother sinks down [in poverty] beside him,<br>so that he sells himself to the resident sojourner beside you, or to an offshoot of the sojourner’s clan,"
Leviticus 25 48,"[even] after he has sold himself, redemption may be his;<br>one of his brothers may redeem him,"
Leviticus 25 49,"or his uncle or the son of his uncle may redeem him,<br>or a blood-relation of his flesh, from his clan, may redeem him,<br>or, should his hand reach [means], he may redeem-himself."
Leviticus 25 50,He is to reckon with his purchaser from the year that he was sold to him until the Year of Homebringing;<br>the silver from his sale shall be by the number of years—<br>like the time-period of a hired-hand is he to be beside him.
Leviticus 25 51,"If there are still many years [left],<br>according to them he is to return-payment for his redemption from the silver of his purchase;"
Leviticus 25 52,"and if few remain in years until the Year of Homebringing,<br>he is to reckon it to him&mdash;<br>according to its years he is to return-payment for his redemption."
Leviticus 25 53,"As a hired-hand, year by year, he is to be beside him;<br>he is not to dominate him with crushing-labor before your eyes."
Leviticus 25 54,"And if he has not been redeemed in [any of] these [ways],<br>he is to go free in the Year of Homebringing, he and his children beside him."
Leviticus 25 55,"For it is to me that the Children of Israel are servants&mdash;<br>my servants are they,<br>whom I brought out of the land of Egypt,<br>I am <small>YHWH</small> your God!"
Leviticus 26 1,"You are not to make for yourselves no-gods,<br>a carved-image or a standing-pillar you are not to establish for yourselves,<br>a decorated stone you are not to place in your land, to bow down to it,<br>for I <small>YHWH</small> am your God!"
Leviticus 26 2,"My Sabbaths you are to keep, my Holy-Shrine you are to hold-in-awe;<br>I am <small>YHWH</small>!"
Leviticus 26 3,"If by my laws you walk, and my commands you keep, and observe them,"
Leviticus 26 4,"then I will give-forth your rains in their set-time,<br>so that the earth gives-forth its yield<br>and the trees of the field give-forth their fruit."
Leviticus 26 5,"Threshing will overtake vintage for you, and vintage will overtake sowing;<br>you shall eat your food to being-satisfied, and be settled in security in your land."
Leviticus 26 6,"I will give peace throughout the land, so that you will lie down with none to make you tremble,<br>I will cause-to-cease wild beasts from the land, and a sword shall not cross through your land."
Leviticus 26 7,"You shall pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you to the sword;"
Leviticus 26 8,"five of you will pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you, a myriad pursue,<br>and your enemies will fall before you to the sword."
Leviticus 26 9,"I will turn-my-face toward you, make-you-fruitful and make-you-many,<br>and I will establish my covenant with you."
Leviticus 26 10,"You will eat old-grain, the oldest-stored,<br>and the old for the new you will have to clear out."
Leviticus 26 11,"I will place my Dwelling in your midst,<br>and I will not repel you."
Leviticus 26 12,"I will walk about in your midst,<br>and I will be a God for you, and you yourselves will be a people for me."
Leviticus 26 13,"I <small>YHWH</small> am your God<br>who brought you out of the land of Egypt,<br>from your being serfs to them;<br>I broke the bars of your yoke, enabling you to walk upright!"
Leviticus 26 14,"But if you do not hearken to me, and do not observe all these commandments,"
Leviticus 26 15,"if my laws you spurn, and if my regulations you repel<br>by not observing all my commandments, by your violating my covenant,"
Leviticus 26 16,"I in turn will do this to you:<br>I will mete out shock to you,<br>and consumption, and fever,<br>wearing out the eyes and exhausting the breath;<br>and you will sow your seed for naught, for your enemies will eat it."
Leviticus 26 17,"And I will set my face against you, you will be hit-by-plague in the face of your enemies;<br>those who hate you will dominate you,<br>you will flee, with no one pursuing you!"
Leviticus 26 18,"Now if, after all that, you do not hearken to me,<br>I will continue to discipline you, sevenfold, for your sins—"
Leviticus 26 19,"I will break your fierce pride!<br>I will give your heavens to be like iron, and your earth like bronze,"
Leviticus 26 20,"so that your power will be spent for naught;<br>your land will not give forth its yield,<br>the trees of the land will not give forth their fruit."
Leviticus 26 21,"Now if you walk with me [in] opposition, and do not consent to hearken to me,<br>I will continue against you blows, sevenfold, according to your sins—"
Leviticus 26 22,"I will send loose against you the wild-beasts of the field,<br>so that they bereave you,<br>so that they [utterly] cut off your animals,<br>so that they make you few, and your roads become desolate."
Leviticus 26 23,"Now if, after these-things, you do not accept-discipline from me,<br>but [continue to] walk with me [in] opposition,"
Leviticus 26 24,"I will walk with you, I myself, with opposition;<br>I will strike you, yes, I myself, sevenfold for your sins:"
Leviticus 26 25,"I will bring against you an avenging sword, taking-vengeance for the covenant.<br>Should you gather yourselves into your cities,<br>I will send-free pestilence in your midst,<br>and you will be given into the hand of your enemies."
Leviticus 26 26,"When I break the “staff of bread” for you, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven;<br>they will return your bread by weight,<br>and you will eat, but you will not be satisfied."
Leviticus 26 27,"And if after this you will not hearken to me,<br>but [still] walk with me with opposition,"
Leviticus 26 28,"I will walk with you in the heat of opposition;<br>I will discipline you, even I myself, sevenfold for your sins!"
Leviticus 26 29,"You will eat the flesh of your sons,<br>and the flesh of your daughters, you will eat!"
Leviticus 26 30,"I will wipe out your sanctuaries and and cut down your cult-stands,<br>I will place your corpses atop the corpses of your Illicit-Things<br>and I will repel you."
Leviticus 26 31,"I will make your cities a wasteland,<br>I will make-desolate your holy-shrines,<br>and I will not savor your soothing savors!"
Leviticus 26 32,"And I, I myself, will make the land desolate,<br>so that your enemies that settle in it will be appalled-at-the-desolation in it."
Leviticus 26 33,"And you I will scatter among the nations;<br>I will unsheath the sword against you,<br>so that your land becomes a desolation and your cities become a wasteland."
Leviticus 26 34,"Then the land will find-acceptance regarding its Sabbaths,<br>all the days of desolation—when you are in the land of your enemies—<br>then the land will enjoy-cessation, and find-acceptance regarding its Sabbaths."
Leviticus 26 35,"All the days of desolation it will enjoy-cessation,<br>since it did not enjoy-cessation during its Sabbaths when you were settled on it."
Leviticus 26 36,"Now those that remain among you—I will bring faintness into their hearts, in the lands of their enemies,<br>they will be set-in-pursuit by the sound of a leaf blown about,<br>they will flee as if in flight from a sword and will fall, though there is no pursuer!"
Leviticus 26 37,"They will stumble, each-man over his brother, as before the sword, though pursuer there is none.<br>And you will not be able to stand-your-ground before your enemies;"
Leviticus 26 38,"rather, you will perish among the nations—<br>it will devour you, the land of your enemies."
Leviticus 26 39,"Those that remain among you will rot away in their iniquity, in the lands of their enemies;<br>yes, because of the iniquities of their fathers, with them they shall rot away."
Leviticus 26 40,"Now should they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, in their breaking-faith by which they broke-faith with me<br>—yes, since they have walked with me in opposition,"
Leviticus 26 41,"yes, I myself will walk with them in opposition,<br>and will bring them into the land of their enemies—<br>if then their foreskinned heart should humble itself,<br>if then they should find-acceptance regarding their iniquity,"
Leviticus 26 42,"I will bear-in-mind my Yaakov covenant,<br>and yes, my Yitzhak covenant, and yes, my Avraham covenant I will bear-in-mind, and the land I will bear-in-mind."
Leviticus 26 43,"—The land will have to be left behind by them, attaining-acceptance through its Sabbaths by being-desolate-of them,<br>and they will have to find-acceptance regarding their iniquity,<br>because, because my regulations they spurned, and my laws they repelled.—"
Leviticus 26 44,"And yes, even then, when they are in the land of their enemies, <br>I will not spurn them, I will not repel them, to finish them off, to abrogate my covenant with them,<br>for I <small>YHWH</small> am their God!"
Leviticus 26 45,"I will bear-in-mind to their [benefit] the covenant of the former-ones<br>whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, before the eyes of the nations,<br>to be a God for them;<br>I am <small>YHWH</small>!"
Leviticus 26 46,"These are the laws, the regulations, and the instructions<br>that <small>YHWH</small> gave between himself and the Children of Israel at Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moshe."
Leviticus 27 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Leviticus 27 2,"Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>Anyone—when one would make a vow-offering<br>in your assessed-equivalent of persons to <small>YHWH</small>,"
Leviticus 27 3,"your assessment shall be:<br>[if] a male, from the age of twenty years up to the age of sixty years,<br>your assessment shall be fifty silver <i>shekels</i> by the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel.</i>"
Leviticus 27 4,"And if it is a female, your assessment shall be thirty <i>shekels.</i>"
Leviticus 27 5,"If the age [is] from five years up to the age of twenty years,<br>your assessment for a male is twenty <i>shekels</i>, and for a female, ten <i>shekels.</i>"
Leviticus 27 6,"If from the age of a month up to the age of five years,<br>your assessment is for a male, five silver <i>shekels,</i> and for a female, your assessment, three silver <i>shekels.</i>"
Leviticus 27 7,"If from the age of sixty years and upward,<br>if a male, your assessment shall be fifteen <i>shekels,</i> and for a female, ten <i>shekels.</i>"
Leviticus 27 8,"If he sinks down [in poverty], lower than the assessment,<br>he is to be stood before the priest,<br>and the priest is to assess [the amount] for him;<br>according to what the hand of the one-making-the-vow can reach, the priest is to assess him."
Leviticus 27 9,"If [it concerns] an animal from which they bring near a near-offering for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>all of what he gives from it to <small>YHWH</small> is to be a holy-portion."
Leviticus 27 10,"He is not to substitute for it and he is not to exchange it, good for ill or ill for good;<br>if they exchange, yes, exchange animal for animal,<br>it will be that it and its exchanged-one will be a holy-portion."
Leviticus 27 11,"If it [concerns] any <i>tamei</i> animal from which there may not be brought near a near-offering for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>the animal is to be stood before the priest,"
Leviticus 27 12,"and the priest is to make-assessment for it, between good and ill,<br>according to your assessment by the priest, thus shall it be."
Leviticus 27 13,"And if he [wants to] redeem, yes, redeem it,<br>he is to add its fifth-part to your assessment."
Leviticus 27 14,"Now a man—when he hallows his house as holy-property to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>the priest is to assess it, between good and ill;<br>as the priest assesses it, thus shall [its cost] be-established."
Leviticus 27 15,"And if the one-who-hallows-it would redeem his house,<br>he is to add a fifth-part [to the] silver of your assessment,<br>and it shall remain his."
Leviticus 27 16,"If from the field of his holding any-man hallows [part] to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>your assessment shall be according to its seed-requirement:<br>the seed-requirement of a <i>homer</i> of barley, fifty silver <i>shekels.</i>"
Leviticus 27 17,"If as of the year of Homebringing he hallows his field, as your assessment [its cost] will be-established."
Leviticus 27 18,"but if it is after the Homebringing that he hallows his field,<br>the priest is to reckon for him the silver according to the years left until the Year of Homebringing,<br>and it is to be subtracted from your [first] assessment."
Leviticus 27 19,"If he wants to redeem, yes, redeem the field, the one hallowing it,<br>he is to add a fifth-part of the silver of your assessment of it, and [its cost] is to be-established for him."
Leviticus 27 20,"But if he does not want to redeem the field,<br>or if he has sold the land to another man,<br>it cannot be redeemed again—"
Leviticus 27 21,"the field shall be, when it goes-free in the Homebringing, a holy-portion for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>like a field specially-devoted;<br>for the priest it shall be, as his holding."
Leviticus 27 22,"And if his purchased field that is not a field of his holding [is what] he hallows to <small>YHWH</small>,"
Leviticus 27 23,"the priest is to reckon for him the value of your assessment, until the Year of Homebringing,<br>he is to give your assessment [in payment] at that time,<br>as a holy-portion for <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 27 24,"In the Year of Homebringing the field shall return to the one from whom it was purchased,<br>the one whose holding of land it is."
Leviticus 27 25,"All your assessments are to be according to the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel,</i><br>twenty grains being the [one] <i>shekel.</i>"
Leviticus 27 26,"However, a firstborn that is assigned-as-firstborn to <small>YHWH</small>, among animals—<br>no man may hallow it;<br>whether ox or sheep, it is <small>YHWH’S</small>."
Leviticus 27 27,"Now if [it is] of a <i>tamei</i> animal, he is to redeem it at your assessment,<br>and add its fifth-part to it,<br>and if it is not redeemed, it is to be sold at your assessment."
Leviticus 27 28,"However, everything specially-devoted that a man devotes for <small>YHWH</small> from all that is his,<br>whether of man or of beast or of field of his holding,<br>is not to be sold and not to be redeemed;<br>everything specially-devoted—it is a holiest holy-portion for <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 27 29,"Anyone specially-devoted that has been devoted-to-destruction, among humans, is not to be ransomed;<br>he is to be put to death, yes, death."
Leviticus 27 30,"And every tithe of the land, [whether] from the seed of the land or from the fruit of the tree:<br>for <small>YHWH</small> it is, a holy-portion for <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 27 31,"of his tithes,<br>its fifth-part he is to add to it;"
Leviticus 27 32,"and every tithe of herd or flock, from all that passes under the [shepherd’s] rod,<br>[each] tenth one, is to be a holy-portion for <small>YHWH</small>."
Leviticus 27 33,"He is not to search between good and ill, he is not to make-exchange for it;<br>but if he makes-exchange, yes, exchange for it,<br>then it and its exchange are a holy-portion, they cannot be redeemed."
Leviticus 27 34,These are the commandments<br>that <small>YHWH</small> commanded Moshe for the Children of Israel at Mount Sinai.
Numbers 1 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Appointment,<br>on the first [day] of the second month, in the second year after their going-out from the land of Egypt,<br>saying:"
Numbers 1 2,"Take up the head-count of the entire community of the Children of Israel,<br>by their clans, by their Fathers’ Houses,<br>according to the number of names, <br>every male per capita;"
Numbers 1 3,"from the age of twenty years and upward,<br>everyone going out to the armed-forces in Israel:<br>you are to count them [for battle] according to their forces,<br>you and Aharon."
Numbers 1 4,"And with you let there be<br>a man, a man per tribe [each],<br>each head of his Fathers’ House he is [to be]."

Numbers 1 16,"These are the [ones] called-by the community,<br>the exalted-leaders of the tribes of their fathers;<br>heads of the divisions of Israel are they."
Numbers 1 17,"Now Moshe and Aharon took these men, who were indicated by name,"
Numbers 1 18,"and the entire community they assembled,<br>on the first [day] of the second month;<br>they declared-their-lineage according to their clans, by their Fathers’ Houses,<br>as numbered by name, from the age of twenty years and upward, per capita,"
Numbers 1 19,as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe;<br>thus he counted them [for battle] in the Wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers 1 20,"Thus they were: the Sons of Re’uven, firstborn of Israel,<br>their begettings by their clans, by their Fathers’ House,<br>as numbered by name, per capita,<br>every male from the age of twenty years and upward,<br>everyone going out to the armed-forces:"

Numbers 1 45,"they were, all those accounted for of the Children of Israel by their Fathers’ House,<br>from the age of twenty and upward,<br>everyone going out to the armed-forces in Israel,"
Numbers 1 46,"thus they were, all those accounted for: <br>six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty."
Numbers 1 47,"But the Levites, by the tribe of their fathers, were not counted in the midst of them."
Numbers 1 48,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 1 49,"Mark, the tribe of Levi you are not to count,<br>their head-count you are not to take up in the midst of the Children of Israel."
Numbers 1 50,"But you, make the Levites accountable for the Dwelling of Testimony, for all its implements and for all that belongs to it:<br><i>they</i> are to carry the Dwelling and all its implements,<br><i>they</i> are to attend to it,<br>and around the Dwelling they are to camp."
Numbers 1 51,"When the Dwelling moves on, the Levites are to take it down,<br>and when the Dwelling is encamped, the Levites are to set it up;<br>the outsider who comes near is to be put to death!"
Numbers 1 52,"The Children of Israel are to camp, <br>each according to his encampment, each according to his banner-contingent, by their forces."
Numbers 1 53,But the Levites are to camp around the Dwelling of Testimony—that there be no fury against the community of the Children of Israel—<br>and the Levites are to keep the charge of the Dwelling of Testimony.
Numbers 1 54,"The Children of Israel did [it];<br>exactly as <small>YHWH</small> commanded Moshe, thus they did."
Numbers 2 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:"

Numbers 3 1,Now these are the begettings of Aharon and Moshe<br>at the time <small>YHWH</small> spoke with Moshe on Mount Sinai:
Numbers 3 2,"These are the names of the sons of Aharon: the firstborn—Nadav,<br>and Avihu,<br>El’azar and Itamar;"
Numbers 3 3,"these are the names of the sons of Aharon, the anointed priests,<br>whom he had mandated to act-as-priests."
Numbers 3 4,"Now Nadav and Avihu died before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>when they brought near outside fire before the presence of <small>YHWH</small><br>in the Wilderness of Sinai;<br>sons they did not have,<br>so El’azar and Itamar were made-priest in the living-presence of Aharon their father."
Numbers 3 5,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 3 6,"Bring near the tribe of Levi,<br>and have it stand [regularly] in the presence of Aharon the priest,<br>that they may attend upon him."

Numbers 10 35,"And it was, whenever the Coffer was to march on, that Moshe would say:<br> Arise [for battle], O <small>YHWH</small>,<br>that your enemies may scatter,<br>that those who hate you may flee before you!"
Numbers 10 36,"And when it would rest, he would say:<br> Return, O <small>YHWH</small>,<br>[you of] the myriad divisions of Israel!"
Numbers 11 1,"Now the people were like those-who-grieve over ill-fortune, in the hearing of <small>YHWH</small>.<br>When <small>YHWH</small> heard, his anger flared up,<br>and there blazed against them a fire of <small>YHWH</small> <br>and ate up the edge of the camp."
Numbers 11 2,"The people cried out to Moshe<br>and Moshe interceded to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and the fire abated."
Numbers 11 3,"So they called the name of that place: Tav’era/Blaze,<br>for [there] had blazed against them fire of <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 11 4,"Now the gathered-riffraff that were among them<br>had a craving, a hunger-craving,<br>and moreover the Children of Israel wept again and said:<br>Who will give us meat to eat?"
Numbers 11 5,"We recall the fish that we used to eat in Egypt for free,<br>the cucumbers, the watermelons,<br>the green-leeks, the onions, and the garlic!"
Numbers 11 6,"But now, our throats are dry;<br>there is nothing at all<br>except for the <i>mahn</i> before our eyes!"
Numbers 11 7,"—Now the <i>mahn</i> is like seed of coriander,<br>its aspect like the aspect of bdellium."
Numbers 11 8,"The people would roam around and collect it, <br>grind it in millstones or crush it in a crusher,<br>boil it in a pot, and make it into cakes,<br>so that its taste was like the taste of [something] rich [made with] oil."
Numbers 11 9,"And when the dew came down on the camp at night,<br>the <i>mahn</i> would come down on top of it.—"
Numbers 11 10,"Moshe heard the people weeping by their clans,<br>each one at the entrance to his tent.<br>Now <small>YHWH’S</small> anger flared up exceedingly,<br>and in the eyes of Moshe [it was] ill."
Numbers 11 11,"Moshe said to <small>YHWH</small>:<br>Why have you dealt-ill with your servant?<br>Why have I not found favor in your eyes,<br>[that you] have placed the burden of this entire people on me?"
Numbers 11 12,"Did I myself conceive this entire people,<br>or did I myself give birth to it,<br>that you should say to me,<br>Carry it in your bosom<br>as a nursing-parent carries a suckling-child,<br>to the soil about which you swore to their fathers?"
Numbers 11 13,"From where should I [get] meat to give to this entire people,<br>when they weep on me, saying:<br>Give us meat so that we may eat!"
Numbers 11 14,"I am not able, I alone, to carry this entire people,<br>for it is too heavy for me!"
Numbers 11 15,"If thus you deal with me,<br>pray kill me, yes, kill me,<br>if I have found favor in your eyes,<br>so that I do not have to see my ill-fortune!"
Numbers 11 16,"Then <small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe:<br>Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel,<br>of whom you know that they are elders of the people and its officers;<br>and take them to the Tent of Appointment<br>and station them there with you."
Numbers 11 17,"I will come down and speak with you there,<br>and I will extend from the rushing-spirit that is upon you<br>and place it upon them;<br>then they will carry along with you the burden of the people,<br>so that you will not [have to] carry it, you alone."
Numbers 11 18,"Now to the people you are to say:<br>Hallow yourselves for the morrow<br>that you may eat meat,<br>for you have wept in the ears of <small>YHWH</small>, saying:<br>Who will give us meat to eat?<br>For it was better for us in Egypt!<br><small>YHWH</small> will give you meat, and you shall eat it:"
Numbers 11 19,"not for [only] one day shall you eat it, and not for two days,<br>not for five days or for ten days or [even] for twenty days—"
Numbers 11 20,"[but] for a monthful of days,<br>until it comes out of your nostrils<br>and becomes for you something-disgusting,<br>because you have spurned <small>YHWH</small> who is among you,<br>by weeping before him, saying:<br>Why, now, did we leave Egypt?"
Numbers 11 21,"Moshe said:<br>Six hundred thousand on foot<br>are the fighting-people among whom I am,<br>yet you, you say:<br>Meat I will give them,<br>and they are to eat [it] for a monthful of days?!"
Numbers 11 22,"Are there flocks and herds that may be slaughtered for them,<br>that they would find-them-sufficient?<br>Or are there all the fish of the sea to be caught for them,<br>that they would find-them-sufficient?"
Numbers 11 23,<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Is the arm of <small>YHWH</small> too short? <br>Now you shall see whether my word happens for you or not.
Numbers 11 24,Moshe went out and spoke to the people the words of <small>YHWH</small>.<br>He gathered seventy men from the elders of the people<br>and had-them-stand around the tent.
Numbers 11 25,"And <small>YHWH</small> came down in a cloud<br>and spoke to him,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> extended some of the rushing-spirit that was upon him<br>and put it upon the seventy men, the elders;<br>and it was, <br>when the spirit rested upon them,<br>that they ranted-like-prophets, but did not continue."
Numbers 11 26,"Now two men remained in the camp:<br>the name of the one was Eldad,<br>the name of the second, Medad,<br>and the spirit rested upon them <br>—they were among those recorded,<br>but they had not gone out to the Tent—<br>and they ranted-like-prophets in the camp."
Numbers 11 27,"A [certain] lad ran<br>and told Moshe, he said:<br>Eldad and Meidad are ranting-like-prophets in the camp!"
Numbers 11 28,"Then Yehoshua son of Nun, Moshe’s attendant from his youth, spoke up;<br>he said:<br>My lord Moshe, contain them!"
Numbers 11 29,"But Moshe said to him:<br>Are you zealous for me?<br>O who would give that all the people of <small>YHWH</small> were prophets,<br>that <small>YHWH</small> would put the rush-of-his spirit upon them!"
Numbers 11 30,"Moshe took himself back to the camp,<br>he and the elders of Israel;"
Numbers 11 31,"and a rush-of-wind moved from <small>YHWH</small> <br>and swept in quails from the sea,<br>they spread out over the camp <br>as far as a day’s journey here and a day’s journey there, <br>all around the camp,<br>and about two cubits [deep] on the face of the ground."
Numbers 11 32,"The people arose all that day and all night, and all the morrow day<br>and gathered the quail;<br>the least gathered ten <i>homers.</i><br>They spread them, spread them out, all around the camp."
Numbers 11 33,"The meat was still between their teeth,<br>[with the supply] not yet exhausted,<br>when the anger of <small>YHWH</small> flared up among the people,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> struck down among the people an exceedingly great striking."
Numbers 11 34,"So they called the name of that place: Kivrot Ha-Taava/Burial-Places of the Craving,<br>for there they buried the people who had-the-craving."
Numbers 11 35,"From Kivrot Ha-Taava the people marched to Hatzeirot,<br>and they remained in Hatzeirot."
Numbers 12 1,"Now Miryam spoke, and Aharon, against Moshe<br>on account of the Cushite wife that he had taken [in marriage],<br>for a Cushite wife had he taken."
Numbers 12 2,"They said:<br>Is it only, solely through Moshe that <small>YHWH</small> speaks?<br>Isn’t it also through us that he speaks?<br>And <small>YHWH</small> heard."
Numbers 12 3,"Now the man Moshe was exceedingly humble,<br>more than any human who was on the face of the earth."
Numbers 12 4,"And <small>YHWH</small> said suddenly to Moshe, to Aharon and to Miryam:<br>Go out, the three of you, to the Tent of Appointment!<br>So the three of them went out."
Numbers 12 5,And <small>YHWH</small> descended in a column of cloud<br>and stood at the entrance to the Tent;<br>he called out: Aharon and Miryam!<br>And the two of them went out.
Numbers 12 6,"He said:<br>Pray hear my words:<br>If there should be among-you-a-prophet of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>in a vision to him I make-myself-known,<br>in a dream I speak with him."
Numbers 12 7,"Not so my servant Moshe:<br>in all my house, he is trusted;"
Numbers 12 8,"mouth to mouth I speak with him,<br>in-plain-sight, not in riddles,<br>and the form of <small>YHWH</small> he beholds.<br>So why were you not too awestruck<br>to speak against my servant, against Moshe?"
Numbers 12 9,"And the anger of <small>YHWH</small> flared up against them,<br>and he went off."
Numbers 12 10,"When the cloud turned away from above the Tent,<br>here, Miryam had <i>tzaraat</i> like snow!<br>Aharon faced Miryam,<br>and here, she had <i>tzaraat</i>!"
Numbers 12 11,"Aharon said to Moshe:<br>Please, my lord,<br>do not, pray, impose on us guilt-for-a-sin<br>by which we were foolish, by which we sinned!"
Numbers 12 12,"Do not, pray, let her be like a dead-child<br>who, when it comes out of its mother’s womb,<br>is eaten up in half its flesh!"
Numbers 12 13,"Moshe cried out to <small>YHWH</small>, saying:<br>O God, pray, heal her, pray!"
Numbers 12 14,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>If her father spat, yes, spat in her face,<br>would she not be put-to-shame for seven days?<br>Let her be shut up for seven days outside the camp,<br>and afterward she may be gathered back."
Numbers 12 15,"So Miryam was shut up outside the camp for seven days,<br>and the people did not march on until Miryam had been gathered back."
Numbers 12 16,[Only] afterward did the people march on from Hatzeirot;<br>they encamped in the Wilderness of Paran.
Numbers 13 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 13 2,"Send for yourself men,<br>that they may scout out the land of Canaan<br>that I am giving to the Children of Israel.<br>One man, one man per tribe of their fathers, you are to send,<br>each one a leader among them."
Numbers 13 3,"So Moshe sent them from the Wilderness of Paran, by order of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>all of them men[of standing]—<br>heads of the Children of Israel were they."
Numbers 13 4,And these were their names:<br>for the tribe of Re’uven: Shammu’a son of Zakkur;
Numbers 13 5,for the tribe of Shim’on: Shafat son of Hori;
Numbers 13 6,for the tribe of Yehuda: Calev son of Yefunne;
Numbers 13 7,for the tribe of Yissakhar: Yig’al son of Yosef;
Numbers 13 8,for the tribe of Efrayim: Hoshe’a son of Nun;
Numbers 13 9,for the tribe of Binyamin: Palti son of Rafu;
Numbers 13 10,for the tribe of Zevulun: Gaddiel son of Sodi;
Numbers 13 11,"for the tribe of Yosef, for the tribe of Menashe: Gaddi son of Susi;"
Numbers 13 12,for the tribe of Dan: Ammiel son of Gemalli;
Numbers 13 13,for the tribe of Asher: Setur son of Mikhael;
Numbers 13 14,for the tribe of Naftali: Nahbi son of Vofsi;
Numbers 13 15,for the tribe of Gad: Ge’uel son of Makhi.
Numbers 13 16,These the names of the men<br>whom Moshe sent to scout out the land<br>—now Moshe called Hoshe’a son of Nun: Yehoshua.
Numbers 13 17,"Moshe sent them to scout out the land of Canaan;<br>he said to them:<br>Go up this way through the Negev/Parched-Land,<br>and [then] you are to go up into the highlands."
Numbers 13 18,"And see the land—what it is [like],<br>and the population that is settled in it:<br>whether they are strong or weak,<br>whether they are few or many;"
Numbers 13 19,"and what the land is [like], where they are settled:<br>whether it is good or ill;<br>and what the towns are [like], where they are settled therein:<br>whether encampments or fortified-places;"
Numbers 13 20,"and what the land is [like]:<br>whether it is fat or lean,<br>whether there are trees in it or not.<br>Exert yourselves,<br>and take some of the fruit of the land<br>—now these days were the days of the first ripe-grapes."
Numbers 13 21,"So they went up and scouted out the land,<br>from the Wilderness of Tzyn as far as Rehov, coming toward Hamat."
Numbers 13 22,"They went up through the Negev<br>and came as far as Hevron:<br>there were Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai,<br>the descendants of the Anakites.<br>Now Hevron had been built seven years before Tzo’an of Egypt."
Numbers 13 23,They came to the Wadi of Eshkol/Clusters<br>and cut down from there a branch and one cluster of grapes<br>—they had to carry it on a bar [held] by two—<br>and some pomegranates and some figs.
Numbers 13 24,"That place they called: the Wadi of Clusters,<br>on account of the cluster that the Children of Israel had cut down there."
Numbers 13 25,They returned from scouting out the land<br>at the end of forty days.
Numbers 13 26,"Then they went and came before Moshe, before Aharon, and before the entire community of the Children of Israel<br>in the Wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh;<br>they returned word to them and to the entire community,<br>and let them see the fruit of the land."
Numbers 13 27,"Now they recounted to him, they said: <br>We came to the land to which you sent us,<br>and yes, it is flowing with milk and honey,<br>and this is its fruit—"
Numbers 13 28,"except that powerful are the people that are settled in the land,<br>the cities are fortified, exceedingly large,<br>and also the descendants of Anak did we see there!"
Numbers 13 29,"Amalek is settled in the Negev land,<br>and the Hittite and the Yevusite and the Amorite are settled in the highlands,<br>and the Canaanite is settled by the Sea and hard by the Jordan!"
Numbers 13 30,"Now Calev hushed the people before Moshe<br>and said:<br>Let us go up, yes, up, and possess it,<br>for we can prevail, yes, prevail against it!"
Numbers 13 31,"But the men who went up with him said:<br>We are not able to go up against the population,<br>for it is stronger than we!"
Numbers 13 32,"So they gave out a [false] report of the land<br>that they had scouted out<br>to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>The land that we crossed through to scout it out:<br>it is a land that devours its inhabitants;<br>all the people that we saw in its midst are men of [great] stature,"
Numbers 13 33,"[for] there we saw the giants—the Children of Anak [come] from the giants—<br>we were in our eyes like grasshoppers,<br>and thus were we in their eyes!"
Numbers 14 1,"The entire community lifted up and let out their voice,<br>and the people wept on that night."
Numbers 14 2,"And they grumbled against Moshe and against Aharon, all the Children of Israel;<br>they said to them, the entire community:<br>Would that we had died in the land of Egypt,<br>or in this wilderness, would that we had died!"
Numbers 14 3,"Now why is <small>YHWH</small> bringing us to this land, to fall by the sword?<br>Our wives and our little-ones will become plunder!<br>Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?"
Numbers 14 4,"So they said, each one to his brother:<br>Let us head back and return to Egypt!"
Numbers 14 5,Moshe and Aharon flung themselves on their faces<br>before the entire assembled community of the Children of Israel.
Numbers 14 6,"Now Yehoshua son of Nun and Calev son of Yefunne,<br>[alone] from among those who scouted out the land,<br>tore their garments;"
Numbers 14 7,"they said to the entire community of the Children of Israel, saying:<br>The land that we crossed through, to scout it out—<br>good is that land, exceedingly, exceedingly!"
Numbers 14 8,"If <small>YHWH</small> is pleased with us,<br>he will bring us to this land and give it to us,<br>a land that is flowing with milk and honey."
Numbers 14 9,"But: against <small>YHWH</small>, do not rebel,<br>and you—<br>do not be afraid of the people of the land,<br>for food-for-us are they!<br>Their protector has turned away from them,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> is with us.<br>Do not be afraid of them!"
Numbers 14 10,"But the entire community of Israel intended to pelt them with stones.<br>Now the Glory of <small>YHWH</small> was seen at the Tent of Appointment<br>by all the Children of Israel,"
Numbers 14 11,"and <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Until when will this people scorn me?<br>Until when will they not trust in me,<br>despite all the signs that I have done among them?"
Numbers 14 12,"Let me strike it down with pestilence and dispossess it,<br>and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier [in number] than it!"
Numbers 14 13,"But Moshe said to <small>YHWH</small>:<br>When they hear, the Egyptians,<br>that you brought up this people with your power from its midst,"
Numbers 14 14,"they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.<br>They have heard that you are <small>YHWH</small> in the midst of this people,<br>that eye to eye you were seen, O <small>YHWH</small>,<br>with your cloud standing over them,<br>in a column of cloud going before them by day,<br>and in a column of fire by night."
Numbers 14 15,"But should you put this people to death as one man,<br>then will say the nations that have heard of your fame, saying:"
Numbers 14 16,"[It was] from want of <small>YHWH’S</small> ability<br>to bring this people into the land about which he swore to them,<br>and so he slaughtered them in the wilderness!"
Numbers 14 17,"So-now,<br>pray let the power of my Lord [to forbear] be great,<br>as you have promised, saying:"
Numbers 14 18,"<small>YHWH</small>,<br>long-suffering and of much loyalty,<br>bearing away iniquity and transgression,<br>yet clearing, not clearing [the guilty],<br>calling-to-account the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons<br>to the third and to the fourth [generation]—"
Numbers 14 19,"pray grant-pardon for the iniquity of this people, as your loyalty is great,<br>just as you have been bearing [it] for this people<br>from Egypt until now!"
Numbers 14 20,"<small>YHWH</small> said:<br>I grant-pardon, according to your words;"
Numbers 14 21,"however, as I live,<br>and as the Glory of <small>YHWH</small> fills all the earth:"
Numbers 14 22,"indeed, all the men who have seen my Glory and my signs<br>that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness,<br>and have tested me these ten times,<br>and have not hearkened to my voice:"
Numbers 14 23,if they should see the land<br>about which I swore to their fathers . . . !<br>All who have scorned me will not see it!
Numbers 14 24,"But as for my servant, Calev,<br>because there was another spirit in him, and he followed-me-fully,<br>I will bring him into the land that he is about to enter,<br>and his seed will possess it."
Numbers 14 25,"Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite are settled in the Lowlands; <br>on the morrow, face about and march into the wilderness,<br>by the Reed Sea Road."
Numbers 14 26,"And <small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe and Aharon, saying:"
Numbers 14 27,"Until when for this evil community,<br>that they stir-up-grumbling against me?<br>The grumblings of the Children of Israel that they grumble against me, <br>I have heard!"
Numbers 14 28,"So say to them:<br>As I live—the Utterance of <small>YHWH</small>—<br>if not as you have spoken in my ears,<br>thus I do to you . . . !"
Numbers 14 29,"In this wilderness your corpses shall fall,<br>all of you counted [for battle], including all your number,<br>from the age of twenty and upward,<br>who have grumbled against me!"
Numbers 14 30,"If [any of] you should enter the land over which I lifted my hand [in an oath]<br>to have you dwell in it,<br>except for Calev son of Yefunne and Yehoshua son of Nun . . . !"
Numbers 14 31,"Your little-ones, whom you said would become plunder—<br>I will let them enter,<br>and they shall come to know the land that you have spurned."
Numbers 14 32,"But your corpses, yours,<br>shall fall in this wilderness,"
Numbers 14 33,"and your children shall graze in the wilderness for forty years;<br>thus shall they bear your whoring,<br>until your corpses come-to-an-end in the wilderness."
Numbers 14 34,"According to the number of days that you scouted out the land,<br>forty days,<br>[for each] day a year, [for each] day a year,<br>you are to bear your iniquities,<br>forty years;<br>thus will you know my hostility!"
Numbers 14 35,"I am <small>YHWH</small>, I have spoken:<br>If I do not do this to this whole evil community<br>that has come-together against me . . . !<br>In this wilderness they will come-to-an-end,<br>there they will die."
Numbers 14 36,So the men whom Moshe had sent to scout out the land<br>returned and caused the entire community to grumble against him<br>by bringing a [false] report about the land;
Numbers 14 37,"the men died,<br>those bringing a report of the land, an ill one,<br>in a plague, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 14 38,But Yehoshua son of Nun and Calev son of Yefunne<br>remained-alive from those men<br>who had gone to scout out the land.
Numbers 14 39,"Moshe spoke all these words to the Children of Israel,<br>and the people mourned, exceedingly."
Numbers 14 40,"They started-early in the morning<br>and went up to the top of the highlands, saying:<br>Here we are,<br>let us go up to [attack] the place that <small>YHWH</small> promised,<br>for we have sinned!"
Numbers 14 41,But Moshe said:<br>Why now do you cross the order of <small>YHWH</small>?<br>It will not succeed!
Numbers 14 42,"Do not go up, for <small>YHWH</small> is not in your midst—<br>that you not be defeated by your foes!"
Numbers 14 43,"For the Amalekite and the Canaanite are there to face you,<br>and you will fall by the sword, <br>for since you have turned from [following] after <small>YHWH</small>,<br><small>YHWH</small> will not be with you!"
Numbers 14 44,"But they went up recklessly to the top of the highlands, <br>while the Coffer of the Covenant of <small>YHWH</small> and Moshe did not move from amid the camp."
Numbers 14 45,"And the Amalekite and the Canaanite who were settled in those highlands came down,<br>they struck them and crushed them, near Horma."
Numbers 15 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 15 2,"Speak to the Children of Israel <br>and say to them:<br>When you enter the land of your settling that I am giving you,"
Numbers 15 3,"and make a fire-offering to <small>YHWH</small>:<br>an offering-up or a sacrifice,<br>to make a vow-offering, or in free-will, or at your appointed-times,<br>to make a soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>from the herd or from the flock,"
Numbers 15 4,"the one bringing near his near-offering is to bring near to <small>YHWH</small> as grain-gift:<br>flour, a tenth-measure,<br>mixed with a fourth of a <i>hin</i> of oil,"
Numbers 15 5,"and wine for a poured-offering: a fourth of a <i>hin;</i><br>you are to make it with the offering-up or the sacrifice,<br>for [each] one sheep,"
Numbers 15 6,"or for the ram, you are to make as a grain-gift:<br>flour, two tenth-measures,<br>mixed with oil, a third of a <i>hin,</i>"
Numbers 15 7,"and wine for a poured-offering, a third of a <i>hin;</i><br>you are to bring near a soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 15 8,"And when you make the young of the herd as an offering-up or as a sacrifice,<br>to make a vow-offering or a <i>shalom</i>-offering to <small>YHWH</small>:"
Numbers 15 9,"it is to be brought near with the young of the herd as a grain-gift: <br>flour, three tenth-measures,<br>mixed with oil, half a <i>hin,</i>"
Numbers 15 10,"and wine you are to bring near as a poured-offering, half a <i>hin,</i><br>as a fire-offering of soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 15 11,"Thus is to be made with [each] one ox or with [each] one ram<br>or with [any] lamb among the sheep or among the goats,"
Numbers 15 12,"according to the number that you make [as sacrifice];<br>thus are you to make for [each] one, according to their number."
Numbers 15 13,"Every native is to make these thus,<br>to bring near a fire-offering of soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 15 14,"Now when there sojourns a sojourner with you,<br>or [one] who has been in your midst, throughout your generations,<br>and he makes a fire-offering of soothing savor for <small>YHWH;</small>;<br>as you make [it], thus is he to make."
Numbers 15 15,"Assembly!<br>One law for you and for the sojourner who takes-up-sojourn,<br>a law for the ages, throughout your generations:<br>as [it is for] you, so will it be [for] the sojourner before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 15 16,"One instruction, one regulation shall there be for you<br>and for the sojourner who takes-up-sojourn with you!"
Numbers 15 17,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 15 18,"Speak to the Children of Israel<br>and say to them:<br>When you enter the land that I am bringing you to,"
Numbers 15 19,"it shall be<br>that when you eat of the bread of the land,<br>you are to set aside a contribution to <small>YHWH</small>:"
Numbers 15 20,"the premier-product of your kneading-troughs,<br>round-loaves you are to set aside as a contribution;<br>like the contribution of the threshing-floor,<br>so you are to set it aside."
Numbers 15 21,"From the premier-product of your kneading-troughs<br>you are to give to <small>YHWH</small> a contribution,<br>throughout your generations."
Numbers 15 22,"Now if you should err,<br>not doing any of these commandments<br>about which <small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe,"
Numbers 15 23,"anything that <small>YHWH</small> has commanded you, through the hand of Moshe,<br>from the day that <small>YHWH</small> commanded and forward, throughout your generations,"
Numbers 15 24,"it shall be:<br>if [away] from the eyes of the community it was done, by error,<br>the entire community is to make [as sacrifice]<br>one bull, a young of the herd, as an offering-up, as a soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>with its grain-gift and its poured-offering, according to regulation,<br>and one hairy goat, as a <i>hattat-</i>offering."
Numbers 15 25,"The priest is to effect-purgation for the entire community of the Children of Israel,<br>that there may be granting-of-pardon for them,<br>for it was an error,<br>but they have brought their near-offering,<br>a fire-offering of soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and their <i>hattat-</i>offering before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>, on account of their error."
Numbers 15 26,"So there shall be granting-of-pardon for the entire community of the Children of Israel,<br>and for the sojourner who sojourns in their midst,<br>for [it was done] by the entire people in error."
Numbers 15 27,"Now if one person sins, in error,<br>they are to bring near a she-goat, in its [first] year, as a <i>hattat</i>- offering."
Numbers 15 28,"The priest is to effect-purgation for the person that errs,<br>in sinning, in erring, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>to effect-purgation for him, that he may be granted-pardon."
Numbers 15 29,"The native among the Children of Israel,<br>and for the sojourner who sojourns in your midst:<br>one instruction shall there be for you,<br>for him that does [anything] in error."
Numbers 15 30,"But the person who does [anything] with a high hand<br>among the native-born or among the sojourners,<br>it is <small>YHWH</small> whom they have blasphemed;<br>cut off shall that person be from among his kinspeople,"
Numbers 15 31,"for the word of <small>YHWH</small> they have despised, and his commandment they have violated;<br>cut off, cut off shall that person be—<br>their iniquity is on them!"
Numbers 15 32,"Now when the Children of Israel were in the wilderness,<br>they found a man picking wood on the Sabbath day."
Numbers 15 33,"They brought him near, those who found him picking wood,<br>to Moshe and to Aharon, and to the entire community;"
Numbers 15 34,"they put him under guard,<br>for it had not been clarified what should be done to him."
Numbers 15 35,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>The man is to be put to death, yes, death;<br>pelt him with stones, the entire community, outside the camp!"
Numbers 15 36,"So they brought him, the entire community, outside the camp,<br>and they pelted him with stones, so that he died,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Numbers 15 37,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 15 38,"Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them<br>that they are to make themselves tassels<br>on the corners of their garments, throughout their generations,<br>and are to put on the corner tassel a thread of blue-violet."
Numbers 15 39,"It shall be a tassel for you,<br>that you may look at it<br>and keep-in-mind all the commandments of <small>YHWH</small><br>and observe them,<br>that you not go scouting-around after your heart, after your eyes<br>which you go whoring after;"
Numbers 15 40,"in order that you may keep-in-mind<br>and observe all my commandments,<br>and [so] be holy to your God!"
Numbers 15 41,"I am <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>who took you out of the land of Egypt, to be a God to you;<br>I am <small>YHWH</small> your God!"
Numbers 16 1,"Now there betook himself Korah son of Yitzhar son of Kehat son of Levi,<br>and Datan and Aviram the sons of Eliav and On son of Pelet, the sons of Re’uven;"
Numbers 16 2,"they rose up before Moshe<br>with men-of-stature from the Children of Israel, fifty and two hundred,<br>leaders of the community, those Called in the Appointed-Council, men of name."
Numbers 16 3,"They assembled against Moshe and against Aharon<br>and said to them:<br>Too much is yours!<br>For the entire community, the entirety-of-them, are holy,<br>and in their midst is <small>YHWH</small>!<br>Why then do you exalt yourselves over the assembly of <small>YHWH</small>?"
Numbers 16 4,"[When] Moshe heard, he flung himself on his face."
Numbers 16 5,"Then he spoke to Korah and to his entire community, saying:<br>At daybreak<br><small>YHWH</small> will make known who is his and who is holy<br>and he will declare-him-near to him;<br>the one that he chooses, he will declare-near to him."
Numbers 16 6,"This, do:<br>take yourselves fire-pans,<br>Korah and his entire community,"
Numbers 16 7,"and place fire in them,<br>and put incense on them, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>, tomorrow.<br>And it shall be:<br>the man whom <small>YHWH</small> chooses, <i>he</i> is the holy-one.<br>Too much is yours, Sons of Levi!"
Numbers 16 8,"And Moshe said to Korah:<br>Now hearken, Sons of Levi:"
Numbers 16 9,"Is it too little for you<br>that the God of Israel has separated you from the community of Israel<br>to bring you near to him,<br>to serve the serving-tasks of the Dwelling of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>to stand before the community, to attend on them?"
Numbers 16 10,"He has brought near you and all your brothers, the Sons of Levi, with you—<br>would you seek the priesthood as well?"
Numbers 16 11,"Truly,<br>it is you and your entire community<br>who come together against <small>YHWH</small>—<br>as for Aharon, what is [wrong] with him that you should grumble against him!"
Numbers 16 12,"Moshe sent to call Datan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav,<br>but they said: We will not go up!"
Numbers 16 13,"Is it too little<br>that you have brought us up from a land flowing with milk and honey<br>to cause our death in the wilderness?<br>that you should play-the-prince over us, even the prince?"
Numbers 16 14,"Then too, not to a land flowing with milk and honey have you brought us,<br>[nor] have you given us an inheritance of field and vineyard.<br>The eyes of these men, would you gouge out?<br>We will not go up!"
Numbers 16 15,Then Moshe became exceedingly upset; <br>he said to <small>YHWH</small>:<br>Do not turn your face toward their grain-gift—<br>not one donkey of theirs have I carried off;<br>I have not done ill to one of them!
Numbers 16 16,"Moshe said to Korah:<br>You and your entire community,<br>be [there] before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>you and they and Aharon, tomorrow."
Numbers 16 17,"And take, each-man, his pan,<br>place on them smoking-incense,<br>and bring it near, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>each-man his pan,<br>fifty and two hundred pans,<br>and [also] you and Aharon, each-man his pan."
Numbers 16 18,"So they took each-man his pan,<br>and placed on them fire,<br>and put on them smoking-incense,<br>and stood at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment, <br>as [did] Moshe and Aharon."
Numbers 16 19,"And Korah and his entire community assembled against them,<br>at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.<br>Now the Glory of <small>YHWH</small> was seen by the entire community;"
Numbers 16 20,"and <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:"
Numbers 16 21,"Separate yourselves from the midst of this community,<br>that I may finish them off in an instant!"
Numbers 16 22,"They flung themselves on their faces and said:<br>O God, God of the spirits of all flesh,<br>when one man sins,<br>at the entire community will you be furious?"
Numbers 16 23,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 16 24,"Speak to the community, saying:<br>Go up from around the dwelling-place of Korah, Datan and Aviram!"
Numbers 16 25,"Moshe arose and went to Datan and Aviram,<br>and there went after him the elders of Israel."
Numbers 16 26,"And he spoke to the community, saying:<br>Pray turn away from the tents of these wicked men;<br>do not touch anything that is theirs,<br>lest you be swept away in all their sins!"
Numbers 16 27,"They went up from the dwellings of Korah, Datan, and Aviram, all around.<br>Now Datan and Aviram had come out, stationed at the entrance to their tents,<br>with their wives, their children, and their little-ones."
Numbers 16 28,"Moshe said:<br>By this you shall know<br>that <small>YHWH</small> sent me to do all these deeds,<br>that it was not from my [own] heart:"
Numbers 16 29,"if like the death of all humans these [men] die,<br>and the calling-to-account of all humans is accounted upon them,<br>it is not <small>YHWH</small> [who] has sent me."
Numbers 16 30,"But if <small>YHWH</small> creates a new-creation,<br>and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows up them and all that is theirs,<br>and they go down alive into Sheol,<br>then you will know<br>that these men have scorned <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 16 31,"Now it was, just as he finished speaking all these words,<br>that the ground that was beneath them split;"
Numbers 16 32,"the earth opened its mouth<br>and swallowed up them and their households,<br>all the human beings who belonged to Korah<br>and all the property."
Numbers 16 33,"So they went down, they and all theirs,<br>alive, to Sheol;<br>the earth covered them,<br>and they vanished from the midst of the assembly."
Numbers 16 34,"Now all Israel that were around them<br>fled at [the sound of] their voice,<br>for they said:<br>Lest the earth swallow us up!"
Numbers 16 35,"And fire went out from before the presence of <small>YHWH</small><br>and consumed the fifty and two hundred men,<br>those bringing near the incense."
Numbers 17 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 17 2,"Speak to El’azar son of Aharon the priest,<br>that he may set aside the pans from the burned-remains,<br>and the fire-coals, scatter yonder,<br>for they have become holy;"
Numbers 17 3,"[as for] the pans of those-who-sinned, [at the cost of] their lives,<br>make of them beaten plates, overlaid for the altar,<br>for they were brought near before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and have become-holy.<br>Let them be a sign for the Children of Israel!"
Numbers 17 4,"So El’azar the priest took<br>the bronze pans that the burned-men had brought near,<br>and he beat them as overlay for the altar,"
Numbers 17 5,"as a reminder for the Children of Israel,<br>in order that no outside man might come near<br>who is not of the seed of Aharon<br>to turn smoking-incense into smoke before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and so that he not become like Korah and like his community,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> spoke through the hand of Moshe to him."
Numbers 17 6,"But all the Children of Israel grumbled on the morrow<br>against Moshe and against Aharon, saying:<br>It is you [who] caused the death of <small>YHWH’S</small> people!"
Numbers 17 7,"Now it was, when the community assembled against Moshe and against Aharon,<br>that they turned toward the Tent of Appointment,<br>and here, the cloud had covered it,<br>and the Glory of <small>YHWH</small> could be seen!"
Numbers 17 8,Then Moshe and Aharon came to the front of the Tent of Appointment.
Numbers 17 9,"And <small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 17 10,"Move aside from the midst of this community,<br>that I may finish them off in an instant!<br>They flung themselves upon their faces."
Numbers 17 11,"Moshe said to Aharon:<br>Take [your] pan<br>and place upon it fire from the altar, and put smoking-incense [there];<br>go quickly to the community and effect-appeasement for them,<br>for the fury is [still] going-out from the presence of <small>YHWH</small>&mdash;<br>the plague has begun!"
Numbers 17 12,"Aharon took [it], as Moshe had spoken,<br>and ran to the midst of the assembly:<br>and here, the plague had begun among the people!<br>So he put the smoking-incense [in it], and effected-appeasement for the people:"
Numbers 17 13,"now he stood between the dead and the living,<br>and the plague was held back."
Numbers 17 14,"Now those that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred,<br>aside from those that died in the matter of Korah."
Numbers 17 15,"Aharon returned to Moshe, to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment,<br>since the plague was held back."
Numbers 17 16,"Now <small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 17 17,"Speak to the Children of Israel,<br>take from them a staff, a staff [each] per Fathers’ House<br>from all their leaders, for their Father’s House:<br>twelve staffs,<br>each-man—his name you are to write upon the staffs."
Numbers 17 18,"And the name of Aharon you are to write upon the staff of Levi,<br>indeed, one staff for [each] head of their Fathers’ House."
Numbers 17 19,"You are to put them in the Tent of Appointment, before the Testimony,<br>where I appoint-meeting with you."
Numbers 17 20,"Now it shall be:<br>the man whom I choose, his staff will sprout;<br>thus will I still from upon me<br>the grumblings of the Children of Israel that they set grumbling against you [both]."
Numbers 17 21,"Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel,<br>and they gave him, all the leaders,<br>a staff per [each] one leader, a staff per [each] one leader,<br>for their Fathers’ House,<br>twelve staffs,<br>with the staff of Aharon in the midst of their staffs."
Numbers 17 22,"Moshe laid out the staffs before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>in the Tent of the Testimony."
Numbers 17 23,"Now it was on the morrow:<br>when Moshe entered the Tent of the Testimony, <br>here, it had sprouted, the staff of Aharon, of the House of Levi;<br>it had put forth a sprouting-flower, it had blossomed a blossom, and it had ripened almonds!"
Numbers 17 24,"Moshe brought out all the staffs from before the presence of <small>YHWH</small><br>to all the Children of Israel;<br>they saw [them], and each-man took his staff."
Numbers 17 25,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Return the staff of Aharon before the Testimony<br>to be safeguarded as a sign for the rebellious-folk, <br>that their grumblings may be finished from me,<br>so that they do not die!"
Numbers 17 26,"Moshe did it;<br>as <small>YHWH</small> commanded him, so he did."
Numbers 17 27,"But the Children of Israel said to Moshe, saying:<br>Here, we perish, we are lost, all of us lost!"
Numbers 17 28,"Anyone who comes near, near [at all] to the Dwelling of <small>YHWH</small> will die; <br>will there be an end to our perishing?"
Numbers 18 1,<small>YHWH</small> said to Aharon:<br>You and your sons and your father’s house along with you<br>are to bear any iniquity [pertaining to] the Holy-Area;<br>you and your sons after you<br>are to bear any iniquity [pertaining to] your priesthood.
Numbers 18 2,"And also your brothers, the stock of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring near with you;<br>they are to be joined to you and are to act-as-attendants for you,<br>you and your sons along with you<br>in front of the Tent of the Testimony."
Numbers 18 3,"They are to keep your charge and the charge of the entire Tent,<br>but: to the implements of holiness and to the altar, they are not to come near,<br>so that they do not die—so they, so you!"
Numbers 18 4,"They are to be joined to you,<br>that they may keep the charge of the Tent of Appointment,<br>including all the serving-tasks of the Tent;<br>an outsider is not to come near with you,"
Numbers 18 5,"but you are to keep the charge of the Holy-Shrine and the charge of the altar,<br>that there be no further fury against the Children of Israel."
Numbers 18 6,"Now I, I hereby take your brothers, the Levites,<br>from the midst of the Children of Israel,<br>for you [they are] a gift, given over for <small>YHWH</small>,<br>for serving the serving-tasks of the Tent of Appointment."
Numbers 18 7,"And you and your sons with you<br>are to be in charge of your priesthood,<br>in every matter [pertaining to] the altar and [what is] inside the Curtain,<br>and you are to do service;<br>serving-tasks of special-grant I give your priesthood—<br>any outsider who comes near will be put to death!"
Numbers 18 8,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Aharon:<br>Now I, I hereby give over to you the charge of my contributions,<br>including all the holy-donations of the Children of Israel,<br>to you I give them, as an anointed-share,<br>and to your sons, as an allotment for the ages."
Numbers 18 9,"This shall be yours from the holiest holy-offerings, from the fire:<br>including their every near-offering, including their every grain-gift, including their every <i>hattat-</i>offering<br>and including their every <i>asham-</i>offering that they remit to me,<br>it is a holiest holy-portion, for you and for your sons."
Numbers 18 10,"In the holiest state-of-holiness you are to eat it,<br>every male may eat it,<br>holy shall it be for you."
Numbers 18 11,"And this [too is] for you: their contributed gift<br>including all the elevation-offerings of the Children of Israel,<br>to you I give it over,<br>and to your sons and to your daughters along with you,<br>as an allotment for the ages;<br>everyone ritually-pure in your house may eat it."
Numbers 18 12,"All your choicest shining-oil, all your choicest new-wine and grain,<br>the premier-part that they give to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>to you I give it."
Numbers 18 13,"The first-fruits of everything that is in their land, that they bring to <small>YHWH</small>,<br>it is for you,<br>everyone pure in your house may eat it."
Numbers 18 14,Everything specially-devoted in Israel—<br>it is for you.
Numbers 18 15,"Every breacher of a womb of all flesh<br>that you bring near for <small>YHWH</small>, of man and of beast,<br>for you it shall be.<br>However, you are to redeem, yes, redeem the firstborn of humans,<br>and the firstborn of <i>tamei</i> animals you are to redeem."
Numbers 18 16,"And its redemption-price, from the age of a month you are to redeem,<br>in your assessment: silver, five <i>shekels</i> by the<i> </i>Holy-Shrine <i>shekel</i>,<br>—it is twenty grains."
Numbers 18 17,"However, the firstborn of oxen, the firstborn of sheep, or the firstborn of goats<br>you are not to redeem,<br>[already] holy are they,<br>their blood you are to dash against the altar,<br>and their fat you are to turn-into-smoke,<br>a fire-offering, a soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>,"
Numbers 18 18,and their meat is to be for you;<br>like the breast of the elevation-offering and like the right thigh<br>shall it be for you.
Numbers 18 19,"All the contributions of the holy-things that the Children of Israel set aside for <small>YHWH</small><br>I give to you and to your sons and to your daughters along with you<br>as an allotment for the ages:<br>it is a “covenant of salt” for the ages, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>for you and for your seed after you."
Numbers 18 20,"And <small>YHWH</small> said to Aharon:<br>In their land you are not to receive-inheritance,<br>no portion-of-land shall be yours in their midst:<br>I am your portion and your inheritance<br>in the midst of the Children of Israel."
Numbers 18 21,"And to the Sons of Levi,<br>here, I give over every tithe in Israel, as an inheritance,<br>in exchange for their serving-tasks that they serve,<br>the serving-tasks of the Tent of Appointment."
Numbers 18 22,"The Children of Israel are no longer to come near the Tent of Appointment,<br>to bear sin, to die."
Numbers 18 23,"The Levite, <i>he</i> is to serve the serving-tasks of the Tent of Appointment,<br><i>they</i> will bear their iniquity&mdash;<br>a law for the ages, throughout their generations:<br>but in the midst of the Children of Israel they are not to inherit a [land-]inheritance."
Numbers 18 24,"For the tithing of the Children of Israel that they set aside for <small>YHWH</small> as a contribution,<br>I give over to the Levites as an inheritance;<br>therefore I have said to them:<br>in the midst of the Children of Israel they are not to inherit a [land-]inheritance."
Numbers 18 25,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 18 26,"To the Levites you are to speak, saying to them:<br>When you take from the Children of Israel the tithe that I am giving you from them, as your inherited-share,<br>you are to set aside from it as a contribution for <small>YHWH</small><br>a tenth from the tithe;"
Numbers 18 27,"it will be reckoned to you as your contribution,<br>like grain from the threshing-floor,<br>like fully-fermented [grapes] from the vat."
Numbers 18 28,"Thus you are to set aside, on your part, the contribution of <small>YHWH</small>, <br>from all your tithes that you take from the Children of Israel,<br>and are to give from them the contribution of <small>YHWH</small> to Aharon the priest."
Numbers 18 29,"From all your gifts<br>you are to set aside all contributions forf <small>YHWH</small>,<br>from all its choice-parts, <br>its holy-part from it."
Numbers 18 30,"And you are to say to them:<br>When you set aside the choice-part from it,<br>it is to be reckoned for the Levites<br>like the produce of the threshing-floor, like the produce of the vat."
Numbers 18 31,"You may eat it in any place, you and your household,<br>for it is a wage for you,<br>in exchange for your serving-tasks in the Tent of Appointment."
Numbers 18 32,"You will not bear on account of it [any] sin<br>once you set aside its choice-part from it,<br>that you not profane the holy-donations of the Children of Israel,<br>and you do not die."
Numbers 19 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:"
Numbers 19 2,"This is the law of the instructed-ritual<br>that <small>YHWH</small> has commanded, saying:<br>Speak to the Children of Israel,<br>that they may take you a red cow, wholly-sound,<br>that has in it no defect,<br>that has not yet yielded to a yoke;"
Numbers 19 3,"you are to give it to El’azar the priest,<br>and it is to be brought forth, outside the camp,<br>and is to be slaughtered in his presence."
Numbers 19 4,"El’azar the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger<br>and is to sprinkle toward the face of the Tent of Appointment, some of its blood,<br>seven times."
Numbers 19 5,"Then the cow is to be burned before his eyes;<br>its hide, its flesh, and its blood<br>along with its dung, are to be burned."
Numbers 19 6,"The priest is to take wood of cedar, and hyssop, and scarlet of worm,<br>and is to throw [them] into the midst of the cow burning."
Numbers 19 7,"He is to scrub his garments, the priest, and is to wash his body in water,<br>and afterward he may enter the camp,<br>but the priest will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset."

Numbers 19 9,"And a [ritually] pure man shall collect the ashes of the cow,<br>and deposit them outside the camp<br>in a pure place.<br>It shall be for the community of the Children of Israel in safekeeping,<br>as Waters of Undefilement;<br>it is [for] decontamination."
Numbers 19 10,The collector of the cow’s ashes is to scrub his garments<br>and remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.<br>It shall be for the Children of Israel and for the sojourner who sojourns in their midst <br>as a law for the ages:

Numbers 20 6,"Moshe and Aharon came away from the presence of the assembly<br>to the entrance to the Tent of Appointment,<br>and flung themselves on their faces.<br>The Glory of <small>YHWH</small> was seen by them,"
Numbers 20 7,"and <small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 20 8,"Take the staff<br>and assemble the community, you and Aharon your brother;<br>you are to speak to the boulder before their eyes<br>so that it gives forth its water.<br>Thus you are to bring them out water from the boulder,<br>that you may give-drink to the assembly and to their cattle."
Numbers 20 9,"So Moshe took the staff from before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>as he had commanded him."
Numbers 20 10,"And Moshe and Aharon assembled the assembly facing the boulder.<br>He said to them:<br>Now hear, [you] rebels,<br>from this boulder must we bring you out water?"
Numbers 20 11,"And Moshe raised his hand<br>and struck the boulder with his staff, twice,<br>so that abundant water came out,<br>and the community and their cattle drank."
Numbers 20 12,"Now <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe and to Aharon:<br>Because you did not have trust in me<br>to treat-me-as-holy before the eyes of the Children of Israel,<br>therefore:<br>you [two] shall not bring this assembly into the land that I am giving them!"
Numbers 20 13,"Those were the Waters of Meriva/Quarreling,<br>where the Children of Israel quarreled with <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and he was made holy through them."
Numbers 20 14,Moshe sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom:<br>Thus says your brother Israel:<br>You know [about] all the hardships that have found us:
Numbers 20 15,"our fathers went down to Egypt<br>and we stayed in Egypt for many years,<br>and Egypt ill-treated us and our fathers."
Numbers 20 16,"Now we cried out to <small>YHWH</small>, and he hearkened to our voice,<br>and he sent a messenger and brought us out of Egypt.<br>So here we are at Kadesh, [the] town at the edge of your territory."
Numbers 20 17,"Pray let us cross through your land;<br>we will not cross through field or through orchard, <br>we will not drink water from wells;<br>[on] the King’s Road we will march&mdash;;<br>we will not turn aside right or left,<br>until we have crossed through your territory."
Numbers 20 18,"But Edom said to him:<br>You shall not cross through me,<br>lest with the sword I come out to meet you!"
Numbers 20 19,"The Children of Israel said to him:<br>On the byway we will go up;<br>if we drink your water, I and my livestock,<br>I will give its selling-price—<br>only [let it] not be a matter-of-dispute;<br>on foot let me cross!"
Numbers 20 20,But he said:<br>You shall not cross!<br>And Edom went out to meet him<br>with a heavy [host of] fighting-people and with a strong hand.
Numbers 20 21,"So Edom refused to give Israel [leave] to cross through his territory,<br>and Israel turned away from him."
Numbers 20 22,"They marched on from Kadesh,<br>and they came, the Children of Israel, the entire community, to Hill’s Hill."
Numbers 20 23,"And <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe and to Aharon at Hill’s Hill,<br>by the border of the land of Edom,<br>saying:"
Numbers 20 24,"Let Aharon be gathered to his kinspeople,<br>for he is not to enter the land that I am giving to the Children of Israel—<br>since you [both] rebelled against my orders at the Waters of Meriva."
Numbers 20 25,Take Aharon and El’azar his son<br>and bring them up on Hill’s Hill;
Numbers 20 26,strip Aharon of his garments and clothe El’azar his son in them.<br>Aharon will be gathered and will die there.
Numbers 20 27,So Moshe did as <small>YHWH</small> commanded him:<br>they went up Hill’s Hill before the eyes of the entire community;
Numbers 20 28,"and Moshe stripped Aharon of his garments and clothed El’azar his son in them.<br>So Aharon died there on top of the hill.<br>Moshe and El’azar came down from the hill,"
Numbers 20 29,"and the entire community saw that Aharon had expired,<br>so they wept for Aharon thirty days,<br>the whole House of Israel."
Numbers 21 1,"Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who sat [as ruler] in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the Atarim Road,<br>so they waged battle against Israel and captured from them war-captives."
Numbers 21 2,"And Israel vowed a vow to <small>YHWH</small><br>and said:<br>If you will give, yes, give this people into my hand,<br>I will devote their towns [to destruction]."
Numbers 21 3,"Now <small>YHWH</small> hearkened to the voice of Israel, and he gave [them] the Canaanites,<br>and they devoted-them-to-destruction along with their cities;<br>so they called the name of the place Horma/Destruction."
Numbers 21 4,"They marched from Hill’s Hill by the Reed Sea Road,<br>to go around the land of Edom,<br>and the people’s temper became short on the way."
Numbers 21 5,"The people spoke against God and against Moshe:<br>Why did you bring us up from Egypt to die in the wilderness?<br>For there is no food and no water,<br>and our throats loathe the wretched food!"
Numbers 21 6,"So <small>YHWH</small> sent upon the people vipers, burning-snakes;<br>they bit the people,<br>and many people of Israel died."
Numbers 21 7,"The people came to Moshe<br>and said:<br>We have sinned!<br>For we have spoken against <small>YHWH</small> and against you.<br>Intercede to God, so that he may remove from us the vipers!<br>So Moshe interceded on behalf of the people."
Numbers 21 8,And <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Make yourself a burning-snake and put it on a banner-pole;<br>it shall be:<br>whoever has been bitten and then sees it will live.
Numbers 21 9,"So Moshe made a viper of copper, and he put it on a banner-pole,<br>and it was:<br>if a viper bit someone<br>and he looked upon the viper of copper, he would live."
Numbers 21 10,The Children of Israel marched on and encamped at Ovot.
Numbers 21 11,"They marched on from Ovot and encamped at Iyyei Ha-Avarim,<br>in the wilderness that faces Moav,<br>toward the rising of the sun."
Numbers 21 12,From there they marched on and encamped at Wadi Zered.
Numbers 21 13,"From there they marched on and encamped across the Arnon that is in the wilderness,<br>that goes out from the Amorite territory;<br>for the Arnon is the border of Moav<br>between Moav and the Amorites."
Numbers 21 14,"Therefore it is said in the Record of the Wars of <small>YHWH</small>:<br> . . . Vahev in Sufa,<br>the wadis, Arnon,"
Numbers 21 15,"along with its canyon wadis<br>that stretches along the settled-country of Ar,<br>and leans on the territory of Moav."
Numbers 21 16,"From there to Be’er/The Well;<br>that is the well of which <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Gather the people, and I will give them water."
Numbers 21 17,"Then Israel sang this song:<br> Spring up, O well, sing-in-chorus to it"
Numbers 21 18,—the well that was dug out by princes!<br>—that was excavated by people’s nobles!<br>—with scepter!<br>—with their rods!<br> Now from the wilderness—to Mattana;
Numbers 21 19,and from Mattana—to Nahaliel;<br>and from Nahaliel—to Bamot/The Heights;
Numbers 21 20,"and from Bamot—to the valley that is at the Open-Country of Moav,<br>the top of Pisga/the Summit,<br>overlooking the face of the wasteland."
Numbers 21 21,"Now Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying:"
Numbers 21 22,"Let me cross through your land!<br>We will not turn aside into field or vineyard,<br>we will not drink well water;<br>on the King’s Road we will march,<br>until we have crossed your territory."
Numbers 21 23,But Sihon would not give Israel [leave] to cross through his territory.<br>Sihon gathered all his fighting-people<br>and went out to meet Israel in the wilderness;<br>he came to Yahatz and waged battle against Israel.
Numbers 21 24,"But Israel struck him with the mouth of the sword<br>and took possession of his land,<br>from the Arnon as far as the Yabbok, as far as the Children of Ammon,<br>for strong is the territory of the Children of Ammon."
Numbers 21 25,"Israel took all these towns<br>and Israel settled in all the Amorite towns—<br>in Heshbon and in all her daughter-villages,"
Numbers 21 26,"for Heshbon—it was the town of Sihon king of the Amorites.<br>He had waged battle against a former king of Moav<br>and had taken all his land from his hand, as far as the Arnon."
Numbers 21 27,"Therefore the bards say:<br> Come to Heshbon! Be built up; <br>be established, Sihon’s town!"
Numbers 21 28,"For fire went forth from Heshbon,<br>flame from the city of Sihon,<br>devouring Ar of Moav,<br>the inhabitants of the heights of Arnon."
Numbers 21 29,"Woe to you, Moav!<br>You have perished, people of Kemosh!<br>His sons [become] fugitives,<br>his daughters, captives<br>of the king of the Amorites, Sihon."
Numbers 21 30,"We shot them&mdash;<br>Heshbon perished as far as Divon,<br>we desolated [them] as far as Nofah,<br>fire as far as Medeva!"
Numbers 21 31,Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers 21 32,And Moshe sent [men] to scout Ya’zer;<br>they captured its daughter-villages<br>and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.
Numbers 21 33,"Then they faced-about and went up the Bashan Road.<br>Og king of Bashan went out to meet them,<br>he and all his fighting-people in war, at Edre’i."
Numbers 21 34,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Do not be afraid of him,<br>for into your hand I give him and all his people, and his land;<br>you will do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who sat [as ruler] in Heshbon."
Numbers 21 35,"So they struck him and his sons and all his people<br>until not a survivor was left to him,<br>and they took possession of his land."
Numbers 22 1,"And the Children of Israel marched on and encamped in the Plains of Moav,<br>across from Jordan-Jericho."
Numbers 22 2,"Balak son of Tzippor saw<br>all that Israel had done to the Amorites,"
Numbers 22 3,"and Moav was in exceeding fear before the people, since they were so many;<br>they felt dread before the Children of Israel."
Numbers 22 4,"Moav said to the elders of Midyan:<br>Look now, this assembly will lick up everything around us like an ox licks up the green-things of the field!<br>Now Balak son of Tzippor was king of Moav at that time."
Numbers 22 5,"He sent messengers to Bil’am son of Be’or, to Petor, which is beside the River [in] the land of the sons of his kinspeople,<br>to call him, saying:<br>Here, a people has come up out of Egypt;<br>here, it covers the aspect of the land,<br>and it has settled hard upon me!"
Numbers 22 6,"So-now, pray go, curse this people for me,<br>for it is too mighty [in number] for me!<br>Perhaps I will prevail: we will strike it, so that I drive it from the land.<br>For I know<br>that whomever you bless is blessed,<br>whomever you curse is cursed!"
Numbers 22 7,"The elders of Moav and the elders of Midyan went,<br>tokens-of-augury in their hand;<br>they came to Bil’am and spoke Balak’s words to him."
Numbers 22 8,"He said to them:<br>Spend the night here tonight,<br>then I will bring back to you whatever word <small>YHWH</small> speaks to me.<br>The nobles of Moav stayed with Bil’am."
Numbers 22 9,Now God came to Bil’am and said:<br>Who are these men with you?
Numbers 22 10,"Bil’am said to God:<br>Balak son of Tzippor, king of Moav, has sent to me:"
Numbers 22 11,"Here, the people that came out of Egypt, it covers the aspect of the land!<br>So-now, pray go, hex it for me&mdash;<br>perhaps I will be able to wage battle against it and drive it away!"
Numbers 22 12,"God said to Bil’am:<br>You are not to go with them,<br>you are not to curse the people,<br>for it is blessed!"
Numbers 22 13,"Bil’am arose at daybreak and said to Balak’s nobles:<br>Go to your land,<br>for <small>YHWH</small> refuses to give-me-leave to go with you."
Numbers 22 14,"The nobles from Moav arose, they came to Balak and said:<br>Bil’am refuses to go with us!"
Numbers 22 15,"So Balak once again sent nobles,<br>greater and more honored than those;"
Numbers 22 16,they came to Bil’am<br>and said to him:<br>Thus says Balak son of Tzippor:<br>Pray do not hold back from going to me;
Numbers 22 17,"indeed, I will honor, yes, honor you exceedingly—<br>anything that you say to me, I will do.<br>Only: pray go, revile this people for me!"
Numbers 22 18,"Bil’am answered, <br>he said to the servants of Balak:<br>If Balak were to give me his house’s fill of silver and gold<br>I would not be able to cross the order of <small>YHWH</small> my God<br>to do [anything] small or great!"
Numbers 22 19,"So now,<br>pray stay here, you as well, tonight,<br>that I may know<br>what <small>YHWH</small> will once again speak with me."
Numbers 22 20,"And God came to Bil’am at night,<br>he said to him:<br>Since it is to call you that the men have come,<br>arise, go with them;<br>but: only the word that I speak to you,<br>that [alone] you may do."
Numbers 22 21,"Bil’am arose at daybreak,<br>he saddled his she-ass<br>and went with the nobles of Moav."
Numbers 22 22,"But <small>YHWH’S</small> anger flared up because he was going,<br>so <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger stationed himself in the way as an adversary to him.<br>Now he was riding on his she-ass, his two serving-lads with him."
Numbers 22 23,"And the she-ass saw <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger<br>stationed in the way,<br>his sword drawn in his hand,<br>so the she-ass turned aside from the way and went into the field.<br>And Bil’am struck the she-ass<br>to turn her back onto the way."
Numbers 22 24,"But <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger stood in the furrow of the vineyards,<br>a fence on this-side and a fence on this-side."
Numbers 22 25,"And the she-ass saw <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger,<br>so she pressed herself against the wall;<br>she pressed Bil’am’s foot against the wall,<br>and once again he struck her."
Numbers 22 26,"But <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger once again crossed over,<br>standing in a narrow place <br>where there was no pathway to turn, right or left."
Numbers 22 27,"And the she-ass saw <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger,<br>so she crouched down beneath Bil’am.<br>Bil’am’s anger flared up,<br>and he struck the she-ass with his staff."
Numbers 22 28,Then <small>YHWH</small> opened the mouth of the she-ass<br>and she said to Bil’am:<br>What have I done to you<br>that you have struck me [on] these three occasions?
Numbers 22 29,"Bil’am said:<br>Because you have dealt-wantonly with me!<br>If a sword had been in my hand,<br>by now I would have killed you!"
Numbers 22 30,"The she-ass said to Bil’am:<br>Am I not your she-ass<br>upon whom you have ridden from your past until this day?<br>Have I ever been accustomed, accustomed to do thus to you?<br>He said:<br>No."
Numbers 22 31,"Then <small>YHWH</small> uncovered Bil’am’s eyes<br>and he saw <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger stationed in the way,<br>his sword drawn in his hand;<br>he did homage and bowed low, to his nostrils."
Numbers 22 32,"<small>YHWH’S</small> messenger said to him:<br>For what [cause] did you strike your she-ass [on] these three occasions?<br>Here, I came out as an adversary,<br>for the way was rushed out against me."
Numbers 22 33,"The she-ass saw me,<br>so she turned aside before me these three occasions.<br>Had she not turned aside from me,<br>by now, [it is] you I would have killed,<br>and her I would have left-alive!"
Numbers 22 34,"Bil’am said to <small>YHWH’S</small> messenger:<br>I have sinned,<br>for I did not know that you were stationed to meet me in the way.<br>But now, if it is evil in your eyes,<br>I will head back."
Numbers 22 35,"<small>YHWH’S</small> messenger said to Bil’am:<br>Go with the men,<br>but only the word that I speak to you,<br>that [alone] you may speak! <br>And so Bil’am went with Balak’s nobles."
Numbers 22 36,"And Balak heard that Bil’am was coming,<br>so he went out to meet him,<br>to Ir/Town of Moav that is by the Arnon border,<br>that is at the far-edge of the border."
Numbers 22 37,"And Balak said to Bil’am:<br>Did I not send, yes, send to you, to call you!<br>Why did you not go to me?<br>Am I truly not able to honor you?"
Numbers 22 38,"Bil’am said to Balak:<br>Here, I have come to you;<br>but now,<br>am I able, able to speak anything [myself]?<br>The word that God puts in my mouth,<br>that [alone] may I speak."
Numbers 22 39,Now Bil’am went with Balak;<br>they came to the village of Hutzot/Streets.
Numbers 22 40,"Balak slew oxen and sheep,<br>and sent them out to Bil’am and to the nobles that were with him."
Numbers 22 41,"Now it was at daybreak:<br>Balak took Bil’am and had him go up on the Heights of Baal,<br>so that he could see from there the edge of the people."
Numbers 23 1,"Bil’am said to Balak:<br>Build me here seven altars,<br>and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams."
Numbers 23 2,Balak did as Bil’am had spoken to him;<br>then Bil’am and Balak offered up a bull and a ram on [each] altar.
Numbers 23 3,"Bil’am said to Balak:<br>Station yourself beside your offering-up, and I will go:<br>perhaps <small>YHWH</small> will encounter me in an encounter,<br>the word of whatever he lets me see, I will report to you.<br>So he went off by himself."
Numbers 23 4,"And God encountered Bil’am;<br>he said to him:<br>The seven altars I have arranged,<br>and I have offered-up a bull and a ram on [each] altar."
Numbers 23 5,"And <small>YHWH</small> put words in Bil’am’s mouth<br>and said:<br>Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak."
Numbers 23 6,"So he returned to him,<br>and here: he was standing alongside his offering-up,<br>he and all the nobles of Moav."
Numbers 23 7,"He took up his discourse and said:<br>From Aram, Balak led me,<br>Moav’s king from the highlands of Kedem:<br>Go, curse Yaakov for me,<br>go, revile Israel!"
Numbers 23 8,How shall I revile [him]<br>whom God has not reviled?<br>How shall I denounce [him] <br>whom <small>YHWH</small> has not denounced?
Numbers 23 9,"Indeed, from the top of crags I see him:<br>from hills I behold him:<br>here, a people, alone-in-security it dwells,<br>among the nations it does not need to come-to-reckoning."
Numbers 23 10,"Who can measure the dust of Yaakov,<br>or [find a] number [for] the dust-clouds of Israel?<br>May I die the death of the upright,<br>may my future be like his!"
Numbers 23 11,"Balak said to Bil’am:<br>What have you done to me?<br>To revile my foes I took you on,<br>and here, you have blessed, yes, blessed [them]!"
Numbers 23 12,"He answered and said:<br>Is it not whatever <small>YHWH</small> puts in my mouth,<br>that [alone] I must take care to speak?"
Numbers 23 13,"Balak said to him:<br>Pray go with me to another place from where you can see them:<br>only their edge will you see,<br>all of them you will not see<br>—hex them for me from there!"
Numbers 23 14,"So he took him to the Field of Watchmen, to the top of the summit.<br>He built seven altars<br>and offered-up a bull and a ram on [each] altar."
Numbers 23 15,"Then he said to Balak:<br>Station yourself here, alongside your offering-up;<br>as for me, I will seek-an-encounter there."
Numbers 23 16,"<small>AND YHWH</small> encountered Bil’am<br>and put words in his mouth;<br>he said:<br>Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak."
Numbers 23 17,"He came to him:<br>here, he was standing alongside his offering-up,<br>the nobles of Moav with him.<br>Balak said to him:<br>What did <small>YHWH</small> speak?"
Numbers 23 18,"He took up his discourse and said: <br> Arise, Balak, and hearken,<br>turn-ear toward me, O son of Tzippor:"
Numbers 23 19,"No man is God, that he should lie,<br>or a human being, that he should retract.<br>He, should he say and not do,<br>speak and not fulfill?"
Numbers 23 20,"Here, to bless I was taken on,<br>when he blesses, I cannot reverse it."
Numbers 23 21,"He spies no evil in Yaakov,<br>he sees no trouble in Israel,<br><small>YHWH</small> their God is with them,<br>fanfare for the king, among them!"
Numbers 23 22,The God who brought them out of Egypt<br>like the horns of the wild-ox for him.
Numbers 23 23,"For there is no divination in Yaakov,<br>and no augury in Israel;<br>at once it is declared to Yaakov,<br>to Israel, what God intends."
Numbers 23 24,"Here, a people arises like a king-of-beasts,<br>like a lion it lifts itself up:<br>it does not lie down till it eats [its] prey,<br>and the blood of the slain it drinks."
Numbers 23 25,"Balak said to Bil’am:<br>If you just cannot revile, revile them,<br>just do not bless, bless them!"
Numbers 23 26,"Bil’am spoke up and said to Balak:<br>Didn’t I speak to you [before], saying: <br>All that God speaks—<br>that [alone] I may do?!"
Numbers 23 27,"Balak said to Bil’am:<br>Pray go, I will take you to another place;<br>perhaps it will be right in God’s eyes that you will revile them for me from there."
Numbers 23 28,So Balak took Bil’am to the top of Pe’or that overlooks the face of the wasteland.
Numbers 23 29,Bil’am said to Balak:<br>Build me here seven altars<br>and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.
Numbers 23 30,So Balak did as Bil’am had said;<br>and he offered-up a bull and a ram on [each] altar.
Numbers 24 1,"And Bil’am saw<br>that it was good in the eyes of <small>YHWH</small> to bless Israel,<br>and so he did not go forth as time and time [before] to encounter divination-meetings,<br>but he set his face toward the wilderness."
Numbers 24 2,"And Bil’am lifted up his eyes<br>and saw Israel, dwelling by their tribes,<br>and there [came] upon him the spirit of God."
Numbers 24 3,"He took up his discourse and said:<br> Utters Bil’am the son of Be’or,<br>utters the man of the open eye,"
Numbers 24 4,"utters the hearer of Godly sayings<br>who envisages a vision of Shaddai,<br>fallen, but with eyes uncovered:"
Numbers 24 5,"How goodly are your tents, O Yaakov,<br>your dwellings, O Israel,"
Numbers 24 6,"like groves stretched out,<br>like gardens beside a river,<br>like aloes planted by <small>YHWH</small>,<br>like cedars beside the water;"
Numbers 24 7,"dripping water from their boughs,<br>their seed in many waters!<br>Their king will rise above Agag,<br>their kingdom be exalted."
Numbers 24 8,"The God who brought them out of Egypt<br>like the horns of the wild-ox for him!<br>They will consume nations, their foes,<br>their bones they will crush;<br>their arrows they will smash!"
Numbers 24 9,"They crouch, they lie down like a lion,<br>like the king-of-beasts: who will [dare] rouse him?<br>Those who bless you—-blessed,<br>those who curse you—cursed!"
Numbers 24 10,"Balak’s anger flared up against Bil’am,<br>and he smacked his hands [together].<br>Balak said to Bil’am:<br>To revile my enemies I had you called,<br>and here, you have blessed, yes, blessed them,<br>these three times!"
Numbers 24 11,"So now, hasten back to your [own] place!<br>I had said: I will honor, yes, honor you;<br>but here, <small>YHWH</small> has denied you honor!"
Numbers 24 12,"Bil’am said to Balak:<br>Didn’t I speak also to the messengers whom you sent to me, saying:"
Numbers 24 13,"If Balak were to give me his house’s fill of silver and gold,<br>I would not be able to cross the order of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>to do good or ill from my [own] heart?<br>What <small>YHWH</small> speaks,<br>that [alone] I may speak!"
Numbers 24 14,"So now,<br>here, I am going [back] to my people;<br>come, I will advise you<br>as to what this people will do to your people in future days."
Numbers 24 15,"And he took up his discourse and said:<br> Utters Bil’am the son of Be’or,<br>utters the man of open eye,"
Numbers 24 16,"utters the hearer of Godly sayings,<br>who knows the knowledge of the Most-High,<br>envisaging a vision of Shaddai,<br>fallen, but with eyes uncovered:"
Numbers 24 17,"I see it, but not now,<br>I behold it, but not soon:<br>there goes forth a star from Yaakov,<br>there arises a meteor from Israel,<br>it smashes the pate of Moav,<br>the crown of all the Children of Shet."
Numbers 24 18,"Edom becomes a possession,<br>a possession becomes Se’ir of its enemies,<br>but Israel does valiantly."
Numbers 24 19,"There rules [one] from Yaakov,<br>he causes the remnant of Ir to perish."
Numbers 24 20,"He saw Amalek,<br>and he took up his discourse and said:<br> Premier of nations, Amalek,<br>but its future: near to oblivion!"
Numbers 24 21,"He saw the Kenites,<br>and he took up his discourse, and said:<br> Secure is your settlement,<br>set in the clefts is your nest,"
Numbers 24 22,but ablaze will be Kayin <br>when Ashur takes you captive.
Numbers 24 23,"And he took up his discourse and said:<br> Alas, who can remain-alive whom God has condemned!"
Numbers 24 24,"Ships [come] from Kittite shore,<br>they afflict Ashur, they afflict Ever,<br>but they too: near to oblivion!"
Numbers 24 25,"Then Bil’am arose and went, returning to his place;<br>and also Balak went on his way."
Numbers 25 1,"Israel stayed in Shittim/Acacias,<br>and the people began to whore with the women of Moav."
Numbers 25 2,They called the people for sacrifices to their gods;<br>the people ate <br>and bowed down to their gods.
Numbers 25 3,"And Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Pe’or,<br>so the anger of <small>YHWH</small> flared up against Israel,"
Numbers 25 4,"and <small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Take all the heads of the people and impale them to <small>YHWH</small>, facing the sun,<br>so that the flaming anger of <small>YHWH</small> may turn from Israel."

Numbers 29 35,On the eighth day:<br>Restraint there is to be for you;<br>any-kind of servile work you are not to do!
Numbers 29 36,"You are to bring near an offering-up, a fire-offering of soothing savor for <small>YHWH</small>:<br>one bull, one ram,<br>lambs a year in age seven, wholly-sound,"
Numbers 29 37,"their grain-gift as well as their poured-offerings,<br>for [each] bull, for [each] ram, and for the lambs,<br>by their number, according to the regulation,"
Numbers 29 38,"and one hairy-one as a <i>hattat-</i>offering,<br>aside from the regular offering-up, its grain-gift, and its poured-offering."
Numbers 29 39,"These you are to make to <small>YHWH</small> at your appointed-times,<br>aside from your vow-offerings and your freewill-offerings,<br>whether your offerings-up or your grain-gifts,<br>your poured-offerings or your <i>shalom</i>-offerings."
Numbers 30 1,So Moshe declared to the Children of Israel<br>exactly as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe.
Numbers 30 2,"Now Moshe spoke to the heads of the tribes of the Children of Israel, saying:<br>This is the word that <small>YHWH</small> has commanded:"
Numbers 30 3,"[Any] man who vows a vow to <small>YHWH</small><br>or swears a sworn-oath, to bind himself by a binding-obligation:<br>he is not to desecrate his word;<br>exactly as what goes out of his mouth, he is to do."
Numbers 30 4,"And any woman, when she vows a vow to <small>YHWH</small><br>or binds herself by a binding-obligation in her father’s house, in her youth,"
Numbers 30 5,"and her father hears her vow, or her binding-obligation by which she has bound herself,<br>and her father is silent to her:<br>all her vows, they shall be upheld,<br>and all her binding-obligations by which she has bound herself shall be upheld."
Numbers 30 6,"Now if her father constrains her at the time that he hears it,<br>all her vows and her binding-obligations by which she binds herself shall not be upheld,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> will grant-her-pardon,<br>for her father has constrained her."
Numbers 30 7,"But if she becomes married, married to a man<br>while her vows are upon her,<br>or the rash-statement of her lips by which she has bound herself,"
Numbers 30 8,"and her husband hears,<br>[and] at the time that he hears, he is silent to her,<br>her vows shall be upheld;<br>all her binding-obligations by which she has bound herself shall be upheld."
Numbers 30 9,"Now if at the time that her husband hears, he constrains her,<br>he annulls her vow that is upon her<br>as well as the rash-statement of her lips by which she has bound herself,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> will grant-her-pardon."
Numbers 30 10,"Now the vow of a widow or a divorcée,<br>anything by which she has bound herself,<br>shall be upheld regarding her."
Numbers 30 11,"If in the house of her husband she made-a-vow<br>or bound, bound herself by a sworn-oath,"
Numbers 30 12,"and her husband heard, and was silent to her,<br>not constraining her,<br>all her vows shall be upheld,<br>and all the binding-obligations by which she bound herself shall be upheld."
Numbers 30 13,"But if her husband annulled, yes, annulled them at the time of his hearing it,<br>all that went out of her lips as her vows, as her binding of herself&mdash;<br>shall not be upheld,<br>her husband has annulled them,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> will grant-her-pardon."
Numbers 30 14,"Every vow and every sworn binding, for afflicting her self:<br>her husband may uphold, her husband may annul it."
Numbers 30 15,"But if her husband is silent, yes, silent to her, from [one] day to the [next] day,<br>[then] he has upheld all her vows and all her binding-obligations that are upon her,<br>he has upheld them, since he was silent to her at the time of his hearing it."
Numbers 30 16,"Now if he annuls, yes, annuls it after his hearing it,<br>he is to bear her iniquity."
Numbers 30 17,"These are the laws that <small>YHWH</small> commanded Moshe<br>between a man and his wife,<br>between a father and his daughter<br>in her youth, [in] the house of her father."
Numbers 31 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 31 2,"Seek-vengeance, the vengeance of the Children of Israel from the Midyanites;<br>afterward you will be gathered to your kinspeople."
Numbers 31 3,"Moshe spoke to the people, saying:<br>Draft from among you men for the attack-force,<br>that they may be against Midyan,<br>to exact the vengeance of <small>YHWH</small> upon Midyan."
Numbers 31 4,"A thousand per tribe, a thousand per tribe for each of the tribes of Israel,<br>you are to send out to the attack-force."
Numbers 31 5,"There were mustered, from the divisions of Israel, a thousand per tribe,<br>twelve thousand [men] drafted for the attack-force."
Numbers 31 6,"Moshe sent them out, a thousand per tribe, to the attack-force,<br>them and Pin’has son of El’azar, priest to the armed-forces,<br>the holy implements and the trumpets for [sounding] trilling-blasts in his hand."
Numbers 31 7,"They arrayed-their-forces against Midyan,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe,<br>and they killed every male,"
Numbers 31 8,"and the kings of Midyan they killed, along with the [other] slain:<br>Evi and Rekem, Tzur, Hur and Reva,<br>the five kings of Midyan;<br>and Bil’am son of Be’or they killed with the sword."
Numbers 31 9,"Now the Children of Israel captured the women of Midyan, and their little-ones,<br>and all their animals and all their acquired-wealth,<br>and all their goods they took-as-plunder."
Numbers 31 10,"And all their towns, among their settlements, and all their tent-villages, they burned with fire."
Numbers 31 11,"They took all the spoils and all those taken, among man and among beast."
Numbers 31 12,"And they brought to Moshe and to El’azar the priest, and to the community of the Children of Israel<br>the captives and those taken and the spoils, to the camp,<br>to the Plains of Moav, that are by Jordan-Jericho."
Numbers 31 13,"Now Moshe and El’azar the priest and all the leaders of the community, came out to meet them,<br>outside the camp."
Numbers 31 14,"And Moshe was furious with the commanders of the military,<br>the officers of thousands and the officers of hundreds,<br>who had come back from the armed-force in battle;"
Numbers 31 15,Moshe said to them:<br>You have left alive all the females!
Numbers 31 16,"Here, they were [the cause] for the Children of Israel following the word of Bil’am,<br>of breaking-faith with <small>YHWH</small>, in the matter of Pe’or,<br>so that a plague came against the community of <small>YHWH</small>!"
Numbers 31 17,"So now,<br>kill every male among the little-ones,<br>and every woman who has known a man by lying with a male, kill [as well]!"
Numbers 31 18,But all the younger ones among the women who have not known lying with a male—<br>you may keep them alive for yourselves.
Numbers 31 19,"As for you: pitch camp outside the camp, for seven days;<br>everyone who killed a person or everyone who touched a corpse—<br>decontaminate yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day,<br>you and your captives."
Numbers 31 20,"And every garment and every vessel of animal-skin and everything made of goats’-hair and every wooden vessel,<br>you are to decontaminate."
Numbers 31 21,El’azar the priest said to the men of the armed-force who came back from the battle:<br>This is the legal instruction that <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe:
Numbers 31 22,"However, gold and silver,<br>bronze, iron, tin and lead"
Numbers 31 23,"—anything that can come through fire—<br>you are to have cross through fire, and it will be pure;<br>however, in Waters of Undefilement it is to be decontaminated.<br>And everything that cannot come through fire, you are to have cross through water."
Numbers 31 24,"You are to scrub your garments on the seventh day, then you will be purified;<br>afterward you may come back into the camp."
Numbers 31 25,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 31 26,"Take up the head-count of those taken captive,<br>among man and among beast,<br>you and El’azar the priest and the heads of the fathers of the community."
Numbers 31 27,"You are to halve [equally] the taken-loot<br>between those wielding [swords skillfully] in battle, those going-out to the armed-forces,<br>and the entire community."
Numbers 31 28,"And you are to raise a levy for <small>YHWH</small><br>from the men of battle, those going out to the armed-forces,<br>one life out of five hundred,<br>from humans and from cattle, from donkeys and from sheep."
Numbers 31 29,From their half-share you are to take<br>and give to El’azar the priest a contribution to <small>YHWH</small>.
Numbers 31 30,"And from the half-share of the Children of Israel you are to take one, withheld from the fifty,<br>from humans and from cattle, from donkeys and from sheep,<br>from all domestic-animals,<br>and you are to give them to the Levites,<br>those charged with the charge of <small>YHWH’S</small> Dwelling."
Numbers 31 31,Moshe and El’azar the priest did<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe.
Numbers 31 32,"Now what was taken, over-and-above the plunder that the people from the armed-forces plundered,<br>were sheep, six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand,"
Numbers 31 33,"and cattle, two and seventy thousand,"
Numbers 31 34,"and donkeys, one and sixty thousand;"
Numbers 31 35,"and human persons,<br>of women who had not known lying with a male,<br>all the persons: two and thirty thousand."
Numbers 31 36,"And the half-share, the portion of those going-out to the armed-forces,<br>the number of sheep: three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred."
Numbers 31 37,"And the levy for <small>YHWH</small> from the sheep was<br>six hundred and five and seventy,"
Numbers 31 38,"and the cattle, six and thirty thousand,<br>and their levy for <small>YHWH</small>, two and seventy,"
Numbers 31 39,"and the donkeys, thirty thousand and five hundred,<br>and their levy for <small>YHWH</small>, one and sixty;"
Numbers 31 40,"and human persons, sixteen thousand,<br>and their levy for <small>YHWH</small>, two and thirty persons."
Numbers 31 41,"Moshe gave the levy of the contribution of <small>YHWH</small> to El’azar the priest,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Numbers 31 42,"Now from the half-share of the Children of Israel<br>that Moshe had halved, from the men who served-as-armed-forces,"
Numbers 31 43,"the half-share for the community, from the sheep was:<br>three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred;"
Numbers 31 44,"and cattle, six and thirty thousand;"
Numbers 31 45,"and donkeys, thirty thousand and five hundred;"
Numbers 31 46,"and human persons, sixteen thousand."
Numbers 31 47,"Moshe took from the half-share of the Children of Israel, one withheld out of fifty,<br>among man and among beast,<br>and gave them to the Levites, those charged with the duties of the Dwelling of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Numbers 31 48,"Now there came near to Moshe the commanders that belonged to the divisions of the armed-forces, <br>officers of thousands and officers of hundreds;"
Numbers 31 49,they said to Moshe:<br>Your servants have taken up the head-count of the men of war that are under our hand:<br>there has not gone uncounted of us a [single] man!
Numbers 31 50,"And we have brought near a near-offering for <small>YHWH</small><br>[from] any man who found an article of gold, armlets or bracelets,<br>rings, earrings, or ornaments,<br>to effect-ransom for our lives, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 31 51,"So Moshe and El’azar the priest took the gold from them,<br>all kinds of implements of [fine] workmanship."
Numbers 31 52,"Now all the gold of the contribution that they set aside for <small>YHWH</small>:<br>sixteen thousand and seven hundred and fifty <i>shekels</i>,<br>from the officers of thousands and from the officers of hundreds."
Numbers 31 53,"The men of the armed-forces kept-as-plunder, each-man [what] was his."
Numbers 31 54,"And Moshe and El’azar the priest took the gold<br>from the officers of thousands and the officers of hundreds,<br>and brought it to the Tent of Appointment,<br>as a reminder for the Children of Israel, before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 32 1,"Now many livestock had the Sons of Re’uven and the Sons of Gad,<br>an exceedingly mighty [amount];<br>and they saw the land of Ya’zer in the land of Gil’ad:<br>here, the place was a place [fit] for livestock."
Numbers 32 2,"So the Sons of Re’uven and the Sons of Gad came<br>and said to Moshe, to El’azar the priest and to the leaders of the community, saying:"
Numbers 32 3,"Atarot and Divon, Ya’zer and Nimra,<br>Heshbon and El’aleh,<br>Sevam, Nevo and Be’on,"
Numbers 32 4,"the land that <small>YHWH</small> has struck before the community of Israel—<br>it is a land for livestock,<br>and your servants have livestock."
Numbers 32 5,"And they said:<br>If we have found favor in your eyes,<br>let this land be given to your servants as a holding;<br>do not make us cross the Jordan!"
Numbers 32 6,"Moshe said to the Sons of Gad and to the Sons of Re’uven:<br>Should your brothers go out to battle,<br>and you, you stay here?"
Numbers 32 7,Why would you constrain the will of the Children of Israel<br>from crossing into the land that <small>YHWH</small> has given them?
Numbers 32 8,"Thus your fathers did, when I sent them out of Kadesh Barne’a to see the land:"
Numbers 32 9,"they went up as far as Wadi Eshkol and saw the land,<br>and then they constrained the will of the Children of Israel<br>so they did not come into the land that <small>YHWH</small> had given them."
Numbers 32 10,"And the anger of <small>YHWH</small> flared up on that day,<br>and he swore, saying:"
Numbers 32 11,"If they should see, the men who went up from Egypt,<br>—from the age of twenty and upward—<br>the ground about which I swore to Avraham, to Yitzhak and to Yaakov . . . !<br>For they did not follow-fully after me,"
Numbers 32 12,"excepting Calev son of Yefunne, the Kenizzite, and Yehoshua son of Nun,<br>for they followed-fully after <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 32 13,"And the anger of <small>YHWH</small> flared up against Israel,<br>and he had them wander in the wilderness, for forty years,<br>until it came-to-an-end, that whole generation that was doing what was ill in the eyes of <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 32 14,"Now here, you have arisen in place of your fathers,<br>a brood of sinning men,<br>to add further to the flaming anger of <small>YHWH</small> against Israel."
Numbers 32 15,"If you turn away from him,<br>he will add further to leave them in the wilderness,<br>and you will bring-ruin-on this entire people!"
Numbers 32 16,"They came close to him and said:<br>Sheep fences we will build, for our livestock here,<br>and towns for our little-ones;"
Numbers 32 17,"while as for us, we shall be drafted hastily before the Children of Israel,<br>until we have brought them to their place.<br>But our little-ones will stay in towns fortified against the inhabitants of the land."
Numbers 32 18,We will not return to our houses<br>until the Children of Israel have inherited each one his inheritance.
Numbers 32 19,"For we will not take-inheritance with them across the Jordan and further [on],<br>for our inheritance has come to us<br>across the Jordan, toward sunrise."
Numbers 32 20,"Moshe said to them:<br>If you do this thing,<br>if you are drafted before <small>YHWH</small> for battle,"
Numbers 32 21,"and you cross the Jordan, every hand-picked man, before <small>YHWH</small>,<br>until he has dispossessed his enemies from before him,"
Numbers 32 22,"and the land is subdued before <small>YHWH</small>,<br>afterward you may return,<br>and [then] you will be clear [of obligation] before <small>YHWH</small> and before Israel;<br>this land will be for you as a holding before <small>YHWH</small>."
Numbers 32 23,"But if you do not do thus,<br>here, you will have sinned against <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and know your sin—that [it] will overtake you!"
Numbers 32 24,"Build yourselves towns for your little-ones and fences for your flocks,<br>and what has gone out of your mouths, do!"
Numbers 32 25,"Then said the Sons of Gad and the Sons of Re’uven to Moshe, saying:<br>Your servants will do as my lord commands:"
Numbers 32 26,"our little-ones, our wives, our livestock and all our animals<br>will stay there in the towns of Gil’ad;"
Numbers 32 27,"your servants will cross over, every drafted [member] of the armed-forces, before <small>YHWH</small>, in battle,<br>as my lord has spoken."
Numbers 32 28,"So Moshe commanded El’azar the priest concerning them<br>and Yehoshua son of Nun<br>and the heads of the Fathers of the tribes of the Children of Israel,"
Numbers 32 29,"and Moshe said to them:<br>If the Sons of Gad and the Sons of Re’uven cross over the Jordan with you,<br>everyone drafted for battle, before <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and the land is conquered before you,<br>you may give them the land of Gil’ad as an inheritance."
Numbers 32 30,"But if the drafted [warriors] do not cross over with you,<br>they will receive-holdings with you in the land of Canaan."
Numbers 32 31,"The Sons of Gad and the Sons of Re’uven answered, saying:<br>What <small>YHWH</small> has spoken to your servants, thus will we do:"
Numbers 32 32,"we ourselves will cross over, as drafted men, before <small>YHWH</small>, into the land of Canaan;<br>[remaining] with us [will be] our inherited holding, across the Jordan."
Numbers 32 33,"So Moshe gave to them, to the Sons of Gad, the Sons of Re’uven, and half the tribe of Menashe son of Yosef,<br>the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,<br>and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan,<br>the land as regards its towns in the territories, the towns of the land all around."
Numbers 32 34,"And the Sons of Gad rebuilt Divon, Atarot, and Aro’er,"
Numbers 32 35,"Aterot Shofan, and Ya’zer and Yogbeha,"
Numbers 32 36,"and Bet Nimra and Bet Haran,<br>as fortified cities and as fences for flocks."
Numbers 32 37,"And the Sons of Re’uven rebuilt Heshbon and El’alei<br>and Kiryatayim,"
Numbers 32 38,"and Nevo and Baal Me’on—of changed name—<br>and Sivma;<br>and they called them by [other] names,<br>the names of the towns that they built."
Numbers 32 39,"Then went out the Sons of Makhir son of Menashe, to Gil’ad,<br>they captured it <br>and dispossessed the Amorites that were in it."
Numbers 32 40,"And Moshe gave Gil’ad to Makhir son of Menashe,<br>and he settled there."
Numbers 32 41,"And Ya’ir son of Menashe marched out<br>and captured their villages,<br>he called them Havvot-Ya’ir/Fortified-Villages of Ya’ir."
Numbers 32 42,"And Novah went out<br>and captured Kenat and its daughter-towns,<br>and he called it Novah, after his [own] name."
Numbers 33 1,"These are the marching-stages of the Children of Israel that they went on<br>from the land of Egypt, by their forces,<br>through the hand of Moshe and Aharon."
Numbers 33 2,"Moshe wrote down their departures, by their marching-stages, by order of <small>YHWH</small>.<br>Now these are their marching-stages, by their departures:"
Numbers 33 3,"they marched from Ra’mses, in the first month,<br>on the fifteenth day of the first month;<br>on the morrow of the Passover-meal<br>the Children of Israel departed with a high hand, before the eyes of all Egypt,"
Numbers 33 4,"while Egypt was burying those whom <small>YHWH</small> had struck down among them, all the firstborn,<br>and on their gods, <small>YHWH</small> had rendered judgment."
Numbers 33 5,"And the Children of Israel marched on from Ra’mses, and encamped at Sukkot;"
Numbers 33 6,"they marched on from Sukkot, and encamped at Eitam, which is at the edge of the wilderness."
Numbers 33 7,"And they marched on from Eitam and turned toward Pi-Ha-Hirot, that [runs] along the face of Baal Tzefon,<br>and encamped before Migdol."
Numbers 33 8,"They marched on from Penei Ha-Hirot and crossed in the midst of the Sea into the wilderness;<br>then they marched a journey of three days into the Wilderness of Eitam,<br>and encamped at Mara."
Numbers 33 9,"They marched on from Mara and came to Eilim;<br>now in Eilim [were] twelve springs of water and seventy palms,<br>and they encamped there."

Numbers 33 36,"They marched on from Etzyon Gever, and encamped in the Wilderness of Tzyn—that is Kadesh."
Numbers 33 37,"They marched on from Kadesh, and encamped at Hill’s Hill, at the edge of the land of Edom."
Numbers 33 38,"Now Aharon the priest went up on Hill’s Hill, by order of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and died there,<br>in the fortieth year after the going out of the Children of Israel from the land of Egypt,<br>in the fifth month, on the first of the month."
Numbers 33 39,Aharon was three and twenty and a hundred years old<br>when he died at Hill’s Hill.
Numbers 33 40,"Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad <br>—he sat [as ruler] in the Negev, in the land of Canaan—heard of the coming of the Children of Israel."

Numbers 33 50,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe in the Plains of Moav,<br>by Jordan-Jericho, saying:"
Numbers 33 51,"Speak to the Children of Israel, and say to them:<br>When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,"
Numbers 33 52,"you are to dispossess all the settled-folk of the land from before you.<br>You are to destroy all their figured-objects,<br>all their molten images you are to destroy,<br>all their sanctuaries you are to wipe out,"
Numbers 33 53,"that you may take possession of the land and settle in it,<br>for to you I have given the land, to possess it."
Numbers 33 54,"You shall arrange-inheritance of the land by lots, according to your clans: <br>for the many, you are to make-much their inheritance,<br>for the few, you are to make-little their inheritance&mdash;<br>wherever the lot comes out for them there, [so] shall theirs be;<br>by the tribes of your fathers you are to receive-inheritance."
Numbers 33 55,"But if you do not dispossess the settled-folk of the land from before you,<br>those who are left of them shall be<br>as barbs in your eyes, and as spines in your sides;<br>they will harrass you on the land that you are settling in,"
Numbers 33 56,"and it shall be:<br>as I intended to do to them, so I will do to you!"
Numbers 34 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 34 2,"Command the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>When you enter the land, Canaan,<br>this is the land that will fall to you as an inheritance,<br>the land of Canaan by its borders:"
Numbers 34 3,"the Negev limit will be for you from the Wilderness of Tzyn alongside Edom;<br>the Negev border will be for you from the edge of the Sea of Salt, on the east;"
Numbers 34 4,"the border will then turn for you from the Negev-side of Scorpions’ Pass, crossing on to Tzyn;<br>its outer-reaches will be from the Negev-side of Kadesh Barne’a,<br>[then] going out to Hatzar Addar and crossing on to Atzmon."
Numbers 34 5,"The border will then turn from Atzmon toward the Wadi of Egypt,<br>its outer-reaches will be at the Sea."
Numbers 34 6,As the seaward border will be for you the Great Sea and [its own] border;<br>this will be for you the seaward border.
Numbers 34 7,And this will be for you the northern border:<br>from the Great Sea you are to mark yourselves [a line] to Hill’s Hill.
Numbers 34 8,"From Hill’s Hill you are to mark going to Hamat,<br>and the outer-reaches of the border shall be at Tzedad."
Numbers 34 9,"Then the border will go out to Zifron,<br>and its outer-reaches will be Hatzar Einan;<br>this will be for you the northern border."
Numbers 34 10,"And you are to mark for yourselves, for the border eastward:<br>from Hatzar Einan to Shefam."
Numbers 34 11,"And the border will go down from Shefam to Rivla, on the east of Ayin/The Spring,<br>then the border will go down and brush the shoulder of the Sea of Kinneret, eastward,"
Numbers 34 12,"then the border will go down along the Jordan,<br>and its outer-reaches will be the Sea of Salt.<br>This will be the land for you, in its borders all around!"
Numbers 34 13,"So Moshe commanded the Children of Israel, saying:<br>This is the land for which you are to arrange-inheritance by lot,<br>that <small>YHWH</small> commanded to be given to the nine tribes and the half tribe."
Numbers 34 14,"For the tribe of the Sons of the Re’uvenites, according to their Fathers’ House,<br>and the tribe of the Sons of the Gadites, according to their Fathers’ House,<br>and half of the tribe of Menashe<br>have [already] taken their inheritance;"
Numbers 34 15,"two tribes and the half tribe<br>have taken their inheritance across from Jordan-Jericho,<br>eastward, toward sunrise."
Numbers 34 16,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 34 17,"These are the names of the men that will arrange-for-your-inheritance of the land:<br>El’azar the priest and Yehoshua son of Nun,"
Numbers 34 18,"and one leader, one leader per tribe you are to take for arranging-inheritance of the land."
Numbers 34 19,And these are the names of the men:<br>of the tribe of Yehuda: Calev son of Yefunne
Numbers 34 20,Of the tribe of the Sons of Shim’on: Shemuel son of Ammihud.
Numbers 34 21,Of the tribe of Binyamin: Elidad son of Kislon.
Numbers 34 22,"Of the tribe of the Sons of Dan, leader: Bukki son of Yogli."
Numbers 34 23,"Of the Sons of Yosef:<br>of the tribe of the Sons of Menashe, leader: Hanniel son of Efod,"
Numbers 34 24,"of the tribe of the Sons of Efrayim, leader: Kemiel son of Shiftan."
Numbers 34 25,"Of the tribe of the Sons of Zevulun, leader: Elitzafan son of Parnakh."
Numbers 34 26,"Of the tribe of the Sons of Yissakhar, leader: Paltiel son of Azzan."
Numbers 34 27,"Of the tribe of the Sons of Asher, leader: Ahihud son of Shelomi."
Numbers 34 28,"Of the tribe of the Sons of Naftali, leader: Pedah’el son of Ammihud."
Numbers 34 29,"These [are they] whom <small>YHWH</small> commanded to parcel-out-inheritance for the Children of Israel, in the land of Canaan."
Numbers 35 1,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, in the Plains of Moav,<br>by Jordan-Jericho, saying:"
Numbers 35 2,"Command the Children of Israel,<br>that they may give over to the Levites, from their inherited holdings, towns to settle in,<br>and pasture-land for the towns around them, give to the Levites."
Numbers 35 3,"The towns shall be for them to settle in,<br>and their pasture-lands shall be for their cattle, their property and for all their animals."
Numbers 35 4,"And the pasture-lands of the towns that you give to the Levites [shall be]<br>from the wall of the town and outward, a thousand cubits all around;"
Numbers 35 5,"you are to measure outside the city, the eastern limit: two thousand by the cubit,<br>and the Negev limit, two thousand by the cubit,<br>and the seaward limit, two thousand by the cubit,<br>and the northern limit, two thousand by the cubit,<br>with the town in the middle.<br>This shall be for them the pasture-lands of the towns."
Numbers 35 6,"And with the towns that you give to the Levites,<br>with the six towns of asylum that you give for fleeing-to for the [accidental] murderer—<br>along with them you are to give forty-two towns."
Numbers 35 7,"All the towns that you are to give the Levites:<br>forty-eight towns,<br>them and their pasture-lands."
Numbers 35 8,"And the towns that you give [them] from the holdings of the Children of Israel—<br>from those that have-many you are to take-many, from those that have-few you are to take-few;<br>each one according to his inheritance that they receive-as-inheritance<br>is to give of its towns for the Levites."
Numbers 35 9,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
Numbers 35 10,"Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>When you cross over the Jordan, into the land of Canaan:"
Numbers 35 11,"You are to select for yourselves [certain] towns&mdash;<br>towns of asylum shall they be for you,<br>for fleeing-to for the [accidental] murderer, one who strikes down a life in error."
Numbers 35 12,"The towns shall be for you for asylum from the [blood] redeemer,<br>that the murderer not die<br>until he can come before the community for judgment."
Numbers 35 13,And the towns that you provide—<br>six towns of asylum shall there be for you.
Numbers 35 14,"Three of the towns you are to provide across the Jordan,<br>and three of the towns you are to provide in the land of Canaan<br>&mdash;towns of asylum they are to be&mdash;"
Numbers 35 15,"for the Children of Israel, for the sojourner and for the temporary-settler among them,<br>these six towns are to be for asylum,<br>for fleeing to for anyone who strikes down a person in error."
Numbers 35 16,"But if with an iron instrument he struck him down, so that he died,<br>he is a murderer:<br>put to death, put to death must the murderer be!"
Numbers 35 17,"And if with a stone in hand through which one can die he struck him down, so that he died,<br>he is a murderer: <br>put to death, put to death must the murderer be!"
Numbers 35 18,"Or with a wooden tool in hand through which one can die he struck him down, <br>so that he died,<br>he is a murderer:<br>put to death, put to death must the murderer be!"
Numbers 35 19,"As for the blood redeemer—<br>he may put to death the murderer,<br>upon meeting him, he may put him to death."
Numbers 35 20,"Now if in hatred he pushed him,<br>or threw [something] at him lying-in-wait, so that he died,"
Numbers 35 21,"or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died,<br>put to death, put to death must the striker be&mdash;<br>he is a murderer:<br>the blood redeemer may put the murderer to death, upon meeting him."
Numbers 35 22,"But if with suddenness, with no [previous] enmity, he pushed him,<br>or threw at him any tool, without lying-in-wait,"
Numbers 35 23,"or with any stone tool through which one can die, without seeing [him],<br>he dropped it on him, so that he died<br>—now he was not his enemy, not one seeking his ill—"
Numbers 35 24,"the community is to judge between the striker and the blood redeemer,<br>according to these regulations;"
Numbers 35 25,"the community is to rescue the murderer from the hand of the blood redeemer,<br>and the community is to return him to his town of asylum, to which he fled;<br>he is to stay in it until the death of the Great Priest<br>who was anointed with the oil of holiness."
Numbers 35 26,"But if the murderer goes out, yes, goes out<br>from the border of his town of asylum, whence he fled,"
Numbers 35 27,"and the blood redeemer finds him, outside the border of his town of asylum,<br>the blood redeemer may murder the murderer;<br>he has no bloodguilt."
Numbers 35 28,"For in his town of asylum he must stay, until the death of the Great Priest;<br>after the death of the Great Priest<br>the murderer may return to the land of his holding."
Numbers 35 29,"These shall be for you<br>as a law of procedure into your generations, throughout all your settlements:"
Numbers 35 30,"whoever strikes down a life,<br>at the mouth of witnesses [only] may a murderer be murdered;<br>one witness [alone] may not testify against the person, to have-him-put-to-death."
Numbers 35 31,"You are not to accept a ransom for the life of a murderer,<br>since he is culpable, [deserving] the death-penalty;<br>indeed, he is to be put to death, put to death!"
Numbers 35 32,"And you are not to accept a ransom<br>for fleeing to his town of asylum,<br>for returning to settle in the land,<br>until the death of the Great Priest."
Numbers 35 33,"You are not to corrupt the land that you are in,<br>for the blood—it will corrupt the land,<br>and the land will not be purged of the blood that has been shed upon it<br>except through the blood of him who shed it."
Numbers 35 34,"You are not to make-<i>tamei</i> the land in which you are settling,<br>in whose midst I dwell,<br>for I am <small>YHWH</small>,<br>Dweller in the midst of Israel!"
Numbers 36 1,"There came near the heads of the Fathers’ [Houses] of a clan of the Sons of Gil’ad son of Makhir son of Menashe, of the clans of the Sons of Yosef;<br>they spoke before Moshe and before the leaders,<br>the heads of the Father[s’ Houses] of the Children of Israel,"
Numbers 36 2,"they said:<br>It is my lord that <small>YHWH</small> has commanded to give out the land as inheritance, by lot, to the Children of Israel,<br>and my lord was commanded by <small>YHWH</small> to give out the inheritance of Tzelofhad our brother, to his daughters."
Numbers 36 3,"Now should they be for one of the members of [another] tribe of the Children of Israel as wives,<br>their inheritance will be diminished from the inheritance of their fathers<br>and be added to the inheritance of the tribe for whom they become [wives];<br>from our allotted inheritance it will be diminished!"
Numbers 36 4,"And when there is a Homebringing for the Children of Israel<br>and their inheritance is added to the inheritance of the tribe for which they are [wives]<br>from the inheritance of our fathers’ tribe,<br>their inheritance will be diminished!"
Numbers 36 5,"So Moshe commanded the Children of Israel by order of <small>YHWH</small>, saying:<br>Rightfully has the tribe of the Sons of Yosef spoken!"
Numbers 36 6,"This is the word that <small>YHWH</small> commands concerning the daughters of Tzelofhad, saying:<br>For those good in their eyes, they may become wives;<br>however, [only] for a clan from the tribe of their father, may they become wives."
Numbers 36 7,"The inheritance of the Children of Israel is not to go round from tribe to tribe;<br>indeed, each one to the inheritance of his father’s tribe is to cleave, [among] the Children of Israel."
Numbers 36 8,"And every daughter who comes-into-possession of inheritance from the tribes of the Children of Israel—<br>for someone from the clan of her father’s tribe she must become a wife,<br>in order that the Children of Israel may remain-in-possession, each one, of the inheritance of his fathers."
Numbers 36 9,"There shall not go round the inheritance of a tribe to another tribe;<br>indeed, each to his inheritance is to cleave, [among] the tribes of the Children of Israel."
Numbers 36 10,"As <small>YHWH</small> had commanded Moshe,<br>thus the daughters of Tzelofhad did."
Numbers 36 11,"They became&mdash; Mahla, Tirtza, Hogla, Milka and No’a, the daughters of Tzelofhad&mdash;wives for the sons of their uncles,"
Numbers 36 12,"in the clans of the Sons of Menashe son of Yosef they became wives,<br>so that their inheritance went along with the tribe of the clan of their father."
Numbers 36 13,"These are the commandments and the regulations <br>that <small>YHWH</small> commanded by the hand of Moshe to the Children of Israel, <br>in the Plains of Moav, by Jordan-Jericho."
Deuteronomy 1 1,"These are the words that Moshe spoke to all Israel<br>in [the country] across the Jordan<br>in the wilderness, in the plains near Suf,<br>between Paran and Tofel, Lavan, Hatzerot, and Di-Zahav—"
Deuteronomy 1 2,"eleven days [it is] from Horev, by the route of Mount Se’ir, [going] by Kadesh-Barne’a."
Deuteronomy 1 3,"And it was in the fortieth year,<br>in the eleventh month, on [day] one of the month:<br>Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel<br>exactly as <small>YHWH</small> had commanded him concerning them,"
Deuteronomy 1 4,"after he had struck<br>Sihon king of the Amorite, who sat [as ruler] in Heshbon,<br>and Og king of Bashan, who sat [as ruler] in Ashtarot, in Edre’i."
Deuteronomy 1 5,"In [the country] across the Jordan, in the land of Moav,<br>Moshe set about to explain this Instruction, saying:"
Deuteronomy 1 6,"<small>YHWH</small> our God spoke to us at Horev, saying:<br>Enough for you, staying at this mountain!"
Deuteronomy 1 7,"Face about, march on<br>and come to the Amorite highlands and to all its dwellers<br>in the Plains, the Highlands and the Lowlands, the Negev/Parched-Land and the shore of the Sea,<br>the land of the Canaanite and the Lebanon,<br>as far as the Great River, the river Euphrates."
Deuteronomy 1 8,"See,<br>I give the land before you;<br>enter, take possession of the land<br>about which <small>YHWH</small> swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitzhak, and to Yaakov,<br>to give to them and to their seed after them."
Deuteronomy 1 9,"And I said to you at that time, saying:<br>I am not able, I alone, to carry you;"
Deuteronomy 1 10,"<small>YHWH</small> your God has made-you-many—<br>and here you are today, like the stars in the heavens in abundance!"
Deuteronomy 1 11,"<small>YHWH</small>, the God of your fathers, may he add to you as you are a thousand times,<br>and bless you, as he promised to you!"
Deuteronomy 1 12,"How can I carry, I alone, your load, your burden, your quarreling?"
Deuteronomy 1 13,"Provide yourselves men, wise, understanding and knowledgeable, for your tribes,<br>and I will set them as heads-over-you."
Deuteronomy 1 14,"And you answered me, you said:<br>Good is the word that you have proposed to do!"
Deuteronomy 1 15,"So I took heads of your tribes, men wise and knowledgeable,<br>and I placed them as heads over you,<br>as rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens, and as officials for your tribes."
Deuteronomy 1 16,"And I commanded your judges at that time, saying:<br>hear-out [what is] between your brothers;<br>judge with equity between each-man and his brother or a sojourner."
Deuteronomy 1 17,"You are not to [specially-]recognize a face in judgment,<br>as the small, so the great, you are to hear-them-out;<br>you are not to be in fear of any-man,<br>for judgment—it is God’s!<br>And [any] legal-matter too hard for you, bring near to me,<br>and I will hear-it-out."
Deuteronomy 1 18,So I commanded you at that time concerning all the matters that you should do.
Deuteronomy 1 19,"We marched on from Horev<br>and traveled through the whole wilderness, that great and awe-inspiring one that you saw,<br>by the Amorite highland route,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> our God commanded us,<br>and we came as far as Kadesh-Barne’a."
Deuteronomy 1 20,And I said to you:<br>You have come to the Amorite highlands that <small>YHWH</small> our God is giving us.
Deuteronomy 1 21,"See,<br><small>YHWH</small> your God has given this land before you;<br>go up, take possession [of it],<br>as <small>YHWH</small> the God of your fathers promised you.<br>Do not be afraid, do not be dismayed!"
Deuteronomy 1 22,"Then you came near to me, all of you, and said:<br>Let us send men before us<br>that they may explore the land for us<br>and return us word<br>about the route that we should [use to] go up against it<br>and about the towns that we will come to."
Deuteronomy 1 23,"The matter was good in my eyes,<br>and so I took from among you twelve men, one man per tribe."
Deuteronomy 1 24,"They faced about and went up into the hills, and came as far as the Wadi of Clusters<br>and spied it out."
Deuteronomy 1 25,They took in their hand some of the fruit of the land and brought [it] down to us<br>and returned us word; they said:<br>Good is the land that <small>YHWH</small> our God is giving us!
Deuteronomy 1 26,Yet you were not willing to go up;<br>you rebelled against the order of <small>YHWH</small> your God.
Deuteronomy 1 27,"You muttered in your tents; you said:<br>Because of <small>YHWH’S</small> hatred for us he took us out of the land of Egypt,<br>to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to wipe us out!"
Deuteronomy 1 28,"To where are we going up?<br>Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying:<br>A people greater and taller than we,<br>towns great and fortified to heaven,<br>and even Children of the Anakites we saw there!"
Deuteronomy 1 29,"But I said to you:<br>Do not shake-in-fear, do not be afraid of them!"
Deuteronomy 1 30,"<small>YHWH</small> your God, who goes before you,<br>he will do battle for you,<br>exactly as he did with you in Egypt, before your eyes,"
Deuteronomy 1 31,"and in the wilderness, where you saw<br>how <small>YHWH</small> your God carried you<br>as a man carries his child,<br>on all the way that you went upon,<br>until your coming to this place."
Deuteronomy 1 32,"Yet in this matter<br>you have not been evincing trust in <small>YHWH</small> your God,"
Deuteronomy 1 33,"who goes before you on the way<br>to scout out for you a place to pitch-your-camp,<br>in fire by night, to show you the way on which you should go,<br>and in a cloud by day!"
Deuteronomy 1 34,"<small>YHWH</small> heard the voice of your words,<br>and he became furious and swore [an oath], saying:"
Deuteronomy 1 35,"If they should get-to-see—a [single] man of all of these men, of this evil generation—<br>the good land that I swore to give to their fathers . . . !"
Deuteronomy 1 36,"Only Calev son of Yefunne, <i>he</i> will get-to-see it,<br>to him I will give the land that he has tread upon, and to his children,<br>in consequence that he fully-followed after <small>YHWH</small>."
Deuteronomy 1 37,"At me also <small>YHWH</small> was incensed for your sakes, saying:<br>You also will not enter there!"
Deuteronomy 1 38,"Yehoshua son of Nun, who stands before you, <i>he</i> will enter there;<br>him [you are to] strengthen,<br>for he will allot-it-as inheritance to Israel."
Deuteronomy 1 39,"Now your little-ones, of whom you said: For plunder will they be,<br>and your children who as of today do not [yet] know good or ill,<br><i>they</i> shall enter there,<br>to them I will give it, and they will take possession of it!"
Deuteronomy 1 40,"As for you, face about, march into the wilderness, by the Reed Sea route."
Deuteronomy 1 41,"But you spoke up; you said to me:<br>We have sinned against <small>YHWH</small>,<br>we will go up and do battle,<br>exactly as <small>YHWH</small> our God commanded us!<br>So each-man girded on his implements of battle<br>and you made bold to go up to the highlands."
Deuteronomy 1 42,"But <small>YHWH</small> said to me:<br>Say to them:<br>You are not to go up, you are not to do battle,<br>for I am not in your midst—<br>so that you not be defeated before your enemies!"
Deuteronomy 1 43,"So I spoke to you,<br>but you did not hearken;<br>you rebelled against the order of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>you brazenly went up to the highlands."
Deuteronomy 1 44,"And the Amorites came out, those who were settled in those highlands, to meet you,<br>they pursued you—as bees do!—<br>and they crushed you at Se’ir, as far as Horma."
Deuteronomy 1 45,"You returned, and you wept before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>but <small>YHWH</small> did not hearken to your voice,<br>he did not give-ear to you."
Deuteronomy 1 46,"So you stayed in Kadesh for many days, like the days you had stayed [there before],"
Deuteronomy 2 1,"and we faced about and marched into the wilderness, by the Reed Sea route,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had spoken to me;<br>we circled around the highlands of Se’ir for many days-and-years."
Deuteronomy 2 2,"Then <small>YHWH</small> said to me, saying:"
Deuteronomy 2 3,"Enough for you, circling around these highlands!<br>Face about, northward!"
Deuteronomy 2 4,"And as for the people, command [them], saying:<br>You are about to cross the territory of your brothers, the Children of Esav, who are settled in Se’ir.<br>Though they are afraid of you,<br>take exceeding care!"
Deuteronomy 2 5,"Do not stir yourselves up against them,<br>for I will not give you of their land so much as the sole of a foot can tread on,<br>for as a possession to Esav I gave the highlands of Se’ir."
Deuteronomy 2 6,"Food you may market from them for silver, that you may eat;<br>and also water you may purchase from them for silver, that you may drink."
Deuteronomy 2 7,For <small>YHWH</small> your God has blessed you in all the works of your hands—<br>he has known your travels in this great wilderness!<br>These forty years <small>YHWH</small> your God is with you;<br>you have not lacked a thing!
Deuteronomy 2 8,"So we crossed on by, away from our brothers, the Children of Esav, who are settled in Se’ir,<br>[away] from the route of the Plain, from Eilat and from Etzion Gever,<br>and we faced about and crossed the route of the Wilderness of Moav."
Deuteronomy 2 9,"<small>YHWH</small> said to me:<br>Do not harass Moav,<br>do not stir yourself up against them in battle,<br>for I will not give you [any] of their land as a possession,<br>for to the Children of Lot I have given Ar as a possession."
Deuteronomy 2 10,"—The Emites/Frightful-Ones were formerly settled there,<br>a people great and many, and tall like the Anakites."
Deuteronomy 2 11,"[As] Refa’ites/Shades are they considered, like the Anakites [are],<br>but the Moavites call them Emites."
Deuteronomy 2 12,"Now in Se’ir the Horites were formerly settled;<br>but the Children of Esav dispossessed them and wiped them out from before them and settled in their place,<br>[just] as Israel did to the land of their possession,<br>which <small>YHWH</small> gave to them.—"
Deuteronomy 2 13,"Now, arise, cross you the Wadi Zered!<br>So we crossed the Wadi Zered."
Deuteronomy 2 14,"And the days that we traveled from Kadesh Barne’a until we crossed the Wadi Zered [were]:<br>thirty-eight years,<br>until all that generation came to an end, the men of battle, from amid the camp,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> had sworn to them."
Deuteronomy 2 15,"Yes, the hand of <small>YHWH</small> was against them, to panic them from amid the camp,<br>until they met their end."
Deuteronomy 2 16,"Now it was, when all the men of battle had ended [their] dying from amid the people,"
Deuteronomy 2 17,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to me, saying:"
Deuteronomy 2 18,"You are crossing today the territory of Moav, Ar."
Deuteronomy 2 19,"[When] you come near, opposite the Children of Ammon,<br>do not harass them, do not stir yourself up against them,<br>for I will not give any of the land of the Children of Ammon to you as a possession,<br>for to the Children of Lot I have given it as a possession."
Deuteronomy 2 20,"It, too, is considered the land of the Refa’ites&mdash;<br>Refa’ites were settled in it in former-times,<br>but the Ammonites call them Zamzummites/Barbarians,"
Deuteronomy 2 21,"a people great and many, tall like the Anakites,<br>and yet <small>YHWH</small> wiped them out from before them, and they dispossessed them,<br>and settled in their place,"
Deuteronomy 2 22,"as he did to the Children of Esav who are settled in Se’ir,<br>that he wiped out the Horites from before them, and they dispossessed them<br>and settled in their place,<br>until this day."
Deuteronomy 2 23,"As for the Avvites who were settled in villages as far as Gaza,<br>Kaftorites who came from Kaftor wiped them out and settled in their place."
Deuteronomy 2 24,"Arise, march on and cross the Wadi Arnon!<br>See, I have given into your hand Sihon king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land;<br>Start! Take-possession!<br>And stir yourself up against him in battle!"
Deuteronomy 2 25,"This day<br>I will start to put the terror of you and the awe of you<br>upon the peoples [that are] under all the heavens,<br>so that when they hear heard-rumors of you,<br>they will shudder and writhe before you."
Deuteronomy 2 26,"Now I sent messengers from the Wilderness of Kedemot to Sihon, king of Heshbon,<br>words of peace, saying:"
Deuteronomy 2 27,"Let me cross through your land;<br>on the main-route, on the main-route I will go&mdash;<br>I will not turn aside right or left."
Deuteronomy 2 28,"As for food, for silver you may market [it] to me, that I may eat,<br>as for water, for silver you may give [it] to me, that I may drink;<br>only: let me cross on foot—"
Deuteronomy 2 29,"as the Children of Esav, who are settled in Se’ir, did for me,<br>and the Moavites, who are settled in Ar,<br>until I have crossed the Jordan<br>into the land that <small>YHWH</small> our God is giving us."
Deuteronomy 2 30,"But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us cross through him,<br>for <small>YHWH</small> your God hardened his spirit and stiffened his heart,<br>in order to give him into your hand, as [is] this day."
Deuteronomy 2 31,"And <small>YHWH</small> said to me:<br>See, I have started to give before you Sihon and his land;<br>start, take possession, to possess his land!"
Deuteronomy 2 32,"And Sihon went out to meet us, he and all his people in battle, at Yahatz,"
Deuteronomy 2 33,"but <small>YHWH</small> our God gave him before us,<br>and we struck him and his sons and all his people."
Deuteronomy 2 34,"We captured all his towns at that time,<br>and devoted-to-destruction every town: menfolk, women, and little-ones;<br>we left no remnant."
Deuteronomy 2 35,"Only the animals did we plunder for ourselves,<br>and the spoils of the towns that we captured."
Deuteronomy 2 36,"From Aro’er, that is on the bank of the Wadi Arnon,<br>and the town that is in the Wadi, as far as Gil’ad,<br>there was not a city that was too lofty for us&mdash;<br>all [of them] <small>YHWH</small> our God gave before us."
Deuteronomy 2 37,"Only the land of the Children of Ammon you did not come near,<br>all the environs of the Wadi Yabbok, and the towns in the highlands,<br>and all about which <small>YHWH</small> our God commanded us."
Deuteronomy 3 1,"We faced about and went up the route to Bashan,<br>and Og king of Bashan came out to meet us,<br>he and all his fighting-people in battle, at Edre’i."
Deuteronomy 3 2,"And <small>YHWH</small> said to me:<br>Do not be afraid of him,<br>for into your hand I give him and all his fighting-people, and his land,<br>you will do to him<br>as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who sat [as ruler] in Heshbon."
Deuteronomy 3 3,"And <small>YHWH</small> our God gave into our hand<br>Og king of Bashan as well, and all his fighting-people;<br>we struck him until there was not left him a survivor."

Deuteronomy 18 14,"For these nations that you are coming-to-possess:<br>to sorcerers and augurers do they hearken,<br>but you—not thus has <small>YHWH</small> your God made you!"
Deuteronomy 18 15,"A prophet from your midst, from your brothers, like myself<br>will <small>YHWH</small> your God raise up for you;<br>to him you are to hearken,"
Deuteronomy 18 16,"just as you asked from <small>YHWH</small> your God at Horev<br>on the day of the Assembly, saying:<br>I cannot continue hearing the voice of <small>YHWH</small> my God, and this great fire I cannot [bear to] see anymore,<br>so that I do not die!"

Deuteronomy 19 3,"Measure yourself the way<br>and divide-in-three the territory of your land<br>that <small>YHWH</small> your God is causing you to inherit.<br>It shall be for fleeing there, for every [accidental] murderer."
Deuteronomy 19 4,"Now this is the matter of the murderer who flees there, that he may stay alive,<br>who strikes down his neighbor with no foreknowledge,<br>nor did he bear hatred toward him from yesterday [and the] day-before;"
Deuteronomy 19 5,"or who comes upon his neighbor in the forest, chopping wood,<br>and his hand swings away with an ax, to cut wood,<br>and the iron-part is dislodged from the wood-part<br>and reaches his neighbor, so that he dies:<br>he may flee to one of these towns, so that he may stay-alive"
Deuteronomy 19 6,"—lest the blood redeemer pursue the murderer,<br>since his heart is hot-blooded,<br>and overtake him—since the journey is long—and strike his life,<br>though his is not a judgment of death;<br>since he has not borne-hatred toward him, from yesterday [and the] day-before."
Deuteronomy 19 7,"Therefore I command you, saying:<br>Three towns you are to separate for yourself."
Deuteronomy 19 8,"Now if <small>YHWH</small> your God should broaden your territory<br>as he swore to your fathers,<br>and give you all the land<br>that he promised to give your fathers:"
Deuteronomy 19 9,"indeed, you are to keep all this commandment, by observing it,<br>that I command you today,<br>to love <small>YHWH</small> your God, and to walk in his ways, all the days;<br>and you are to add for yourself another three towns to these three,"
Deuteronomy 19 10,"so that the blood of the innocent not be shed amid your land<br>that <small>YHWH</small> your God is giving you as an inheritance,<br>and there be bloodguilt upon you!"
Deuteronomy 19 11,"But if it should be [that] a man bears-hatred toward his neighbor<br>and waits-in-ambush for him<br>and rises up against him and strikes his life, so that he dies,<br>and he flees to one of these towns:"
Deuteronomy 19 12,"the elders of his town are to send and have him taken from there;<br>they are to give him into the hand of the blood redeemer, so that he dies."

Deuteronomy 19 17,"and the two men who have the quarrel stand before the presence of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>before the presence of the priests or the judges who are [there] in those days:"
Deuteronomy 19 18,"the judges are to inquire well;<br>and [if] here, a false witness is the witness, falsely has he testified against his brother:"
Deuteronomy 19 19,you are to do to him<br>as he schemed to do to his brother.<br>So shall you eradicate the evil from your midst!
Deuteronomy 19 20,Those who remain will hear and will be-awed;<br>they will not continue to do any more according to this evil practice in your midst.

Deuteronomy 20 6,"And who is the man<br>that has planted a vineyard and has not made-common-use of it?<br>Let him go and return to his house,<br>lest he die in the battle<br>and another man make-common-use-of it!"

Deuteronomy 29 4,"I had you travel for forty years in the wilderness;<br>there did not wear out your garments from upon you,<br>your sandal did not wear out from upon your foot,"
Deuteronomy 29 5,"bread you did not eat,<br>wine and beer you did not drink,<br>in order that you might know<br>that I am <small>YHWH</small> your God."
Deuteronomy 29 6,"[When] you came to this place,<br>Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to meet you in battle,<br>but we struck them down,"
Deuteronomy 29 7,"we took away their land and gave it as an inheritance<br>to the Re’uvenites and to the Gadites, and to half the Menashite tribe."
Deuteronomy 29 8,"So you are to take care regarding the words of this covenant,<br>and are to observe them,<br>in order that you may act-wisely in all that you do."
Deuteronomy 29 9,"You are stationed today, all of you,<br>before the presence of <small>YHWH</small> your God:<br>your heads, your tribes, your elders and your officials,<br>all the men of Israel,"
Deuteronomy 29 10,"your little-ones, your wives, your sojourner who is amid your encampments,<br>from your woodchopper to your waterhauler,"
Deuteronomy 29 11,"for you to cross over into the covenant of <small>YHWH</small> your God, and into his oath-of-fealty<br>that <small>YHWH</small> your God is cutting with you today—"
Deuteronomy 29 12,"in order that he may establish you today for him as a people,<br>with him being for you as a god,<br>as he promised you<br>and as he swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitzhak, and to Yaakov."
Deuteronomy 29 13,"Not with you, you-alone<br>do I cut this covenant and this oath,"
Deuteronomy 29 14,"but with the one who is here, standing with us today<br>before the presence of <small>YHWH</small> our God,<br>and with the one who is not here with us today."
Deuteronomy 29 15,"Indeed, you yourselves know<br>how we were settled in the land of Egypt,<br>and how we crossed amid the nations that you crossed;"
Deuteronomy 29 16,"you saw their Detestable Things and their Illicit Things,<br>of wood and stone, of silver and of gold, that were with them—"
Deuteronomy 29 17,"[beware] lest there be among you a man or a woman, a clan or a tribe<br>whose heart faces away today from <small>YHWH</small> our God<br>by going to serve the gods of those nations,<br>lest there be among you a root bearing-fruit of wormwood and poison-herb;"
Deuteronomy 29 18,"for it shall be<br>when he hears the words of this oath<br>and blesses himself in his heart, saying:<br>I will have <i>shalom,</i><br>though in the stubbornness of my heart I will walk—<br>with the result of “sweeping away the watered and the parched [alike],”"
Deuteronomy 29 19,"[that] <small>YHWH</small> will not consent to grant-him-pardon;<br>rather, then the anger of <small>YHWH</small> will smoke, along with his zealous-rage, against that man,<br>and there will crouch upon him all the oath-curse<br>that is written in this Record,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> will blot-out his name from under the heavens!"
Deuteronomy 29 20,"<small>YHWH</small> will set him apart for ill from all the tribes of Israel,<br>according to all the oath-curses of the covenant<br>that are written in this Record of Instruction."
Deuteronomy 29 21,"Then shall say a later generation,<br>your children who arise after you<br>and the foreigner that comes from a land far off,<br>when they see the blows [dealt] this land<br>and its sicknesses with which <small>YHWH</small> has made-it-sick:"
Deuteronomy 29 22,"by brimstone and salt is all its land burnt;<br>it cannot be sown, it cannot sprout [anything],<br>there cannot spring up in it any herbage—<br>like the overturning of Sedom and Amora, Adma and Tzvoyim<br>that <small>YHWH</small> overturned in his anger, in his venemous-wrath."
Deuteronomy 29 23,"Then all the nations shall say:<br>For what did <small>YHWH</small> do thus to this land,<br>[for] what was this great flaming anger?"
Deuteronomy 29 24,And they shall say [in reply]:<br>Because they abandoned the covenant of <small>YHWH</small> the God of their fathers<br>that he cut with them when he took them out of the land of Egypt:
Deuteronomy 29 25,"they went and served other gods and bowed down to them,<br>gods they had not known and that he had not apportioned to them."
Deuteronomy 29 26,"So the anger of <small>YHWH</small> flared up against that land,<br>to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this Record."
Deuteronomy 29 27,"And <small>YHWH</small> uprooted them from their land<br>in anger, wrath, and great fury,<br>and he cast them into another land, as [is] this day."
Deuteronomy 29 28,"The hidden things are for <small>YHWH</small> our God,<br>but the revealed things are for us and for our children, for the ages,<br>to observe all the words of this Instruction."
Deuteronomy 30 1,"Now it shall be:<br>when there come upon you all these things,<br>the blessing and the curse that I have set before you,<br>and you take them to your heart<br>among all the nations where <small>YHWH</small> your God has led you away,"
Deuteronomy 30 2,"and you return to <small>YHWH</small> your God and hearken to his voice,<br>exactly as I command you today,<br>you and your children,<br>with all your heart and with all your being,"
Deuteronomy 30 3,"that <small>YHWH</small> your God will restore your fortunes, and have compassion on you:<br>he will return to collect you from all the peoples<br>wherein <small>YHWH</small> your God has scattered you."
Deuteronomy 30 4,"If you be led away to the ends of the heavens,<br>from there <small>YHWH</small> your God will collect you, from there he will take you,"
Deuteronomy 30 5,"and <small>YHWH</small> your God will bring you<br>to the land that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it,<br>he will do-well by you and make you many-more than your fathers."
Deuteronomy 30 6,"<small>YHWH</small> your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed,<br>to love <small>YHWH</small> your God with all your heart and with all your being,<br>in order that you may live."
Deuteronomy 30 7,"<small>YHWH</small> your God will place all those threats upon your enemies and on those hatingyou, those pursuing you;"
Deuteronomy 30 8,while you will return and hearken to the voice of <small>YHWH</small><br>and observe all his commandments that I command you today:
Deuteronomy 30 9,"<small>YHWH</small> your God will make you excel in all the doings of your hands,<br>in the fruit of your womb and in the fruit of your animals, and in the fruit of your land, to good-measure,<br>indeed, <small>YHWH</small> will return to delighting in you, to [your] good,<br>as he delighted in your fathers—"
Deuteronomy 30 10,"if you hearken to the voice of <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>by keeping his commandments and his laws—what is written in this Record of Instruction—<br>if you return to <small>YHWH</small> your God with all your heart and with all your being."
Deuteronomy 30 11,"For the commandment that I command you today:<br>it is not too extraordinary for you,<br>it is not too far away!"
Deuteronomy 30 12,"It is not in the heavens,<br>[for you] to say:<br>Who will go up for us to the heavens and get it for us<br>and have us hear it, that we may observe it?"
Deuteronomy 30 13,"And it is not across the sea,<br>[for you] to say:<br>Who will cross for us, across the sea, and get it for us<br>and have us hear it, that we may observe it?"
Deuteronomy 30 14,"Rather, near to you is the word, exceedingly,<br>in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it!"
Deuteronomy 30 15,"See, I set before you today<br>life and good, and death and evil:"
Deuteronomy 30 16,"in that I command you today<br>to love <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>to walk in his ways<br>and to keep his commandments, his laws and his regulations,<br>that you may stay-alive and become-many<br>and <small>YHWH</small> your God may bless you<br>in the land that you are entering to possess."
Deuteronomy 30 17,"Now if your heart should face about, and you do not hearken,<br>and you be led and bow down to other gods, and serve them,"
Deuteronomy 30 18,"I declare to you today<br>that you will perish, yes, prish;<br>you will not prolong days on the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter, to possess."
Deuteronomy 30 19,"I call-as-witness against you today the heavens and the earth:<br>life and death I place before you, blessing and curse;<br>so choose life, in order that you may stay alive, you and your seed,"
Deuteronomy 30 20,"by loving <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>by hearkening to his voice and by cleaving to him,<br>for he is your life and the length of your days,<br>to be settled on the land<br>that <small>YHWH</small> swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitzhak and to Yaakov,<br>to give them!"
Deuteronomy 31 1,Now Moshe went<br>and spoke these words to all Israel;
Deuteronomy 31 2,"he said to them:<br>A hundred and twenty years old am I today;<br>I am no longer able to go out and to come in,<br>and <small>YHWH</small> has said to me:<br>you are not to cross over this Jordan!"
Deuteronomy 31 3,"<small>YHWH</small> your God, <i>he</i> will cross over before you;<br>he will wipe out those nations from before you, so that you may dispossess them.<br>Yehoshua, he will cross over before you,<br>as <small>YHWH</small> has promised."
Deuteronomy 31 4,"<small>YHWH</small> will do to them<br>as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land,<br>that he wiped them out."
Deuteronomy 31 5,<small>YHWH</small> will give them before you<br>and you will do to them<br>exactly as the command that I have commanded you.
Deuteronomy 31 6,"Be strong and be courageous;<br>do not be afraid, do not be terrified before them,<br>for <small>YHWH</small> your God, he is the one who goes with you;<br>he will not desert you, he will not abandon you!"
Deuteronomy 31 7,"Then Moshe called Yehoshua<br>and said to him, before the eyes of all Israel:<br>Be strong and courageous,<br>for you yourself will enter with this people<br>the land about which <small>YHWH</small> swore to your fathers, to give them;<br>you yourself will allot-it-as-inheritance to them."
Deuteronomy 31 8,"And <small>YHWH</small>, he is the one who goes before you&mdash;<br>he will be with you;<br>he will not desert you, he will not abandon you;<br>you are not to be afraid, you are not to be shattered!"
Deuteronomy 31 9,"Moshe wrote down this Instruction<br>and gave it to the priests, the Sons of Levi,<br>those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>and to all the elders of Israel."
Deuteronomy 31 10,"And Moshe commanded them, saying:<br>At the end of seven years,<br>at the appointed-time of the Year of Release, on the pilgrimage-festival of Sukkot,"
Deuteronomy 31 11,"when all Israel comes<br>to be seen at the presence of <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>at the place that he chooses,<br>you are to proclaim this Instruction<br>in front of all Israel, in their hearing."
Deuteronomy 31 12,"Assemble the people,<br>the men, the women, and the little-ones,<br>and your sojourner who is within your gates,<br>in order that they may hearken, in order that they may learn<br>and have-awe-for <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>and take care to observe all the words of this Instruction;"
Deuteronomy 31 13,"and [that] their children, who do not know,<br>may hearken and learn<br>to have awe for <small>YHWH</small> your God,<br>all the days that you remain alive on the land<br>that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess."
Deuteronomy 31 14,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Here, your days are drawing-near to die.<br>Call Yehoshua and station yourselves at the Tent of Appointment,<br>that I may command him.<br>So Moshe went, along with Yehoshua,<br>they stationed themselves at the Tent of Appointment."
Deuteronomy 31 15,"And <small>YHWH</small> was seen at the Tent of Appointment, in a column of cloud,<br>and the column of cloud stood over the entrance to the Tent of Appointment."
Deuteronomy 31 16,"<small>YHWH</small> said to Moshe:<br>Here, you are about to lie beside your fathers;<br>now this people will proceed<br>to go whoring after the gods of the foreigner of the land<br>that they are entering in his midst;<br>they will abandon me<br>and violate my covenant that I have cut with them."
Deuteronomy 31 17,"And my anger will flare up against them on that day.<br>I will abandon them and I will conceal my face from them;<br>[they] will be [ripe] for devouring,<br>and there will befall them many and troubling evils.<br>And they will say on that day:<br>Was it not because God was not in my midst<br>[that] there have befallen me these evils?"
Deuteronomy 31 18,"But I, I will conceal, yes, conceal my face on that day,<br>because of all the evil that they have done,<br>for they faced about to other gods!"
Deuteronomy 31 19,"But now, write yourselves down this song;<br>teach it to the Children of Israel, put it in their mouths,<br>in order that this song may be for you as a witness against the Children of Israel."
Deuteronomy 31 20,"When I bring them to the land about which I swore to their fathers,<br>flowing with milk and honey,<br>and they eat, and are satisfied, and grow fat,<br>and they face about to other gods, and serve them,<br>and spurn me and violate my covenant:"
Deuteronomy 31 21,"it will be,<br>when there befall them many and troubling evils,<br>that this song will speak up before their presence as a witness,<br>for it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their seed.<br>Indeed, I know the plans that they are making today,<br>[even] before I bring them into the land about which I swore!"
Deuteronomy 31 22,"So Moshe wrote down this song on that day,<br>and he taught it to the Children of Israel."
Deuteronomy 31 23,"Now he commanded Yehoshua son of Nun<br>and said:<br>Be strong and courageous,<br>for you will bring the Children of Israel<br>to the land about which I swore to them;<br>and I myself will be with you."
Deuteronomy 31 24,"And it was, when Moshe had finished writing down the words of this Instruction in a record, until they were ended,"
Deuteronomy 31 25,"that Moshe commanded the Levites,<br>those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>saying:"
Deuteronomy 31 26,Take this Record of the Instruction<br>and place it beside the Coffer of the Covenant of <small>YHWH</small> your God;<br>let it be there among you as a witness.
Deuteronomy 31 27,"For I myself know your rebelliousness,<br>and your hard neck;<br>here, while I am yet alive with you today,<br>you have been rebellious against <small>YHWH</small>—<br>more so after my death!"
Deuteronomy 31 28,"Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officials,<br>that I may speak these words in their hearing,<br>that I may call-to-witness against them the heavens and the earth."
Deuteronomy 31 29,"For I know:<br>after my death, indeed, you will wreak ruin, yes, ruin;<br>you will turn aside from the way that I have commanded you,<br>and call down upon yourselves evil in future days,<br>for you will do what is evil in the eyes of <small>YHWH</small>,<br>provoking him through the doings of your hands!"
Deuteronomy 31 30,"So Moshe spoke in the ears of the entire assembly of Israel<br>the words of this song, until they were ended:"
Deuteronomy 32 1,"Give ear, O heavens, that I may speak,<br>hear, O earth, the utterance of my mouth."
Deuteronomy 32 2,"Let my teaching drip like rain,<br>let my words flow like dew,<br>like droplets on new-growth,<br>like showers on grass."
Deuteronomy 32 3,"For the name of <small>YHWH</small> I proclaim,<br>give greatness to our God!"

Deuteronomy 32 5,"His children have wrought-ruin toward him—a defect in them,<br>a generation crooked and twisted!"
Deuteronomy 32 6,"[Is it] <small>YHWH</small> whom you [thus] pay back,<br>O people foolish and not wise?<br>Is he not your father, your creator,<br>he [who] made you and established you?"
Deuteronomy 32 7,"Regard the days of ages-past,<br>understand the years of generation and generation [ago];<br>ask your father, he will tell you,<br>your elders, they will declare it to you:"
Deuteronomy 32 8,"when the Most-High gave nations [their] inheritances,<br>at his dividing the human-race,<br>he stationed boundaries for peoples<br>by the number of the gods."
Deuteronomy 32 9,"Indeed, the portion of <small>YHWH</small> became his people,<br>Yaakov, the lot of his inheritance."
Deuteronomy 32 10,"He found him in a wilderness land,<br>in chaos, a howling desert.<br>He surrounded him, he paid-him-attention,<br>he guarded him like the pupil of his eye;"
Deuteronomy 32 11,"like an eagle protecting its nest,<br>over its young-birds hovering,<br>he spread out his wings, he took him,<br>and bore him on his pinions."
Deuteronomy 32 12,"<small>YHWH</small> alone did lead them,<br>not with him any foreign god!"
Deuteronomy 32 13,"He had them mount on the high-places of the land,<br>he fed them the crops of the field;<br>he suckled them with honey from a boulder,<br>with oil from a flinty rock;"
Deuteronomy 32 14,"on curds of cattle and milk of sheep,<br>along with the milk of lambs and rams,<br>of the young of Bashan and he-goats,<br>along with the kidney fat of wheat,<br>and blood of the grapes, you drank fermented [wine]."
Deuteronomy 32 15,"But Yeshurun grew fat and kicked,<br>you were fat, you were gross, you were gorged,<br>he forsook the God that made him,<br>and treated-like-a-fool the Rock of his deliverance."
Deuteronomy 32 16,"They enraged him with alien [gods],<br>with abominations they provoked him."
Deuteronomy 32 17,"They sacrificed to demons, no-gods,<br>gods they had not known;<br>new-ones from nearby came,<br>of whom your fathers had no idea."
Deuteronomy 32 18,"The Rock that birthed you, you neglected,<br>you forgot the God that produced-you-in-labor."
Deuteronomy 32 19,"<small>YHWH</small> saw, and he spurned [you],<br>out of the provocation of his sons and daughters."
Deuteronomy 32 20,"He said: I will conceal my face from them,<br>I will see what is their future.<br>Indeed, a generation of overturning are they,<br>children in whom one cannot trust."
Deuteronomy 32 21,"They aroused my zealous-rage with a no-god,<br>provoked me with their nothingnesses;<br>so I will arouse their rage with a no-people,<br>with a nation of fools I will provoke them!"
Deuteronomy 32 22,"For fire is kindled in my nostrils,<br>it burns [down] to Sheol, below,<br>it devours the earth and its yield,<br>and sets-ablaze the hills’ foundations."

Deuteronomy 32 25,"Outside, the sword bereaves,<br>in rooms-within, Terror!<br>[Destroying] young-man and virgin alike,<br>the nurseling along with the gray-haired man."
Deuteronomy 32 26,"I would have said: I will cleave-them-in-pieces,<br>I will make their memory cease from mortals,"
Deuteronomy 32 27,"—except that I feared the provocation from the enemy,<br>lest their foes misconstrue,<br>lest they say: Our hand is raised high&mdash;<br>not <small>YHWH</small> wrought all this!"
Deuteronomy 32 28,"For a nation straying from counsel are they,<br>in them there is no understanding."
Deuteronomy 32 29,"If [only] they were wise, they would contemplate this,<br>they would understand their future!"
Deuteronomy 32 30,"How can one pursue a thousand,<br>two put a myriad to flight,<br>unless their Rock had sold them out,<br><small>YHWH</small> had handed them over?"
Deuteronomy 32 31,"For not like their rock is our Rock,<br>though our enemies [so] assess it;<br>indeed, from the vine of Sedom is their vine,"

Deuteronomy 32 36,"But <small>YHWH</small> will judge [in favor of] his people,<br>regarding his servants he will repent,<br>when he sees that strength-of-hand is gone,<br>naught [left] of [even] fettered and forsaken."
Deuteronomy 32 37,"He will say: Where are its gods,<br>the rock in whom it sought-refuge,"

Deuteronomy 32 45,"[When] Moshe had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,"
Deuteronomy 32 46,"he said to them:<br>Set your hearts toward all these words which I call-as-witness among you today,<br>that you may command your children<br>to take care to observe all the words of this Instruction."
Deuteronomy 32 47,"Indeed, no empty word is it for you,<br>indeed, it is your [very] life;<br>through this word you shall prolong [your] days upon the land<br>that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess."
Deuteronomy 32 48,"<small>YHWH</small> spoke to Moshe on that same day, saying:"
Deuteronomy 32 49,"Go up these heights of Avarim/The-Region-Across, Mount Nevo<br>that is in the land of Moav,<br>that faces Jericho,<br>and see the land of Canaan<br>that I am giving to the Children of Israel for a holding."
Deuteronomy 32 50,"You are to die on the mountain that you are going up,<br>and are to be gathered to your kinspeople,<br>as Aharon your brother died on Hill’s Hill<br>and was gathered to his kinspeople"
Deuteronomy 32 51,"—because you [both] broke-faith with me<br>in the midst of the Children of Israel<br>at the waters of Merivat Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Tzyn,<br>because you did not treat-me-as-holy<br>in the midst of the Children of Israel."
Deuteronomy 32 52,"Indeed, at a distance you shall see the land,<br>but there you shall not enter,<br>the land that I am giving to the Children of Israel."
Deuteronomy 33 1,Now this is the blessing<br>with which Moshe the man of God blessed the Children of Israel<br>before his death.
Deuteronomy 33 2,"He said:<br> <small>YHWH</small> from Sinai came,<br>he shone forth from Se’ir for them,<br>radiating from Mount Paran,<br>approaching from Rivevot Kodesh,<br>at his right-hand, a fiery stream for them."
