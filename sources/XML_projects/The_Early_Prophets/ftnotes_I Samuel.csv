I Samuel 9:42,[]
I Samuel 9:43,"<b>Ahinoam:</b> Levenson (1978) makes the case that she is Sha’ul’s wife (see 14:50), thus explaining the prophet Natan’s words in II Sam. 12:7–8, “I gave you … the wives of your lord.” A son or successor stealing away/sleeping with his predecessor’s wife or concubine thus established his new power base; in this passage, the process is muted but present."
I Samuel 9:44,<b>Gallim:</b> Location unknown.
I Samuel 9:45,"<b>with the name:</b> A more conventional rendering would be “in the name,” but the Hebrew preposition is the same as the many “withs” earlier in the verse."
I Samuel 9:46,<b>your carcass and:</b> Added by LXX.
I Samuel 9:47,"<b>had captured:</b> The Hebrew verb (<i>l-k-d</i>) is often connected to the casting of lots, as in v.41 above, and also 10:20–21, as well as referring to conquest. <b>Moav … Edom:</b> Pronounced <i>mo-AHV</i> and <i>eh-DOHM.</i> Along with Ammon, these were traditional enemies who were understood in Genesis to come from the same stock as Israel. The Moabites inhabited the region due east of the Dead Sea, with the Edomites occupying the area to the south of that. <b>king:</b> So ancient versions; MT has “kings.” <b>Tzova:</b> The area north of Damascus, <b>was victorious:</b> Reading MT’s <i>yrsh’</i> (“did wrong,” “was blameworthy”), which makes no sense here, as <i>ywsh’,</i> following LXX and other ancient versions."
I Samuel 9:48,[]
I Samuel 9:49,"<b>forehead:</b> Some understand this instead as the shin or a spot on the leg not covered by armor, which would perhaps better explain Golyat’s literal and forward-moving downfall."
I Samuel 9:50,"<b>Aviner:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-vee-NAYR.</i> Usually spelled as “Avner” in the text; similar, in II Samuel, are “Aminon/Amnon” and “Avishalom/Avshalom.” The name means “Father [God] Is a Light/Lamp.” He is also, as indicated in the next verse, Sha’ul’s cousin. Trad. English “Abner.”"
I Samuel 9:51,[]
I Samuel 9:52,<b>Gat … Ekron:</b> All the way back to the Philistine cities.
I Samuel 9:53,[]
I Samuel 9:54,"<b>Jerusalem:</b> Another anomaly in the text; it will not be an Israelite city until David himself conquers it in II Sam. 5. Similarly, as a nonwarrior, David would not have had his own tent."
I Samuel 9:55,"<b>Whose son:</b> Since in the ancient Near East, kings were sometimes referred to as “sons of the gods,” Sha’ul’s question is not as innocent as it seems, at least to the audience. See II Sam. 7:14."
