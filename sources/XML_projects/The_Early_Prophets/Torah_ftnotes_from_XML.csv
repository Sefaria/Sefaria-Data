"Genesis 1:1 <b>At the beginning…</b>:This phrase, which has long been the focus of debate among grammarians, is traditionally read: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” B-R agrees, I have followed several medieval commentators, and most moderns, in my rendition, <b>creating:</b> Indicative of God’s power and not used in reference to humans, although later in the chapter such words as “make” and “form” do appear, <b>the heavens and the earth:</b> Probably a merism—an inclusive idiom meaning “everything” or “everywhere“—such as in Hamlet’s “There are more things in heaven and earth. …”"
"Genesis 1:2 <b>when the earth … :</b> Gen. 1 describes God’s bringing order out of chaos, not creation from nothingness. <b>wild and waste:</b> Heb. <i>tohu va-vohu</i>, indicating “emptiness.” <b>Ocean:</b> The primeval waters, a common (and usually divine) image in ancient Near Eastern mythology, <b>rushing-spirit:</b> Others, “wind.” The Hebrew word <i>ruah</i> can mean both “spirit” and “wind.” See Ps. 33:6. <b>hovering:</b> Or “flitting.” The image suggested by the word (see Deut. 32:11) is that of an eagle protecting its young."
"Genesis 1:3-5 <b>God said … God saw … God separated … God called:</b> Here, from the outset of the story, the principle of order is stressed, through the rhythmic structure of “God” plus verb, four times."
"Genesis 1:4 <b>God saw … that it was good:</b> The syntax is emphatic; others use “God saw how good it was.” The phrase is reminiscent of ancient Near Eastern descriptions of a craftsman being pleased with his work. <b>separated:</b> The verb occurs four more times early in the chapter (vv.6, 7, 14, 18), and further points to the motif of order."
Genesis 1:5 <b>setting … dawning:</b> The Heb. terms <i>erev</i> and <i>boker</i> are rather more specific than the usual “evening” and “morning.” Elsewhere I have used “sunset” and “daybreak”; the latter would have clashed with “day” in these lines.
"Genesis 1:6 <b>dome:</b> Heb. <i>raki’a</i>, literally a beaten sheet of metal."
Genesis 1:8 <b>Heaven!:</b> The sky.
"Genesis 1:11 <b>sprout forth with sprouting-growth … seed forth seeds … fruit trees … fruit:</b> The three sound doublets create a poetic effect in God’s pronouncement. Note that they are not repeated by the narrator in verse 12. See also v.20, “… swarm with a swarm …” <b>after their kind:</b> Here as in a number of passages in the translation I have shifted some words that occur in the singular (especially collectives) for the sake of clarity. See, for example, 6:3, 5."
Genesis 1:14 <b>lights:</b> In the sense of “lamps.” <b>for signs—for set-times …</b>: Hebrew difficult.
Genesis 1:21 <b>great sea-serpents:</b> The rebellious primeval monster of Ps. 74:13 (and common in ancient Near Eastern myth) is here depicted as merely another one of God’s many creations.
"Genesis 1:22 <b>And God blessed them:</b> The first occurrence in Genesis of the key motif of blessing, which recurs especially throughout the Patriarchal stories. <b>Bear fruit and be many and fill:</b> Heb. <i>peru u-revu u-mil’u</i>."
"Genesis 1:26 <b>in our image:</b> The “our” is an old problem. Some take it to refer to the heavenly court (although, not surprisingly, no angels are mentioned here)."
"Genesis 1:27 <b>God created humankind:</b> The narrative breaks into verse, stressing the importance of human beings. “Humankind” (Heb. <i>adam</i>) does not specify sex, as is clear from the last line of the poem."
Genesis 1:29 <b>I give you:</b> “You” in the plural.
"Genesis 1:30 <b>all green plants for eating:</b> Human beings in their original state were not meat-eaters. For the change, see 9:3ff."
"Genesis 1:31 <b>exceedingly good … the sixth day:</b> The two qualifiers “exceedingly” and “the” are deviations from the previous expressions in the story, and underscore the sixth day (when humankind was created) as the crowning achievement of creation (or else serve as a summary to the whole)."
"Genesis 2:3 <b>gave … his blessing:</b> Or “blessed,” here expanded in English for rhythmical reasons, <b>by creating, God had made:</b> Hebrew difficult. Buber’s working papers show numerous attempts at a solution."
"Genesis 2:4 <b>Y<small>HWH</small></b> For a discussion of the name of God and its translation and pronunciation, see p. xxix."
"Genesis 2:5 <b>human/<i>adam</i> … soil/<i>adama:</i></b> The sound connection, the first folk etymology in the Bible, establishes the intimacy of humankind with the ground (note the curses in 3:17 and 4:11). Human beings are created from the soil, just as animals are (v.19). Some have suggested “human … humus” to reflect the wordplay."
Genesis 2:6 <b>surge:</b> Or “flow.”
"Genesis 2:8 <b>Eden/Land-of-Pleasure:</b> For another use of the Hebrew root, see 18:12. The usage here may be a folk etymology; Speiser translates it as “steppe.”"
"Genesis 2:9 <b>Tree of Life:</b> Conferring immortality on the eater of its fruit. <b>Knowing of Good and Evil:</b> Interpreters disagree on the meaning of this phrase. It could be a merism (as in “knowledge from A to Z”—that is, of everything), or an expression of moral choice."
Genesis 2:10 <b>stream-heads:</b> Branches or tributaries.
"Genesis 2:12 <b>bdellium … carnelian:</b> Identification uncertain; others suggest, for instance, “lapis” and “onyx.”"
"Genesis 2:15 <b>work:</b> A different Hebrew word (here, <i>avod</i>) from the one used in 2:2–3 (<i>melakha</i>)."
"Genesis 2:16 <b>eat, yes, eat:</b> Heb. <i>akhol tokhel</i>, literally, “eating you may eat.” Others use “you may freely eat”; I have followed B-R’s practice of doubling the verb throughout, which retains the sound as well as the meaning. In this passage, as in many instances, I have inserted the word “yes” for rhythmical reasons."
"Genesis 2:17 <b>die, yes, die:</b> Others use “surely die.”"
"Genesis 2:18 <b>It is not good:</b> In contrast to the refrain of Gen. I, “God saw that it was good.” <b>corresponding to:</b> Lit. “opposite.” The whole phrase (Heb. <i>ezer kenegdo</i>) could be rendered “a helping counterpart.” At any rate, the Hebrew does not suggest a subordinate position for women."
Genesis 2:20 <b>called out:</b> Or “gave.” <b>for the human:</b> Others use “for Adam” or “for a man.”
"Genesis 2:21 <b>ribs:</b> Or possibly “sides,” paralleling other ancient peoples’ concept of an original being that was androgynous."
Genesis 2:23 <b>She:</b> Lit. “this-one.”
"Genesis 3:1 <b>Even though God said:</b> Others use “Did God really say… ?” <b>in the garden…!:</b> Such an uncompleted phrase, known as aposeopesis, leaves it to the reader to complete the speaker’s thought which in the Bible is usually an oath or a threat (see also, for instance, 14:23, 21:23, 26:29, 31:50)."
"Genesis 3:5 <b>you:</b> Plural, <b>like gods:</b> Or “like God.”"
Genesis 3:7 <b>then:</b> Added in English to avoid a “knew-nude” rhyme.
"Genesis 3:8 <b>breezy-time:</b> Evening, <b>face of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The “face” or presence of God is a dominating theme in many biblical stories and in the book of Psalms. People seek God’s face or hide from it; God reveals it to them or hides it from them."
"Genesis 3:12 <b>gave to be:</b> Put. “Give” has been retained here, despite its awkwardness, as a repeating word in the narrative."
"Genesis 3:15 <b>seed:</b> Offspring, descendants."
"Genesis 3:17 <b>painstaking-labor:</b> Heb. <i>itzavon</i>. Man and woman receive equal curses (see v.16, “pain … pains”)."
Genesis 3:18 <b>sting-shrub:</b> Heb. <i>dardar;</i> thistle (“thorns and thistles” suggests an alliteration not found in the Hebrew).
Genesis 3:20 <b>Havva:</b> Trad. English “Eve.”
"Genesis 3:21 <b>God … clothed them:</b> Once punishment has been pronounced, God cares for the man and the woman. Both aspects of God comprise the biblical understanding of his nature, and they are not exclusive of each other."
Genesis 3:22 <b>one of us:</b> See note on 1:26. <b>throughout the ages:</b> Or “for the eons”; others use “forever.”
"Genesis 3:24 <b>winged-sphinxes:</b> Mythical ancient creatures, also represented on the Ark of the Covenant (Ex. 25:18). “Cherubim,” the traditional English rendering, has come to denote chubby, red-cheeked baby angels in Western art, an image utterly foreign to the ancient Near East."
"Genesis 4:1 <b>knew:</b> Intimately; a term for sexual intercourse. <b>Kayin:</b> Trad. English “Cain.” The name means “smith” (see also v.22, below). <b>I-have-gotten:</b> Others use “I have created.” <b>as has YHWH:</b> Hebrew difficult."
Genesis 4:2 <b>Hevel:</b> The name suggests “something transitory” (see the opening of the book of Ecclesiastes: <i>havel havalim</i>).
"Genesis 4:3 <b>gift:</b> Heb. <i>minha</i>, usually referring to sacrifices of grain."
"Genesis 4:4 <b>fat-parts:</b> I.e., the choicest."
"Genesis 4:7 <b>Is it not thus …:</b> Hebrew obscure, <b>bear-it-aloft:</b> Others use “there is forgiveness,” “there is uplift.” <b>toward you his lust—/ but you can rule over him:</b> Recalling God’s words to Hawa in 3:16."
"Genesis 4:8 <b>Kayin said …:</b> The verse appears incomplete. Ancient versions add “Come, let us go out into the field.”"
Genesis 4:10 <b>A sound:</b> Or “Hark!”
"Genesis 4:15 <b>a sign:</b> The exact appearance of the sign is not specified. It is a warning and a protection, not the punishment itself (which is exile)."
Genesis 4:17 <b>Now he:</b> “He” refers to Kayin.
Genesis 4:18 <b>Mehuyael begot:</b> Heb. <i>Mehiyael</i>.
Genesis 4:19 <b>Ada … Tzilla:</b> The names suggest “dawn” and “dusk” (Gaster).
Genesis 4:20 <b>father:</b> Ancestor or founder.
Genesis 4:22 <b>burnisher…:</b> Or “craftsman of every cutting-edge of copper and iron.”
"Genesis 4:26 <b>called out the name of Y<small>HWH</small></b> I.e., worshiped God."
"Genesis 5:1 <b>At the time …:</b> The language is reminiscent of the earlier poem in 1:27. In this case, however, the Hebrew creates a rhyming effect. The cola of the poem here end thus: <i>bera’am / otam / shemam: Adam / hibare’am</i>. Such a rhyming scheme is rare in biblical Hebrew, and usually endows a passage with particular significance (see also, for instance, II Sam. 12:11)."
Genesis 5:18 <b>Hanokh:</b> Trad. English “Enoch.”
"Genesis 5:22 <b>and Hanokh walked in accord with God … three hundred years:</b> The variation from the rigid formulations of this chapter draws attention to this key figure, the first pious man (similarly with Noah, 5:29). “Walked in accord with God” means walked in God’s ways, led a righteous life."
"Genesis 5:24 <b>then he was no more:</b> He died. Later interpreters found the phrase ambiguous, and fantastic postbiblical legends arose concerning Hanokh (see Ginzberg)."
"Genesis 5:31 <b>seventy-seven years and seven hundred years:</b> As in 4:24, a man named Lemekh is linked to multiples of seven."
Genesis 6:2 <b>divine beings:</b> Or “godlings.”
"Genesis 6:3 <b>for they too are flesh:</b> Hebrew difficult. The text uses the singular, <b>a hundred and twenty years:</b> Some early interpreters take this to specify a “grace period” for humanity before the Flood. The text seems to be setting the limits of the human life span."
"Genesis 6:4 <b>came in to:</b> The common biblical term for sexual intercourse. The concept, also expressed in Arabic, is of the man entering the woman’s tent for the purposes of sex."
"Genesis 6:5 <b>And Y<small>HWH</small> saw … evildoing:</b> In contrast to the refrain of Chapter 1, “God saw that it was good.” <b>every form of their heart’s planning:</b> This lengthy phrase indicates human imagination (Speiser: “every scheme that his mind devised”). “Heart” (Heb. <i>lev</i> or <i>levav</i>) often expresses the concept of “mind” in the Bible."
Genesis 6:7 <b>man to beast:</b> Or “human to animal.”
"Genesis 6:9 <b>righteous:</b> A term with legal connotations; “in the right’’ or “just.” <b>righteous, wholehearted:</b> Foreshadowing Avraham, of whom similar vocabulary will be used (17:1). “Whole” (below “wholly-sound”) is used of animals fit for sacrifice. Others, “perfect” or “unblemished.”"
Genesis 6:11–12 <b>Now the earth …:</b> A poetic summary of the situation.
Genesis 6:11 <b>before God:</b> In his sight.
"Genesis 6:12 <b>God saw the earth, and here: it had gone-to-ruin:</b> A bitter echo of 1:31, “Now God saw all that he had made,/ and here: it was exceedingly good!”"
Genesis 6:13 <b>has come before me:</b> Has been determined by me.
"Genesis 6:14 <b>Ark:</b> English as well as Hebrew etymology points to a box or chest, not strictly a boat. God, not human engineering, is the source of survival in the story. <b><i>gofer:</i></b> Identification unknown, <b>reeds:</b> Reading Heb. <i>kanim</i> for traditional text’s <i>kinnim</i> (“compartments”)."
"Genesis 6:15 <b>cubits:</b> A cubit equaled a man’s forearm in length, about 17½ inches."
"Genesis 6:16 <b>skylight:</b> Hebrew obscure, including the end of the phrase."
"Genesis 6:17 <b>Deluge:</b> Heb. <i>mabbul</i>. Others suggest the more conventional word “Flood,” but the term may be an Assyrian loan-word."
"Genesis 6:18 <b>covenant:</b> An agreement or pact, most notably (in the Bible) one between God and individuals or between him and the people of Israel."
"Genesis 7:2 <b>(ritually) pure:</b> An anachronism, referring to later Israelite laws about sacrifice and eating, <b>seven and seven each:</b> The contradiction between this and 6:19 has led scholars to posit two different sources for the story, <b>male:</b> Lit. “a man.”"
Genesis 7:4 <b>in yet seven days:</b> Seven days from now. <b>forty:</b> Used in the Bible to denote long periods of time; also a favorite patterned number.
"Genesis 7:11 <b>then burst …:</b> Cassuto (1972) suggests that the poetic verses here and elsewhere in the Flood story are fragments of an Israelite epic. See also 9:11, 15. <b>well-springs … sluices:</b> The normal sources of rain function here without any restraint (Cassuto). <b>Ocean:</b> The world returns to the primeval chaos of 1:2."
Genesis 7:16 <b>Y<small>HWH</small> dosed:</b> Another sign of God’s control over the events (and of his protection of Noah).
"Genesis 7:17–20 <b>increased … swelled and increased exceedingly … swelled exceedingly, yes, exceedingly … swelled:</b> The structure here mirrors the action: the surging and growing of the waters."
Genesis 7:18 <b>swelled:</b> Lit. “grew mighty.” <b>floated:</b> Lit. “went.”
"Genesis 7:22 <b>firm-ground:</b> Heb. <i>harava</i>, lit. “dry-land.” Hebrew has two words for “dry” (<i>harev</i> and <i>yavesh</i>), while English uses only one."
"Genesis 7:23 <b>blotted out:</b> Twice repeated, echoing God’s promise in 6:7."
Genesis 8:1 <b>paid mind:</b> More than merely “remembered.” <b>rushing-wind:</b> Reminiscent of the “rushing-spirit of God” at creation.
"Genesis 8:3-5 <b>advancing and returning … advance and diminish:</b> Again, as in 7:17–20, the motion of the waters is suggested by means of sound."
Genesis 8:7 <b>sent out:</b> Or “released.”
"Genesis 8:8 <b>dove:</b> This bird is portrayed in the Bible as beautiful (even pure) and delicate. From this passage, of course, stems the popular use of the dove as the symbol of peace."
Genesis 8:13 <b>left firm ground:</b> Or “were fully dried up” (see note to 7:22).
Genesis 8:19 <b>clans:</b> Classifications.
"Genesis 8:20 <b>slaughter-site:</b> Etymologically the word <i>mizbe’ah</i> hearkens back to a time when such sites were used mainly for animal sacrifice; the Bible cites other uses such as libations and cereal offerings, <b>offered up:</b> The Hebrew verb (<i>’alo</i>) implies upward movement."
"Genesis 8:21 <b>smelled the soothing savor:</b> Conveyed by the sound in Hebrew, <i>va-yarah et re’ah ha-niho’ah</i>. <b>evil from its youth:</b> That is, evil already begins in what we might call adolescence. But Speiser renders it “from the start.”"
Genesis 8:22 <b>sowing and harvest …:</b> The solemn promise is expressed in verse.
Genesis 9:6 <b>Whoever …:</b> A poem that plays on the sounds of “humankind” (<i>adam</i>) and “blood” (<i>dam</i>): <i>Shofekh dam ha-adam/ ba-adam damo yishafekh</i>. <b>for that human:</b> Or “by humans.”
"Genesis 9:18 <b>Now Ham is the father of Canaan:</b> See repetition in the story to follow, vv.20–27."
"Genesis 9:24 <b>littlest:</b> Or “youngest,” difficult in the light of v.18."
Genesis 9:26 <b>to them:</b> Others use “to him.”
"Genesis 10:2 <b>Sons:</b> Here, and later, it may mean “descendants.”"
"Genesis 10:4 <b>Dodanites:</b> Some read “Rodanites,” following I Chron. 1:7."
Genesis 10:6 <b>Mitzrayim:</b> The biblical name for Egypt (the modern Egyptian name is <i>Misr</i>).
Genesis 10:8 <b>mighty man:</b> Three times here; clearly Nimrod was well known as an ancient hero.
"Genesis 10:10 <b>Calne:</b> Some read <i>cullana</i>, “all of them.”"
"Genesis 10:11 <b>city squares:</b> Some read this as a name, “Rehovot-Ir.”"
Genesis 10:14 <b>Casluhites … Caftorites:</b> Some reverse the order; the Bible often speaks of the origins of the Philistines in Caftor (Crete).
"Genesis 10:15 <b>Yevusite, etc.:</b> Collective names."
Genesis 11:1 <b>language:</b> Lit. “lip.”
"Genesis 11:3 <b>so … brick-stone … :</b> An explanation of Mesopotamian building techniques for the Hebrew audience. The text plays on sound (<i>levena … le-aven</i>, <i>hemer … la-homer</i>). <b>raw-bitumen:</b> Asphalt, used for making cement."
"Genesis 11:4 <b>make … a name:</b> That is, make sure that we and our works will endure."
"Genesis 11:10 <b>two years after the Deluge:</b> Possibly a typical popular way of telling time (see Amos 1:1, “two years after the earthquake”)."
Genesis 11:26 <b>Avram:</b> Trad. English “Abram.”
Genesis 11:28 <b>in the living-presence of Terah his father:</b> During his father’s lifetime. <b>Chaldeans:</b> An anachronism; see Speiser.
"Genesis 11:30 <b>barren, she had no child:</b> This doubling is characteristic of biblical style (formal poetry in the Bible uses parallelism of lines)."
"Genesis 11:31 <b>Harran:</b> An important city and center of moon worship, like Ur. The name means “crossroads.”"
Genesis 12:1 <b>kindred:</b> Others use “birthplace.”
Genesis 12:3 <b>find blessing:</b> Or “seek to be blessed (as you).”
Genesis 12:5 <b>property … gained:</b> Heb. <i>rekhusham … rakhashu</i>.
"Genesis 12:6 <b>Place:</b> Possibly with the implication of “sacred place.” <b>Oak:</b> Some read “valley.” <b>Moreh:</b> Some, like Buber, interpret this as “sage.” <b>the Canaanite:</b> The peoples inhabiting the land at the time of the Israelite conquest under Joshua; see also 13:7."
"Genesis 12:7 <b>was seen:</b> Others use “appeared to,” which is more comfortable in English. “See” has been kept here as a leading word in the Avraham cycle."
Genesis 12:8 <b>toward the sea:</b> West.
"Genesis 12:9 <b>the Negev:</b> The “dry,” southern portion of the land of Israel."
"Genesis 12:10 <b>sojourn:</b> To reside temporarily, as an alien, <b>heavy:</b> Severe."
"Genesis 12:15 <b>Pharaoh:</b> Heb. Par’o. This is an Egyptian title, “(Lord of) the Great House,” and not a name."
Genesis 13:2 <b>heavily laden:</b> Rich.
Genesis 13:8 <b>brother men:</b> Relatives.
"Genesis 13:9 <b>before you:</b> Possibly a legal term concerning boundaries, <b>left… right:</b> North and south."
Genesis 13:10 <b>Y<small>HWH</small> brought ruin:</b> See Chap. 19. <b>Sedom and Amora:</b> Trad. English “Sodom and Gomorrah.”
Genesis 14:3 <b>The Sea of Salt:</b> The Dead Sea.
"Genesis 14:10 <b>bitumen:</b> Asphalt, <b>flung themselves:</b> Others use “fell.”"
"Genesis 14:12 <b>—the son of Avram’s brother— :</b> The Hebrew places the phrase after “property,” not after “Lot,” as would be comfortable in English, <b>for he had settled:</b> The story abounds in similar explanatory phrases, which could almost be put in parentheses."
Genesis 14:14 <b>brother:</b> Kinsman.
Genesis 14:15 <b>north:</b> Lit. “left.”
"Genesis 14:18 <b>Malki-Tzedek:</b> Trad. English “Melchizedek.” The name is a Hebrew one, and the character appears as if from nowhere. <b>Shalem:</b> Identified with the later Jerusalem. <b>God Most-High:</b> Heb. <i>El Elyon</i>."
Genesis 14:20 <b>a tenth:</b> Like the tithe later given to Israelite priests.
Genesis 14:22 <b>I raise my hand:</b> I swear.
"Genesis 14:23 <b>from a thread to a sandal-strap:</b> As in “from A to Z,” or “anything at all.”"
Genesis 14:24 <b>lads:</b> Servants.
"Genesis 15:1 <b>Y<small>HWH</small>’s word came:</b> A formula often used by the Prophets. Avram is portrayed as their spiritual ancestor (Buber, 1982)."
Genesis 15:2 <b>accursed:</b> Heb. <i>ariri;</i> B-R uses “bare-of-children.” <b>Son Domestic … Damascan:</b> Hebrew difficult. The translation here reflects the play on sound (Heb. <i>ben meshek … dammesek</i>).
"Genesis 15:3 <b>Son of My House:</b> The chief servant, who could inherit the estate in certain circumstances. Note the play on “son”: the Hebrew here is <i>ben beti</i>, while <i>ben</i> alone means “son.” <b>heir:</b> Three times here, indicating Avram’s main concern."
Genesis 15:6 <b>he deemed it:</b> “He” refers to God.
"Genesis 15:7 <b>who brought you out:</b> Like the later “I am Y<small>HWH</small> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt” (Ex. 20:2). The language is undoubtedly intentional."
"Genesis 15:8 <b>But he said:</b> Avram, having just demonstrated trust in v.6, now expresses deep doubt, <b>inherit:</b> Or “possess.”"
"Genesis 15:9 <b>of three:</b> I.e., three years old, and presumably mature and ritually fit for sacrifice."
"Genesis 15:12 <b>deep slumber:</b> Not conventional sleep, it is almost always sent by God in the Bible (see 2:21, for example). The result here is “fright and great darkness.”"
"Genesis 15:13 <b>afflict:</b> Looking toward the “affliction” of the Israelites in Egypt (Ex. 1:11, 12)."
Genesis 15:15 <b>ripe-age:</b> Lit. “grayness” or “hoariness.”
Genesis 15:16 <b>But in the fourth generation …:</b> God here speaks of the future conquest of Canaan by Avram’s descendants. The natives (here termed ‘Amorites”) are viewed as having forfeited their right to the land by their immorality (see Lev. 18:25–8).
"Genesis 15:18 <b>cut:</b> Concluded; the usage is influenced by the act of cutting animals by the parties involved, as in this story."
"Genesis 15:19 <b>the Kenite …:</b> Canaanite tribes, here presented as a round ten in number."
"Genesis 15 <b>she-goats … :</b> The gift is a special one, promising increase (females with their young)."
Genesis 15:21 <b>lift up my face:</b> Or “be gracious to me.”
"Genesis 15:23 <b>Yabbok:</b> A traditional natural boundary, it creates a wild gorge which is the perfect setting for this incident."
Genesis 15:25 <b>left alone:</b> In a psychological sense Yaakov has not yet crossed the river.
"Genesis 15:26 <b>touched:</b> Perhaps in homage, for the injury had already occurred (Ehrlich)."
"Genesis 15:27 <b>dawn has come up:</b> In folklore, supernatural beings often must disappear with the break of day."
Genesis 15:28–29 <b>What is your name? … Not as Yaakov:</b> As if to say “You cannot be blessed with such a name!” The “man” in effect removes Esav’s curse.
"Genesis 15:29 <b>God-Fighter:</b> The name may actually mean “God fights.” Buber further conjectured that it means “God rules,” containing the kernel of ancient Israel’s concept of itself, but he retained “Fighter of God” in the translation."
Genesis 15:29 <b>God and men:</b> Others use “beings divine and human.”
"Genesis 15:30 <b>Now why do you ask:</b> In folklore the name of a divine being is often withheld, for to know it would be to acquire power over him. See also Judg. 13:18: “Now why do you ask after my name? For it is wondrous!”"
"Genesis 15:31 <b>Peniel/Face of God:</b> See v.21, and 33:10, for the important allusions."
Genesis 15:32 <b>The sun rose:</b> A sign of favor. <b>Penuel:</b> A variant spelling of Peniel.
Genesis 15:33 <b>sinew:</b> The sciatic nerve.
"Genesis 16:1 <b>built-up-with-sons:</b> Heb. <i>ibbane</i>, a play on <i>bano</i> (build) and <i>ben</i> (son)."
Genesis 16:3 <b>wife:</b> Or “concubine.”
Genesis 16:4 <b>became of light-worth in her eyes:</b> A Hebrew idiom. JPS: “was lowered in her esteem.”
"Genesis 16:6 <b>afflicted:</b> Or “abused,” “maltreated.”"
"Genesis 16:7 <b>Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger:</b> Traditionally “angel,” but the English word stems from the Greek <i>angelos</i>, which also means “messenger.” In Genesis God’s messengers seem to be quite human in appearance, and are sometimes taken for God himself (see 18:2ff.)."
"Genesis 16:10 <b>too many to count:</b> Apparently fulfilling God’s blessing and promise to Avram in 15:5. Until 17:16, nothing indicates that Yishmael is not Avram’s long-awaited heir."
Genesis 16:11 <b>Yishmael:</b> Trad. English “Ishmael.”
Genesis 16:13 <b>Have I actually gone on seeing …:</b> Heb. obscure. Hagar possibly is expressing surprise that she survived her encounter with God.
"Genesis 17:1 <b>Ninety years and nine years:</b> Thirteen years have elapsed since the events of the previous chapter. Now that Yishmael is entering puberty, God can no longer conceal that he is not the promised heir. See vv.16, 18. <b>Shaddai:</b> Hebrew obscure. Traditionally translated “Almighty”; others use “of the mountains.” In Genesis the name is most often tied to promises of human fertility, as in v.2. <b>Walk … be wholehearted:</b> Contrasted to Noah (6:9), Avram is a genuine religious man who lives his faith actively."
"Genesis 17:2 <b>set:</b> Heb. <i>va-ettena</i>. The root <i>n-t-n</i> is repeated throughout the chapter (as “make” in vv.5 and 6, and as “give” in vv.8 and 16)."
"Genesis 17:4 <b>throng:</b> The word suggests the sound of a crowd, rather than merely a large number."
Genesis 17:5 <b>Avraham:</b> Trad. English ‘Abraham.”
"Genesis 17:8 <b>I will be God to them:</b> Often reiterated as part of the biblical covenant (e.g., 28:21)."
"Genesis 17:12 <b>house-born or bought with money:</b> I.e., slaves. The entire household, as an extension of the man’s personality, is to be brought into the covenant."
"Genesis 17:15 <b>you shall not call her name Sarai:</b> Significantly, Sara is the only woman in the Bible to have her name changed by God."
Genesis 17:16 <b>so that she becomes nations:</b> Sara in essence shares the blessing of God. She is not merely the biological means for its fulfillment.

"Genesis 17:21 <b>another year:</b> Not nine months (Sara does not immediately become pregnant). Again the events seem to take place in a realistic framework, rather than in a strictly supernatural one."
"Genesis 17:22 <b>God went up, from beside Avraham:</b> Perhaps a formula used to signify the end of the conversation."
"Genesis 17:23 <b>on that same day:</b> Underlining Avraham’s customary obedience, <b>as God had spoken to him:</b> Like Noah in 6:22, 7:5, and 7:9, Avraham scrupulously follows God’s commands without question (so too in 21:4 and 22:3)."
"Genesis 18:1 <b>entrance to his tent:</b> Also used in vv.2 and 10, it may hint at the important events being portrayed: the “entrance to the tent” is often a sacred spot in subsequent books of the Bible."
Genesis 18:2 <b>three men:</b> See note on 16:7. <b>over against him:</b> Heb. <i>alav</i> could mean “over” or “next to” him.

Genesis 18:22 <b>but Avraham still stood in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Some manuscripts read “But Y<small>HWH</small> still stood in the presence of Avraham.” The subject of the sentence has been reversed by scribes who were uncomfortable with the passage’s human portrayal of God.
"Genesis 18:25 <b>Heaven forbid:</b> Lit. “May you have a curse,” an ironic turn of phrase in this situation, <b>like the innocent, like the guilty:</b> Or “innocent and guilty alike.”"
Genesis 18:26 <b>bear with:</b> Or “bear the sin.”
"Genesis 18:27 <b>earth and ashes:</b> Heb. <i>afar va-efer</i>, traditionally “dust and ashes.” The phrase, while common in English, is used in the Bible again only in Job (30:19, 42:6)."

Genesis 19:11 <b>(all men) great and small:</b> Lit. “from small to great.”

"Genesis 19:19 <b>lest the wickedness cling to me:</b> The expression of an idea common to many cultures: that evil is like a disease, a physical rather than purely moral entity."
Genesis 19:20 <b>tiny:</b> Or “a trifle.”
"Genesis 19:21 <b>lift up your face:</b> A similar Assyrian phrase means “save” or “cheer.” <b>overturning:</b> Overthrowing. The word is used later in the Bible to describe the fate of the two cities again (e.g., Lam. 4:6)."
Genesis 19:22 <b>I am not able … until you come there:</b> In deference to Avraham (see v.29).
"Genesis 19:26 <b>she became a pillar of salt:</b> An old folklore motif of what happens when humans see God (or his actions), made popular by the many mineral pillars in the region around the Dead Sea."

"Genesis 20:11 <b>awe:</b> Others, “fear.”"
"Genesis 20:13 <b>roam:</b> A word which in Genesis suggests a wandering that is nevertheless directed by God. See 21:14 and 37:15 for other examples. This passage gives us a fascinating glimpse of Avraham’s own perception of the events in Chap. 12. It is not unusual for the biblical storyteller to give out informa-tion in this manner (in a later speech of the protagonist), <b>faithfulness:</b> Or “favor.”"
Genesis 20:16 <b>a covering for the eyes:</b> Hebrew obscure; apparently it has legal connotations (see also “decided for” at the end of the verse).
"Genesis 20:18 <b>Y<small>HWH</small> had obstructed:</b> On account of Sara, the “obstructed” one of 16:2."
Genesis 21:6 <b>laugh for me:</b> Out of joy or disbelief. Some suggest “laugh at.”

Genesis 21:34 <b>Philistines:</b> Another anachronism. The Philistines appear first in the days of the Conquest (Joshua and Judges).
"Genesis 22:1 <b>after these events:</b> Others use “Some time afterward.” <b>Here I am:</b> A term frequently used to convey readiness, usually in relation to God’s command or address."
"Genesis 22:2 <b>Yitzhak:</b> The name is left until the end of the phrase, to heighten tension. Similarly, see 27:32. <b>Moriyya:</b> Trad. English “Moriah.” The mountain here is later identified with the site of Solomon’s Temple."
Genesis 22:5 <b>bow down:</b> Worship.
"Genesis 22:7 <b>fire:</b> I.e., a torch or brand."
"Genesis 22:8 <b>see-for-himself:</b> Or “select.” See the name of the mountain in verse 14, “Y<small>HWH</small> Sees.” <b>offering-up,/ my son:</b> One might read it with a dash instead of a comma, to preserve what may be an ironic answer."

Genesis 22:18 <b>all the nations …</b>: See 12:3.
"Genesis 22:19 <b>Avraham returned:</b> The fact that Yitzhak is not mentioned here has given rise to speculation for centuries (see Shalom Spiegel, <i>The Last Trial</i>). The omission may simply arise from the fact that Yitzhak as a personality is not important to the story, which is first and foremost a test of Avraham."
Genesis 22:23 <b>Rivka:</b> Trad. English “Rebecca.”
"Genesis 23:1 <b>(thus) the years of Sara’s life:</b> She is the only biblical woman whose life span is given, again as a sign of importance."

Genesis 23:20 <b>established:</b> Others use “made over.”
Genesis 24:2 <b>put your hand under my thigh:</b> A symbol used in taking of an oath (see also 47:29). The use of “thigh” might allude to a curse of childlessness as the punishment for not keeping the oath.
"Genesis 24:5 <b>back there:</b> The Hebrew text has “there” in the next line; it has been moved up in the English text for reasons of style. The word occurs four times in vv.5–8, as a signal of what is most important to Avraham: that his son must stay in the land of Canaan."

"Genesis 24:25 <b>Yes, there is straw:</b> Not until Rivka has extended the offer of hospitality (and enthusiastically, with the triple “yes”) is the servant sure that “Y<small>HWH</small> has granted success to my journey.” Hospitality, once again, is the determinant, over and above beauty or virginity."
"Genesis 24:27 <b>his faithfulness and his trustworthiness:</b> Others combine and translate as “steadfast kindness.” The phrase is often found in the Psalms, describing God. <b>brothers:</b> Relatives."
Genesis 24:29 <b>Lavan:</b> Trad: English “Laban.” He will be a key figure in the story of Rivka’s son Yaakov.
"Genesis 24:34 <b>He said …:</b> The servant’s speech diplomatically omits certain emotional details of Avraham’s speech, most notably his warning against Yitzhak himself’s going back “there.”"
Genesis 24:40 <b>will send his messenger:</b> Speaking figuratively.
"Genesis 24:41 <b>oath-curse:</b> Changed from Avraham’s simple “sworn-oath,” perhaps because it is reported from the servant’s point of view."
"Genesis 24:50 <b>Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The family apparently worships the God of Avraham, in addition to others (see 31:19, 30)."
"Genesis 24:53 <b>objects of silver and … gold and garments:</b> A stock biblical phrase (see, similarly, Ex. 3:22) for wealth or presents."
"Genesis 24:55 <b>a few days, perhaps ten:</b> Some interpret as “a year or ten months.”"
"Genesis 24:59 <b>with her nurse:</b> Yitzhak’s life as the father of his people begins with the marriage arranged in this chapter; curiously, when he dies in Chap. 35, the nurse dies as well, perhaps to hint that Rivka dies too."
"Genesis 24:60 <b>May your seed inherit the gate:</b> See Avraham’s blessing in 22:17. Again, the matriarch shares in the blessing."
Genesis 24:62 <b>Well of the Living-One:</b> Already a site of God’s activity (16:14).
Genesis 24:63 <b>stroll:</b> Hebrew obscure; some use “ponder.”
"Genesis 24:67 <b>Sara:</b> As the story opened with Yitzhak’s father in his last active moments, it closes with the memory of his mother. Yitzhak is on his own."
Genesis 25:7 <b>days and years:</b> Lit. “days of the years.”
"Genesis 25:8 <b>A hundred years …:</b> See “The Patriarchal Narratives,” p.51, <b>satisfied:</b> Or “full.” For the complete expression, see 35:29."
Genesis 25:11 <b>God blessed Yitzhak:</b> This is the first detail reported about Yitzhak after his father’s death—lest there be any doubt about the continuation of God’s care.
Genesis 25:16 <b>corrals:</b> Others (including Buber) use “circled encampments.” <b>twelve princes:</b> See 17:20.
"Genesis 25:18 <b>did (his inheritance) fall:</b> Hebrew difficult. Others interpret negatively, “made raids against” or “fell upon” (his kinsmen)."
"Genesis 25:20 <b>forty years old:</b> Another schematic number. Twenty years later (see v.26), his wife will bear him children. <b>Aramean:</b> Three times in this verse the root ‘Aram” confirms what we learned in the previous chapter—the importance of family and lineage here, <b>country of Aram:</b> Others leave this untranslated, as “Padan-Aram.”"
Genesis 25:22 <b>almost crushed:</b> Others use “struggled.” <b>inquire:</b> Consult an oracle. Note that there is no indication that Yitzhak is aware of what God wants.
"Genesis 25:23 <b>tribes:</b> Heb. <i>le’ummim</i>, a poetic term for “peoples.”"
"Genesis 25:24 <b>here:</b> The text speaks from the point of view of the onlookers, not of Rivka, who is perfectly aware that she has twins."
Genesis 25:25 <b>Esav:</b> Trad. English “Esau.” <b>Rough-One:</b> A conjectural interpretation from Arabic <i>’athaya</i>.
"Genesis 25:26 <b>Yaakov:</b> Trad. English “Jacob.” <b>Heel-Holder:</b> A popular reinterpretation of the name Yaakov, which may have meant originally “May (God) protect.”"
Genesis 25:27 <b>plain:</b> Hebrew unclear. Others use “simple.”
Genesis 25:28 <b>(he brought) hunted-game:</b> Hebrew difficult.
"Genesis 25:29 <b>boiling boiled-stew:</b> This phrase may connote plotting, as in our English “cook up,” ‘brew,” “concoct,” or “stir up” trouble. Other forms of the Hebrew denote “insolence” or “intentional evil.”"
Genesis 25:31 <b>here-and-now:</b> Others use “at once”; apparently a legal term.
"Genesis 25:34 <b>he ate…:</b> Esav’s impulsive personality is brilliantly portrayed by the use of four rapid-fire verbs, <b>despise:</b> Others use ‘belittle.”"
Genesis 26:1 <b>a famine … Yitzhak went to Avimelekh:</b> Parallel to the story in Chap. 20.
Genesis 26:5 <b>in consequence of Avraham’s hearkening …:</b> The blessing mirrors 22:17ff. <b>my commandments …</b>: These are not specified; this is probably a poetic phrase describing a general idea.
"Genesis 26:8 <b>laughing-and-loving:</b> Heb. <i>metzahek</i>, which can mean laughter or sexual activity. Trad. English “sporting.”"
Genesis 26:11 <b>touches:</b> Or “harms.”
Genesis 26:12 <b>reaped:</b> Lit. “attained.”

Genesis 26:26 <b>aide:</b> Lit. “friend.”

Genesis 26:34 <b>forty years old:</b> The same age that his father was at the time of his marriage.
"Genesis 27:4 <b>delicacy:</b> See 25:28. Yitzhak is tied to the senses, a trait that he prizes in Esav. <b>my own blessing:</b> Or “my special blessing.” Heb. <i>nefesh</i> frequently means “self” or “personality.”"
Genesis 27:7 <b>before Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Note that Rivka adds these words to her husband’s.
"Genesis 27:9 <b>take:</b> Fetch (see also vv.13, 14, 45)."
"Genesis 27:13 <b>Let your curse be on me:</b> Ominously, Rivka disappears from the narrative after v.46."
"Genesis 27:18 <b>Which one are you:</b> Three times—here, in v.21, and in v.24—the father asks for assurances about the son’s identity, <b>my son:</b> This phrase reverberates throughout the story, underlining the confusion over the identity of the sons."
"Genesis 27:19 <b>Esav, your firstborn:</b> From the first word the lie is blatant; contrast Esav’s tension-filled reply to the same question in v.32."
Genesis 27:20 <b>made it happen:</b> An appropriate expression to use with Yitzhak; see 24:12.
"Genesis 27:23 <b>hairy:</b> In the end Yitzhak relies more on the sense of touch than on his hearing. Yet the latter is usually regarded as the source of truth in the Bible (see Deut. 4:12, for example)."
"Genesis 27:27 <b>a field:</b> Fitting for Esav, the “man of the field” (25:27)."
"Genesis 27:29 <b>Those who bless you, blessed!:</b> Perhaps hearkening back to God’s speech to Avraham in 12:3. Note that this blessing, at least in this particular wording, is never spoken to Yitzhak."
"Genesis 27:32 <b>Esav:</b> The exact identification is put off until the end of the sequence, heightening the drama. Similarly, see 22:2."
"Genesis 27:33 <b>blessed he must remain:</b> Once uttered, the words of blessing cannot be rescinded."
"Genesis 27:36 <b>Heel-Sneak:</b> In effect, Esav puts a curse on his brother’s name, which will be removed only in 32:29, twenty years later. <b>he has now sneaked against me:</b> Or “cheated me.”"

"Genesis 28:12 <b>Here:</b> The word (three times) emphasizes the immediacy of the report; it is the vocabulary of dreams, as in 37:7 (Andersen). <b>ladder:</b> Others use “ramp” or “stairway.”"
Genesis 28:13 <b>over against:</b> See note to 18:2.
"Genesis 28:18 <b>standing-pillar:</b> A stone marker, common to the culture of the region."
Genesis 28:19 <b>Bet-El:</b> Trad. English “Beth El.”
"Genesis 28:21 <b>in peace:</b> Or “safely.” This functions as a key word in the Yaakov cycle, extending into the Yosef story as well. Yaakov, the “sneak” and wanderer, seeks peace and safety; he does not find it until the end of his life, albeit in a foreign land."
Genesis 28:22 <b>tithe:</b> See note to 14:20.
"Genesis 29:1 <b>lifted his feet:</b> Colloquially, “picked up and went.”"
Genesis 29:5 <b>We know him:</b> Biblical Hebrew expresses the idea “yes” by repeating the words of the question. See also v.6 and 24:58.

"Genesis 29:16 <b>Lea:</b> Or “Le’a,” trad. English “Leah.” The name means “wild cow.”"
Genesis 29:17 <b>delicate:</b> Others use “weak.” Either the term is meant negatively or else Lea is being praised for one attribute but Rahel for total beauty.
"Genesis 29:18 <b>seven:</b> Aside from forty, this is the other schematic number found often in Genesis and elsewhere (for instance, as the basic number of the biblical calendar, in days, months, and years)."
"Genesis 29:19 <b>with me:</b> Or “in my service,” “under me.”"
"Genesis 29:21 <b>fulfilled:</b> I.e., over, completed."

Genesis 30:18 <b>hired-wages:</b> “Wages” recurs as a theme throughout this part of the Yaakov cycle (Fokkelman). It is perhaps a veiled portrayal of the events of Yaakov’s adulthood as “payment” for what he did to his brother. <b>Yissakhar:</b> Trad. English “Issachar.”
"Genesis 30:20 <b>this time my husband will prize me:</b> Lea’s six pregnancies and birthings are bracketed by this verse and 29:32, “Now my husband will love me.” <b>Zevulun:</b> Trad. English “Zebulun.”"
Genesis 30:23-24 <b>removed … add:</b> Yosef’s naming prefigures his destiny as a son lost and found.
Genesis 30:24 <b>Yosef:</b> Trad. English “Joseph.”
"Genesis 30:26 <b>give over my wives and my children:</b> In the law of the region, slaves did not retain control of their families. Does this suggest something about Yaakov’s treatment by Lavan? (Speiser)"
"Genesis 30:27 <b>Pray, if I have found:</b> Or “May I now find.” <b>I have become wealthy,/ and Y<small>HWH</small> … :</b> Some interpret this as “I have divined that Y<small>HWH</small>….”"
"Genesis 30:32 <b>Let me go:</b> Some read “Go.” <b>every speckled … :</b> This would appeal to Lavan, since such animals would be in the minority."
Genesis 30:35 <b>white:</b> Heb. <i>lavan.</i> Also the word “poplar” in v.37 is a play on Lavan (<i>livne</i>). The conniving father-in-law is tricked with words resembling his own name.
Genesis 30:39 <b>by the rods:</b> Folk belief holds that what the animals see as they mate will influence the color of their offspring.
Genesis 30:40 <b>gave position:</b> Following the interpretation of Fokkelman.
Genesis 30:43 <b>he came to have many flock-animals:</b> Like his father (26:14) and grandfather (12:16).
Genesis 31:2 <b>he was no longer with him:</b> Others use “Lavan’s manner toward him was no longer….”
"Genesis 31:3 <b>land of your fathers … your kindred:</b> Here, unlike 12:1, the land is Canaan, not Harran! <b>I will be with you:</b> Heb. <i>ehye immakh,</i> interpreted here and throughout by B-R as “I will be-there with you,” stressing that it is God’s presence that is indicated by the verb <i>hyh,</i> “to be.” See especially Ex. 3:14."
Genesis 31:4 <b>to the field:</b> As a place where such conversations would be certain to be private.
Genesis 31:7 <b>ten times:</b> Many times.
"Genesis 31:10 <b>Now it was … in a dream:</b> Several times in this chapter we hear of important events secondhand, in speech rather than in action. See note to 20:13. <b>streaked, speckled, and spotted:</b> Heb. <i>akuddim, nekuddim, u-veruddim.</i> The rhyme (rare in biblical Hebrew) suggests a vision or a dream."
Genesis 31:19 <b><i>terafim:</i></b> Hebrew obscure; apparently some sort of idols. Others use “household gods.”
"Genesis 31:20 <b>stole-the-wits:</b> Fooled, hoodwinked."
Genesis 31:24 <b>be it good or ill:</b> Lit. “from good to ill.”
Genesis 31:28 <b>kiss:</b> Upon leaving; “kiss good-bye.”
Genesis 31:30 <b>you had to go:</b> Or “Suppose you had to go.”
"Genesis 31:31 <b>Indeed, I was afraid:</b> Yaakov seems to be explaining why he “had to go” first, and then answering Lavan’s question in v. 32."
Genesis 31:32 <b>with me:</b> In my possession.
"Genesis 31:34 <b>sat down upon them:</b> Ridiculing the pagan gods, at least to the audience. <b>felt all around:</b> Recalling the “feeling” of Yitzhak in Chap. 27."
Genesis 31:35 <b>manner of women:</b> The menstrual period.
Genesis 31:37 <b>felt all through:</b> Or “rifled.”
"Genesis 31:39 <b>seek:</b> I.e., seek restitution."
Genesis 31:41 <b>twenty years:</b> Yosef will be away from Yaakov for approximately the same period of time.
Genesis 31:42 <b>Terror:</b> The intent of the Hebrew is unclear; it could be something like “Yitzhak’s champion” or “the One who inspired terror in Yitzhak.”
Genesis 31:43 <b>to my daughters:</b> Others use “for my daughters.”
Genesis 31:46 <b>And they ate:</b> See note to 26:30.
"Genesis 31:47 <b><i>Yegar Sahaduta:</i></b> Aramaic for “Mound-Witness” (Yaakov’s Gal-Ed of the next verse). Aramaic was the lingua franca of the area from the First Millennium <small>B.C.E.</small> on, and is still spoken in some Syrian villages."
Genesis 31:49 <b>when we are hidden:</b> Even when I cannot verify your behavior.
Genesis 31:50 <b>God:</b> Or “a god.”
"Genesis 31:54 <b>bread:</b> Or more generally, “food.”"
Genesis 32:1 <b>Lavan (started-early) … :</b> The verse numbering follows the Hebrew; some English translations number 32:1 as 31:55.
"Genesis 32:7 <b>four hundred men:</b> A considerable fighting force. Even if the number is schematic (as ten times forty), it still represents something formidable."
"Genesis 32:11 <b>Too small:</b> This is the first indication of the change in Yaakov’s personality. Now he relies on God (although he still uses his wits, by diplomatically and strategically preparing for his meeting with Esav)."
"Genesis 32:13 <b>you have said:</b> I.e., you have promised. See also note on 31:10. <b>like the sand:</b> In fact, this is God’s promise to Avraham, in 22:17."
"Genesis 33:8 <b>What to you is:</b> I.e., What does it mean to you?"
Genesis 33:9 <b>my brother:</b> The phrase suggests that they are now reconciled.
"Genesis 33:15 <b>leave with you:</b> Or “station with you,” “put at your disposal.” <b>mine:</b> Lit. “with me.” <b>For what reason?:</b> Yaakov still seems cautious."
"Genesis 33:19 <b>he acquired:</b> Like his grandfather Avraham, Yaakov must purchase the land. <b>lambs’-worth:</b> Hebrew obscure."
Genesis 34:1 <b>to see:</b> To visit.
"Genesis 34:2 <b>Hamor:</b> Heb. “donkey.” Some take the name to prove that they were donkey-drivers, while others see it as an insult to the character. <b>forcing:</b> Or “humbling.”"
Genesis 34:7 <b>disgrace:</b> A different Hebrew word from the one rendered “disgraced” in 15:2.
Genesis 34:8 <b>his emotions are so attached:</b> Speiser uses “has his heart set on.” <b>pray give:</b> The repetition of “give” suggests a greediness on their part.
Genesis 34:10 <b>travel about:</b> Or “trade.”
Genesis 34:13 <b>with deceit:</b> Another example of a key word in the Yaakov stories; see 27:35 and 29:25.
"Genesis 34:19 <b>desired:</b> Not the same Hebrew term as in 2:9. <b>carried more weight:</b> I.e., was more respected."
"Genesis 34:21 <b>peaceably disposed:</b> Or “friendly,” “honest.”"
"Genesis 34:24 <b>all who go out … :</b> I.e., all able-bodied men."
Genesis 34:25 <b>Shim’on and Levi:</b> They are condemned for this incident by Yaakov in 49:5–7.
Genesis 35:2 <b>Change your garments:</b> Speiser translates this as “Put on new clothes.”
"Genesis 35:8 <b>Rivka’s nurse, died:</b> See note to 24:59."
Genesis 35:9 <b>God was seen … :</b> Apparently a different version of the Peniel story of Chap. 32.
Genesis 35:11-12 <b>I am God Shaddai … :</b> See God’s words to Avraham in 17:6.
"Genesis 35:13 <b>at the place where he had spoken with him:</b> The phrase occurs three times here and subsequently, probably to emphasize the sanctity of Bet-El."
"Genesis 35:17 <b>this one too is a son:</b> This seems to be a breach birth, since the midwife already knew that it was a son when “her birthing was at its hardest”—that is, before the child had fully emerged."
"Genesis 35:18 <b>her life was slipping away:</b> Or “her life-breath was leaving (her),” paralleling a similar expression in Ugaritic."
"Genesis 35:18 <b>But his father called him: Binyamin:</b> Given the power of names, it would not have been considered proper for a child to begin life with a name such as the one Rahel gives him. <b>Binyamin:</b> Trad. English “Benjamin.”"
Genesis 35:19 <b>Bet-Lehem:</b> Trad. English “Bethlehem.”
Genesis 35:29 <b>Then Yitzhak expired:</b> See the Commentary on 26:1-6.
"Genesis 36:7 <b>for their property was too much:</b> Again recalling Avraham, in his conflict with Lot (13:6)."
Genesis 36:14 <b>Tziv’on:</b> The name means “hyena.” Such animal names have long been popular in the region and occur a number of times in this chapter (Vawter).
Genesis 36:15 <b>families:</b> Others use “chieftains.”
"Genesis 36:24 <b><i>yemim:</i></b> Hebrew obscure; some use “hot-springs,” “lakes.”"
"Genesis 36:26 <b>Dishon:</b> The traditional text uses “Dishan,” but see I Chron. 1:41."
"Genesis 37:2 <b>begettings:</b> In the sense of “family history.” As noted above, the Yosef story is a continuation of the Yaakov saga. <b>seventeen:</b> Together with 47:28, this provides another example of numerical balance in these stories (see the Commentary on “The Patriarchal Narratives,” p. 51). Yosef lives with Yaakov for the first seventeen years of his life and for the last seventeen of his father’s. <b>along with his brothers:</b> A hint that he would one day “shepherd” (rule) his brothers? The Hebrew is open to that interpretation (Redford). <b>brought a report:</b> Or “gossip.” Although the doting father’s love is crucial, it seems really to be Yosef’s own behavior (which precedes the information about his coat) that causes his abuse by the brothers."
Genesis 37:3 <b>ornamented:</b> Hebrew obscure; B-R uses “ankle-length.”
"Genesis 37:4 <b>hated:</b> Such a violent emotion nevertheless has once before (with Lea in 29:31) led not to disaster but to the fulfillment of the divine plan (there, the hatred results in the competition to have children). <b>in peace:</b> Or “civilly”—again the key Yaakov word, “peace.”"
Genesis 37:6 <b>hear:</b> Which can also mean “understand” in biblical Hebrew.
"Genesis 37:8 <b>king, yes, king … rule, yes, rule:</b> The doubling might reflect the brothers’ astonishment and bitterness. See also v. 10."
Genesis 37:10 <b>your mother:</b> The fact that she had died in Chap. 35 does not detract from the symbol of the dream.
Genesis 37:11 <b>remembered:</b> Or “kept in mind.”
Genesis 37:12 <b>Shekhem:</b> In our text this city’s name (three times here) reminds the reader of the disastrous events of Chap. 34.
Genesis 37:13 <b>Come:</b> Repeated in vv.20 and 27; it is ironically Yaakov’s decision to send Yosef to his brothers that sets this part of the plot into action.
"Genesis 37:14 <b>well-being:</b> Heb. <i>shalom,</i> translated as “peace” in v.4 and elsewhere."
Genesis 37:15 <b>a man:</b> Possibly another divine messenger (like the “man” in 32:25). See also the note to “roaming” in 20:13.
"Genesis 37:20 <b>ill-tempered:</b> Others, “wild.”"
Genesis 37:21 <b>take his life:</b> Lit. “strike him mortally.”
Genesis 37:25 <b>bread:</b> Or “food.”
Genesis 37:29 <b>rent his garments:</b> The tearing of clothing was a customary sign of mourning.
"Genesis 37:30 <b>And I … :</b> Heb. <i>va-ani, ana ani va.</i> The sound expresses the emotions. <b>where am I to go:</b> I.e., what will become of me?"
"Genesis 37:32 <b>pray recognize:</b> See 27:23, where Yitzhak did not “recognize” Yaakov. Yaakov’s youth returns to haunt him, in a sense."
"Genesis 37:33 <b>My son’s coat:</b> With the omission of “It is,” the shock is conveyed more dramatically. Some ancient versions, however, include the phrase. <b>An ill-tempered beast … torn-to-pieces:</b> The Hebrew breaks into verse structure, with three word-beats per line: <i>haya ra’a akhalat’hu/ tarof toraf Yosef</i> (Alter 1981)."
"Genesis 37:34 <b>many days:</b> Possibly “years”; at any rate, longer than a normal mourning period (in the Bible, thirty or seventy days) (Jacob)."
Genesis 37:35 <b>Sheol:</b> The biblical underworld; others (and B-R) use “the grave.”
"Genesis 37:36 <b>Midyanites:</b> The Hebrew has “Medanites.” <b>court-official:</b> Lit. “eunuch,” a common ancient Near Eastern title for such a position. Originally the term was applied literally, although later on the person was not necessarily a eunuch."
"Genesis 38:1 <b>away from his brothers:</b> More than geography seems to be meant. Yehuda begins to change as a person here, in preparation for Chap. 44. Note that the place Adullam assonates with Arabic (’adula) “to turn aside.”"
Genesis 38:5 <b>Ceziv:</b> The Hebrew root connotes “lying.”
Genesis 38:6 <b>Tamar:</b> The name means “date palm.”
"Genesis 38:6–7 <b>firstborn:</b> Perhaps parallel to the ineffectual firstborn, Re’uven, of the previous chapter."
"Genesis 38:8 <b>a brother-in-law’s duty:</b> It was a well-known practice in biblical times that if a man died without leaving an heir, it was the obligation of his nearest of kin (usually his brother) to marry the widow and sire a son—who would then bear the name of the deceased man (Deut. 25:5–10)."
"Genesis 38:10 <b>What he did was ill:</b> Onan dies because he does not fulfill his legal obligation to continue his brother’s line. The later interpretation, that his crime was masturbation (“onanism”), has no basis in this text."
Genesis 38:11 <b>Otherwise he will die:</b> Folk belief often regarded a woman who had outlived two husbands as a bad risk in marriage. The emotion here—a father’s fear of losing a young son—will return as central in 42:36.
"Genesis 38:18 <b>seal … cord … staff:</b> Individual objects of identification in the ancient Near East, particularly the seal, which served to sign documents. See Speiser."
"Genesis 38:21 <b>prostitute:</b> Heb. <i>kedesha,</i> which in cognate languages may indicate a “holy” official, here seems to describe a woman who is similarly outside the usual constraints of family."
"Genesis 38:27 <b>Now it was … :</b> The scene here rather strikingly recalls Yaakov and Esav at birth: twins, the hand reaching out, and the struggle to be first."
Genesis 38:29 <b>breach:</b> Not in the sense of a “breach birth.”
"Genesis 38:30 <b>Zerah:</b> Possibly connoting “red of dawn”—connecting with the scarlet thread of v.28 (and possibly paralleling Esav, who was also known as Edom, the “Red One”)."
"Genesis 39:1 <b>Potifar… :</b> The narrative resumes exactly, almost literally, where it had left off in 37:36."
Genesis 39:2 <b>a man of success:</b> Or “a man blessed by success.”
Genesis 39:4 <b>over his house:</b> Foreshadowing Yosef’s eventual position and title (41:40).
"Genesis 39:6 <b>left:</b> Consigned; see also v.13 for a play on words. <b>except for the bread that he ate:</b> Since the Egyptians did not eat with foreigners (see, for instance, 43:32). <b>fair of form and fair to look at:</b> The only other person in the Bible described in exactly these words is Rahel, Yosef’s mother (29:17). We are thus given an indirect clue about the source of Yaakov’s doting behavior in the Yosef story."
"Genesis 39:9 <b>sinning:</b> Or “at fault.” <b>against God:</b> From this point on, it is clear that Yosef is no longer the spoiled brat of Chap. 37. At key points in his life he consistently makes mention of God as the source of his success and good fortune (40:8; 41:16; 45:5, 7, 9)."
"Genesis 39:10 <b>to lie beside her, to be with her:</b> A curious expression. Why does not the text say, as in v.7, “to he with her”? There is an additional irony: “to be with” usually refers to God (see v.2, for example)."
Genesis 39:14 <b>play around:</b> A sexual reference; or it might mean “laugh at.” (Translated laughing-and-loving in 26:8.)
"Genesis 39:15 <b>beside:</b> Three times here, the word perhaps suggests to the audience that Yosef’s garment is all that she will ever get “to lie beside her.”"
Genesis 39:20 <b>dungeon:</b> Hebrew obscure.
"Genesis 39:21 <b>kindness:</b> Or “faithfulness,” “loyalty.” See 32:11."
"Genesis 40:1 <b>the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt:</b> The Hebrew has “the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the baker,” a common construction in biblical Hebrew."
Genesis 40:2 <b>cupbearer:</b> Others use “butler.”
Genesis 40:4 <b>appointed Yosef:</b> As Potifar had “appointed him over his house” (39:4).
Genesis 40:5 <b>interpretation:</b> Or “meaning.”
"Genesis 40:8 <b>Are not interpretations from God:</b> Foreshadowing 41:16, “Not I!/ God will answer….”"
Genesis 40:11 <b>Pharaoh’s cup:</b> The cup was a common symbol of fate in the ancient Near East.
Genesis 40:13 <b>lift up your head:</b> A parallel expression in Assyrian means “release” or “pardon.”
Genesis 40:14 <b>with you:</b> Possibly stressing the personal nature of the plea.
Genesis 40:15 <b>stolen:</b> The Yaakov motif of Chaps. 30–31.
Genesis 40:16 <b>white-bread:</b> Others use “wicker.”
"Genesis 40:17 <b>eating:</b> In Pharaoh’s dreams of Chap. 41, “eating up” comes to symbolize the disaster of famine."
Genesis 40:19 <b>hang … on a tree:</b> Others use “impale on a stake.”
"Genesis 40:23 <b>he forgot him:</b> Here, as in Potifar’s house, initial success gives way to failure and continued imprisonment."
Genesis 41:1 <b>two years’-time:</b> Lit. “two years of days.”
"Genesis 41:2 <b>cows:</b> in later (Ptolemaic) Egyptian inscriptions, as here, cows represent years."
Genesis 41:5 <b>fat and good:</b> Referring to the ears of grain.
"Genesis 41:8 <b>his dream:</b> The two dreams function as one, as Yosef explains."
Genesis 41:19 <b>in all the land … I have never seen their like:</b> Pharaoh’s description of his dream is more vivid than the narrator’s (vv.1–4).
Genesis 41:25 <b>is one:</b> Or “has a single meaning.”
"Genesis 41:26 <b>The seven good cows …</b>: Yosef’s interpretation is highly structured. The rhetoric emphasizes the last line of v.27: after hearing “<i>x</i> are seven years,” three times, we hear “<i>x</i> will be seven years of famine!” See above, 40:19, where “Pharaoh will lift up your head” is followed by “from off you.”"
"Genesis 41:34 <b>let him appoint appointed-overseers:</b> We already know that Yosef is a man often entrusted with responsibility—“appointed” (39:4, 40:4). <b>dividing … into five parts:</b> Hebrew obscure. B-R uses “arm (the land of Egypt).”"
"Genesis 41:35 <b>hand:</b> I.e., supervision."
"Genesis 41:36 <b>the land:</b> I.e., its people."
Genesis 41:37 <b>The words seemed good:</b> Words now bring about Yosef’s rise to power.
"Genesis 41:40 <b>the One Over My House:</b> A title similar to that of Yosef’s steward in 43:16ff. <b>submit:</b> Hebrew obscure. <b>only by the throne:</b> Similar to Yosef’s situation in Potifar’s house, “He is no greater in this house than I” (39:9)—but he withholds his wife."
"Genesis 41:41 <b>all the land of Egypt:</b> A refrain here, pointing to Yosef’s power."
"Genesis 41:43 <b><i>Avrekh/</i>Attention:</b> Hebrew unclear. Some suggest that it is Hebrew for “bend the knee,” others that it resembles an Assyrian title."
"Genesis 41:45 <b><i>Tzafenat-Pane’ah</i>/The God Speaks and He Lives:</b> An Egyptian name which is appropriate to the story. Yosef lives, and through him so do Egypt, his family, and the future People of Israel. <b>Yosef’s influence:</b> Perhaps an idiom, or merely “Yosef went out.”"
"Genesis 41:46 <b>thirty:</b> Yosef will be in power for eighty years (2×40), another patterned number."
"Genesis 41:51 <b>Menashe:</b> Trad. English “Menasseh.” <b>made-me-forget:</b> Yet he does not forget for long, any more than the cupbearer did (Chap. 41)."
Genesis 41:52 <b>bear fruit … affliction:</b> Two expressions from the stories about the Patriarchs.
Genesis 41:54 <b>Famine occurred in all lands:</b> The repetition of “all” here brings home the totality of the famine.
"Genesis 42:2 <b>that we may live and not die:</b> This becomes a refrain in the story, alternating in meaning between Yosef’s family (here and 43:8) and the Egyptians (47:19)."
"Genesis 42:4 <b>Yosef’s brother:</b> His full brother, as opposed to the others who were half-brothers."
Genesis 42:7 <b>recognized:</b> Ironically recalling the brothers’ “Pray recognize” of 37:32. <b>pretended-no-recognition:</b> Others use “pretended to be a stranger.”
Genesis 42:9 <b>nakedness:</b> Vulnerability (strategically).
"Genesis 42:11 <b>honest:</b> They will be, by the end of the chapter (Redford)."
"Genesis 42:13 <b>twelve:</b> At last they think of themselves as a unit, “we are brothers!”"
"Genesis 42:16 <b>tested:</b> Heb. <i>bahan</i>, a different root from the word translated “tested” (<i>nissa</i>) in 22:1. Interestingly, the English “test” and the Hebrew <i>bhn</i> originally meant the refining of metals, separating pure from impure. <b>or not</b>—: Or “(in you.) / If not….”"
"Genesis 42:21 <b>guilty:</b> Perhaps it is the phrase “youngest brother” in Yosef’s words (v.20) that jars their memory. They must now show responsibility to their father, which they had evaded in Chap. 37. <b>distress…. distress:</b> Another example of justice in the Bible: the punishment fits the crime."
"Genesis 42:22 <b>Re’uven:</b> A replay of Chap. 37, with Re’uven again making extravagant but ineffective declarations. Once again Yehuda will emerge in charge."
Genesis 42:23 <b>translator:</b> Interpreter.
"Genesis 42:24 <b>imprisoning:</b> Or “fettering.” <b>before their eyes:</b> As opposed to the sale of Yosef where their presence is not mentioned, strictly speaking."
Genesis 42:25 <b>they fill:</b> “They” refers to Yosef’s servants. <b>silver-pieces:</b> Yosef had been sold for silver (37:28).
"Genesis 42:30 <b>The man:</b> Used eight times of Yosef in Chaps. 42–44, perhaps out of ironic anonymity. <b>harshly:</b> Paralleling their earlier attitude: they “could not speak to him in peace” (37:4)."
Genesis 42:37 <b>My two sons:</b> Re’uven is again spouting nonsense. <b>I myself will return him:</b> But he did not in 37:22 (Ackerman 1982).
"Genesis 42:38 <b>My son is not to go down…. you will bring down my gray hair in grief:</b> Yaakov will indeed “go down,” but to Egypt, not to Sheol, to meet his “dead” son. The latter part of the phrase is basically repeated in 44:29 and 44:31, as a key to the father’s feelings. <b>he alone is left:</b> Of his mother Rahel (see 44:20)."
Genesis 43:3 <b>my face:</b> The great confrontation theme of the Yaakov stories returns.
"Genesis 43:4–5 <b>send:</b> Or “release,” “let go.”"
Genesis 43:9 <b>I will act as his pledge/ at my hand you may seek him:</b> Echoing Yaakov’s own language of responsibility in 31:39 (“I would make good the loss/ at my hand you would seek it”). <b>in your presence:</b> Literally “before your face.”
"Genesis 43:11 <b>Take:</b> Three times, culminating in the pathetic “And as for your brother, take him!” (v.13). <b>balsam … honey, balm and ladanum, pistachio nuts and almonds:</b> Another example of concealment in the story. The list includes the cargo of the caravan that carried Yosef away (37:25)."
Genesis 43:12 <b>two times over … oversight:</b> Heb. <i>mishne … mishge.</i>
"Genesis 43:14 <b>God Shaddai:</b> Yaakov uses the same term for God as did his father, when Yaakov left for Aram (28:3). bereaved: Echoing the fears of his mother Rivka (27:45)."
"Genesis 43:18 <b>roll upon us:</b> Others use “attack us.” <b>roll upon us, and fall upon us:</b> The rhythm reflects the brothers’ emotional anguish."
"Genesis 43:23 <b>has come in:</b> I.e., I have received full payment."
"Genesis 43:27 <b>well:</b> Or “at peace”—as before, a key element of the Yaakov stories."
Genesis 43:29 <b>Is this:</b> Or “So this is.”
"Genesis 43:34 <b>five times:</b> Others use “many times.” Yet the prominence of the number five throughout the Yosef story, as noted above, should not be overlooked."
Genesis 44:2 <b>my goblet:</b> The ensuing scene is somewhat parallel to Rahel’s theft of the <i>terafim</i> (compare v.9 with 31:32).
"Genesis 44:5 <b>divines:</b> Cups were used in predicting the future in the ancient Near East; see note to 40:11. The diviner would examine the shapes made by insoluble liquids, such as oil in water. <b>You have wrought ill:</b> Resembling Laban’s accusation against Yaakov, “You have done foolishly” (31:28)."
Genesis 44:10 <b>clear:</b> Of punishment.
Genesis 44:16 <b>your servants’ crime:</b> Of selling Yosef?
Genesis 44:17 <b>But he said:</b> “He” is Yosef. <b>this:</b> Enslaving all of the brothers.
"Genesis 44:18 <b>Now Yehuda … said … :</b> Yehuda’s great speech, masterful in its rhetoric, is chiefly aimed at stirring up sympathy for the father; it contains the word “father” fourteen times. Binyamin, whose appearance actually causes Yosef great anguish, is hardly treated as a personality at all. <b>you are like Pharaoh:</b> Lit. “like you is like Pharaoh.”"
"Genesis 44:22 <b>he would die:</b> “He” refers to Yaakov, although the Hebrew is somewhat ambiguous."
"Genesis 44:28 <b>thus far:</b> A hint that Yosef is still alive, or perhaps a tiny expression of hope."
"Genesis 44:30 <b>life:</b> Heb. <i>nefesh,</i> also “emotions” or “feelings.”"
Genesis 44:31 <b>our father:</b> Is Yehuda unknowingly including Yosef?
Genesis 44:11 <b>as disinherited:</b> Or “reduced-to-poverty.”
"Genesis 44:13 <b>all the weight I carry:</b> I.e., my importance."
Genesis 44:15 <b>his brothers spoke with him:</b> Which they could not do “in peace” in 37:4.
Genesis 44:16 <b>come:</b> The verb focuses toward Pharaoh’s invitation to follow: “Yosef’s brothers have come!” (v.16) to “and come to me” (v.18) to “and come!” (v.19).
"Genesis 44:18 <b>good-things:</b> More precisely, “best-things” (“good” has been retained here to indicate a major theme of the story: good and ill)."
Genesis 44:20 <b>Let not your eyes look-with-regret:</b> Possibly “Do not stint.”
Genesis 44:22 <b>but to Binyamin he gave:</b> The original situation (Chap. 37) is set up once more; this time the brothers do not react adversely to the youngest son’s being favored.
"Genesis 44:27 <b>Yosef’s words:</b> In Chap. 37 his words were damaging, but here they are life-giving."
"Genesis 46:2 <b>Yaakov! Yaakov!:</b> Doubled as in 22:11 and other moments of dramatic revelations in the Bible (e.g., Ex. 3:4)."
"Genesis 46:4 <b>lay his hand on your eyes:</b> I.e., be present at your death."
"Genesis 46:8 <b>Now these are the names … :</b> This phrase opens the book of Exodus, making that book a resumption of the Genesis narrative."
"Genesis 46:27 <b>seventy:</b> Once again, the “perfect” number."
Genesis 46:33 <b>What is it that you do:</b> What is your occupation?
"Genesis 46:34 <b>every shepherd … is an abomination to the Egyptians:</b> Speiser understands this as a reference to the Hyksos “shepherd kings,” who as foreigners ruled Egypt in the mid-Second Millennium (until they were driven out)."
"Genesis 46:47.4 <b>It is to sojourn:</b> Are they still sensitive to the accusation in 42:12, “For it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see”?"
Genesis 46:8 <b>days and years:</b> See the note to 25:7.
Genesis 46:9 <b>in the days of:</b> Others use “during.”
Genesis 46:17 <b>got-them-through:</b> Lit. “led them.”
Genesis 46:21 <b>transferred them:</b> Hebrew difficult; some read “enslaved them.”
Genesis 46:24 <b>a fifth:</b> Here is the ubiquitous “five” again.
"Genesis 48:5 <b>they are mine:</b> As it were, adopted. <b>Efrayim and Menashe:</b> Note how Yaakov reverses the order of birth; see vv.14, 17–19."
"Genesis 48:7 <b>Rahel died on me:</b> The memory is still painful to Yaakov, even after many years."
Genesis 48:11 <b>your face:</b> The final and most powerful occurrence of the term.
Genesis 48:15 <b>tended:</b> Or “shepherded.”
"Genesis 48:16 <b>redeemed me from all ill-fortune:</b> Despite his words in 47:9, perhaps Yaakov achieves a measure of peace in the end. <b>my name continue to be called through them:</b> My line continue through them. <b>teem-like-fish:</b> Others use “become teeming (multitudes).”"
"Genesis 48:19 <b>I know:</b> Though blind, Yaakov knows exactly what he is doing, unlike his father in Chap. 27."
"Genesis 48:22 <b>one portion over and above:</b> Hebrew unclear. We do not know to what event Yaakov is referring in this entire verse. <b>took away:</b> Others use “will take,” “must take.”"
Genesis 49:4 <b>when you mounted … :</b> Alluding to 35:21–22.
"Genesis 49:5 <b>ties-of-kinship:</b> Hebrew obscure. Others use “weapons,” “swords” (B-R uses “mattocks”)."
Genesis 49:6 <b>in their anger they kill men:</b> See 34:25–26.
Genesis 49:8 <b>Yehuda … enemies:</b> Heb. <i>yehuda/ atta yodukha ahikha/ yadekha al oref oyevekha.</i>
Genesis 49:9 <b>lion:</b> Eventually the symbol of the (Judahite) monarchy.
Genesis 49:10 <b>until they bring … :</b> Hebrew difficult; others use “until Shiloh comes.” The phrase is an old and unsolved problem for interpreter and translator alike.
Genesis 49:11 <b>colt:</b> Of a donkey.
"Genesis 49:13 <b>Tzidon:</b> Sidon, the important Phoenician city (north of Israel)."
Genesis 49:15 <b>laboring serf:</b> The Hebrew <i>mas ‘oved</i> denotes forced labor.
Genesis 49:16 <b>mete-out-judgment:</b> Others use “will endure.”
Genesis 49:18 <b>I wait-in-hope … :</b> Either a deathbed cry or possibly the cry of a falling rider (see the preceding line) (Ehrlich).
Genesis 49:19 <b>goad:</b> Lit. “attack”; a play on “Gad” (Heb. <i>gad gedud yegudennu</i>).
Genesis 49:24 <b>arms and hands:</b> Lit. “arms of his hands.”
"Genesis 49:25 <b>Shaddai:</b> Once again connected to fertility (note the content of the following lines). <b>give-you-blessing:</b> Just as Yaakov had blessed Yosef’s sons, so Yosef is the only one of the twelve brothers to whom Yaakov applies the term."
"Genesis 49:26 <b>mountains:</b> Reading <i>hararei</i> for the traditional Hebrew <i>horei,</i> “parents” on the basis of Hab. 3:6."
"Genesis 49:28 <b>tribes:</b> Heb. <i>shevatim,</i> “staffs,” which symbolized the tribes."
Genesis 49:31 <b>Lea:</b> Not called “my wife.” Again the old feelings remain vivid.
Genesis 49:33 <b>expired:</b> Omitted are the “old and satisfied in days” that were applied to his father and grandfather.
"Genesis 50:9 <b>heavy:</b> Three times through v.11. The root <i>k-b-d</i> connotes “honor,” “importance,” “weight,” and is central here perhaps to emphasize the respect shown to Yaakov."
"Genesis 50:13 <b>the cave in the field of Makhpela:</b> Despite God’s continual promise of the land throughout the book, this is practically all that the Patriarchs possess at the end of Genesis."
Genesis 50:22 <b>a hundred and ten years:</b> The ideal Egyptian life span.
Genesis 50:23 <b>born on Yosef’s knees:</b> Considered his own; see 30:3.
Genesis 50:24 <b>brothers:</b> Presumably meant in the sense of “family.”
Genesis 50:25 <b>Sons of Israel:</b> They are no longer merely the sons of one man but are now on their way to becoming a people.
"Exodus 1:1 <b>children of Israel:</b> Or “sons,” though it should be noted that the Hebrew <i>b‘nei</i> can denote members of a group in general, not just family. In this verse, “children” has been printed with a lowercase “c”; v.7 the whole expression comes to mean a nation, and so a capital “C” has been utilized (Hebrew writing does not make this distinction). <b>Yaakov:</b> Trad. English “Jacob.”"
"Exodus 1:2–4 <b>Re’uven, Shim’on, Levi, Yehuda, Yissakhar, Zevulun, Binyamin, Dan, Naftali, Gad, Asher:</b> Trad. English “Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher.”"
"Exodus 1:5 <b>issuing:</b> The same Hebrew verb (<i>yatzo</i>’) is later used to describe the Israelites’ “going out” of Egypt (e.g., 12:31, 41). <b>loins:</b> A figurative expression denoting the genitals. <b>seventy:</b> A number expressing perfection or wholeness in the thought of many ancient cultures; see Gen. 46:8–27 for the original passage."
Exodus 1:6 <b>And Yosef died … :</b> Note the rhythmic lilt of this verse; such devices are often used in biblical style when a key event is portrayed. <b>Yosef:</b> Trad. English “Joseph.”
"Exodus 1:7 <b>Yet:</b> Despite the disappearance of the politically influential generation of Yosef, the Israelites’ success continues (Cassuto). <b>swarmed:</b> This verb is usually applied to animals (see Gen. 1:20) (Greenberg 1969). Here the term is positive, as part of God’s plan; shortly, it will carry a negative connotation for Pharaoh. <b>grew mighty (in number):</b> This reflects the promise of God to Avraham in Gen. 18:18 (to become “a mighty nation”) (Keil and Delitzsch)."
"Exodus 1:8 <b>a new king:</b> His name is not given, even though later biblical books do refer to foreign rulers by name. This is perhaps another example of the biblical text’s playing down history in favor of stressing the story and its lesson. <b>who had not known Yosef:</b> Just as his successor will say “I do not know YHWH” (5:2), and will continue the oppression begun here."
Exodus 1:9 <b>his people … (this) people:</b> Pharaoh states the case as the conflict between one national entity and another.
"Exodus 1:10 <b>use-our-wits:</b> Others, “We must be prudent,” “Let us deal shrewdly.” <b>it:</b> The shift from plural to singular to refer to a plural object is not unusual in biblical parlance. <b>added:</b> Heb. <i>nosaf</i>, like Yosef (Joseph), whose name is interpreted as “May God add … another son” at his birth in Gen. 30:24. <b>go up away:</b> Heb. unclear."
"Exodus 1:11 <b>afflict:</b> Or “oppress.” <b>Pharaoh:</b> Heb. <i>Par’o.</i> This is an Egyptian title, “(Lord of) the Great House,” and not a proper name. One could justifiably translate, as some do, “<i>the</i> Pharaoh.”"
"Exodus 1:12 <b>so … so:</b> Heb. <i>ken … ken.</i> Ackerman (1974) interprets this as a rhyming retort to Pharaoh’s earlier <i>pen</i> (“<i>lest</i> he become many more”) in 1:10. <b>burst forth:</b> The verb (Heb. <i>parotz</i>) is connected to fertility and wealth in Genesis (e.g., 28:14)."
"Exodus 1:13 <b>crushing-labor:</b> A rare Hebrew word, here translated according to early rabbinic tradition, <i>perekh</i> is used rhetorically three times in Lev. 25 (vv. 43, 46, and 53), where the Israelites are given laws about how to deal with their impoverished countrymen (v.43, “you are not to oppress him with crushing-labor”)."
"Exodus 1:14 <b>in the field:</b> In Egyptian accounts, the phrase indicates hard labor. <b>all their service … :</b> The Hebrew syntax is difficult. Here the phrase is taken as the object of “they embittered.”"
"Exodus 1:15 <b>midwives of the Hebrews:</b> The ambiguity of this phrase raises an ancient question: were they Hebrew or Egyptian? The names seem Semitic (and hence un-Egyptian); then, too, the use of “Hebrew” in the Bible usually occurs when a foreigner is talking about Israelites. Yet the women’s answer in v.19 suggests that they are in fact Egyptians. Abravanel notes that Hebrew women would not be likely to kill Hebrew babies."
"Exodus 1:16 <b>supporting-stones:</b> Some suggest that these were stools or other objects on which to support women in labor, while others see them as a reference to the testicles of the newborn males."
Exodus 1:17 <b>held … in awe:</b> Trad. “feared.” This may be a sound-play on “see” in v.16: <i>va-yire’u</i> (held in awe) resembles <i>va-yir’u</i> (“saw”).
"Exodus 1:19 <b>lively:</b> Another form of the Hebrew would mean “animals,” and so B-R combined the two ideas in rendering the word as “lively-like-animals.”"
"Exodus 1:20–21 <b>And the people … :</b> The order here seems confused. “And the people …” is perhaps out of place, although the thought is not inappropriate for the context."
"Exodus 1:22 <b>all his people:</b> Specialists (the midwives) are not equal to the task of checking the Israelite population explosion, and so the whole Egyptian population must now be enlisted. <b>Nile:</b> Heb. <i>ye’or,</i> Egyptian <i>itrw:,</i> “the great river” (cf. Heb. <i>ha-nahar ha-gadol,</i> with the same meaning, used for the Euphrates in Gen. 15:18 etc.)."
"Exodus 2:1 <b>a man … a daughter:</b> Moshe’s parents are anonymous, unlike the usual king and queen of the hero myth found in other cultures. The namelessness of all the secondary characters in this chapter—sister, Pharaoh’s daughter and her maids—helps us to focus on the protagonist and on his name."
"Exodus 2:2 <b>she saw him—that he was goodly:</b> The parallel in Genesis is “God saw the light: that it was good” (Gen. 1:4). <b>goodly:</b> Handsome (so Ibn Ezra, among others), although others interpret the Hebrew <i>tov</i> as “healthy,” given the context. What is important is the Genesis connection just mentioned. <b>three months:</b> Another “perfect” number, which will recur with the Israelites’ three-month trip to Mount Sinai (see 19:1)."
"Exodus 2:3 <b>little-ark:</b> The term used to designate the little basket/boat, <i>teiva,</i> has clearly been chosen to reflect back to Noah’s ark in Genesis. The implication is that just as God saved Noah and thus humanity from destruction by water, so will he now save Moshe and the Israelites from the same. <b>papyrus:</b> A material that floats; it was also used in biblical times for writing, including biblical texts. <b>in the reeds:</b> Another foreshadowing; when Moshe grows up, he will lead the liberated people through the Sea of Reeds. The word <i>suf</i> (reeds) appears to be a loan-word from Egyptian."
"Exodus 2:4 <b>to know:</b> Better English would be “to learn.” This first occurrence of the Hebrew word <i>yado’a</i> foreshadows the later theme of the Egyptians’ and the Israelites’ coming to “know” (or “acknowledge”) God’s power. For the moment, and in the story that follows, the issue is one of revealing information—Moshe’s fate (2:4) and the discovery of his crime (2:14)."
"Exodus 2:5 <b>Pharaoh’s daughter:</b> Her station is important, for it enables Moshe to be saved and to be brought up in the Egyptian palace (useful both for his political future and for literary irony of situation). <b>girls:</b> Maidservants."
"Exodus 2:6 <b>She opened … boy weeping!:</b> The emphatic, halting syntax of the narrative brings out the visual drama of seeing, taking, opening, and identifying. <b>One of the Hebrews’ children:</b> How does she know that? The simplest explanation lies in the situation itself and not in any identifying marks. Who else but a Hebrew, under the threat of losing her baby, would set such a child adrift? <b>is this:</b> Or “must this be.”"
"Exodus 2:8 <b>Go:</b> In biblical Hebrew, a verb repeated from a question is the equivalent of “Yes,” for which there was no other expression."
"Exodus 2:10 <b>grew:</b> His age is not mentioned, but weaning may be inferred (cf. Gen. 21:8) as the appropriate boundary, and hence the child was probably around three (DeVaux 1965). <b>he became her son:</b> A formulaic expression for legal adoption. <b>Moshe/He-Who-Pulls-Out:</b> Trad. English “Moses.” <i>Mss</i> is a well-attested name in ancient Egypt, meaning “son of” (as in Ra’amses—“son of Ra”—in Ex. 1:11). Thus it is quite appropriate that Pharaoh’s daughter names her adopted son in this manner. However, there is an explicit irony here, as Buber (1988) and others have pointed out. The princess, in a Hebrew folk etymology (one based on sound rather than on the scientific derivation of words), thinks that the name Moshe recalls her act of “pulling out” the baby from the Nile. But the verb form in <i>moshe</i> is active, not passive, and thus it is Moshe himself who will one day “pull out” Israel from the life-threatening waters of both slavery and the Sea of Reeds."
"Exodus 2:11 <b>some years later:</b> Heb. <i>yamim,</i> lit. “days,” can mean longer periods of time, and often years. Here the narrative skips over what it considers unimportant, and we are presented with a young man, who already has strong identity and opinions. <b>his brothers:</b> Occurring twice in this verse, this phrase can only mean that Moshe was aware of his background, and concerned with the plight of the Israelites (Heb. <i>r’h b-,</i> “see” with a specific preposition, indicates not only observation but sympathy)."
"Exodus 2:12 <b>no man (there):</b> Although some have interpreted this as “no man around to help,” the expression taken in context would seem to indicate that Moshe was afraid of being seen. This incident reveals Moshe’s concern and early leanings toward being a liberator, but also demonstrates his youthful lack of forethought. In fact, it will take God, not Moshe’s own actions, to set the liberation process in motion. <b>struck down:</b> This is the same verb (Heb. <i>hakkeh)</i> that the narrator used in v.11 to describe the fatal beating received by the Israelite slave."
"Exodus 2:13 <b>Hebrew men scuffling:</b> A rhyme in Hebrew, <i>anashim ’ivriyyim nitzim.</i>"
"Exodus 2:14 <b>Who made you prince … :</b> One hears here echoes of Moshe’s later experiences with his “hard-necked” people, which commence in the book of Exodus (Greenberg 1969). <b>judge:</b> Or “ruler.” I have retained “judge” here in order not to lose the connection with 5:21."
"Exodus 2:15 <b>Moshe fled … and settled:</b> The details about what must have been a psychologically important journey are not spelled out, as the narrative rushes toward its first great climax in Chap. 3. More important than the journey motif is that of exile, brought out tellingly in v.22. <b>settled … sat:</b> Adding the “settle down” of v.21, we hear a threefold use of <i>yashov,</i> perhaps to stress Moshe’s new life."
"Exodus 2:16 <b>priest of Midyan:</b> This title has spawned extensive theorizing about the origins of Mosaic religion (sometimes called the “Kenite Hypothesis” after the Kenites, a tribe of smiths connected to Moshe’s father-in-law and spoken of favorably at a number of points in the Bible). It has been suggested that Moshe learned the rudiments of his religious or legal system from this source. We do not have enough evidence to make a positive judgment on this theory; biographically, it does make sense for Moshe to marry into a holy family of some sort. <b>seven daughters:</b> The requisite “magic” number, as in a good folk tale."
"Exodus 2:19 <b>An Egyptian man:</b> Moshe would have been recognizable as such from his manner of dress and lack of facial hair. In addition, he is not yet fully an Israelite, spiritually speaking."
"Exodus 2:20 <b>So-where-is-he:</b> This is one word in the Hebrew (<i>ve-ayyo</i>). The whole verse stands in ironic contrast to Moshe’s earlier treatment (v. 14) at the hand of “his brothers” (Childs). There, he was rejected; here, his host cannot welcome him quickly enough. <b>For-what-reason:</b> Similarly this is one Hebrew word (<i>lamma</i>). <b>bread:</b> As often in both the Bible and other cultures, “bread” is here synonymous with “food.”"
Exodus 2:21 <b>Tzippora:</b> Trad. English “Zipporah.” The name means “bird”; such animal names are still popular among Bedouin.
"Exodus 2:22 <b>Gershom/Sojourner There:</b> Related to the Hebrew <i>ger</i>, “sojourner” or resident alien. The name more accurately reflects the sound of the verb <i>garesh,</i> “drive out” (so Abravanel), which plays its role in the Exodus stories (and in Moshe’s recent experience in the narrative). As my student Nancy Ginsberg once pointed out, this naming of sons to express the feelings about exile has already occurred in a more personally positive context—with Yosef (see Gen. 41:50–52). <b>A sojourner … in a foreign land:</b> The King James Version phrase, “a stranger in a strange land,” is stunning, but the Hebrew uses two different roots (<i>gur</i> and <i>nakhor</i>)."
"Exodus 2:23 <b>the king of Egypt died./ The Children of Israel groaned:</b> The change in regime does not prove beneficial to the suffering slaves, but makes it possible for Moshe to return to Egypt, thus impelling the narrative along and reestablishing the link between Moshe and his people. <b>cried out:</b> The same verb (Heb. <i>tza’ok</i>) is used to describe the “hue and cry” of Sodom and Gomorra (Gen. 18:20; see also the note to 22:22, below)."
"Exodus 2:23–24 <b>groaned … cried out … plea-for-help … moaning:</b> As in 1:7, four phrases describe the Israelites’ actions. Note also the double use of “from the servitude.”"
"Exodus 2:24 <b>Avraham, Yitzhak, Yaakov:</b> Trad. English “Abraham, Isaac, Jacob.”"
"Exodus 2:25 <b>knew:</b> Others, “took notice,” but <i>yado’a</i> needs to be noticed throughout the book as a key word."
"Exodus 3:1 <b>Now Moshe was shepherding … :</b> The Hebrew syntax indicates the beginning of an entirely new story. <b>shepherding:</b> A symbol of great power in the ancient Near East; witness the enduring image of King David, sprung from shepherding roots, and of course that of Jesus. <b>Yitro:</b> Trad. English “Jethro.” It is not clear why other names (Re’uel, Hovav) are also associated with him. The name, if Semitic, means “excellence.” <b>behind:</b> Others, “to the west side of,” “to the far side of,” or simply “into,” although the word seems to convey a certain mystery. Fairy tales often portray the hero’s going deep into a forest and the like. <b>mountain of God:</b> Sinai is so designated only several times subsequently in the Pentateuch, suggesting perhaps biblical religion’s reluctance to make of it a shrine of permanence. <b>Horev:</b> Another name for Sinai, principally used in Deuteronomy (but also twice more in Exodus, 17:6 and 33:6). A related Hebrew root, <i>harev</i>, means “dry.”"
"Exodus 3:2 <b>Y<small>hwh</small>’s messenger:</b> Traditionally “angel,” but the English word stems from the Greek <i>angelos,</i> which means “messenger.” In Genesis, God appears in somewhat human guise (cf. Chap. 18), and “messenger” indicates an unspecified manifestation of God, open to wide interpretation. <b>in the flame:</b> Others, “as a flame.” <b>bush:</b> Jewish tradition identifies it as a thornbush, but the precise plant remains unknown. The bush, called <i>s’neh</i> in Hebrew, perhaps has the added function here of providing assonance with <i>Sinai</i>. <b>the bush is burning … the bush is not consumed:</b> The use of tense (plus the opening “here”) conveys the immediacy of the vision. <b>not consumed:</b> The symbolism of the imperishable bush is left open for the reader; commentators suggest variously Israel and God himself."
"Exodus 3:3 <b>let me turn aside:</b> Despite Moshe’s apparent retirement from intervening on behalf of his brothers in Egypt, his reaction here seems active, not passive. He does not shirk from seeking out the strange sight."
"Exodus 3:4 <b>Moshe! Moshe!:</b> The name is repeated for emphasis, as in Gen. 22:11 <b>Here I am:</b> The classic response of biblical heroes; see Gen. 22:1, 11; I Sam. 3:4."
"Exodus 3:5 <b>put off your sandal from your foot:</b> A common form of respect in the ancient East, still practiced by Muslims in worship."
"Exodus 3:6 <b>the God of your father:</b> Hearkening back to the personal and family relationships with God in Genesis (see, for instance, Gen. 26:24, 31:42, 32:10). <b>Avraham … :</b> The text stresses the Patriarchs, reminding both Moshe and the reader of the promises made to them in Genesis."
"Exodus 3:7 <b>I have seen … heard … known:</b> Echoing the narrative above, 2:24–25. <b>the affliction of my people:</b> Heb. <i>’oni ’ammi.</i> <b>my people:</b> This fateful designation signals the beginning of the liberation process. The Golden Calf story (Chaps. 32ff.) provides a tragic variation on this phrase."
"Exodus 3:8 <b>I have come down:</b> The phrase indicates God’s intervention in human affairs (as, negatively, in Gen. 11:7). <b>a land flowing with milk and honey:</b> Or with “goats’ milk and date-syrup.” This description of Canaan is repeated many times in the three subsequent books of the Pentateuch, but is not found in Genesis. <b>Canaanite</b> [etc.]: These names are the Bible’s designation for the indigenous peoples of Canaan at the time of the Israelite conquest. Biblical lists contain varying numbers of peoples, from six to ten. <b>Yevusite:</b> The pre-Israelite inhabitants of Jerusalem."
"Exodus 3:12 <b>this is the sign:</b> The thought is not entirely clear. It may signify that liberation signals Israel’s birth as a people, and therefore Moshe’s legitimacy as well. (<b>all</b>): “You” is plural here. <b>by:</b> As opposed to “upon,” since the people will not be allowed to trespass its sacred boundaries (see 19:12)."
Exodus 3:13 <b>What is his name?:</b> See Commentary below. B-R: “What is behind his name?”
"Exodus 3:14 <b>E<small>hyeh</small> A<small>sher</small> E<small>hyeh</small> …</b>: The syntax is difficult. Others, “I am that I am.”"
"Exodus 3:15 <b>title:</b> Others, “memorial.”"
Exodus 3:16 <b>elders:</b> They are the holders of political power in such a tribal society. <b>taken account.</b> As per Yosef’s promise in Gen. 50:24.
"Exodus 3:18 <b>pray let us go:</b> Interestingly, the initial request made of Pharaoh is not for emancipation but for permission to observe a religious festival. It eventually becomes clear that Israel cannot be Israel until it is free of Egyptian hegemony. <b>slaughter (offerings):</b> Offer animal sacrifices."
"Exodus 3:21 <b>you shall not go empty-handed:</b> The despoiling of the Egyptians is reminiscent of obtaining booty in war. At the same time, there is probably a legal background to this (Daube 1961): the furnishing of a freed slave with provisions. The follow-up to the despoiling, intended or not, is God’s command that, in Israel’s future observance of religious festivals in the Promised Land, “no one is to be seen in my presence empty-handed” (Ex. 23:15)."
"Exodus 3:22 <b>ask of:</b> Others, “borrow.” <b>strip:</b> Here the verb (<i>natzel</i>) means “strip,” perhaps punning on a different form used in v.8 which means “rescue.”"
Exodus 4:1 <b>spoke up … said:</b> This coupling of verbs is common in Ugaritic and Hebrew to denote a new thought on the speaker’s part (Cassuto 1967).
Exodus 4:4 <b>send forth:</b> Or “stretch out.”
"Exodus 4:6 <b>bosom:</b> Others, “upper folds of (his) cloak.”"
"Exodus 4:6 <b>had <i>tzaraat</i>:</b> Trad. “was leprous,” but <i>tzaraat</i> is now understood as a kind of skin disease, not as serious as true leprosy. In the Bible, it was, however, often taken as a sign from God of wrongdoing on the part of the victim."
"Exodus 4:8 <b>voice:</b> Meaning “message,” as in Ugaritic usage. <b>sign:</b> These were often required or used by prophets in the Bible (see the discussion in Deut. 13:2ff.) (Greenberg 1969)."
"Exodus 4:9 <b>blood:</b> Since the Nile was regarded as divine by the Egyptians, not only would such a plague be miraculous and devastating, but it would also be a direct swipe at the Egyptian religion."
"Exodus 4:10 <b>no man of words am I:</b> Yet this is exactly the quality that Moshe’s mission requires! (Greenberg 1969). Similarly, Jeremiah (1:6) seeks to evade the call, although his refusal is based more on inexperience than on lack of eloquence. <b>yesterday … the day-before:</b> A Hebrew idiom for “the past.” <b>heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue:</b> The nature of Moshe’s speech impediment is not clear. Curiously, writes Buber (1988), it is the stammerer whose task it is to bring down God’s word to the human world."
"Exodus 4:13 <b>pray send by whose hand you will send!:</b> That is, find someone else!"
"Exodus 4:14 <b>flared up:</b> Literally, burned, the normal biblical metaphor for anger. <b>Aharon:</b> Trad. English “Aaron.” This is the first mention of the brother whom we later find out was the firstborn. <b>the Levite:</b> Why this designation here? Some theorize that it means “joiner,” while others see it as a tracing of Levite roots as spokespeople in Israel. The phrase could also be translated as “Is not your brother Aharon the Levite?”"
Exodus 4:15 <b>you shall put … :</b> Moshe is to Aharon as God is to a prophet; the latter is to serve principally as a mouthpiece.
"Exodus 4:16 <b>a god:</b> Others, “an oracle.”"
"Exodus 4:18 <b>Yitro:</b> Here his name appears as <i>Yeter</i> in Hebrew. <b>Pray let me go:</b> B-R: “Now I will go.” <b>my brothers:</b> This concern has not been heard from Moshe during his years in Midyan, nor has he mentioned his past at all. <b>whether they are still alive:</b> Reminiscent of Yosef’s cry in Gen. 45:3, “Is my father still alive?” Note that Moshe says nothing to Yitro about what happened to him on the mountain."
"Exodus 4:19 <b>all the men:</b> Moshe need no longer fear for his life at Pharaoh’s hands, but he will shortly be threatened by God himself (see vv. 24–26)."
"Exodus 4:20 <b>mounted them upon a donkey:</b> A stereotyped biblical way of describing setting out on a journey. <b>staff of God:</b> In standard hero stories, one would expect to hear a good deal more about this object, which would normally possess magical powers. Here, as usual, such a motif has been suppressed. It surfaces later in Jewish legend, in full mythical garb. The staff is mentioned in this verse, possibly, to provide a dramatic conclusion to the entire revelation account: Moshe sets out for Egypt armed, as it were, with a token from God. This was the missing piece in his activity in Egypt."
"Exodus 4:21 <b>portents:</b> Signs, wonders. <b>send … free:</b> Others, “let … go.”"
"Exodus 4:22 <b>Thus says YHWH:</b> A formula often used by the prophets to open their pronouncements. The context is similar as well: the prophets stand frequently against the kings of Israel and Judah, arguing for an end to oppression. <b>my firstborn:</b> The use of this image is a statement of emotional force, not actual primacy of birth or antiquity, as Israel was a comparative latecomer in the ancient Near East."
"Exodus 4:24 <b>to make him die:</b> To kill him; the means is not specified, but one could surmise that illness is meant."
"Exodus 4:25 <b>his:</b> Whose? Presumably those of Moshe, who is then “released” by God."
"Exodus 4:26 <b>released him:</b> Or “relaxed (his hold upon) him.” <b>circumcision-cuttings:</b> Others, “on account of the circumcision,” “because of the circumcision,” “referring to the circumcision.”"
"Exodus 4:31 <b>The people trusted … :</b> For the first time in the Torah, Israel responds to God’s promises in a positive manner, something which will rarely happen again. The vocabulary and attitude form an <i>inclusio</i> (a bracket) with the end of the Liberation Narrative, 14:30–31 (cf. the verbs “trust” and “see”)."
"Exodus 5:1 <b>hold-a-festival:</b> Or “observe a pilgrimage-festival.” The Hebrew <i>hag</i> is still echoed in the great pilgrimage of Islam, the hajj, in which worshipers make (sometimes long) journeys to Mecca."
"Exodus 5:2 <b>Who is Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> This attitude recalls an earlier obstacle to the liberation process, “Who am I” of Moshe (3:11). <b>I do not know Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> Colloquially, “I care not a whit for Y<small>hwh</small>!” To Pharaoh’s pointed challenge, the entire narrative that follows is an answer (cf. 14:4, 18)."
"Exodus 5:3 <b>pray let us go:</b> A milder phrase than the earlier “Send free my people!” <b>three days’ journey:</b> Either the magical three again, or a standard biblical way of describing a journey (see Gen. 22:4). <b>lest he confront us:</b> In the ancient world the gods demanded sacrifices at specified times. “Confront” and “sword” also occur in VV.20–21, nicely balancing this section of narrative."
"Exodus 5:4 <b>For-what-reason:</b> Heb. <i>lamma,</i> as distinct from <i>maddu’a</i> (“why,” with similar meaning)."
"Exodus 5:5 <b>too many:</b> Echoing 1:9ff. (Fishbane 1979). <b>the people of the land:</b> This phrase occurs here in its wider usage, i.e., the common folk, as opposed to what is found in Gen. 23:7, where the term indicates the landed nobility."
"Exodus 5:6 <b>slave-drivers:</b> In several Semitic languages <i>nagos</i> denotes “pressing” or “overpowering” (Ullendorff), hence “driving” here."
"Exodus 5:9 <b>so that they pay:</b> Others, “Let them pay” (Greenberg 1969)."
"Exodus 5:10 <b>Thus says Pharaoh:</b> An ironic transformation of the prophetic formula noted in v.1 above, “the language of redemption turned sour” (Greenberg 1969)."
Exodus 5:14 <b>beaten:</b> The same Hebrew verb as “striking” in 2:11–13.
"Exodus 5:16 <b>your people’s:</b> Heb. <i>’ammekha</i>, which some read <i>’immakh</i> (“with you”)."
"Exodus 5:18 <b>go—serve:</b> This phrase will be repeated three times during the Plague Narratives (10:8, 24; 12:31), with a different meaning: Go serve God! Pharaoh cannot wait to free the Israelites! (Greenberg 1969)."
"Exodus 5:19–21 <b>saw … see:</b> In these negative usages it is as if the earlier redemptive theme of God’s “seeing” has gone awry. But all is righted below, in 6:1 (“Now you will see …”)."
"Exodus 5:21 <b>having made our smell reek:</b> An expression meaning the causing of hatred or horror. <b>giving a sword into their hand:</b> This scenario often occurs historically with liberators; initial attempts fail or are rejected. Here we have a replay of Moshe’s earlier efforts (note the use of “judge” there as well, in 2:14). The tension in this chapter may be said to revolve around whether God’s sword (v.3) or Pharaoh’s will prevail."
"Exodus 5:22 <b>My Lord:</b> The Hebrew <i>Adonai</i> is used often in the Bible for pleading one’s case, as before a king (see Gen. 18:27, 30, 31, 32; 19:18, and Ex. 4:10)."
"Exodus 5:22–23 <b>this people … this people … your people:</b> Note Moshe’s brilliant use of psychology in dealing with God, similar to what he will do again in 32:11–13."
Exodus 5:23 <b>to speak in your name:</b> The issue of God’s name will become paramount in the passage following.
"Exodus 6:1 <b>out of his land:</b> The phrase is also used in connection with “sending free” in 6:11, 7:2, and 11:10."
"Exodus 6:2 <b>I am Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> I am [name] is an authority formula in the ancient Near East (as in Gen. 41:44, where it refers to an earlier Pharaoh) (Greenberg 1969)."
"Exodus 6:3 <b>Shaddai:</b> Heb. obscure; traditionally translated ‘Almighty,” while some understand it as “of the mountains.” In Genesis the name is most often tied to promises of human fertility (see 17:1); a possibly related Hebrew word means “breasts.” <b>was not known:</b> Others, “did not make known.”"
"Exodus 6:6 <b>I will bring … :</b> God’s answer comprises verbs of action: “bring out,” “rescue,” “redeem,” “take,” and “give.” The Hebrew rhymes (<i>ve-heveti etkhem … vehitzalti etkhem …</i>)."
Exodus 6:6–7 <b>beneath … beneath:</b> A more vivid image than merely rescuing them.
"Exodus 6:7 <b>I will take you … :</b> This covenant language recalls the vocabulary of marriage in many societies (“take you,” “be for/to you”). <b>you shall know:</b> The verb “know” in the ancient Near East is often part of covenant (treaty) language, and so Moshe’s task is not only to force Pharaoh to acknowledge God, but also to bring the Israelites into a special relationship with God (see Chaps. 19ff.)."
"Exodus 6:8 <b>(over) which I lifted my hand … :</b> The promise of the land forms the backbone of the book of Genesis, which ends with it as well (Gen. 50:24)."
"Exodus 6:9 <b>shortness of spirit:</b> Others, “impatience” (so Ramban), “shortness of breath” (so Rashi). Also notable is Walzer’s suggestion of “dispiritedness.” A parallel Ugaritic phrase probably means “wretchedness.”"
"Exodus 6:12 <b>spoke before:</b> Appealed to (Orlinsky). <b>of foreskinned lips:</b> Either Moshe had some physical defect, as legend has it, or he is alluding to his difficulties as a public speaker (cf. 4:10). The use of “foreskinned” may express the biblical idea that things in their natural state require sanctifying, as can be seen with firstborn humans and animals, first-fruits, food, sexuality, etc."
"Exodus 6:14 <b>Fathers’ Houses:</b> Family units, listed according to the name of the ancestor. <b>sons:</b> Heb. <i>banim,</i> translated above as “children,” but here clearly referring to the males."
"Exodus 6:16 <b>seven and thirty and a hundred years:</b> Here, and in vv.18 and 20, the life spans of Moshe’s family members are composed of “perfect” numbers in combinations and multiples, as if to say that heroic biography as well as group history has a preordained meaning."
Exodus 6:25 <b>Pin’has:</b> Trad. English “Phinehas.” He will play an important role in Num. 25:7 as a zealot for the new faith. The name is Egyptian in origin.
"Exodus 6:26 <b>by their forces:</b> The term has a military ring, and is used frequently in the Bible with that connotation."
"Exodus 7:1 <b>as a god:</b> Or oracle, as mentioned in the note to 4:16."
"Exodus 7:5 <b>when I stretch out my hand:</b> In the Plague Narrative, Moshe and Aharon will do the actual stretching out of hands (see 7:19, 8:1, 12; 9:22; 10:12, 21; and the climactic passage in 14:16, 26)."
"Exodus 7:6 <b>Moshe and Aharon did/ as Y<small>hwh</small> had commanded them, thus they did:</b> This construction can be broken up in two ways (with, for instance, the break at “them”), a syntactical usage found fairly frequently in biblical texts (cf. 39:43). The wording recalls the Flood Narrative in Genesis, with the same emphasis: the hero obeys God without question."
"Exodus 7:7 <b>eighty … eighty-three:</b> Another set of “perfect” numbers, this time using forty (and three) as the base. It occurs here due to the biblical practice of mentioning age to “mark … a milestone in life’s journey” (Greenberg 1969)."
"Exodus 7:9 <b>Give, you, a portent:</b> That is, “Prove yourselves by working a miracle” (Hyatt). <b>your staff:</b> It is not clear whether the staff is the aforementioned one of Moshe, or part of another tradition, connected to Aharon. <b>serpent:</b> Heb. <i>tanin,</i> a word indicating a reptile, with possible mythological overtones (as in “dragon”)."
"Exodus 7:11 <b>occult arts:</b> Whereas Aharon needs none, since God performs the miracle (Greenberg 1969)."
Exodus 7:12 <b>swallowed up:</b> Leaving no doubt as to whether optical illusion or sleight of hand is involved.
"Exodus 7:14 <b>heavy-with-stubbomness:</b> In the Plague Narrative, the root <i>kaved,</i> “heavy,” occurs ten times—five times referring to Pharaoh’s heart and five referring to the plagues themselves. The latter are perhaps seen as the direct outcome of the former."
"Exodus 7:15 <b>he goes out to the Nile:</b> Many interpretations have been proposed for this action, which must have had some significance for the biblical narrator. It remains unclear whether Pharaoh is involved in a religious rite or a function of state. More charming is the suggestion by Rashi, the medieval Hebrew commentator, that Pharaoh went secretly to the river in order to relieve himself—so that the Egyptians would not see him as less than a god."
"Exodus 7:17 <b>change:</b> Continuing the theme of transformation found in the scene with the snake. Overall, of course, the change from slavery to liberation and to responsible society is a major theme in Exodus."
"Exodus 7:19 <b>wooden-containers … stoneware:</b> It is unclear what is meant. The context seems to suggest “even in their kitchen utensils,” reflected in the present translation. On the other hand, virtually everywhere in the Bible that “wood and stone” occur as a pair in the singular, they refer to idols; Cassuto speaks of the Egyptians’ bathing their idols and thus sees the passage as another example of Exodus’s denigrating Egyptian religion."
Exodus 7:20 <b>He raised the staff:</b> “He” refers to Aharon. <b>struck:</b> The first “stroke”—that is the Hebrew term (<i>makka</i>) used for what we know in English as a “plague.”
"Exodus 7:21 <b>throughout all the land of Egypt:</b> One of the refrains used in this section of the book (see “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” p. 241)."
"Exodus 7:25 <b>Y<small>hwh</small> had struck the Nile:</b> Even though Aharon did the “striking,” it becomes clear here that the brothers are only agents."
"Exodus 7:27 <b>frogs:</b> A symbol of fertility in Egyptian culture (the goddess Heket), and so the plague might be regarded as an assault on the Egyptian gods again (Cassuto). There may also be an ironic hint here of the “swarming” of the Israelites in 1:7."
"Exodus 7:28 <b>ovens:</b> A place which, because of its dryness, would be most unlikely to harbor them (Childs)."
Exodus 8:2 <b>frog-horde:</b> The Hebrew uses a collective singular here (likewise with “insects” in 8:17ff. and “locusts” in 10:4ff.); all other “frogs” in this plague receive the standard plural.
"Exodus 8:3 <b>the magicians did thus:</b> The theme of Israel’s distinctiveness, so prominent in these stories, is delayed. Here the magicians can do the same tricks as their Hebrew counterparts, although, as noted above, they require the aid of “occult-arts.”"
"Exodus 8:5 <b>Be praised over me:</b> Others, “Have the advantage over me.” The sense is that Pharaoh will be allowed to choose the precise time of the frogs’ removal."
"Exodus 8:6 <b>In order that you may know:</b> The intent of Moshe’s words in v.5 is now revealed: precise timing, even when chosen at will, demonstrates God’s total power."
Exodus 8:9 <b>from the houses … :</b> The threefold repetition of “from” paints a vivid picture of the end of this plague. The dead frogs recede like water drying up.
"Exodus 8:12 <b>gnats:</b> Other translations vary here. There are many traditions, but it seems clear that some kind of small insect is indicated (Hyatt)."
"Exodus 8:15 <b>the finger of a god:</b> That is, God’s direct intervention in human affairs. The only other occurrence of this expression is in Exodus (31:18) and in the text that retells that story, Deut. 9:10. In the latter cases it refers to the divine writing on the two tablets of Testimony."
"Exodus 8:17 <b>upon you … :</b> Similar to the refrain of 7:28–29, with regard to the frogs; here, “upon” occurs four times in one line. <b>insects:</b> As in the last plague, there are many opinions as to what these were (e.g., gnats, gadflies, mosquitos); Bekhor Shor understands the “mixture” (the literal meaning of the Hebrew term used here, <i>’arov</i>) as one of wild animals."
"Exodus 8:18 <b>region:</b> Lit. “land” (see Gen. 45:10). <b>in the land:</b> That is, as an active force."
"Exodus 8:19 <b>ransom:</b> Heb. <i>pedut,</i> usually emended to <i>pelut,</i> “distinction,” to bring the phrase into consonance with v.18 and with the entire plague section in general."
"Exodus 8:20 <b>in ruins:</b> The verb “ruin” (Heb. <i>shihet</i>) is often used in the Bible in connection with punishment for sin (see, for example, Gen. 6:11–12; 19:13, 29)."
"Exodus 8:22 <b>wise … thuswise:</b> Heb. <i>nakhon … ken.</i> <b>Egypt’s abomination:</b> In Cassuto’s view, there are two possibilities here: either the animals in question were venerated as holy by the Egyptians, or they were actually thought of as gods, in which case the Hebrew phrase would be quite derogatory (so too Rashi). <b>stone:</b> A widely used form of execution in biblical times (e.g., 17:4; 19:13; 21:28, 29, 32 below). It was apparently used for very severe crimes, and often connected, logically, to the anger of the populace (Greenberg 1962)."
"Exodus 8:24 <b>only: you are not to go far, too far: Heb.</b> <i>rak harhek lo tarhiku.</i>"
"Exodus 8:27 <b>not one remained:</b> Similar words will be used of the Egyptians, drowned in the Sea of Reeds (14:28)."
Exodus 9:2 <b>hold-on-strongly:</b> Both Pharaoh’s obduracy and his stranglehold on the slaves are described with the same verbal root.
"Exodus 9:5 <b>an appointed-time:</b> As before (8:5–6), equally striking to the plague itself is its precise removal at the time promised."
"Exodus 9:8 <b>soot:</b> The transformation from soot to fine-dust and then boils reflects a poetic justice, paralleling bricks baked in a kiln (Cassuto). It also reflects the biblical concept of disease as punishment. <b>toss:</b> Moshe will later “toss” the blood of the covenant on the freed Israelites (24:8)."
"Exodus 9:16 <b>land:</b> Others, “earth.”"
"Exodus 9:20 <b>Whoever had awe … :</b> The focus now shifts to the Egyptians in general (at least some of them), who now suspect the real source of their troubles, whereas only the magicians recognized it previously."
"Exodus 9:24 <b>fire taking-hold-of-itself:</b> Heb. difficult; others, “lightning flashed back and forth,” “lightning flashing through it.” <b>the like of which had never been:</b> The phrase here foreshadows the final plague (11:6)."
"Exodus 9:27 <b>one-in-the-right … ones-in-the-wrong:</b> The terms are drawn from the world of legal, not religious, terminology."
Exodus 9:28 <b>enough is:</b> Or “enough of their being.…”
Exodus 9:29 <b>spread out my hands:</b> In entreaty.
"Exodus 9:31 <b>Now the flax … :</b> An editorial comment, to explain how much harm was done (Cassuto 1967: they used it for cloth and for food)."
"Exodus 10:2 <b>been capricious:</b> Others, “dealt harshly with,” “made fools of.”"
"Exodus 10:5 <b>aspect:</b> Lit. “eye.” <b>not be able to see:</b> Foreshadowing the next plague, darkness (Plaut)."
Exodus 10:8 <b>Who is it:</b> Pharaoh qualifies his approval with conditions.
"Exodus 10:9 <b>Moshe said … :</b> The answer is rhythmical, almost ritual. <b>With our young ones … :</b> The addition of children and animals to the request of Moshe makes Pharaoh suspect that they will not come back."
"Exodus 10:10 <b>May Y<small>hwh</small> be thus with you:</b> That is to say, may he not be with you! <b>your faces are set toward ill:</b> You have evil intentions; “your evil intentions are written on your faces” (Abravanel)."
Exodus 10:11 <b>O males:</b> And only the males.
"Exodus 10:19 <b>sea wind:</b> The story is told from the perspective of the land of Israel where such a wind means a west wind (Plaut). <b>wind … not one … remained:</b> Foreshadowing the incident at the Sea of Reeds (14:21, 28)."
Exodus 10:21 <b>they:</b> The Egyptians.
Exodus 10:24 <b>only your sheep and your oxen:</b> Pharaoh still tries to salvage some control of the situation.
"Exodus 10:25 <b>slaughter-offerings … offerings-up:</b> That is, animals for sacrifice."
"Exodus 10:28 <b>Go from me!:</b> Others, “Out of my sight!,” “Leave my presence.” <b>on the day … you shall die:</b> The expression is similar to the one used in reference to Yosef in Gen. 43:3, 5. Despite the finality of the language here, the confrontation between Moshe and Pharaoh continues in 11:4–8 and 12:31–32."
"Exodus 11:3 <b>Moshe was (considered) exceedingly great:</b> Interestingly, at this point in the narrative it is Moshe and not God who is glorified (see also the note to v.8, below)."
Exodus 11:4 <b>the middle of the night:</b> As so often in folklore. The Hebrew word for “middle” (<i>hatzi</i>) is different from the one used for “midst” on the next line (<i>tavekh</i>).
"Exodus 11:6 <b>cry:</b> See also 12:30. The cry of the Egyptians echoes that of the Children of Israel in 3:7, 9."
Exodus 11:7 <b>no dog:</b> Much less the “bringer-of-ruin” of 12:13! <b>sharpen:</b> Heb. obscure.
"Exodus 11:8 <b>in flaming anger:</b> Somewhat uncharacteristically, the story of this last confrontation reports the emotions of both Moshe and Pharaoh. For a change we get a glimpse of the human side of the drama."
Exodus 11:9–10 <b>Pharaoh will not hearken … :</b> These two verses serve as a summary of the entire Plague Narrative. They also help to smooth out the transition to Chap. 12.
Exodus 11:10 <b>from his land:</b> The last occurrence of this phrase.
Exodus 12:1 <b>in the land of Egypt:</b> The text thereby establishes the antiquity of the ritual.
"Exodus 12:2 <b>Let this … be … let it be:</b> The rhetoric helps to focus attention on this important section. <b>beginning-one:</b> At least one form of the ancient Hebrew calendar began in the spring; the Torah begins its ritual calendar according to its ritual beginning at Passover. It is significant that the new year of nature and that of the nation’s birth coalesce. For extensive discussion of Exodus and the biblical calendar, see Sarna1986."
"Exodus 12:3 <b>entire community of Israel:</b> This term, “community” (Heb. <i>’eda</i>), is used somewhat interchangeably with a host of others in the Torah to indicate the leadership (often, the elders) of the people (Weinfeld 1972a). <b>tenth:</b> There is a parallel important day in the fall, on the tenth day of the seventh month—Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement (see Lev. 16:29). <b>Fathers’ House:</b> See the note to 6:14."
"Exodus 12:5 <b>wholly-sound:</b> Or “hale” (Heb. <i>tamim</i>), that is, physically unblemished. This primary physical meaning often gives way to a spiritualized one, in reference to human beings (Job, for instance, is described as <i>tamim,</i> variously translated as “blameless” and “perfect” in Job 1:1)."
"Exodus 12:6 <b>you … they:</b> The change in the subject of the sentence, from second to third person, is not unusual in biblical Hebrew. <b>fourteenth day:</b> Close to the full moon. <b>between the setting-times:</b> At twilight. This time is mentioned elsewhere (e.g., 16:12; 29:39, 41; and several places in Numbers) in connection with the sacrifices made by the priests. This perhaps implies that we have here the unusual situation (at least in ancient Israel) of the head of the household performing a priestly function."
"Exodus 12:8 <b>roasted in fire:</b> Not raw or boiled, since what seems to be meant is an imitation of standard sacrifices. <i>matzot:</i> Sing. <i>matza,</i> flat, unleavened bread. <b>with bitter-herbs:</b> Others, “on bitter herbs.” Gaster (1949) notes the long-standing use of such cathartics as purifiers or demon-ridders (e.g., garlic) in folk cultures. Later Jewish tradition speaks of the herbs as a symbol of the bitterness of Egyptian bondage."
"Exodus 12:9 <b>legs … innards:</b> That is, completely consumed."
"Exodus 12:10 <b>You are not to leave any of it until morning:</b> Again, as in the removal of leaven, what is meant is complete destruction."
Exodus 12:11 <b>your hips girded … :</b> Prepared for travel. Passover is still observed in this manner by some Jews originating in Arab lands.
"Exodus 12:11 <b>in trepidation:</b> Others, “in haste,” but the element of fear is also contained in the verb (Heb. <i>hafoz</i>)."
"Exodus 12:13 <b>pass over:</b> The exact meaning of Hebrew <i>paso’ah</i> is in dispute. Some interpret it as “protect”; others, including Buber (1988), relate it to “limp,” suggesting a halting dance performed as part of the ancient festival (perhaps in imitation of the newborn spring lambs). It is possible that there are homonyms here, and that the text is playing on them."
"Exodus 12:15 <b>seven days:</b> Similar to the great fall festival, Sukkot, mentioned in Lev. 23:34f. <b>leaven … fermented:</b> The removal of these elements is commonly found in agricultural societies (for more, see Gaster 1949, 1969). <b>from the first … that person … :</b> The two phrases occur in reversed order in the Hebrew."
"Exodus 12:16 <b>a proclamation of holiness:</b> Others, “a holy convocation.” It is not entirely clear what is meant. <b>proclamation … no kind of work:</b> The same rules apply to the fall festival (Lev. 23:33–43). <b>on them:</b> The first and seventh days."
"Exodus 12:17 <b><i>matzot:</i></b> This probably describes a festival separate from the one connected to the lambs, as indicated above."
Exodus 12:20 <b>not to eat … to eat <i>matzot:</i></b> The section ends with an emphatic doublet.
"Exodus 12:22 <b>hyssop:</b> The leaves are known for having a cooling effect (but some understand the Hebrew <i>’ezov</i> as meaning “marjoram”). <b>entrance:</b> Lit. “opening.” This spot of entrance often serves as a figurative threshold in folklore; here, it is the separation point between life and death, Israelites and Egyptians, home and the outside world. Later, it functions as the place of revelation or contact with the holy (e.g., 33:10)."
"Exodus 12:23 <b>pass over:</b> Or, following the comments on v.13, above, “skip over.”"
"Exodus 12:25 <b>service:</b> Ritual; the Israelites have begun their transformation from serfs to divine servants, underscored by the recurrence of “service” in 12:26 and 13:5."
"Exodus 12:26 <b>when your children say:</b> This framework is used frequently in Deuteronomy (e.g., Deut. 6:20)."
"Exodus 12:27 <b>when he … :</b> The chiastic structure (<i>A-B/B-A;</i> here, a verb-noun/noun-verb) ends the speech, a device common in biblical style (Andersen)."
"Exodus 12:29 <b>captive in the dungeon:</b> Cf. 11:5, “the maid who is behind the handmill”; both phrases express the idea of the lowest person in the society."
Exodus 12:30 <b>for there is not a house:</b> The omission of the perfect tense expresses the immediacy of the situation.
"Exodus 12:31 <b>according to your words:</b> Pharaoh has never thus conceded before, and so we know that this time he is sincere. The same change of heart is indicated in the next verse, “And bring a blessing even on me!”"
"Exodus 12:32 <b>even … :</b> The fourfold use of “even” here shows that Pharaoh is finally not hedging. He gives permission for <i>all</i> the Israelites to leave, without preconditions."
Exodus 12:33 <b>Egypt pressed the people strongly:</b> Contrasting with Pharaoh’s “strong-willed heart” of 10:27 and previously.
"Exodus 12:34 <b>their kneading-troughs bound:</b> To explain why only <i>matza</i> was baked; see V.39, below."
"Exodus 12:37 <b>moved on:</b> The Hebrew (<i>naso’a</i>) literally means “pulled out their tent pegs.” <b>six hundred thousand … menfolk:</b> That is, there were over 600,000 men of military age (over twenty). Extrapolating from this several million slaves strains credibility; one might accept either the explanation put forth in Plaut that <i>elef</i> means, not “thousand,” but “troop/contingent” (of nine or ten men each), or Cassuto’s designation of the number as a “perfect” or folkloric one, built on the numerical system of 6/60. For a full discussion, see Sarna (1986)."
"Exodus 12:38 <b>mixed multitude:</b> This is the usual translation in English. The Hebrew is <i>’erev rav,</i> “riffraff.” <b>heavy:</b> Their wealth is a counterpart to Pharaoh’s previously “heavy” heart (and “heavy” plagues)."
"Exodus 12:39 <b>were not able to linger,/ neither had they made provisions:</b> It comes almost as a surprise to the Israelites. Here there can be no question of military victory, as in a coup; history depends on the incursion of God."
"Exodus 12:40 <b>thirty years and four hundred years:</b> The numbers are patterned as usual; although this total disagrees with Gen. 15:13, for instance (which reckons it as 400 years), the differences seem to be more over which patterned numbers to use and not historical exactitude."
"Exodus 12:41 <b>Y<small>hwh</small>’s forces:</b> A term with clear military flavor; later in the Bible, Israel becomes the “armed forces of <b>Y<small>hwh</small>”</b> (the same Hebrew term)."
"Exodus 12:42 <b>keeping-watch:</b> Reflecting the play on words in the Hebrew <i>shamor,</i> by including ideas of both “guarding” and “observing.” Cassuto (1967) sees <i>shamor</i> as a shepherd’s term, appropriate here. Note again, in the tense structure, the conflation of narrative and contemporary ritual."
"Exodus 12:43 <b>foreign son:</b> Or “foreigner.” The English here echoes Hebrew usage and the English idea of “native son” (Greenstein, personal communication)."
"Exodus 12:46 <b>outside:</b> Into that area which has the function of being the realm of death in the story. <b>you are not to break a bone:</b> As if to violate its perfection, since the bone was identified as symbolic of the whole (viz., the same Hebrew word used for “bone” and “essence, person”). The biblical idea, found in reference to all animal sacrifices, is that only unblemished (“whole” or “hale”) animals may be used for such purposes. In Gaster’s (1969) view, the prohibition in this verse was originally instituted to ensure a full flock."
Exodus 12:48 <b>come-near:</b> This verb (Heb. <i>karev</i>) is often used in connection with the priestly cult.
"Exodus 12:49 <b>Instruction:</b> Or “teaching,” “priestly ruling.” The same word later refers to Moshe’s fuller “teaching,” and eventually to the entire Pentateuch."
Exodus 12:51 <b>that same day:</b> The phrase serves to bridge the two chapters here (Plaut).
Exodus 13:2 <b>Hallow:</b> Make holy. <b>breacher:</b> Opener. This should not be confused with a so-called breech birth.
"Exodus 13:3 <b>Remember:</b> Here and again at 20:8, the Hebrew verbal form is an emphatic one."
"Exodus 13:4 <b>Ripe-Grain:</b> Heb. <i>aviv.</i> The month later took on a Babylonian name (Nisan), as did all the months of the Jewish calendar."
Exodus 13:9 <b>sign … reminder:</b> This may have been figurative originally; it became taken literally and gave rise to the phylacteries (<i>tefillin</i>) in rabbinic Judaism. Notable in this verse is how the body is pressed into the service of memory (“hand … eyes … mouth”). Rashi draws attention to the parallel idea of the Song of Songs: “Set me as a seal upon your heart … upon your arm” (Song 8:6).
"Exodus 13:10 <b>year-day:</b> Heb. <i>yamim;</i> the rendering follows B-R, which took the expression to denote both “year to year” and specifically the holiday."
Exodus 13:11–12 <b>It shall be … every breacher:</b> Returning to the subject of v.2.
"Exodus 13:12 <b>to … for Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> That is, for sacrifice to him."
"Exodus 13:13 <b>a donkey:</b> Not one of the “pure” animals fit for sacrifice, and hence its substitution (“redeeming”) by a lamb. <b>break-its-neck:</b> Others, “decapitate.” The intent seems to be that if the animal is not redeemed, one is not allowed to benefit economically from it (Plaut). <b>firstborn of men … redeem:</b> In this case the male child is symbolically transferred to God; child sacrifice was of course abhorrent to the Bible (see Gen. 22). To this day religious Jews “redeem” their firstborn sons with money given to charity, thirty days after birth (<i>Pidyon Ha-Ben</i>)."
Exodus 13:14 <b>What does this mean?:</b> Lit. “What is this?”
"Exodus 13:16 <b>headbands:</b> Others, “frontlets.” The meaning is unclear; see the discussions in Plaut and Tigay (1982), from which the present translation is taken."
"Exodus 13:17 <b>lead them … regret:</b> A play on words: Heb. <i>naham … yinnahem.</i> <b>way:</b> Some take this to be a proper noun or name: “The Way/Road of the Land of the Philistines.” <b>land of the Philistines:</b> That is, along the Mediterranean coast."
"Exodus 13:18 <b>Sea of Reeds:</b> Not “Red Sea,” which came from an ancient translation. It has more recently been suggested that the term (Heb. <i>suf</i>) can be read “End [<i>sof</i>] Sea,” that is, the Sea at the End of the World. This mythological designation is attractive, given the cosmically portrayed events of the next chapter, but is not provable. The exact location, in any event, has not been established with certainty. <b>armed:</b> Heb. (<i>hamush</i>) unclear. The present rendering is supported by ancient versions; Plaut raises the possibility of “groups of five/fifty.”"
"Exodus 13:19 <b>he had made the Children of Israel swear:</b> See Gen. 50:25. The bones will be reburied, marking the end of the conquest of Canaan, in Josh. 24:32."
"Exodus 13:21 <b>Y<small>hwh</small></b> was <b>going before them:</b> Others, “went before them.” The Hebrew idiom here means “to lead,” especially in war, and is the classic biblical description of a king. <b>column of cloud:</b> Heb. <i>‘ammud’ anan.</i> <b>cloud … fire:</b> These are seen as physical manifestations of God’s presence, and are brought back in the narrative at Sinai (19:16, 18)."
Exodus 14:2 <b>Pi ha-Hirot:</b> The location is unknown.
"Exodus 14:4 <b>be glorified through:</b> The Hebrew uses the same stem (<i>k-b-d</i>) earlier in the narrative, as if to suggest that Pharaoh’s “heaviness” (stubbornness) is answered, not only by “heavy” (severe) plagues, but by God, showing his “heaviness” (glory) at the sea. I did not find a solution in English to the unified use of the one root in Hebrew—a frustrating defeat, given the principles of this translation."
Exodus 14:5 <b>told that the people fled:</b> As if they were not expecting it; now it is obvious that the Israelites are not leaving simply to observe a religious festival (Plaut).
Exodus 14:6 <b>(fighting-) people:</b> This reading is supported by Num. 31:32 and Josh. 8:1 (Childs).
"Exodus 14:7 <b>six hundred:</b> A nice counterpart of the 600,000 (or 600 units of) Israelite males mentioned previously. <b>teams-of-three:</b> Others, “officers,” “warriors,” “a picked team.”"
"Exodus 14:8 <b>a high hand:</b> Others, “defiantly,” “in triumph.”"
"Exodus 14:11–12 <b>they said … wilderness:</b> The Israelites’ complaint has been shaped into a great rhetorical paragraph, with the people’s first “grumbling” against Moshe an ominous foreshadowing of what will occur throughout the wanderings. In this construction, the longed-for “Egypt” is repeated five times, and the unknown “wilderness” twice. Note also the stress on Moshe: “you have taken us out … you have done to us.”"
"Exodus 14:13 <b>Moshe said … :</b> There follow four rapid-fire verbs of command, to quiet the complaints. <b>Stand fast and see:</b> Heb. <i>hityatzevu u-re’u.</i>"
"Exodus 14:13 <b>deliverance:</b> A word meaning “rescue,” but extending to circumstances that appear miraculous to those who experience them."
"Exodus 14:15–16 <b>Y<small>hwh</small> said … :</b> God echoes Moshe, issuing four commands."
Exodus 14:15 <b>let-them-march-forward:</b> Countering the “Egypt marching after them” of v. 10.
Exodus 14:16 <b>and split it:</b> As if that were as natural an act as stretching out one’s hand!
"Exodus 14:20 <b>and (there) it lit up:</b> Heb. unclear; some read the verb as coming from a different root, meaning “cast a spell on,” which, however, weakens the theme of distinction mentioned earlier."
"Exodus 14:21 <b>fierce east wind:</b> Looking back to the “east wind” that rid Egypt of the locusts in 10:13, and forward to God’s “fierce-might” in 15:2, after the triumph at the sea. <b>firm-ground:</b> In the Flood Narrative, another story of deliverance (and death) by water, the same word appears as a sign that all is well. Similarly, the “dry-land” of the next verse appears in Gen. 8:14."
"Exodus 14:24 <b>daybreak-watch:</b> Before sunrise; the biblical night was divided into three “watches.” <b>panicked:</b> “stirred up.” Others, “threw into panic.” The phrase is used in the Bible to describe God’s effect on his enemies (e.g., Josh. 10:10, Judg. 4:15, I Sam. 7:10) (Hyatt)."
"Exodus 14:25 <b>heaviness:</b> Again, possibly a play on Pharaoh’s “heaviness” (stubbornness) and God’s “glory.”"
"Exodus 14:27 <b>face:</b> Or “turning,” which, however, would have clashed with the frequent “returning” (another Hebrew verb) in these verses. <b>original-place:</b> Others, “bed,” “normal depth.”"
"Exodus 14:30–31 <b>saw … saw:</b> The key verb again, echoing back not only to v. 13 but to various narratives throughout the book."
Exodus 15:1 <b>uttered (this) utterance:</b> Giving a wider range of meaning for the Hebrew <i>va-yomeru le’mor.</i> <b>triumphed:</b> A rendering based on Ugaritic.
"Exodus 15:2 <b>strength.</b> Others, “song.” <b>YAH:</b> A shortened form (YH) of the name of God (Y<small>hwh</small>), and found often in biblical names (e.g., Uriah)."
Exodus 15:3 <b>man of war:</b> Or “warrior.”
"Exodus 15:6 <b>right-hand:</b> As elsewhere in the ancient and medieval world, the right hand was symbolic of strength."
"Exodus 15:8 <b>piled up:</b> Heb. root <i>’rm,</i> found only here."
"Exodus 15:9 <b>Uttered the enemy … :</b> The Hebrew uses alliteration, as well as a concentration on “I/my,” to express the vividness and urgency of the enemy’s greed: <i>’amar ’oyev/’erdof ’asig/’ahallek shallal.</i> I have tried to use alliterative English words (“uttered … enemy/I … overtake … and apportion”) and at least to hint at the poetic force of the Hebrew. <b>greed:</b> The Hebrew (<i>nefesh</i>) means “seat of feelings, emotions”; trad. “soul.”"
"Exodus 15:11 <b>among the gods:</b> The sea is the scene of <b>Y<small>hwh</small>’s</b> final triumph over the gods of Egypt, as it were."
"Exodus 15:12 <b>Underworld:</b> Others, “earth.”"
"Exodus 15:13 <b>holy pasture:</b> A shepherd’s term, which could indicate the entire land of Canaan, and hence support the background of the Conquest in the poem (Childs)."
"Exodus 15:14–15 <b>Philistia … Edom … Moav:</b> Israel’s later (and hostile) neighbors, to the west and east."
"Exodus 15:15 <b>“rams”:</b> Perhaps, as in Ugaritic usage, a technical term for “chieftains.”"
"Exodus 15:17 <b>mount … foundation … Holy-Shrine:</b> Probably the Jerusalem Temple of later times, although the entire land is sometimes referred to as “mount of your inheritance” (see Deut. 3:25) (Hertz)."
"Exodus 15:20 <b>Miryam the prophetess:</b> Trad. English “Miriam.” This is the first time in the narrative that she is mentioned by name, and also the first appearance of a “prophetess” in the Hebrew Bible."
"Exodus 15:34 <b>Testimony:</b> The tablets of the covenant mentioned in 25:21 and 31:18; their citing seems out of place here, but it should be borne in mind that the Torah is not always chronological, as was already recognized by medieval commentators."
Exodus 17:2 <b>For-what:</b> Why. Notice how the text equates quarreling with Moshe and testing Y<small>hwh</small>. <b>quarrel:</b> A verb that often denotes a legal case in biblical texts.
Exodus 17:3 <b>me:</b> Personalizing the complaint.
Exodus 17:6 <b>you are to strike the rock:</b> See Num. 20:2–13 for the famous variation on this story that proves to be Moshe’s undoing.
Exodus 17:7 <b>saying:</b> Meaning or signifying.
"Exodus 17:9 <b>Yehoshua.</b> Trad. English “Joshua.” He appears subsequently as Moshe’s personal attendant, but it is significant that the first mention of him is in a military context, since he will ultimately command the invasion of Canaan."
Exodus 17:10 <b>Hur:</b> He is mentioned again in 24:4 as Aharon’s assistant in the governing of the people during Moshe’s absence.
Exodus 17:12 <b>sun came in:</b> Set.
Exodus 17:13 <b>weakened:</b> Disabled or defeated.
Exodus 17:14 <b>account:</b> Or “document.” <b>wipe out the memory:</b> The command demonstrates the depth of Israel’s animosity toward Amalek.
"Exodus 17:16 <b>Hand on:</b> Cassuto suggests “monument to,” following the meaning of <i>yad</i> in I Sam. 15:12, II Sam. 18:18, and other instances. <b>throne:</b> Heb. <i>kes,</i> either a corruption of the more standard <i>kisse</i> or, most probably, a scribal error for <i>nes</i>, “banner,” as in v.15."
"Exodus 18:3 <b>he:</b> Moshe, in 2:22, above."
"Exodus 18:4 <b>Eliezer:</b> This is the first and only time we hear of this son. <b>he rescued me from Pharaoh’s sword:</b> Here, as sometimes occurs in the biblical text, we learn of earlier events or emotions. Moshe’s emotional makeup while he was in Midyan (Chaps. 2–4) thus becomes a little clearer."
"Exodus 18:5 <b>at the mountain of God:</b> Another important fact has been casually slipped in at this point, again probably from a narrative taking place later. In the next chapter Israel’s arrival at Sinai will be more dramatically heralded."
"Exodus 18:8 <b>Y<small>hwh</small> had rescued them:</b> The verb was used above in relation to Moshe, and is a key repeating word in this chapter. Thus the experience of leader and people unite again, and the narrative of deliverance comes full circle. Moshe had begun his mission at Sinai, as a member of Yitro’s household, and now the latter meets him in Sinai, on the brink of the confirmation of 3:12 (“you will serve God on this mountain”)."
"Exodus 18:9 <b>jubilant:</b> Heb. <i>va-yihd,</i> from <i>hdy,</i> a rare verb."
"Exodus 18:10 <b>who has rescued the people:</b> There is obviously a redundancy in this verse, based perhaps on a scribal error."
"Exodus 18:11 <b>in just that matter:</b> Heb. difficult; others either omit this phrase altogether, or use complex English constructions to reproduce it (e.g., “for he did this to those who treated Israel arrogantly,” “for he has routed the mighty foes of his folk”). <b>they were presumptuous:</b> The Egyptians."
Exodus 18:12 <b>before presence of God:</b> An expression that usually carries a cultic meaning (Levine 1974).
"Exodus 18:14 <b>all that he had to do:</b> Compare vv.8 and 9, where the great “doing” of God is accomplished with ease. Perhaps a contrast is being drawn between divine and human deeds; Moshe cannot do the “all” that God can."
"Exodus 18:18 <b>heavy:</b> Again the key word that was mentioned earlier (see the note to 14:4); it aids in linking up stories, as it has occurred in 17:12."
"Exodus 18:21 <b>the vision (to select):</b> The verb “see” in Hebrew (<i>ra’oh</i>) also has the connotation of “select” (cf. Gen. 22:8). <b>caliber:</b> A term often used in a military context (see Judg. 11:1, 18:2)."
"Exodus 18:22 <b>at all times:</b> That is, in minor matters—as we would say, “everyday affairs.”"
Exodus 18:23 <b>stand:</b> Endure.
"Exodus 18:27 <b>sent … off/ … went … to his land:</b> A stock biblical farewell passage (see Num. 24:25, for instance)."
Exodus 18:22 <b>lest Y<small>hwh</small> burst out:</b> Lest God slay them with fire or plague. One recalls the demonic character of God portrayed in 4:24ff. The phrase is repeated in v.24 for emphasis.
"Exodus 18:25 <b>and said to them:</b> The Hebrew is ambiguous; did Moshe report God’s previous speech to them, or the following (Decalogue)? I have left this verse without final punctuation to express the unresolved nature of the question."
Exodus 20:4 <b>figure … :</b> A representation of an animal or person.
"Exodus 20:5 <b>zealous:</b> The Hebrew word (<i>kanna</i>) has a cognate meaning in Arabic, “red (with dye),” so an interesting English analogy, expressing facial color changes, would be “livid” (from the Latin “color of lead”)"
Exodus 20:5 <b>the third and the fourth (generation):</b> A long time (Plaut)
"Exodus 20:6 <b>the thousandth:</b> That is, forever (Plaut)."
"Exodus 20:7 <b>take up … for emptiness:</b> Use for a false purpose. The traditional translation, “take in vain,” limits its scope unnecessarily. <b>clear:</b> To acquit or hold innocent."
"Exodus 20:13 <b>You are not to … :</b> Closer to the Hebrew rhythmically would be a sequence like “No murder!/No adultery!” etc., or “Murder not!/Adulter not!” etc. <b>murder:</b> Some interpreters view this as “killing” in general, while others restrict it, as I have done here. <b>adulter:</b> The English has been tailored to fit the Hebrew rhythm of the last five “commandments,” all of which begin with <i>lo</i> (“no”) and a two-syllable command. <b>steal:</b> Ancient Jewish tradition understood this as a reference to kidnapping (see Lauterbach)."
Exodus 20:14 <b>desire:</b> Trad. “covet.” Another possibility is “yearn for.”
"Exodus 20:15 <b>were seeing:</b> Others, “perceived.” The use of the Hebrew participle again emphasizes immediacy. <b>flashing-torches:</b> Perhaps a poetic description of lightning."
"Exodus 20:18 <b>fog:</b> Heb. <i>’arafel,</i> frequently used in conjunction with <i>anan</i>, “cloud.”"
"Exodus 20:21 <b>of soil:</b> Cf. v. 22. The altar was to be made of natural materials. <b>sacrifices of <i>shalom:</i></b> Others, “peace-offerings”; but see Orlinsky. <b>you:</b> Here, second personal singular, as well as through v. 23."
"Exodus 20:22 <b>profaned:</b> In folklore, iron was said to drive out the soul of the stone—that is, rob it of its essence (Driver 1911)."
Exodus 20:23 <b>that your nakedness:</b> To make sure that the priests’ genitals not be uncovered during the rites; the Egyptians wore rather short skirts (Plaut). Note again the desexualizing of religion.
"Exodus 21:1 <b>regulations:</b> Others, “judicial decisions,” “judgments.” See Daube (1947)."
"Exodus 21:2 <b>you:</b> Singular, to stress the perspective of the buyer. <b>Hebrew:</b> Cassuto suggests that the term here has a wide meaning: a member of a bondman class (Akkadian <i>Hapiru</i>) found all over the ancient Near East. <b>for nothing:</b> Without paying redemption money (Cassuto)."
"Exodus 21:3 <b>by himself:</b> I.e., as an unmarried man."
"Exodus 21:4 <b>and she bore him … :</b> The birth of children changes the situation, and the wife must now remain behind, in bondage, with the children."
"Exodus 21:5 <b>say, yes, say:</b> Or “declare.”"
"Exodus 21:6 <b>God’s-oracle:</b> Others, “God,” “the judges.” <b>door … post:</b> It is not clear whether the sanctuary or the master’s house is meant. <b>pierce his ear:</b> The symbolism of this act is not clear. Gaster (1969) theorizes that it establishes the serf’s permanent bond to his master’s house, through the blood on the doorpost."
"Exodus 21:7 <b>handmaid:</b> In this instance, a free woman is bound over to be a slave. <b>as serfs go out:</b> As we saw above. In Cassuto’s view, now that she has a new status (that of wife), she may not be so easily disposed of."
"Exodus 21:8 <b>he has betrayed her:</b> He has not married her off, as was intended in the sale."
"Exodus 21:10 <b>her board:</b> “Her” refers to the first woman, mentioned in v.8. <b>her oil:</b> So Paul, on the basis of Mesopotamian parallels. Others, “marital-relations.”"
"Exodus 21:11 <b>with no money:</b> Again, without having to pay redemption money."
Exodus 21:12 <b>put-to-death:</b> Stronger than simply saying “die.”
"Exodus 21:13 <b>opportunely:</b> Accidentally. <b>a place where he may flee:</b> The so-called cities of refuge (see Num. 35:9–34, Deut. 19:1–12)."
Exodus 21:14 <b>from my very slaughter-site:</b> Even the traditional concept of sanctuary will not aid such a man.
"Exodus 21:15 <b>strikes:</b> Some interpret this as “strikes dead.” But the wording does not warrant this here (cf. 21:12), and such a society would in any case be supportive of this kind of severe penalty in reference to not “honoring” (see 20:12) parents. This is further supported by v.17, below."
Exodus 21:18 <b>fist:</b> Some ancient versions read “club” or “spade.”
Exodus 21:19 <b>to make good … healed:</b> But he is not liable for criminal action.
"Exodus 21:20 <b>avenged:</b> The exact punishment is not specified, but it sounds like death."
"Exodus 21:21 <b>it is not … “money”:</b> “He has human rights, but not those of a free man” (Plaut). Alternatively, Cassuto suggests that the master has lost his own money thereby."
Exodus 21:22 <b>assessment:</b> As agreed by the judges.
"Exodus 21:23 <b>you:</b> Singular. <b>life in place of life:</b> This has historically been taken to indicate a kind of strict Hebrew vengeance, as in the current expression “an eye for an eye.” But the passage (note, by the way, its length) may have been meant as a contrast to the Babylonian system, where the rich could in essence pay to get out of such situations. In Israel this could not be done, and thus we are dealing not with “strict justice” but with strict fairness."
"Exodus 21:28 <b>When an ox gores … :</b> The ox may be taken here as the paradigm of the domestic animal. The secondary literature on this law and its parallels is enormous. <b>its flesh is not to be eaten:</b> Since the ox has not been properly slaughtered for eating or sacrificial purposes, and possibly also because it is connected with the taking of another life (carnivores are forbidden food in the Bible)."
"Exodus 21:30 <b>ransom:</b> Others, “expiation payment.” This functions as a way out of his being put to death (as in the case of the firstborn son, in Chap. 13)"
"Exodus 21:37 <b>(Now) … lamb:</b> In most English translations, this verse is labeled 22:1, and hence 22:1 here appears as 22:2 elsewhere. <b>five cattle … four sheep:</b> In contradistinction to the case of a stolen animal that is found alive (V.3, below), where the payment is only twofold."
"Exodus 22:1 <b>digging through:</b> Secretly, at night; the owner presumably has neither the time nor the light to examine the situation rationally. This issue is still a matter of considerable debate in many state legislatures in America. <b>no bloodguilt:</b> He is not considered a murderer."
Exodus 22:2 <b>If the sun rose:</b> Then the owner could have restrained himself from killing the man.
"Exodus 22:4–5 <b>grazed … blaze:</b> The Hebrew is perhaps a pun on <i>b’r,</i> which is used for both verbs. Some take the entire case to refer to burning."
"Exodus 22:5 <b>pay:</b> Yet not necessarily the “best-part,” as in V.4."
"Exodus 22:6 <b>stealer:</b> The Hebrew form (<i>gannav</i>) indicates a professional thief, not a casual one."
"Exodus 22:7 <b>the owner of the house:</b> That is, the temporary guardian of the goods."
"Exodus 22:8 <b>say:</b> Others, “allege.”"
Exodus 22:9 <b>crippled or captured:</b> Heb. <i>nishbar o nishbe.</i>
"Exodus 22:10 <b>oath of YHWH:</b> It functions like a lie-detector test. <b>he does not:</b> The guardian, as above."
Exodus 22:12 <b>torn-to-pieces:</b> A technical term for “devoured by a wild animal” (Daube 1947); cf. Gen. 37:33. <b>he does not have to pay:</b> Since this could happen to anyone.
Exodus 22:14 <b>he does not have to pay:</b> It is assumed that he did his best to protect his charge. <b>its hiring-price is received:</b> The rental price covers the loss.
"Exodus 22:15 <b>spoken-for:</b> Lit. “paid for.” Others, “betrothed,” but it is not clear that there was such an institution as betrothal in biblical Israel (Orlinsky)."
"Exodus 22:16 <b>marriage-price of virgins:</b> As in many cultures, biblical society prized a virgin as a bride."
"Exodus 22:17 <b>sorceress:</b> The specifying of women here seems to indicate their involvement in this practice in ancient Israel. Magic as such was forbidden (see the famous story of the “witch of Endor” in I Sam. 28) all over the Bible, as an attempt to manipulate God’s world behind his back, as it were. <b>you:</b> Singular, and so basically through V.29. The exceptions, V.21 and the end of V.24, may simply be stylistic variations. <b>not to let live:</b> An unusual Hebrew phrase, perhaps for emphasis."
"Exodus 22:18 <b>lies with a beast:</b> Interestingly, Hittite law distinguishes between some animals in this regard, while Israelite law does not. Just as the Bible has essentially excised mythology concerning half-gods and half-humans, or half-humans/animals such as the Sphinx, so the spheres are not to mix in real life."
"Exodus 22:19 <b>devoted-to-destruction:</b> Set aside for God; confiscated if an object, killed if a person."
"Exodus 22:27 <b>God … one exalted:</b> Here God and ruler are equated, as later in the story of Naboth’s vineyard in I Kings 21:10 (“You cursed God and the king”)."
Exodus 22:28 <b>Your full fruit … :</b> Heb. difficult. Cassuto cites a parallel Hittite law. <b>give to me:</b> Paralleling 13:13 (Cassuto).
"Exodus 22:29 <b>eighth day:</b> Circumcision also takes place on the eighth day, reflecting either a belief that the young are more viable by then, or a symbolic number (7 + 1). Others suggest that it takes seven days for the impurity of birth to be expunged (cf. Lev. 12:2)."
"Exodus 22:30 <b>Men of holiness:</b> The idea is continued in Leviticus, where Chapters 19ff. have come to be known as the “Holiness Code,” a collection of varied laws dealing with different aspects of human conduct. <b>Flesh that is torn-to-pieces:</b> Lev. 17:15 and 22:8 forbid the eating of an animal that has been slain by another. <b>to the dogs:</b> The force of the idea is similar in both Hebrew and English."
"Exodus 23:1 <b>You:</b> Singular through v. 12, except for the second and third lines of v.9. <b>empty:</b> Insubstantial, not based on fact. <b>Do not put your hand (in):</b> That is, do not throw your weight toward, side with."
"Exodus 23:2 <b>quarrel:</b> Legal dispute. <b>many:</b> Or “the majority.” <b>turn away:</b> Referring to either turning the judgment in favor of the wicked, or else the “turning” of justice itself."
"Exodus 23:3 <b>respect:</b> Others, “prefer.” Contrast this idea with v.6."
"Exodus 23:5 <b>abandoning … unbind:</b> That same Hebrew root. <i>’azov,</i> is used for both. It is also possible that the text is the result of a scribal error, and some read the second verb as <i>’azor,</i> “help.”"
"Exodus 23:8 <b>open-eyed:</b> Here, the equivalent of “wise.”"
Exodus 23:9 <b>oppress:</b> Recalling the oppression suffered at the hands of the Egyptians in 3:9.
"Exodus 23:12 <b>pause-for-breath:</b> Later (31:17), God himself is portrayed as having needed to rest after his work of creation."
Exodus 23:13 <b>you:</b> Plural. <b>name … it:</b> Understood as plural.
Exodus 23:14 <b>you:</b> Singular.
Exodus 23:15 <b>before my presence empty-handed:</b> No one is to make a religious pilgrimage on these occasions without bringing “gifts” (sacrifices).
"Exodus 23:16 <b>Pilgrimage-Festival of the Cutting:</b> The wheat harvest and that of first-fruits, occurring in the third month, usually in early June (also known as Shavu’ot, “Weeks”). <b>Pilgrimage-Festival of Ingathering:</b> The final (grape) harvest, in the seventh month in late September or early October (also known as Sukkot, “Huts”)."
"Exodus 23:17 <b>be seen before the presence of … Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> A technical expression for one’s appearing at the sanctuary (Plaut). <b>the Lord, Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> Some see this title as a polemic against the Canaanite Baal, whose name means “master” or “lord.”"
"Exodus 23:18 <b>with anything fermented:</b> Excluding bread and honey (cf. Lev. 2:11) from the offering, possibly since these were included by the Canaanites (Cassuto), or because the sacrifice was to be kept as “natural” as possible."
"Exodus 23:19 <b>You are not to boil … :</b> This law occurs three times in the Torah, and so must have been of particular importance. Despite this, interpreters disagree as to its origins and meaning. Some see it as directly opposing a Canaanite practice; others, as parallel to the law in Deuteronomy (22:6–7) against taking the mother bird along with her young. It also keeps the separation between milk (life-giving) and death; it was thus understood in Jewish mystical tradition of the Middle Ages. The phrase is also cited by Talmudic sages as a basis for the separation of milk and meat in postbiblical Jewish dietary laws (<i>kashrut</i>)."
"Exodus 23:20 <b>a messenger:</b> As sometimes occurs with this word, it is not entirely clear what the distinction is between God and messenger. Here, however, the context seems to require a separate being, whether an angel or Moshe himself."
Exodus 23:21 <b>my name is with him:</b> Or “in him”; “my authority rests with him” (Clements).
"Exodus 23:22 <b>be-an-enemy:</b> The Hebrew expresses this idea with one verb, without auxiliary."
"Exodus 23:23 <b>to the Amorite … :</b> To their land, Canaan."
"Exodus 23:24 <b>standing-stones:</b> Possibly, phallic representations of Canaanite gods."
"Exodus 23:26 <b>no miscarrier:</b> No distinction is made here between human and animal, and presumably both would share in the blessing."
"Exodus 23:27 <b>terror … panic:</b> Heb. <i>’emati … hammati.</i> <b>panic:</b> As in 14:24, above, describing God’s routing of the Egyptians. <b>give all your enemies to you by the neck:</b> I.e., they will be routed by you, their backs turned."
"Exodus 23:28 <b>Despair:</b> Others, “hornet”; the Hebrew implies both."
"Exodus 23:29 <b>I will not drive them out … in one year:</b> This is the situation at the beginning of the book of Judges (after the Conquest); apparently Yehoshua did not finish the job, and so various (later) biblical texts attempt to explain the reason for this."
"Exodus 23:31 <b>Sea of the Philistines:</b> The Mediterranean. <b>Wilderness:</b> The southland or Negev. <b>the River:</b> The Euphrates, in the north. <b>drive them out:</b> Heb. <i>gerashtemo</i> is an archaic form (such as we find in 15:17–<i>tevi’emo ve-titta’emo</i>), used perhaps for reasons of rhythm."
"Exodus 23:32 <b>cut … any covenant:</b> A common Semitic idiom for concluding a treaty (see Gen. 15), perhaps stemming from a ritual. The parties would pass between the halves of sacrificed animals, perhaps implying that such would be the penalty for any party that would break the agreement."
Exodus 24:1 <b>Nadav and Avihu:</b> Aharon’s first two sons. <b>seventy:</b> The “perfect” number with which the book of Exodus began.
"Exodus 24:4 <b>standing-stones:</b> As distinct from the phallic stones mentioned in 23:24, these functioned as boundary markers and memorials."
Exodus 24:5 <b>lads:</b> Or “youths”; the Hebrew term (<i>na’ar</i>) is analogous to “apprentice.”
Exodus 24:7 <b>and we will hearken:</b> This is an addition to the “we will do” of 19:8. In Deuteronomy “hearken” is often found connoting “obey.”
"Exodus 24:10 <b>work of sapphire tiles:</b> Others, “pavement.” Childs notes parallel Ugaritic texts to this description. <b>purity:</b> In Ugaritic, this word has an association of clarity or brightness, especially as regards precious stones (see “pure gold” in the Tabernacle account: 24:11, 17, 24, 31, 39, below)."
"Exodus 24:11 <b>Pillars:</b> Apparently a technical term for the representatives of the people (Buber 1988: “corner-joints”). <b>send forth his hand:</b> Kill them. <b>beheld:</b> Heb. <i>hazoh,</i> often used in connection with prophetic vision (see Isa. 1:1)."
Exodus 24:12 <b>them:</b> The Children of Israel.
"Exodus 24:17 <b>like a consuming fire:</b> In contrast to Moshe’s striking-positive experience of God in Chap. 3, where the bush burned but was not consumed, the Israelites experience him through fear."
"Exodus 24:18 <b>forty:</b> Another meaningful number, reminiscent of the Flood. It is echoed in Elijah’s later experience on the same summit (I Kings 19:8)."
Exodus 24:11 <b>a rim of gold all around:</b> Heb. <i>zer zahav saviv.</i>
"Exodus 24:16 <b>Testimony:</b> B-R, seeking to connect <i>’edut</i> (“Testimony”) with the sound of <i>mo’ed</i> (“appointment”), translate these two terms as “representation” and “presence.” The tablets bear the name “Testimony” because they “testify” or bear witness to God’s relationship with the Israelites. It should also be noted that Akkadian <i>’adu,</i> cognate with our <i>’edut,</i> means “treaty,” somewhat like the Hebrew <i>berit</i> (“covenant”), which is often found parallel to <i>’edut</i> in the Bible (DeVaux 1965)."
"Exodus 24:17 <b>purgation-cover:</b> Heb. <i>kapporet.</i> There are two long-held traditions of translating this word: “expiation” or “mercy-seat” and plain “cover.” I have kept both ideas in the present rendering. The <i>kapporet</i> was used for the purpose of obtaining forgiveness from God (see Lev. 16:13–15), and also served symbolically as God’s “footstool” to the throne represented by the coffer. Such symbolism is in line with ancient Near Eastern practice, as is the keeping of the covenant documents within the footstool."
"Exodus 24:18 <b>winged-sphinxes:</b> Others, “cherubim,” which, however, is too reminiscent of chubby-cheeked baby angels in Western art. In Mesopotamian temples, these mythical figures in sculpture served as guardians; so too at the end of the Garden of Eden story in Gen. 3:24. See Albright."
"Exodus 24:19 <b>here … there:</b> Or “on one side … on the other side”; at either end. <b>from:</b> Or “out of”; others, “of one piece with.” This one-piece construction is a frequent feature of the objects associated with the Tabernacle."
"Exodus 24:20 <b>toward the purgation-cover:</b> Facing downward, as if to avoid the direct presence of God."
"Exodus 24:22 <b>appoint-meeting:</b> The Hebrew verb refers to fixing a time, and is not the same as the earlier “meeting” (5:3). Exodus speaks of the “Tent of Appointment” from Chap. 27 on; it is unclear as to whether the Tabernacle itself or a separate structure is meant. <b>from above the purgation-cover,/from between the sphinxes:</b> So this was seen as the precise spot of God’s presence in the Tabernacle."
Exodus 24:27 <b>as holders for the poles:</b> Heb. <i>le-vatim le-vaddim. Batim</i> are literally “housings.”
"Exodus 24:29 <b>plates … cups … jars … jugs:</b> Translations vary considerably on these terms. Haran (1985) cites several (e.g., “plates, bowls, dishes, cups,” “ladles, jars, saucers, beakers”)."
"Exodus 24:30 <b>Bread of the Presence:</b> Trad. English “shew-bread.” <b>regularly:</b> Not “perpetually,” as earlier interpreters understood."
"Exodus 24:31 <b>shaft … stem:</b> Meyers (1976) interprets this as a hendiadys (two Hebrew words that yield a composite meaning), “thickened shaft.” <b>knobs … blossoms:</b> Others, “calyxes … petals.”"
Exodus 24:33 <b>almond-shaped:</b> Like the shape of the almond flower.
"Exodus 24:35 <b>from it:</b> See the note to v.19, above."
"Exodus 24:38 <b>tongs:</b> Others, “snuffers.”"
"Exodus 26:1 <b>the dwelling:</b> In this context it signifies the inside portion of the Tabernacle; lowercase is used here to distinguish it from the entire structure. <b>tapestries:</b> Others, “curtains,” “cloths.” <b>designer’s making:</b> According to the designer’s craft."
Exodus 26:9 <b>double over:</b> Since it overlaps (see vv.12–13).
Exodus 26:14 <b>covering:</b> A different Hebrew verb (<i>kasse</i>) from the one translated by “purgation-cover” (<i>kapper</i>).
Exodus 26:15 <b>boards:</b> Some interpret as “beams” or “frames.” See the discussion of the possibilities in Haran (1965).
"Exodus 26:17 <b>pegs:</b> Others, “tenons,” a more technical architectural term. <b>parallel:</b> Heb. obscure."
Exodus 26:18 <b>Negev:</b> The desert southland of Israel.
"Exodus 26:22 <b>the sea:</b> The Mediterranean, and hence the west, from the perspective of one living in the land of Israel."
"Exodus 26:24 <b>of twin-use:</b> Used for two purposes? The exact meaning here has been long debated, with many sketches as to what the corners of the Tabernacle might have looked like. <b>toward the first ring:</b> Heb. obscure."
Exodus 26:26 <b>running-bars:</b> Horizontal bars designed to hold the structure together.
Exodus 26:33 <b>Holiest Holy-Shrine:</b> Trad. “Holy of Holies.”
"Exodus 27:2 <b>horns:</b> Many altars have been dug up in the area, both Israelite and non-Israelite in origin, fitting this description. The origin and purpose of the “horns” is not clear. We do know that when an Israelite wanted to be granted asylum, for instance, he could grasp the horns of the altar (see I Kings 1:50ff)."
"Exodus 27:3 <b>scrapers … bowls … flesh-hooks … pans:</b> As in 25:29, above, the exact identification of these objects is not known."
Exodus 27:4 <b>lattice … netting:</b> To let air through and facilitate burning (Cassuto).
"Exodus 27:7 <b>poles:</b> In contrast to those of the coffer, these were apparently removable. The altar was of lesser sanctity than the coffer, and it was not deemed as crucial that no human hand touch it."
"Exodus 27:8 <b>Hollow:</b> And thus easily transportable, to be filled with dirt every time it was set up."
Exodus 27:9 <b>twisted byssus:</b> Heb. <i>shesh moshzar</i>.
"Exodus 27:10 <b>binders:</b> Others, “rods.”"
Exodus 27:14 <b>shoulder-piece:</b> That is the literal Hebrew; “side” would be acceptable idiomatically.
"Exodus 27:19 <b>service (of construction):</b> Not worship (divine service), but rather a term referring to the Levites’ setting up and dismantling of the Tabernacle (Milgrom 1983). <b>pins:</b> Others, “pegs.”"
Exodus 27:20 <b>beaten:</b> Crushed until the substance is pure.
"Exodus 27:21 <b>Tent of Appointment:</b> See the note to 25:22, above. DeVaux (1965) translates as “Tent of Rendezvous,” and Moffatt (in his 1926 Bible translation) as “Trysting Tent,” but these are too romantic in English, even in view of what I have said about the relationship between God and Israel. <b>arrange:</b> Or “set up.”"
"Exodus 28:1 <b>be-priests:</b> One translation possibility was to coin an English verb, “to priest.”"
"Exodus 28:2 <b>glory … splendor:</b> Others, “dignity and magnificence,” but retaining “glory” for <i>kavod</i> enables one to see in the priest’s garb a reflection of the divine splendor."
"Exodus 28:3 <b>wise of mind:</b> Idiomatically, “skilled” or “talented.” <b>practical-wisdom:</b> Wisdom in biblical literature most often denotes worldly wisdom or artisanry, not abstract intellectual prowess."
Exodus 28:8 <b>designed-band:</b> Perhaps resembling a belt.
Exodus 28:10 <b>begettings:</b> Birth order.
"Exodus 28:11 <b>braids:</b> Others, “mesh,” “checkered-work.”"
Exodus 28:12 <b>for remembrance:</b> For a visible symbol.
"Exodus 28:16 <b>a span:</b> A measure taken to be the distance between the outstretched thumb and the little finger, half a cubit or about nine inches."
Exodus 28:17–20 <b>carnelian … jasper:</b> The exact identification of many of these stones is uncertain. The reader will find a different list in virtually every Bible translation.
"Exodus 28:29 <b>over his heart:</b> Or “upon his heart,” three times here. A similar idea occurs in later Judaism, which interpreted Deut. 6:8 (“you shall bind them as a sign upon your hand, and they shall serve as bands between your eyes”) literally. The resulting <i>tefillin</i> (“phylacteries”), leather straps with small boxes containing the relevant Deuteronomy passages worn during weekday morning prayers, include a text that is worn on the arm in such a way as to point to the heart."
"Exodus 28:30 <b>Urim … Tummim:</b> Oracular objects, used for divining God’s plans (e.g. learning if it was the right time to go into battle). Their exact shape and mode of operation are the subject of much scholarly debate (see Cassuto, for instance). In I Sam. 28:6, <i>Urim</i> are equated with dreams and prophets as a means of answering human queries. B-R, following Luther, translate the terms as <i>Lichtende und Schlichtende</i> (“lights and perfections”), a possible literal but unclear translation. It is also worth noting that <i>Urim</i> begins with the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and <i>Tummim</i> the last, giving rise to the possibility that the names themselves are symbolic."
"Exodus 28:31 <b>tunic:</b> Others, “robe.”"
Exodus 28:32 <b>armor:</b> Or “coat of mail.” <b>split:</b> Or “splittable.”
"Exodus 28:33 <b>pomegranates:</b> Cassuto notes that these were a common ornamental device in the ancient world, and a symbol of fertility (as in Song 6:7, 11; 8:2). <b>bells:</b> Their use is explained in v. 35, “so that he [Aharon] does not die.” Bells serve to drive away demons or to warn of human approach in many cultures; see Gaster (1969) for parallels."
Exodus 28:34 <b>bell of gold and pomegranate:</b> In alternating design.
"Exodus 28:36 <b>plate:</b> Lit. “flower” or “gleamer,” perhaps alluding to its shining quality, or to its shape of some kind."
Exodus 28:38 <b>to bear/the iniquity of the holy-offerings:</b> To atone for accidental violations of purity concerning sacrifices brought by the people. This is a classic concern of priests.
"Exodus 28:40 <b>caps:</b> Of less splendor than Aharon’s turban, but constructed along the same lines (wound cloth)."
"Exodus 28:41 <b>give-mandate:</b> Lit. “fill the hand.” The term indicates induction into office; possibly something was put into the inductee’s hand symbolizing their new status. <i>Mandatus</i> in Roman law is similar, and hence the present translation. Plaut also points out that this expression in Akkadian means “to appoint.” <b>anoint … give-mandate … hallow:</b> “A rising trilogy of near synonyms” (Plaut)."
"Exodus 28:42 <b>breeches … to cover … nakedness:</b> As previously (20:23), any hint of sexuality is separated from the cult."
"Exodus 29:1 <b>ceremony:</b> Lit. “matter.” The actual implementation of the ceremony is recounted in Lev. 8:13ff. So unlike the rest of the Tabernacle material (Chaps. 35–40), this ritual is delayed."
Exodus 29:2 <b><i>matza:</i></b> See 12:8 and the accompanying note.
"Exodus 29:6 <b>sacred-diadem:</b> See 28:36 above; the diadem was apparently in the shape of a flower, and was a “sign of consecration” (DeVaux 1965)."
"Exodus 29:9 <b>to wind caps:</b> Like small turbans: see the note to 28:40, above."
"Exodus 29:14 <b><i>hattat</i>/decontamination-offering:</b> Or “purification-offering,” which purges the sanctuary of ritual pollution (cf. Lev. 4 and 6). Pronounced <i>hah-tá;ht</i>."
"Exodus 29:18 <b>soothing savor:</b> Heb. <i>re’ah niho’ah</i>. The original signification of this concept must have been the common ancient one of feeding the gods, and hence the idea of an attractive smell. Already in Gen. 8:21 (after the Flood), however, it has been severed from that context, and the smell only pleases God and induces him to be more merciful with human beings."
"Exodus 29:20 <b>ridge … thumb … thumb-toe:</b> These comprise the extremities of the body, and thus are a way of including the entire body symbolically."
Exodus 29:24 <b>elevation-offering:</b> The earlier translation of “wave-offering” has been shown to be incorrect by Milgrom (1983).
Exodus 29:26 <b>allotment:</b> For the priests.
"Exodus 29:27 <b>that is elevated, that is raised:</b> Heb. <i>asher hunaf vaasher huram</i>. Both denote “presenting.”"
"Exodus 29:31 <b>boil:</b> This clearly indicates that the food in question is meant for the priests’ consumption, since sacrifices were normally completely burned."
"Exodus 29:33 <b>purged:</b> Purified. <b>outsider:</b> Not in the sense of “foreigner,” but of “one unauthorized” for the purpose, a layman (Clements)."
Exodus 29:36 <b>purging it:</b> Or “purging in regard to it.”
"Exodus 29:37 <b>whatever:</b> Others, “whoever.” <b>become-holy:</b> When an object came in contact with holy objects, it became removed from the everyday, in a state resembling what we, in a sense more negative than the Bible means it, would call contamination (as in radioactivity)."
"Exodus 29:38 <b>year-old:</b> That is, newly mature and hence in a state of perfection."
Exodus 29:40 <b><i>hin:</i></b> About a gallon.
"Exodus 29:46 <b>that they may know:</b> This pervasive theme of Exodus finds its true resolution through the Tabernacle texts—not only will the Israelites experience (“know”) God through the “wonders” wrought on their behalf in Egypt, but also through their communication with him in ritual."
Exodus 30:6 <b>in front of…:</b> Some ancient versions and manuscripts omit this entire line as a redundancy.
"Exodus 30:7 <b>when he polishes:</b> Others, “when he dresses” or “trims.”"
"Exodus 30:9 <b>outsider’s smoking-incense:</b> This prohibition is violated by Aharon’s sons in Lev. 10:1 (“offering outsider’s fire”), resulting in their death by “fire from before Y<small>HWH</small>.”"
"Exodus 30:10 <b>do-the-purging:</b> On the day of Yom Kippur, when the ancient sanctuary was, as it were, detoxified (of sins)."
"Exodus 30:13 <b><i>shekel:</i></b> Lit. a “weight” of silver. Coins as such are not documented in the land of Israel until centuries after the events documented in Exodus took place. For a full discussion of biblical currency, see Sellers."
Exodus 30:14 <b>twenty years:</b> The age for military service (and so referring to males).
"Exodus 30:18 <b>basin:</b> Others, “laver.” The Hebrew denotes something round."
"Exodus 30:20 <b>so that they do not die:</b> Twice here, underscoring the power of water to do away with ritual impurity."
"Exodus 30:23 <b>essence:</b> Lit. “head.” <b>five hundred:</b> The measure here is “by the <i>shekel</i>-weight,” as clarified in the next verse."
Exodus 30:25 <b>perfume … perfume-mixture … perfumer’s:</b> Heb. <i>rokah mirkhahat … roke’ah</i>. The verb seems to mean “to mix.”
Exodus 30:26 <b>to anoint with it/the Tent…:</b> Oil is thus used to anoint not only people but also objects.
"Exodus 30:32 <b>in its (exact) proportion:</b> That is, according to an exact “recipe.”"
"Exodus 30:33 <b>cut off:</b> The exact meaning of this is not clarified anywhere, but it seems to indicate the death penalty. It is often mentioned in connection with violations of the cult (see 12:15, for example)."
Exodus 30:34 <b>drop-gum…:</b> The identification of some of these substances is debated.
"Exodus 30:35 <b>salted:</b> Salt was employed in sacrifices perhaps originally to ward off demons; it has taken on importance in both worship and folklore (viz., the practice of throwing salt over one’s shoulder). Some suggest that salt was used simply to improve the taste of the food, or to absorb the blood."
Exodus 31:2 <b>called by name:</b> Or “chosen/singled out.”
"Exodus 31:3 <b>spirit of God:</b> Or “breath of God,” the transfer of which to human beings in the Bible results in great strength, leadership qualities, or, especially, prophetic inspiration."
"Exodus 31:6 <b>Oholiav:</b> Trad. English “Oholiab”; the name means “Tent of Father/God,” rather appropriate here."
"Exodus 31:10 <b>officiating:</b> The Hebrew (<i>serad</i>) is not entirely clear, but may be related to <i>sharet</i>, “attending” (in the sanctuary)."
"Exodus 31:13 <b>However:</b> In contrast to all the previous activity, the Israelites are not to forget about the Sabbath, the “ceasing” from work (so too Rashi). <i>Akh</i> may also be taken as a positive term, “above all.”"
"Exodus 31:17 <b>paused-for-breath:</b> A rather daring anthropomorphism which, by describing God’s resting, encourages humans and animals to do the same (see 23:12)."
"Exodus 31:18 <b>He gave:</b> God gave. <b>the finger of God:</b> Just as in Egypt (8:15), God intervenes in human affairs here as well."
"Exodus 32:1 <b>saw:</b> Ironically, after all the “seeing” of revelation in Chaps. 19–24, what now impresses the people most is Moshe’s absence, leading to a need to make a god that can be “seen.” <b>was shamefully-late:</b> Others, “delayed,” but the Hebrew verb (<i>boshesh</i>) carries the connotation of “causing-shame/embarrassment.” <b>a god:</b> Others, “gods”; but there is one calf and one god that it represents. <b>go before us:</b> As in 23:23 the meaning is to lead, especially in battle."
Exodus 32:2 <b>Break off:</b> Or simply “remove.”
"Exodus 32:4 <b>fashioned it with a graving-tool:</b> Others, “cast it in a mold” or even “tied it in a bag” (see Plaut). <b>calf:</b> Or young bull, symbol of fertility in Canaan. <b>This is your God…:</b> Cf. 20:2 above, “I am Y<small>HWH</small> your God, who brought you out….”"
Exodus 32:5 <b>called out:</b> Or “proclaimed.”
"Exodus 32:6 <b>proceeded:</b> Or the Hebrew <i>kum</i> can be understood as “arose,” as opposed to “sat down” in the phrase to follow. <b>revel:</b> There seems to be a sexual connotation here (as in Gen. 26:8; 39:14, 17) which would support the use of the calf as the divine symbol."
Exodus 32:7 <b>your people:</b> God not so subtly renounces his kingship of Israel. <b>wrought ruin:</b> The verb <i>shahet</i> is often used to describe moral decay (see Gen. 6:11–12).
"Exodus 32:8 <b>turn aside from the way:</b> In the Bible, as in many religious systems, the correct mode of behavior is often called “the way” or “path.” Here it is probably elliptical for “the way of God.” Postbiblical Judaism calls its system of laws <i>Halakhah</i>, from the Hebrew <i>halokh</i>, “to go / walk.”"
"Exodus 32:9 <b>hard-necked:</b> Others, “stiff-necked.” The usage of “hard” ironically recalls the earlier hard-hearted character, Pharaoh."
Exodus 32:11 <b>soothed:</b> Lit. “softened.”
"Exodus 32:12 <b>be sorry:</b> Others, “repent” or “change your mind.” <b>the evil:</b> Destruction. The biblical use of “evil” (<i>ra’</i>) corresponds more closely to our idea of “ill” as in “ill-fortune”; it includes not only immorality but also disasters that befall people."
"Exodus 32:13 <b>Recall:</b> This particular form of the verb <i>zakhor</i> (with the preposition <i>le</i>-) means “to remember to one’s credit” (Childs). <b>I will make…:</b> Recalling the promise to Avraham and Yitzhak in Gen. 15:5 and 22:17, also 26:4."
Exodus 32:16 <b>God’s making … God’s writing:</b> In contrast to the “making” of the Calf.
"Exodus 32:17 <b>as it shouted:</b> Heb. <i>be-re’o</i>, possibly a pun on <i>ve-ra</i> (“set-on-evil”) in v.22."
"Exodus 32:18 <b>song:</b> Heb. <i>’anot</i>, as distinct from <i>shira</i> in 15:1. <b>prevailing … failing:</b> Heb. <i>gevura … halusha</i>, meaning “victory” and “defeat.” <b>choral-song:</b> Or “antiphonal (alternating) song.” The Hebrew is <i>’annot</i> as opposed to <i>’anot</i>. But some interpreters view it as identical to the two previous uses, and find something missing here (as in “the sound of ——— is what I hear”)."
Exodus 32:19 <b>the calf and the dancing:</b> Apparently both angered Moshe. <b>beneath the mountain:</b> The very same place where the covenant was concluded! (Cassuto).
"Exodus 32:20 <b>burned … ground … strewed … made … drink:</b> The first three of these verbs also occur together in a Canaanite (Ugaritic) text, describing the goddess Anat’s destruction of the god Mot; our text perhaps plays off that literature (Childs). At any rate, Moshe’s action is the equivalent of making the Israelites “eat their words.” As has long been noted, this echoes the treatment of the suspected adulteress in Num. 5:11–31; the connection appears intentional, in light of the constant “marriage” imagery used of God and Israel in the Bible (Sarna 1986 discusses the parallels at length)."
Exodus 32:24 <b>out came this calf:</b> Aharon’s reply sounds like that of a child who has been caught in the act.
"Exodus 32:25 <b>gotten-loose:</b> The same verb (<i>paro’a</i>) was used in 5:4, where Pharaoh complained about the Israelites. <b>for whispering:</b> A derisive kind of whispering."
Exodus 32:27 <b>every-man…:</b> The repetition stresses the horror of the situation.
"Exodus 32:28 <b>three thousand:</b> Another stereotyped number (e.g., Samson kills 3,000 Philistines in Judg. 16:27)."
"Exodus 32:32 <b>blot … out:</b> Erase, as in writing. <b>record:</b> Heb. <i>sefer</i>, earlier (17:14) rendered as “account.”"
"Exodus 32:34 <b>my messenger will go before you:</b> Apparently restoring the state of affairs promised in 23:20ff. <b>calling-to-account:</b> In Gen. 50:24, <i>pakod</i> meant “taking account of,” that is, remembering the Israelites in their Egyptian bondage."
"Exodus 32:35 <b>they made … Aharon made:</b> Heb. ambiguous; possibly a scribal error. Or the ambiguity may serve to shift the blame from the perpetrator to the act itself (Greenstein, personal communication)."
Exodus 33:1 <b>the people that you brought up:</b> The use of “you” (Moshe) suggests that God still has not fully reaccepted them.
"Exodus 33:3 <b>I will not:</b> Myself, in person, as it were."
"Exodus 33:6 <b>stripped themselves:</b> This feels analogous to having one’s battle ribbons stripped off, or having one’s spoils taken away."
"Exodus 33:7 <b>outside the camp:</b> Already in early Jewish tradition it was pointed out that this phrase often has negative connotations (that is, one was sent outside the camp because of ritual impurity), and it has been suggested that our passage shows Moshe separating himself from the sinning people. On the other hand, it is usually the carrier/causer of impurity who goes outside!"
Exodus 33:9 <b>he:</b> God.
"Exodus 33:11 <b>face to face:</b> See Gen. 32:31, where Jacob is amazed at still being alive after an encounter with a manifestation of God. In the ancient world in general, direct contact with the gods is often portrayed as leading to madness or death (see the Greek story of Semele, the mortal mother of the god Dionysus). Cf. v.20, below. <b>Yehoshua,/would not depart:</b> Once again, he appears in a fragmentary way, but importantly, as Moshe’s attendant (and so he will be not only a military leader, as in 17:9ff., but also a spiritual one)."
"Exodus 33:13 <b>know:</b> Intimately. <b>indeed your people:</b> And not only Moshe’s, as God suggests in v. 1."
Exodus 33:16 <b>that we are distinct:</b> The text returns to a motif important in the Plague Narrative.
"Exodus 33:18 <b>your Glory:</b> In the Greek story, Semele desires to see Zeus in full battle dress; the Hebrew narrative is understandably more vague."
Exodus 33:19 <b>that I show-favor…:</b> Recalling the earlier answer to Moshe in 4:13. The meaning here is “I choose to whom to reveal myself.”
"Exodus 33:23 <b>my back:</b> That is, hiding the actual appearance of God."
"Exodus 34:2 <b>in the morning:</b> As at Sinai, there is no question of a night vision/illusion."
"Exodus 34:6–7 <b>Y<small>HWH</small> Y<small>HWH</small>…:</b> These two verses became an important part of later Jewish liturgy, and are known as the “Thirteen Attributes of God.” <b>showing-mercy, showing-favor:</b> Heb. <i>rahum ve-hanun</i>."
"Exodus 34:7 <b>third and fourth (generation):</b> This may mean an entire household, that is, generally the largest number of generations alive at one time (Clements)."
"Exodus 34:8 <b>Quickly:</b> This, as perhaps the greatest moment of divine-human intimacy in the Bible, is the one most ripe for forgiveness, and Moshe seizes the opportunity."
"Exodus 34:10 <b>Here…:</b> Does God ever really answer Moshe’s request to “let my Lord go among us!”? We can only tell by the ending of the entire book, when all seems right again (40:34–38). <b>Then shall all … see:</b> The Hebrew word order is “Then shall see ….”"
Exodus 34:13 <b>standing-pillars:</b> These stood near Canaanite altars (Plaut). <b>tree-poles:</b> Phallic idols.
"Exodus 34:14 <b>zealous:</b> Cf. 20:5, above."
Exodus 34:15 <b>whoring:</b> A common biblical metaphor for faithlessness to God.
"Exodus 34:16 <b>their women:</b> They are singled out as the ones enticing the Israelite men into idolatry, perhaps based on the prominence of goddesses and sacred prostitutes in Canaanite worship."
"Exodus 34:19 <b>drops-as-male:</b> Others, “every male.”"
"Exodus 34:21 <b>serve:</b> Here perhaps connoting farm work, as in Gen. 2:5, 4:12. See also Ex. 20:9."
"Exodus 34:21 <b>plowing … grain-cutting:</b> For once, the Bible specifies the work that is not to be done on the Sabbath."
"Exodus 34:22 <b>turning of the year:</b> When the last harvest occurs (September—October), and hence connected to a solar calendar model."
Exodus 34:23 <b>points:</b> Lit. “beats.” <b>Lord:</b> Cf. the note to 23:17.
"Exodus 34:24 <b>no man will desire your land:</b> Not even desire it, much less take it away."
"Exodus 34:28 <b>Ten Words:</b> These are known in the Bible as such, not as the “Ten Commandments.”"
"Exodus 34:29 <b>radiating:</b> Or “radiant.” As is well known, Michelangelo created his famous horned statue of Moses (in the Roman church of San Pietro in Vincoli) on the basis of the Latin translation of the Bible, the Vulgate, which rendered the Hebrew <i>karan</i> as “horned.” There have now been found other ancient Near Eastern texts that support this reading, although the present context and comparative religion seem also to throw weight to “radiating.”"
"Exodus 35:3 <b>You are not to let fire burn:</b> This prohibition perhaps reflects the anthropological use of fire as a transforming force in culture (see Fredman). Since the Shabbat was apparently to be static in nature, or at least transformative of time alone, fire (which by its nature causes chemical changes) could not be employed. <b>throughout all your settlements:</b> And not only in the area of building the Dwelling (Cassuto)."
"Exodus 35:22 <b>necklace:</b> This is a conjecture, as the meaning of the Hebrew <i>kumaz</i> is uncertain."
Exodus 35:25 <b>spun:</b> The Hebrew verb <i>tavoh</i> occurs only here in the Bible.
"Exodus 35:34 <b>(the ability) to instruct:</b> Now that the actual construction is about to take place, it is crucial that the head craftsman be not only skilled himself, but a master instructor as well."
"Exodus 36:10 <b>each-one to each-one:</b> In 26:3, the parallel passage, the text reads “each one to the other.” This is one example of the changes that occur between Chaps. 25–31 and 35–40; the reader should consult the parallel accounts for the differences in wording."
"Exodus 38:21 <b>the accountings:</b> I.e., the inventory of materials used to construct the Dwelling."
Exodus 38:21 <b>Itamar:</b> Previously mentioned only in the genealogical list of 6:23 and the enumeration in 28:1.
"Exodus 38:24 <b>ingots:</b> Others, “talents.” These were of fairly large weight, perhaps 75 pounds."
"Exodus 38:26 <b>603,550:</b> A more specific number than the “about 600,000” mentioned in 12:37; it has been shown by Cassuto to conform to a patterned scheme (600,000 + 7,000/2 + 100/2), and hence may be a number designed more for didactic than for reporting purposes."
Exodus 39:3 <b>to make-use-of them amidst:</b> Or “to work them into.”
Exodus 39:6 <b>surrounded by braids:</b> Heb. <i>meshubbot mishbetzot</i>.
Exodus 39:8 <b>an <i>efod</i>:</b> Some ancient versions read “the <i>efod</i>.”
"Exodus 39:32 <b>made:</b> More idiomatically, “did” (similarly in 39:42, 43 and 40:16). See Gen. 6:22, where Noah also follows God’s instructions to the letter."
"Exodus 39:37 <b>lamps for arranging:</b> Others, “lamps in due order.” <b>implements:</b> Others, “fittings.”"
"Exodus 40:2 <b>the first New-Moon … the first (day):</b> The date is almost a year after Israel’s departure from Egypt. The completion of the sanctuary takes place on the first day of the month (new moon), whereas the exodus had occurred on the fifteenth (full moon), also considered a sacred time."
"Leviticus 1:1 <b>And he called … Y<small>HWH</small> spoke:</b> The unusual syntax here links the opening of Leviticus with the revelation at Mount Sinai in Ex. 24:16, the only other passage in the Torah where God “called to Moshe” (in these exact words). Indeed, as Milgrom points out, from the end of Ex. 40 to Num. 9, the Torah contains the bulk of its laws given at Sinai after Ex. 20–23. Leviticus thus verbally returns to the revelation of law."
"Leviticus 1:2 <b>Anyone:</b> Including both men and women. As these texts unfold, I will be using “he,” as the Hebrew does, but both Hebrew and English should be understood as including both sexes in these contexts. <b>near-offering:</b> For this and the rendering of other technical terms, cf. “On Translating Leviticus,” above."
"Leviticus 1:3 <b>offering-up:</b> Or “ascent-offering.” Others, “holocaust,” to show that this sacrifice is to be wholly consumed by fire. <b>wholly-sound:</b> Perfect, unblemished—that is, fit for sacrifice. The adjective is used of humans as well (cf. Gen. 6:9, referring to Noah, and 17:1, referring to Avraham), in the sense of “wholehearted, perfect, full of integrity.” <b>before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> A refrain in these texts, usually indicating a location at the sanctuary."
"Leviticus 1:4 <b>lean his hand:</b> The meaning of this act has puzzled commentators. It may symbolize ownership, a statement of the reason for the sacrifice, or perhaps identification with the animal (as a substitute for the life of the worshiper). <b>to effect-ransom:</b> Heb. root <i>k-p-r</i> (again, see “On Translating Leviticus”). The aspect of “ransoming” mentioned here does not recur with the other sacrifices; some have postulated an original nonpriestly venue for this type of offering."
"Leviticus 1:5 <b>He is to slay … (for sacrifice):</b> Technically, slitting the animal’s throat. This is apparently done by the worshiper himself. As in similar cases, I have left the text ambiguous here regarding the principal actor. <b>dash the blood:</b> For Milgrom, this action prevents murder being imputed to the sacrificer—he has returned the “life” (namely, the blood) to God."
Leviticus 1:6 <b>flay:</b> Or “strip the skin.” The hide (which goes to the priests) is the only part of the offering-up not burned.
"Leviticus 1:7 <b>Sons of Aharon:</b> The priests, not only Aaron’s own sons but those from the tribe of Levi, who were seen as descending from him."
"Leviticus 1:9 <b>fire-offering:</b> B-R render Heb. <i>ishe</i> with “fire-present”; some scholars link the word with Ugaritic <i>itht</i>, “gift.” Wenham notes the parallel with “food” in a number of passages. <b>soothing savor:</b> Or “scent of assent” (L. Rosenwald). It first appears in Gen. 8:21, where Noah offers sacrifices after the Flood, and the pleasing smell leads God to vow never again to annihilate the earth. So the function of the sacrifice in this chapter, at least, is to gain God’s favor and compassion."
"Leviticus 1:15 <b>its blood is to be drained out:</b> Not dashed against the altar; a bird does not contain much blood, compared to a grazing animal."
"Leviticus 1:16 <b>crissum:</b> The anal area (Milgrom); others, “crop,” the throat pocket where food stays during digestion."
"Leviticus 2:1 <b>flour:</b> As opposed to “meal,” this was made from the hard kernels of the wheat that remain after the removal of bran. Others, “choice flour,” “fine meal,” “semolina.”"
"Leviticus 2:2 <b>frankincense:</b> Perhaps an indicator of the festive nature of this sacrifice. <b>reminder-portion:</b> Others “token portion.” It apparently functions to remind God of the whole offering, most of which is eaten by the priests."
"Leviticus 2:3 <b>holiest holy-portion:</b> The phrase <i>kodesh kodashim</i> recurs in connection with the cult, indicating, variously, the inner sanctum of the Tabernacle (“Dwelling”), objects, and sacrifices. The food here is to be eaten by the priests in a holy area."
Leviticus 2:4 <b><i>matza</i>/unleavened:</b> This is typical of Israelite practice; grain connected to the cult is not to be susceptible to rotting—because its imperfection would denigrate divine worship. Cf. v.11 below.
Leviticus 2:5 <b>griddle:</b> Resulting in a crisp wafer-type food.
Leviticus 2:7 <b>pan:</b> A frying pan; the result was a breadlike product.
"Leviticus 2:11 <b>date-honey:</b> Heb. <i>devash</i> may well have this meaning generally, even including the oft-used phrase “a land flowing with milk and honey.”"
"Leviticus 2:13 <b>with salt:</b> In a number of Middle Eastern cultures, continuing down to the present day, salt is used in the sealing of an agreement, hence the term “salt of the covenant” (others, “binding agreement”). Wen-ham points out that salt was considered indestructible in the ancient world, hence its use as a symbol of permanence here. Or it may simply be that the expensive and tasty nature of salt is the crucial factor here."
"Leviticus 2:14 <b>firstfruits:</b> Not literally “fruit,” but figuratively, the first-processed (= best) of the grain."
"Leviticus 3:1 <b>slaughter-offering of <i>shalom:</i></b> Or “slaughter-meal of <i>shalom</i>.” Earlier translations use “peace offering,” which is now felt less likely to be accurate than the widely accepted “sacred gift of greeting” (<i>shalom</i> connotes well-being, wholeness, and also greeting). <b>whether male or whether female:</b> Interestingly, female animals, usually excluded from sacrifice because of their reproductive value, are included here."
"Leviticus 3:3 <b>the fat</b> etc.: Perhaps symbolizing the choicest part of the animal, it denotes here the removable fat around internal organs. The kidneys may be stressed here because of the belief that they were, in humans, the seat of the emotions (Wenham)."
Leviticus 3:4 <b>extension on the liver:</b> A protrusion at the lower part.
"Leviticus 3:9 <b>the whole thick tail:</b> This kind of sheep has a long, thick, bushy tail. It was highly valued, and hence appropriately offered to God."
"Leviticus 3:11 <b>food:</b> Heb. <i>lehem</i>, which in narrower contexts means simply “bread.”"
Leviticus 3:16 <b>all the fat is for Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> This phrase extends beyond the usual ending pattern in these chapters of “a fire-offering for Y<small>HWH</small>”; the change is a rhetorical device meant to emphasize a point.
Leviticus 3:17 <b>throughout all your settlements:</b> And thus beyond the holy places! (Levine)
"Leviticus 4:2 <b>sins:</b> Heb. <i>teheta’</i>; more properly, it means “fails” (B-R) or “misses” (as with an arrow). The word connotes giving offense to or wronging God (or another person). <b>in error:</b> That is, unintentionally."
"Leviticus 4:3 <b>Anointed Priest:</b> The High Priest. <b>bringing-guilt:</b> Or “blame.” He is responsible not only for his own actions, but his misdeeds potentially pollute the whole community, for whom he is the representative. <b><i>hattat:</i></b> Cf. “On Translating Leviticus,” above. It should be pronounced “hah<i>taht</i>.”"
"Leviticus 4:6 <b>in front of the curtain:</b> Separating the Holy Area from the “Holiest Holy-Shrine”; thus, sprinkling the blood near the curtain was as close as one could normally get to God (Milgrom)."
"Leviticus 4:7 <b>horns of the site:</b> The purpose of these four corner “horns,” found in archaeological remains all over ancient Israel, is unknown. Milgrom theorizes that daubing blood on them symbolically purified the whole altar, by means of the extremities symbolizing the whole."
Leviticus 4:8 <b>set … aside:</b> Lit. “lift off.”
"Leviticus 4:11–12 <b>As for the skin</b> etc.: The High Priest cannot eat from his own <i>hattat</i>-offering in the same way that he eats from others’, as that would be in a sense profiting from his wrongdoing."
"Leviticus 4:13 <b>the entire community:</b> Here <i>eda</i> indicates the whole people, not just the leaders (as often elsewhere in the Torah) (Milgrom). The passage reinforces the idea of group responsibility, a concept well illustrated in Deut. 21:1–9, where a town must atone for an unsolved murder committed within its borders. <b>they do:</b> The community. <b>incur-guilt:</b> Whether or not they are cognizant of what they have done wrong (Levine)."
"Leviticus 4:20 <b>effect-purgation:</b> Or “effect-ransom.” <b>granted-pardon:</b> The verb is not used of humans in the Bible; so perhaps the idea is not forgiveness in the usual sense of “forgive and forget”—there is reconciliation, but punishment still occurs (Milgrom)."
Leviticus 4:22 <b>leader:</b> Of a tribe (Wenham).
"Leviticus 4:27 <b>the people of the land:</b> JPS “populace.” In early biblical texts, this term usually denotes nobility, the “landed people.” In postbiblical Judaism, <i>am haaretz</i> came to indicate the “common folk,” often with the connotation of “the unlearned.”"
"Leviticus 5:1 <b>the public-voice (carrying) a threat:</b> That is, testimony has been called for, but the person with knowledge has not come forward; the threat is one of a curse on that person. Levine reminds us that testimony, then as frequently still, took place under oath and thus was connected with the name of God. So the offense described here was a most serious one. <b>tell:</b> Or “report”; it bears the technical meaning “testify.” <b>bear his iniquity:</b> This phrase, which recurs frequently in Leviticus, is now understood not as suffering punishment but as in a sense carrying sin around, as liability; it implies that the sin can at some point be taken away (Schwartz 1994)."
"Leviticus 5:2 <b><i>tamei:</i></b> As stated above, the term is not well served by negative translations such as “impure” or “unclean”; the Hebrew signifies that something is in a charged state and must not come in contact with the sanctuary. In Milgrom’s analogy with <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, accumulated moral and ritual pollution eventually contaminates the sanctuary, potentially beyond repair—hence the original importance of the ritual in Chap. 16, where the Holy-Shrine was “decontaminated” every year. <b><i>tamei</i> wild-animal:</b> As found in the list starting in 11:29 below."
"Leviticus 5:3 <b>human <i>tum’a:</i></b> Indicating pollution from bodily flows (cf. Chap. 12), certain skin diseases (cf. Chaps. 13–14), and especially death (cf. Num. 19)."
"Leviticus 5:6 <b>guilt-offering:</b> Or “penalty-offering, reparation-offering.” The Hebrew term is pronounced “ah-<i>shahm</i>.”"
"Leviticus 5:7 <b>cannot reach enough (means):</b> That is, he cannot afford it. The birds were regarded as the most inexpensive alternative."
"Leviticus 5:8 <b>divide:</b> That is, sever."
"Leviticus 5:11 <b><i>efa:</i></b> A dry measure, equaling perhaps 20 liters (the “tenth” spoken of here might equal two <i>omers</i> or sheaves, an amount thought of as daily rations [Ibn Ezra]). <b>for it is a <i>hattat</i>-offering:</b> And therefore does not take the festive additions of oil and frankincense (Bamberger)."
"Leviticus 5:15 <b>breaks-faith:</b> Or “commits a breach of trust.” Milgrom understands this as “sacrilege” against the sacred vessels. <b>by your assessment:</b> More comfortably in English, “by assessment.” <b>the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel:</i></b> The standard of currency in this and many other cases. Biblical money consisted in the main of metal weights (lit. <i>“shekels”</i>) and not of coins."
"Leviticus 5:16 <b>its fifth:</b> Twenty percent additional, the standard fee for the priests (Levine)."
"Leviticus 5:21 <b>withholding:</b> Either “restraint” of wages or “distraint” (seizure) of property when a loan has not been repaid; in either case, it involves withholding what a person is due."
"Leviticus 5:23 <b>he is to return:</b> That is, first must come restitution, and only then can the <i>hattat</i> act to remove the wrongdoing (Sforno). <b>the robbed-object that he robbed…:</b> Note the almost poetic structuring of object and verb in this verse, which is a legal text!"
Leviticus 5:24 <b>capital-amount:</b> Lit. “head”; the principal.
Leviticus 6:2 <b>for:</b> Or “concerning.” <b>until daybreak:</b> Since everything of the offering-up had to be burned (Bamberger).
Leviticus 6:3 <b>breeches of linen:</b> To prevent the exposure of the lower body while ascending to the altar. Ex. 20:23 tries to accomplish the same thing by providing for a ramp up the altar instead of steps. <b>“flesh”:</b> Most probably a euphemism for “genitals.”
Leviticus 6:10 <b>holiest holy-portion:</b> And hence only priests may eat it (Wenham).
"Leviticus 6:11 <b>becomes holy (property):</b> Levine (“must be in a holy [state]”) and Wenham (“Whoever … becomes holy”) understand this phrase as referring to persons, but Milgrom argues for its meaning objects, and the “contracting” of holiness as a kind of contagion—hence the objects must be isolated."
Leviticus 6:14 <b>well-stirred:</b> Many commentators render “well-baked.” <b>as baked crumbled-bits of grain:</b> Heb. unclear; JPS: “a meal-offering of baked slices.”
"Leviticus 6:15 <b>sacrifice:</b> Lit. “do, make.”"
Leviticus 6:20 <b>is to be scrubbed:</b> Reading <i>tekhubbas</i> for <i>tekhabbes</i>.
"Leviticus 6:21 <b>broken:</b> Earthenware was considered porous, and therefore could not be washed/purified."
"Leviticus 7:12 <b>thanksgiving:</b> Rashi understands this as gratitude for having survived a difficult journey, illness, or imprisonment. Such concerns persist in later Judaism, in the form of a public blessing said in synagogue by the survivor."
Leviticus 7:14 <b>contribution:</b> Or “raised-contribution.” The purpose of this was “to transfer the object from its owner to the deity” (Milgrom).
"Leviticus 7:18 <b>reckoned to him:</b> That is, “credited” to him. Since the sacrifice has not been disposed of properly, its efficacy is void (Bamberger). <b>Tainted-meat:</b> Or “desecrated meat” (Wright, cited by Milgrom). Here the penalty for eating from the sacrifices is being “cutoff” from the community, probably meaning death. As elsewhere in Leviticus, the crossing of sacred boundaries threatens the sacred whole of the community."
"Leviticus 7:21 <b>detestable-creature:</b> Heb. <i>sheketz;</i> emendation to <i>sheretz</i>, “swarming-creature,” also makes sense, and indeed appears in some of the ancient versions."
"Leviticus 7:23 <b>fat:</b> Prohibited to humans, since these “choice-parts” were exclusively sacrificed to God."
"Leviticus 7:29 <b>(himself):</b> Milgrom, quoting Saadiah Gaon."
"Leviticus 7:30 <b>elevating … elevation-offering:</b> Trad. “waving … a wave-offering” has been shown incorrect by Milgrom; the act consists of raising the offering in dedication to God, to indicate transfer of ownership."
Leviticus 7:35 <b>anointed-share:</b> The Heb. root <i>m-sh-h</i> indicates either “anointing” or “measuring”; I have attempted to keep both senses.
"Leviticus 7:36 <b>from the time:</b> Others, “at the time.”"
Leviticus 7:37 <b>mandate-offering:</b> Sacrificed in connection with the installation of Aharon’s sons as priests; cf. the following chapter.
"Leviticus 7:38 <b>in the wilderness of Sinai:</b> This phrase ties Chaps. 6–7 to the first five chapters, as an editorial device (Milgrom)."
"Leviticus 8:2 <b>the garments:</b> For Aharon and his sons, enumerated in some detail in Ex. 28."
"Leviticus 8:3 <b>at the entrance to the Tent:</b> Not necessarily <i>at</i> the entrance, but opposite it (Levine)."
Leviticus 8:7 <b><i>efod</i>-vest:</b> A kind of embroidered apron on the High Priest’s garment. To it was attached the breastpiece.
"Leviticus 8:8 <b>the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Tummim:</i></b> Objects of unknown form contained in the breastpiece; they might mean “lights and perfections” or, alternatively, “A to Z,” but were in any event used in various parts of the Bible for the prediction of the future. The <i>efod</i> too is difficult to reconstruct from the Bible’s description. Levine sees it as a holdover from paganism, where statues of the gods were clothed in special garments (cf. Judg. 8:27 and 18:18, which refer to the worship of Gideon’s <i>efod</i>)."
"Leviticus 8:10 <b>the dwelling:</b> With a lowercase <i>d</i> in English, this indicates, not the Tabernacle itself, but the holy area, which contained the altars, the lampstand, and the table."
Leviticus 8:14 <b>the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering:</b> Offered first here because the sanctuary must be purified before anything else can happen; and Moshe officiates since as yet there are no consecrated priests (Wenham).
"Leviticus 8:15 <b>decontaminating:</b> Or “removing-sin-from.” The two ideas are virtually identical here, creating an unsolvable translator’s problem."
"Leviticus 8:22 <b>giving-mandate:</b> Lit. “filling the hand,” i.e., installing the priests. Cf. note to Ex. 28:41."
"Leviticus 8:23 <b>ridge of the right ear … thumb … thumb-toe:</b> Probably, this use of the extremities symbolically includes the whole person, and it was the whole person that needed to be purified."
"Leviticus 8:24 <b>brought-near:</b> Playing on the frequent use of this verb, which usually means “sacrifice,” but here connotes “consecrate” or “initiate.” <b>dashed:</b> Parallel to the dashing of blood that signifies the making of a covenant in Ex. 24:6–8 (Levine)."
"Leviticus 8:33 <b>the entrance:</b> Once again meaning the courtyard area in front of the “dwelling.” <b>for seven days:</b> A common period of sanctification in biblical Israel, found in reference to childbirth, holiday periods, etc. Seven was of course a number that pointed to perfection in the ancient world; it is emphasized in the sacred calendar outlined in Chap. 23 below."
Leviticus 8:35 <b>so that you do not die:</b> The penalty for not taking extreme care with the priestly rules around the sanctuary. Cf. Chap. 10 below for a narrative example.
"Leviticus 9:4 <b>make-himself-seen by:</b> Others, “appear to.”"
Leviticus 9:17 <b>aside from the morning offering-up:</b> Which still must be offered (Ramban).
Leviticus 9:22 <b>and he blessed them:</b> We do not know the wording of the blessing. The medieval commentators make various proposals based on other biblical passages.
"Leviticus 9:24 <b>fire went out from the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> As in the famous Elijah incident on Mount Carmel, in I Kings 18. There it functions to impress and convince the people of God’s power."
"Leviticus 10:1 <b>them … it:</b> The pronoun shift occurs at times in biblical Hebrew. <b>outside fire:</b> Either coals from a place outside the prescribed altar, or incense. Cf. Ex. 30:9, about the prohibition of offering incorrect or unauthorized incense. <b>such as he had not commanded them:</b> Priestly institutions and practices in all cultures are essentially conservative, not innovative (Bamberger). The phrase itself is a pointed countering of the refrain constantly sounded in Chaps. 8 and 9, “as Y<small>HWH</small> commanded Moshe” (Wenham)."
"Leviticus 10:2 <b>fire went out:</b> An ironic echo of the positive divine fire that came down and completed the sanctifying of the sanctuary/priesthood, just two verses previously."
"Leviticus 10:3 <b>Through those permitted-near:</b> The priests. God seems to be saying that he is only so holy/honored as the behavior of the priests permits. Therefore the death of Aharon’s sons is a way of demonstrating that God’s holiness is established through correct performance of his commands, and the penalty for its abuse is death (cf. in this connection Num. 20, where Moshe is promised punishment by death outside the promised land for not having “proven God holy” in the performance of his duties)."
"Leviticus 10:6 <b>do not bare:</b> Lit. “do not let-loose (your hair).” The loosening of the hair and the tearing of the garments were common ways of expressing mourning in ancient Israel. The priests are forbidden to mourn here as part of the general prohibition against their coming in contact with the dead (since death is seen in priestly texts as the major source of <i>tum’a</i>). <b>he be furious:</b> God. The verb is often used in connection with plagues (Levine). <b>are to weep:</b> Or, “may weep,” that is, you may grieve over the punishment, but not over the deaths of Nadav and Avihu."
Leviticus 10:7 <b>do not go out:</b> Remain in your priestly function.
Leviticus 10:8 <b>Now Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Aharon:</b> This reassurance is the only time in Leviticus that God speaks directly to Aharon alone (Wenham).
"Leviticus 10:9 <b>Wine and intoxicant, do not drink:</b> Does this suggest that such was Nadav and Avihu’s crime? Or is it merely one on a list of prohibitions designed to guard against improper functioning of the priests in general?"
Leviticus 10:10 <b>so that there be separation:</b> As the following chapters provide (Ibn Ezra).
Leviticus 10:12 <b>and eat it:</b> Even though you are in mourning (Rashi).
"Leviticus 10:14 <b>children’s:</b> The Hebrew can be read as “sons’,” but surely both sons and daughters are meant here, as earlier in the verse (and several versions add “daughters”)."
Leviticus 10:15 <b>allotment:</b> Heb. <i>hok</i> can be understood either this way or as “law” (this is true of many similar passages in Leviticus).
"Leviticus 10:16 <b>Moshe inquired … became furious:</b> Fishbane (1988) points out that Aharon’s failure to eat of the sacrifices is in line with Lev.9:15, but against the earlier and perhaps more authoritative law in 6:17–23. The text resolves the contradiction, and deals with the new situation of death as a factor, via divine oracle here."
"Leviticus 10:17 <b>bear the iniquity:</b> Eating the remains of the <i>hattat</i> is one of the two ways in which the sanctuary is purified (the other is the sprinkling of the blood) (Milgrom, Levine). <b>effect-purgation:</b> or “effect-atonement.”"
Leviticus 10:18 <b>its blood was not brought:</b> “As is done in the case of most solemn offerings” (Bamberger).
"Leviticus 10:19 <b>such (things) as these:</b> The death of his two sons. Given that event, Aharon is justifiably cautious about the correct performance of his priestly duties."
"Leviticus 11:2 <b>domestic-animals:</b> Heb. <i>behema</i>, as distinct from <i>hayya</i>, wild animals."
"Leviticus 11:3 <b>cleaving:</b> Creating the effect of a two-part foot, to make clear that the animal does not walk on its “hands” (which would be unnatural, in the biblical view) (Levine). <b>bringing-up:</b> Descriptive of the digestive process of these animals: they have multiple stomachs, and so after food is first chewed and swallowed, it is brought up, rechewed, and reswallowed."
Leviticus 11:5 <b>hyrax:</b> A brown rodentlike mammal with short ears which is actually not part of the rodent family (also called the coney or rock-rabbit).
"Leviticus 11:7 <b>pig:</b> Still avoided by many Jews and Moslems today, it was also used in cults worshiping gods of the underworld."
"Leviticus 11:11 <b>detestable-things:</b> They are not merely prohibited, but are labeled as abhorrent. Milgrom, in defining the difference between “detestable” and “polluted” (<i>tamei</i>) creatures, finds that the former, unlike the latter, do not convey impurity, perhaps because they live in the water, which usually serves as a purifying agent."
"Leviticus 11:21 <b>on all fours:</b> What is meant here is unclear, since insects with wings always have six legs (Bamberger). Perhaps it connotes “the opposite of upright” (Douglas 1993a)."
"Leviticus 11:24 <b>from these:</b> Despite the fact that some animals are prohibited for eating, one cannot become polluted through them by mere touch; only dead animals convey pollution."
Leviticus 11:27 <b>paws:</b> Lit. “soles/palms.”
"Leviticus 11:29 <b>swarming:</b> Their mode of locomotion is unusual (the Bible would characterize it as abnormal), since they dart to and fro. The special rules concerning them may stem from their tendency to get into houses and hence to be in regular contact with humans and vessels (Wenham, both comments)."
"Leviticus 11:32 <b>put through water:</b> Or “dipped in water.” This is done for purification purposes, as in other cases."
"Leviticus 11:33 <b>you are to break (it):</b> Earthenware was considered porous, and hence could not lose its pollution; stone, in contrast, was perceived as incapable of contracting pollution."
Leviticus 11:34 <b>water … beverage:</b> In a vessel; running water (as in a stream) neutralizes pollution (Bamberger).
Leviticus 11:35 <b>two-pot-stove:</b> A kind of stove top.
Leviticus 11:36 <b>cistern:</b> A kind of underground tank for storing rainwater or dry goods; examples can still be seen in Israel. Into such a “pit” Joseph was thrown by his brothers (Gen. 37).
Leviticus 11:42 <b>detestable-things:</b> Continuing the sense of abhorrence noted above.
"Leviticus 11:43 <b>yourselves:</b> Milgrom points out that <i>nefesh</i>, which usually means “person, emotions, life,” can also have the narrower meaning of “throat,” which makes sense here as well."
Leviticus 11:45 <b>bringing you up:</b> Instead of the usual “taking you out.” It might be a purely verbal balance to the “bringing up” of the cud with which the chapter opens.
"Leviticus 11:47 <b>be-separation:</b> As we had in 10:10, regarding the priests’ duties."
"Leviticus 12:2 <b>produces-seed:</b> According to ancient belief, women “produce-seed” which is fertilized by the male “seed.” <b>being-apart:</b> Traditionally rendered “impurity,” this refers to menstruation. The present rendering follows B-R, Greenstein, and others. The word may, alternatively, derive from the verb “to spatter.”"
"Leviticus 12:4 <b>blood purification:</b> That is, being “decontaminated” from the state of danger between life and death that childbirth represents."
Leviticus 12:7 <b>source of blood:</b> Her state in childbirth.
"Leviticus 13:2 <b>swelling … scab … shiny-spot:</b> The exact identification of these marks is not certain. <b>affliction:</b> Heb. <i>nega</i>, which could also be rendered “mark” or even “plague.” The word connotes being touched or stricken (cf. the word for the plagues in the exodus story, <i>makka</i>, from the verb “to strike”). The use of “affliction” in these passages is not connected to the Heb. verb <i>’-n-h</i>, which I have also rendered “afflict,” and which the Torah frequently uses to depict oppression or maltreatment."
"Leviticus 13:3 <b>look:</b> Or “appearance.” <b>deeper:</b> According to one view, lower; to another, deeper in color."
Leviticus 13:5 <b>at a standstill:</b> Or “retained its appearance” (Levine).
Leviticus 13:6 <b>spread:</b> Heb. <i>pasah</i> (alternatively rendered “grown”); scab: Heb. <i>mispahat;</i> the two terms are considered similar sounding enough by Fishbane (1988) to make his point above.
Leviticus 13:9 <b>he:</b> Or she.
"Leviticus 13:10 <b>“live” flesh:</b> Others, “raw,” skin that is exposed."
Leviticus 13:11 <b>mature:</b> Or “prior” (Levine).
"Leviticus 13:30 <b>scall:</b> From a root that means “torn apart,” here referring to follicles of hair ripped after splitting."
Leviticus 13:39 <b>rash:</b> And not a ritually polluting condition.
Leviticus 13:41 <b>becomes smooth:</b> The verb means “to pluck out” or “to shine.” <b>forehead-bald:</b> As opposed to baldness that goes toward the back of the head (Rashi).
"Leviticus 13:44 <b>on his head is his affliction:</b> Some scholars understand the wording as reversed, hence “on account of the infection on his head” (Levine)."
Leviticus 13:45 <b><i>Tamei! Tamei!:</i></b> Only at this point does the text turn to the procedure for dealing with the polluted person.
Leviticus 13:46 <b>alone:</b> The quarantine is as much visual as it is hygienic.
Leviticus 13:47 <b>cloth etc.:</b> The text moves on to another form of imperfection: mold or fungus.
"Leviticus 13:49 <b>greenish:</b> Others, “yellowish.”"
"Leviticus 13:51 <b>acute:</b> Or “persistent serious” (Wenham), “menacing, maleficent” (Greenstein, personal communication)."
"Leviticus 13:55 <b>decay:</b> From a verb meaning “to dig out.” “<b>bald-spot” … “forehead”:</b> These physiological terms describe the inside and outside of a piece of cloth, again highlighting the parallels and sense of order in priestly thinking."
"Leviticus 14:2 <b>Instruction:</b> Here as elsewhere, the meaning of this key structural term in Leviticus is not far from “ritual.”"
"Leviticus 14:4 <b>live:</b> One bird will be killed, the other set free. <b>scarlet of the worm:</b> As in Ex. 25:4, obtained from crushing a small insect. <b>hyssop:</b> A bush known for its use in ceremonies as a kind of brush (cf. Ex. 12:22, where it is used to smear the blood on the Israelites’ doorposts in Egypt)."
"Leviticus 14:5 <b>slay:</b> Unlike the ritual killing of birds in 1:15, which is accomplished by the pinching of the creature’s neck. Hence this is not technically a sacrifice (Sifra, quoted by Bamberger)."
"Leviticus 14:6 <b>living water:</b> I.e., running water, also required for purification in v.50 and in the next chapter."
"Leviticus 14:7 <b>send-out:</b> The liberation of the live bird, into the open field (the countryside), sounds like a scapegoat ritual, whereby sins or noxious influences are driven into uninhabited space and hence disposed of."
"Leviticus 14:9 <b>shaves</b> … <b>his head, his beard:</b> Normally forbidden, but permitted here for purposes of purification (Levine)."
"Leviticus 14:10 <b>On the eighth day:</b> Paralleling circumcision, another ritual of integration into the community (Calvin, quoted by Wenham). <b><i>log:</i></b> A liquid measure, perhaps equivalent to a pint. Its equivalent is found in Ugaritic texts (Cohen)."
"Leviticus 14:17 <b>oil:</b> The oil serves to cover and protect the blood, so that the latter may do its purifying work (Greenstein 1984a); likewise in v.28."
"Leviticus 14:34 <b>Canaan:</b> As in Chap. 25, the law here reflects the later period of settlement and not the one of wandering in the wilderness."
Leviticus 14:48 <b>healed:</b> The language is figurative; it is as if the mold/mildew were a disease.
Leviticus 15:2 <b>a-flow from his “flesh”:</b> A discharge from his genitals.
"Leviticus 15:4 <b>place-of-lying:</b> Either a bed, or, more likely, some padding on the floor."
Leviticus 15:7 <b>flesh:</b> Here the meaning of the word probably reverts to any part of the body.
"Leviticus 15:11 <b>rinsed his hands:</b> That is, the polluted person. The nineteenth-century commentator S. D. Luzzatto understands “hands” as euphemistic for genitals—so the whole body needed to be immersed."
"Leviticus 15:14 <b>before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> This formula, which occurs frequently in priestly texts, is omitted in v.29 below; biblical women are not allowed the same cultic access to the divine as men (Wegner 1988)."
Leviticus 15:18 <b>emission:</b> Lit. “laying” or “layer.”
Leviticus 15:19 <b>(state of) being-apart:</b> Cf. note to 12:2.
"Leviticus 15:31 <b>have … avoid:</b> A form of the verb rendered “consecrate” in Num. 6. <b>that they not die:</b> Death would result, not from the pollution itself, but from carrying it into the sacred areas, and thus polluting them."
"Leviticus 16:1 <b>the two sons of Aharon:</b> Nadav and Avihu, whose death was detailed in Chap. 10."
"Leviticus 16:2 <b>at (just) any time:</b> Indiscriminately. The end of the chapter restricts Aharon’s entry to just once a year. <b>Purgation-Cover:</b> Heb. <i>kapporet;</i> as described in Ex. 25:17–22; the part of the Coffer or Ark which served as God’s “footstool,” and the holiest object in the cult. <b>in a cloud:</b> In which dwells the “Glory” of God."
Leviticus 16:3 <b>for a <i>hattat</i>-offering:</b> Aharon cannot approach God without undergoing purification.
"Leviticus 16:8 <b>Azazel:</b> The identification of this name has been a subject of debate for centuries. Proposals include <i>ez azal,</i> meaning “a goat that escapes” (hence English “scapegoat”), and another reading signifying “a fierce region.” Many recent commentators, however, agree in seeing Azazel as the name of a wilderness demon, and hence the rite is taken as a vestige of an old pagan practice. Appropriately, in modern Hebrew <i>lekh la-azazel</i> is the equivalent of English “go to hell” or “get lost.” Regardless of the precise meaning of Azazel, that is, in fact, what the community wants to happen to its sins."
"Leviticus 16:13 <b>Testimony:</b> That is, the “Coffer of Testimony.”"
"Leviticus 16:16 <b>for:</b> Milgrom: “including,” JPS: “whatever.” <b><i>tum’ot:</i></b> Plural of <i>tum’a,</i> so here, “pollutings.” The idea is that God is with the Israelites even in the presence of <i>tum’a</i> (up to a point, of course)."
Leviticus 16:17 <b>No human:</b> Even regular priests are excluded on this occasion.
"Leviticus 16:21 <b>confess:</b> In Levine’s view, sins were originally listed one by one and thus wiped away."
"Leviticus 16:22 <b>bear upon itself… iniquities:</b> To carry them off; a play on the common phrase “bear one’s iniquity.” <b>a land cut off:</b> That is, remote from human experience."
Leviticus 16:27 <b>and their dung:</b> Completely!
"Leviticus 16:29 <b>seventh New-Moon:</b> Today, Yom Kippur occurs in the first month of the Jewish calendar, in the fall; an earlier calendar viewed the spring as the beginning of the year (cf. Ex. 12:1). <b>afflict your selves:</b> Virtually all commentators (and Jewish tradition) interpret this as a reference to fasting."
"Leviticus 16:31 <b>a Sabbath of Sabbath-Ceasing:</b> A kind of Super-Sabbath, a total cessation of the everyday for the sake of concentrating on atonement."
"Leviticus 16:33 <b>Holiest of Holy-Shrines:</b> Pointing to the inner sanctum, “inside the curtain” (Ibn Ezra)."
"Leviticus 17:3 <b>House of Israel:</b> Levine views this phrase, which is found in the Prophets, as possibly a late one."
"Leviticus 17:4 <b>bloodguilt:</b> Such slaughtering seems to be equated with the murder of a human being. <b>cut off from amid his kinspeople:</b> Schwartz (1987) understands this as premature death (dying before one’s normally allotted time); Frymer-Kensky (1983) as dying without heirs. Greenstein, on the other hand, shows that it indicates execution, not by human beings, but by some kind of divine agency—perhaps as punishment “for transgressions that escape human detection” (personal communication)."
"Leviticus 17:7 <b>goat-demons:</b> Heb. <i>se’irim,</i> a common word for “hairy (goats),” but here with a clearly pagan ring."
Leviticus 17:8 <b>an offering-up or a slaughter-offering:</b> Probably a merism indicating “any sacrifice” (Schwartz 1987).
Leviticus 17:10 <b>eats any blood:</b> The prohibition against eating blood was unique to Israel in the ancient Near East (Bamberger). It has survived throughout the ages among Jews; those who keep the kosher laws still drain blood out of meat before cooking it (cf. v.13).
Leviticus 17:11 <b>it effects-ransom:</b> Or perhaps “effects-atonement” for taking a life. We have already seen that blood “effects-purgation” for holy objects that have been ritually contaminated (cf. Chap. 16).
Leviticus 17:14 <b>its blood is its life:</b> Heb. difficult.
"Leviticus 18:4 <b>do:</b> Elsewhere (especially in Deuteronomy) I translate Heb. ‘-<i>s-h</i> as “observe“; here, I have retained “do” as a theme word in v. 3–5."
"Leviticus 18:6 <b>kin:</b> Heb. <i>she’er, “</i>flesh, meat,” synonymous with <i>basar,</i> which, however, does not bear the additional meaning of “kin.” Note again the connection between food and sexuality. <b>exposing their “nakedness”:</b> To have sexual contact with them; “nakedness” is probably a euphemism for “genitals.”"
"Leviticus 18:7 <b>The nakedness of your father, and the nakedness of your mother:</b> Perhaps better understood as “the nakedness (reserved for) your father, the nakedness of your mother” (Levine). See Ehrlich’s earlier comments on Deut. 23:1."
Leviticus 18:11 <b>the daughter of your father’s wife etc.:</b> It is not entirely clear what is meant by this case.
Leviticus 18:14 <b>your father’s brother:</b> His “nakedness” is exposed by your sleeping with his wife.
"Leviticus 18:17 <b>insidiousness:</b> Heb. <i>zimma,</i> from a verb meaning “to scheme“; the word is sometimes translated as “wickedness, lewdness.”"
"Leviticus 18:18 <b>And a woman</b> etc.: As in the story of Leah and Rahel, Yaakov’s wives (Gen. 29–31)."
"Leviticus 18:19 <b>during her <i>tum’a</i> of being-apart:</b> Here, unlike in 15:24, the man is not merely ritually polluted until sunset, but sleeping with the woman during her period is regarded as a grave offense that cannot be expiated. This section of Leviticus evidently considers such an act on a par with bestiality and adultery; perhaps it too falls under the category of “forbidden mixtures” (in this case, semen and menstrual blood) that are mentioned in 19:19, or else the mixture is another instance of the life-death boundary being violated (Greenstein 1984a)."
"Leviticus 18:21 <b>… the Molekh:</b> While there is disagreement on the meaning here, it can be shown that this probably does refer to child sacrifice to a deity (Levine). A crucial question is why it intrudes on the list of sexual prohibitions. The answer may lie in the observation that to the Israelite mind, paganism (of which Molekh-worship was likely seen as the most egregious kind) was synonymous with sexual immorality."
"Leviticus 18:22 <b>With a male:</b> The condemnation of homosexuality here may reflect, once again, the issues of separation and categorization which are so prominent in the world-view of Leviticus."
"Leviticus 18:23 <b>perversion:</b> Or “confusion, mingling” (Frymer-Kensky 1983), adding to the strong vocabulary of condemnation in this chapter."
"Leviticus 18:25 <b>vomited out:</b> Once again, a food metaphor!"
"Leviticus 19:4 <b>no-gods:</b> Heb. <i>elilim,</i> a popular play on <i>el/elohim</i> (“God, gods”) and <i>al, “</i>nothing.” Greenstein (personal communication) suggests “little-gods” as another possibility."
Leviticus 19:10 <b>afflicted:</b> Or “wretched.” <b>leave:</b> In the sense of “relinquish.”
Leviticus 19:13 <b>commit-robbery:</b> Possibly an evaluation or explanation of the previous line.
"Leviticus 19:15 <b>equity:</b> Heb. <i>tzedek,</i> often translated “righteousness,” but here, as often, it has the meaning of even-handedness in judgment."
"Leviticus 19:17 <b>rebuke:</b> The emotions are to come into the open, not to lie festering. <b>that you not bear sin:</b> Because you did not alert him to the consequences of his behavior."
"Leviticus 19:18 <b>be-loving to your neighbor:</b> The meaning of this phrase, and the concept, have been widely debated throughout the ages. The translation follows B-R, which emphasizes the personhood of one’s neighbor—and of the sojourner in v.34."
"Leviticus 19:19 <b>two-kinds:</b> That is, a mixture. The prohibition regarding the field entails avoiding mixing different crops on a single field. Mixtures in the Bible seem to be reserved for the divine sphere alone. <b><i>shaatnez:</i></b> Of uncertain origin, this word probably means “of mixed-stuff“; it breaks the rhythm of the law, and so was probably a later addition meant to explain “two-kinds” in reference to clothing (Fishbane 1988)."
Leviticus 19:20 <b>destined … redeemed:</b> Cf. Ex. 21:7–11 (Levine). This does not qualify as biblical adultery.
"Leviticus 19:23 <b>(like) a foreskin:</b> Because it is incomplete or “unfit,” in the biblical view. Here culture is to overcome nature."
Leviticus 19:26 <b>You are not to eat</b> etc.: Vv.26 through 28 deal with “practices associated with idolatry” (Schwartz 1987). <b>divination:</b> This act of predicting the future typically involved reading the shapes of nonmixing liquids in goblets; cf. Gen. 44:5.
"Leviticus 19:27 <b>round off … diminish:</b> These prohibitions are likely related to what immediately follows: they were acts appearing in Canaanite funeral practices. As has often been noted, Leviticus is practically silent about cultic practices concerning the dead—which it wishes to avoid (perhaps out of a desire to avoid worshiping the dead)."
"Leviticus 19:31 <b>favorable-spirits:</b> others, “familiar spirits.”"
Leviticus 19:33 <b>maltreat:</b> Schwartz (1987) understands this as “unfair commerce.”
Leviticus 19:36 <b>weighing-stones:</b> Weights used in calculating amounts of goods.
"Leviticus 20:2 <b>the Molekh:</b> that is, “the [divine] King,” the designation of this particular god."
Leviticus 20:4 <b>hide their eyes:</b> Choose to ignore.
"Leviticus 20:11 <b>the nakedness of his father:</b> For an explanation of this phrase, cf. note to 18:7 above."
"Leviticus 20:18 <b>the two of them are to be cut off:</b> Once again, the serious punishment here exceeds what was mentioned in the earlier context of 15:24, and echoes the treatment in 18:19."
Leviticus 20:20 <b>accursed:</b> Or “in shame” (Ehrlich); sometimes translated “childless” (Buber: “naked-of-children”).
Leviticus 20:23 <b>sending-out:</b> or “driving out” (JPS).
"Leviticus 21:1 <b>For a (dead-)person:</b> That is, the priests are not supposed to come in contact with the dead. Vestiges of this prohibition still survive among religious Jews: the descendant of a priestly family is not supposed <i>to</i> enter a cemetery."
"Leviticus 21:10 <b>the priest that is greater:</b> The “Great Priest,” i.e., the High Priest."
"Leviticus 21:17 <b>a defect:</b> Some physical blemish, as enumerated in v.18ff. <b>come-near … bring-near:</b> Here with the meanings “officiate … sacrifice.”"
"Leviticus 22:11 <b>he may eat:</b> That is, the slave “person.”"
Leviticus 22:20 <b>any-one:</b> Among the animals brought for sacrifice.
"Leviticus 22:23 <b>You may sacrifice:</b> The exception to the rule here concerns a voluntary offering; a defective animal would of course not be acceptable in the case of a <i>hattat,</i> for example (Wenham). The rabbis understood that this animal was not even placed on the altar, but merely sold, with the proceeds going to the sanctuary (Sifra, quoted in Bamberger)."
"Leviticus 22:25 <b>ruin:</b> Others, “mutilation” (Levine)."
"Leviticus 23:2 <b>appointed-times:</b> Festivals. <b>proclamations of holiness:</b> Heb. <i>mikra’ei kodesh;</i> an alternative rendering is “holy convocations,” that is, sacred gatherings."
"Leviticus 23:3 <b>you are not to do:</b> I have translated this as “make” (work) in Ex. 31ff., to underscore a major theme of the book; here, such awkwardness may be avoided."
"Leviticus 23:5 <b>between the setting-times:</b> Between the time that the sun is below the horizon, no longer visible, and total darkness. An idiomatic rendition would be “at twilight.”"
Leviticus 23:8 <b>servile work:</b> What appears to be meant is heavy labor.
"Leviticus 23:10 <b>and you harvest its harvest:</b> The wheat harvest, in the late spring."
"Leviticus 23:11 <b>the morrow of the Sabbath:</b> The precise meaning of this phrase was the subject of lengthy debate among the ancient rabbis. Traditionally in Judaism, seven weeks are counted until this Festival of Weeks (Shavuot), beginning on the day after the start of Passover. Another old interpretation understands the phrase to mean the Sunday after Passover. Fishbane (1988) proposes that an older meaning of <i>shab-bat,</i> namely “full moon,” may be operative here, and that it solves the problems inherent in this passage."
"Leviticus 23:13 <b>poured-offering:</b> Conventionally called a “libation,” this involved the pouring out of wine on the altar, and was common in ancient religions."
Leviticus 23:14 <b>groats:</b> Or “fresh ears” (JPS).
"Leviticus 23:24 <b>a reminder by (horn-)blasting:</b> This became the Jewish festival of Rosh Ha-Shanah, the “head of the (New) Year,” at which a <i>shofar</i> (ram’s horn) is still blown in synagogue. The reason here is probably a combination of proclamation (as before a king) and driving out demons (who, it should be noted, do not like loud noises)."
"Leviticus 23:27 <b>Mark:</b> Following JPS. selves: Heb. <i>nefesh,</i> variously rendered “soul,” “emotions,” and even “gullet” (Milgrom). The <i>nefesh</i> was one’s personhood, one’s essence."
"Leviticus 23:34 <b>Huts:</b> Heb. <i>sukkot,</i> the name of the festival. Others, “booths.”"
"Leviticus 23:36 <b>Restraint:</b> Heb. <i>atzeret,</i> understood by some as “solemn assembly.”"
Leviticus 23:37 <b>each-day’s protocol</b> … : Each sacrifice appropriate for the particular holy day.
"Leviticus 23:39 <b>celebrate-as-pilgrimage … pilgrimage-festival:</b> Heb. <i>tahoggu … hag;</i> cf. the Moslem <i>hajj</i> to Mecca. B-R use “do-a-circle-dance,” which is from another (although similar-sounding) root."
Leviticus 23:40 <b>fruit … branches … boughs … willows:</b> This was understood as the “Four Species” <i>(etrog</i> and three-bound <i>lulav</i>) that are used to this day in the Jewish festival of Sukkot.
Leviticus 23:40 <b>you are to rejoice:</b> That the festival was known as <i>the</i> celebration is seen from the emphasis here on joy.
Leviticus 23:42 <b>stay:</b> Or “dwell.”
Leviticus 24:4 <b>the pure lampstand:</b> Detailed in Ex. 25:31–40.
Leviticus 24:5 <b>two tenth-measures:</b> Of an <i>efa.</i>
Leviticus 24:6 <b>the pure table:</b> Described in Ex. 25:23–30.
Leviticus 24:8 <b>Sabbath day (by) Sabbath day:</b> Jewish tradition reflects this practice by mandating two loaves of bread at every sabbath meal.
Leviticus 24:11 <b>the Name:</b> Of God. <b>Divri:</b> From the root meaning “to speak.”
"Leviticus 24:12 <b>clarify:</b> This is one of four Torah passages where something must be “clarified” by God during the case itself. The other three, which all occur in Numbers (9:6ff., 15:32ff., and 27:1ff.), fit logically in with their surroundings; this text, less so (Bamberger)."
"Leviticus 24:14 <b>the entire community:</b> Not only the witnesses (Greenstein, personal communication)."
Leviticus 24:20 <b>break in place of break</b> etc.: Cf. Ex. 21:23–25 for a parallel passage.
Leviticus 25:5 <b>consecrated-vines:</b> JPS “untrimmed vines.”
Leviticus 25:6 <b>Sabbath-yield:</b> What the land produces on its own in the sabbatical year.
"Leviticus 25:8 <b>Sabbath-cycles:</b> Others, “weeks,” as understood in Deut. 16:9. <b>seven years, seven times:</b> Probably a gloss inserted to explain the word “sabbath[-cycles]“ in the previous phrase (Fishbane 1988)."
"Leviticus 25:9 <b><i>shofar:</i></b> A curved horn, from a ram or other animal."
"Leviticus 25:10 <b>proclaiming freedom … inhabitants:</b> These words were used on the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, in the form: “Proclaim liberty….” <b>holding:</b> Ancestral or “granted” land. <b>Homebringing:</b> So B-R and cognates in Akkadian and Ugaritic. Most interpreters understand the word <i>yovel</i> as “ram,” and by extension its horn, but the root seems to indicate “bringing in” of the sheep through horn blowing (cf. Josh. 6:5 for the full term “horn of homebringing”). It usually appears in English as “Jubilee,” a transcription of the Hebrew word. The Septuagint and several medieval commentators interpret it as “release,” which would make it parallel to the meaning of <i>shemitta</i> in Deut. 15."
Leviticus 25:12 <b>(only) from the field:</b> Only what grows by itself.
Leviticus 25:14 <b>maltreat:</b> By playing with the time-frame of the Homebringing Year (Jubilee).
"Leviticus 25:16 <b>according to the many-years (left):</b> “The more the [remaining] years, the higher you may fix its purchase price” (Levine)."
Leviticus 25:18 <b>in security:</b> A phrase common in reference to covenant making (Levine).
Leviticus 25:19 <b>to being-satisfied:</b> Or “your fill.”
"Leviticus 25:20 <b>Now if you should say:</b> Fishbane (1988) sees this as an answer to the practical problems posed by the sabbatical year. <b>(for) here:</b> Or, “if [we may not sow…].”"
Leviticus 25:21 <b>dispatch:</b> Following Levine.
Leviticus 25:22 <b>sold in-harness:</b> A permanent state of ownership.
"Leviticus 25:23 <b>redemption:</b> Retrieval of the land, so that it stays within the family."
"Leviticus 25:24 <b>redeemer:</b> A close relative who fulfills various obligations to the family (another example, from Deut. 19:6, is avenging the murder of a family member)."
"Leviticus 25:28 <b>go-free:</b> JPS “released.” Literally it means “depart,” a legal term also applying to the release of indentured servants (cf. Ex. 21, where it was rendered “go out”)."
Leviticus 25:29 <b>a walled town:</b> A different case than the above. Land was the primary value in these texts; a walled town contained artisans’ shops but not farmland.
"Leviticus 25:30 <b>be-established:</b> Cf. Gen. 23, where the cave of Makhpela is similarly “established” for Abraham—that is, it becomes his property."
Leviticus 25:31 <b>open-fields of the land:</b> Levine: “arable land.”
"Leviticus 25:35 <b>his hand falters:</b> The same “hand” that “reached far enough” (i.e., had enough financial means) in v.26."
Leviticus 25:36 <b>biting-interest:</b> The Hebrew word <i>neshekh</i> is highly descriptive; we still use “taking a bite out of the budget” in English. <b>profit:</b> Interest added to the principal at the time of payment (Bamberger).
Leviticus 25:39 <b>serve the servitude of a serf:</b> The emphatic repetition warns against putting fellow Israelites into indentured servitude.
Leviticus 25:43 <b>crushing-labor:</b> A powerful allusion to the way the Egyptians oppressed their Israelite slaves in Ex. 1:13–14 (the word is used in the Torah only in these two chapters).
"Leviticus 25:46 <b>over him:</b> That is, over “his brother” of the previous line."
"Leviticus 25:53 <b>year by year:</b> Hired by the year, not as a slave in perpetuity."
Leviticus 25:3 <b>If…:</b> One would have expected “Now if.…”
Leviticus 25:10 <b>the old for the new:</b> There will be so much old grain that it will still be there when the new is harvested.
"Leviticus 25:13 <b>from your being-serfs:</b> An echo of the formula in Ex. 20:2, “from a house of serfs.” <b>upright:</b> Heb. <i>komamiyyut,</i> related to the root producing “established” in vv.1 and 9."
"Leviticus 25:21 <b>opposition:</b> Heb. <i>keri</i>, perhaps from <i>kara</i>, “to encounter” or “come up against.” Ancient translations suggest “in obstinacy.”"
Leviticus 25:25 <b>the covenant:</b> The breaking of the covenant.
Leviticus 25:26 <b>the “staff of bread”:</b> Understanding bread as the substance that “supports” life. Parallel passages occur in ancient Near Eastern treaties.
Leviticus 25:30 <b>high-places … cult-stands:</b> Pagan shrines. <b>idol-clods:</b> A derogatory term for local idols.
Leviticus 25:34 <b>find-acceptance regarding:</b> Levine: “atone for” or “make up for.”
"Leviticus 25:39–40 <b>yes:</b> Here, the repeated word affirms the punishment; in vv.42 and 44, in reply, as it were, it affirms God’s mercy toward Israel."
Leviticus 25:41 <b>bring them:</b> The Septuagint reads <i>ve-heveti</i> (“I will bring them”) as <i>ve-he’evadti</i> (“I will cause them to perish”). <b>foreskinned heart:</b> A strong metaphor for a stubborn heart—a heart with a thick layer that needs removing. <b>find-acceptance regarding their iniquity:</b> Their punishment will be deemed fair payment.
"Leviticus 25:46 <b>These are the laws:</b> The fitting end to Leviticus, which this once undoubtedly was."
"Leviticus 27:2 <b>in your assessed-equivalent of persons:</b> Lit. “in the your-assessment”; this is a grammatically “frozen” form, meaning simply “the assessed-equivalent.”"
Leviticus 27:26 <b>assigned-as-firstborn:</b> Following Levine.
"Leviticus 27:29 <b>Anyone specially-devoted … devoted-to-destruction:</b> Heb. <i>kol herem asher yohoram.</i> The institution of <i>herem</i> involved setting people or property apart for the divine; property was confiscated, and people usually killed (for a full study of the concept, see Stern)."
"Leviticus 27:30 <b>tithe:</b> Cf. the description of this 10 percent tax in Deut. 14:22ff. In our passage, the disposition of tithes is adapted to the thrust of the chapter (Levine)."
Leviticus 27:33 <b>not to search:</b> The condition of the animal does not matter.
"Leviticus 27:34 <b>These are the commandments:</b> Another, briefer attempt at an ending. The phrase “at Mount Sinai” echoes the beginning of Chap. 25, and thus forms a bracketed ending section for the book."
"Numbers 1:1 <b>the Wilderness of Sinai:</b> Until the departure of the Israelites in Chap. 10, they are still in the vicinity of Mount Sinai, the setting of revelation. <b>in the second year:</b> Since the exodus from Egypt (Ex. 12), only thirteen months have passed! By the end of Numbers, the text reaches year forty—yet this will occur over a relatively short stretch of text. Thus, typically, the time frame of the Torah operates."
"Numbers 1:2 <b>Take up the head-count:</b> Others, “Take a census,” “calculate the total.” Although “count” is a theme word in this chapter, the Hebrew for “head-count” here is simply “head,” and is not meant to reflect use of the Hebrew verb <i>pakod.</i> <b>community:</b> Alternatively, “assembly.” The term <i>eda</i> can mean either the ruling council or the entire people (with a focus on the males, in both cases). <b>clans … Fathers’ Houses:</b> Units of social organization in ancient Israel. <b>per capita:</b> The English/Latin expression for “by the head”; Heb. “by their skulls.”"
Numbers 1:3 <b>going out to the armed-forces:</b> The force of this expression seems to be “eligible for military service” <b>count them (for battle):</b> Or “muster” or “array“; more than mere counting is meant.
"Numbers 1:4 <b>let there be:</b> To assist in the counting. <b>a man, a man:</b> One man (for each)."
Numbers 1:16 <b>called-by the community:</b> The “elect.” <b>divisions:</b> Heb. <i>elef</i> may have that alternative meaning (mentioned above) here. <b>exalted-leaders:</b> The Hebrew term for “leader” comes from the verb (<i>naso’</i>) meaning “to lift up.”
"Numbers 1:24 <b>Gad:</b> Why does Gad break into the genealogical list at this point? He is not Jacob’s third son. Milgrom points out that the order of this list depends on the physical arrangement of the tribes around the Tabernacle (cf. Chap. 2), not birth order."
"Numbers 1:46 <b>603,550:</b> The round number 600,000 is the biblically agreed-upon total of military-age adult Israelite males that left Egypt. Cassuto (1967) sees it as an indicator of the centrality of a numbering system based on sixty, as was common in Mesopotamia; others (Greenstein and Marcus 1976) cite the importance of five in Assyrian texts, and thus 600,000 would derive from 5 × 10,000 × 12."
"Numbers 1:50 <b>accountable:</b> Playing on “counted,” the theme of the chapter. Others, “in charge of.” <b>Dwelling:</b> Trad. “Tabernacle,” the portable sanctuary in the wilderness. Its design is described in detail in Ex. 25ff. <b>around the Dwelling:</b> The precise order of the camp is spelled out in the next chapter."
"Numbers 1:51 <b>comes-near … put-to-death:</b> This is the first mention of a central problem in priestly texts: getting too close to the sphere of the holy (Milgrom terms it “encroachment”). Cf. 2:2 below, with the Israelites camping around the Dwelling “at a distance,” and the story of Korah (Chaps. 16f.), where it is a central issue."
"Numbers 1:52 <b>banner-contingent:</b> The word <i>degel</i> originally signifies “banner,” but comes to mean also the military grouping that stands under it."
"Numbers 1:53 <b>keep the charge:</b> Or “discharge the charge.” Levine understands <i>shamor mishmeret</i> as doing the general maintenance duties of the sanctuary. Milgrom, on the other hand, argues strongly for the narrower meaning in Numbers of strictly “guarding the guard duty,” citing ancient Near Eastern parallels for temple guardians."
Numbers 1:54 <b>… thus they did:</b> A standard way of reporting the carrying out of God’s command in priestly texts.
"Numbers 2:9 <b>to march:</b> The Hebrew <i>naso’a</i> means literally “to pull up stakes” (i.e., tent pegs) and hence “to move on“; but the moving in Numbers frequently has a military nuance."
Numbers 2:10 <b>southward:</b> Lit. “on the right hand.”
"Numbers 3:1 <b>these are the begettings:</b> The same formula with which begin a number of genealogical lists in Genesis. Outside of the royal (Davidic) genealogy that appears in Ruth 4:18, the phrase occurs only here beyond Genesis—as if to suggest that Moshe and Aharon are continuers of the Patriarchal traditions. For a detailed discussion of the issue, cf. Olson."
Numbers 3:3 <b>anointed priests:</b> This designation occurs only here in the Torah. <b>mandated:</b> Inducted into office; cf. note to Ex. 28:41.
"Numbers 3:4 <b>Nadav and Avihu died: Cf.</b> Lev. 10. <b>in the living-presence:</b> That is, in the lifetime (of their father); cf. Gen. 11:28 for another example."
"Numbers 3:6 <b>Bring-near:</b> Meaning “qualify” in this context (Milgrom). <b>have-it-stand:</b> Denoting official status. <b>attend upon:</b> Or “assist,” “minister to,” “serve.”"
Numbers 3:8 <b>serving-tasks:</b> Heb. <i>’avoda</i> denotes physical labor in these texts (Milgrom).
"Numbers 3:9 <b>formally-given, given-over:</b> Commissioned."
Numbers 3:12 <b>breacher:</b> Or “loosener.”
Numbers 3:13 <b>at the time:</b> Heb. “on the day” frequently has this connotation. <b>I hallowed … every firstborn:</b> Cf. Ex. 13.
"Numbers 3:16 <b>by order of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Or “direct order”; lit. “at the mouth of Y<small>HWH</small>,” frequently indicating an oracle."
Numbers 3:16–17 <b>commanded. / Now these were:</b> An ancient version reads “commanded Y<small>HWH</small>. / These (are).”
"Numbers 3:26 <b>serving-tasks:</b> Heb. <i>’avoda</i> here specifically includes packing, carrying, and setting up."
"Numbers 3:28 <b>six hundred:</b> The probable reading is “three hundred,” with Hebrew <i>shalosh</i> having been mis-copied as <i>shesh;</i> this squares with the Septuagint reading and gives the correct total in v.39."
"Numbers 3:31 <b>coffer:</b> Trad. “Ark [of the Covenant].” “Ark” in English derives from Latin <i>arcus,</i> meaning a chest or box, as does the Hebrew <i>aron.</i>"
"Numbers 3:39 <b>Moshe and Aharon:</b> The traditional Hebrew text has dots placed above Aharon’s name here, perhaps the equivalent of an asterisk. This denotes some scribal concerns about the text—maybe the inconsistency with 3:14–15, where only Moshe is commanded to count the Levites."
Numbers 3:41 <b>animals:</b> Milgrom has “cattle.”
"Numbers 3:46 <b>redemption-price:</b> This idea survives in a Jewish ceremony, the “Redemption of the Firstborn”: thirty days after the birth of a firstborn male (not in a family descended from priests or Levites), symbolic money is handed over to a person descended from priests, and the money is given to charity."
"Numbers 4:3 <b>thirty… fifty:</b> It is twenty-five to fifty in 8:24. <b>working-force:</b> The same word, <i>tzava,</i> means “armed-forces” in Chap. 1."
"Numbers 4:6 <b>blue-violet:</b> A royal color, made from a dye obtained from a certain mollusk. It is used in various places in the Tabernacle (cf. Ex. 25:4, 26:1, 4) and in the ritual tassels (15:37ff., below). The precise shade is open to debate."
"Numbers 4:7 <b>regular bread:</b> Also known as the “Bread of the Presence,” to be displayed on the table of the Tabernacle regularly. The concept that God requires food was probably an early aspect of Israelite practice that has been retained in the cultic paraphernalia but no longer in actual biblical thinking about God."
Numbers 4:16 <b>implements:</b> Or “utensils.”
"Numbers 4:18 <b>tribe:</b> Heb. <i>shevet,</i> like the other word for “tribe,” <i>matte</i> (cf. 1:4),derives from a word meaning “staff”—so the pun could be accommodated by “stick” and “stock.”"
"Numbers 4:20 <b>see:</b> Beyond touching, even the unauthorized seeing of the sancta could be fatal. These were dismantled and covered only by Aharon and his sons (vv.5–14). for-a-moment: Lit. “as long as it takes to swallow.” Similarly, in German, “moment” is <i>Augenblick,</i> lit. “the blinking of an eye.”"
"Numbers 5:2 <b><i>tzaraat:</i></b> Pronounced “tzah-<i>rah</i>-aht.” Apparently a category of skin disease, which rendered a person temporarily “polluted.” Such a person was a danger to the sanctuary (too much pollution would drive God away, as it were), and had to withdraw from the camp boundaries for a time, like the others mentioned in this chapter (cf. Lev. 13–14 for details). <b>flow:</b> Such as semen or menstrual blood. <b>by a (dead) person:</b> Physical contact with a corpse."
"Numbers 5:6 <b>breaking-faith:</b> So JPS. In Lev. 5:15ff. the term refers to sacrilege against holy objects in the sanctuary. Here it encompasses wrongdoing against persons, which is seen as rebellion against God. Cf. also v.12 below."
Numbers 5:7 <b>its fifth:</b> A 20 percent penalty.
Numbers 5:8 <b>no redeemer:</b> No relative who can pay the fine. <b>ram of purgation:</b> The first step in restitution is to provide for the ritual purification of the sinner via sacrifice.
Numbers 5:9–10 <b>shall be his:</b> The priest’s.
"Numbers 5:14 <b>rush:</b> Others, “fit.” <b>jealousy:</b> Or “suspicion,” “zealous indignation” (Fishbane 1974)."
"Numbers 5:15 <b>near-offering:</b> Cf. Lev. 1–5 for a description of this and other sacrifices (grain-gift in this verse, <i>hattat-</i>offering and offering-up in 6:11, and <i>asham</i>-offering in 6:12). <b>barley:</b> The cheapest grain, and hence available even to the poor. <b>reminding:</b> God."
"Numbers 5:18 <b>Water of Bitterness Bringing the Bane:</b> Hebrew difficult. Nevertheless, it is clear (and significant) that the formula is alliterative and thus has a ritual, almost magical ring: <i>mei ha-marim ha-me’arrarim.</i> Another possible rendering, after an interpretation of Frymer-Kensky (1984) and others, is “Waters of Instruction, of Spell-Induction.”"
"Numbers 5:21 <b>oath curse:</b> or “threat,” the part of the oath threatening punishment. <b>thigh fall … belly flood:</b> While the precise biological process is not clear (the suggestions vary from miscarriage to a prolapsed uterus), sterility is one possible meaning. “Thigh” in the Bible is often a euphemism for genitals (e.g., Gen. 24:2). It is also possible that the woman is pregnant and that the intention is to abort the fetus, since if the husband’s suspicions of adultery are founded, the child will be illegitimate and hence a threat to the purity of Israel (Levine)."
"Numbers 5:22 <b>Amen!:</b> Lit. “established,” “firm” (i.e., true)."
"Numbers 5:23 <b>blot:</b> Following Haran; others, “rub.”"
"Numbers 5:29 <b>Instruction:</b> Heb. <i>Tora</i> (Torah), meaning “priestly regulation.” From such <i>torot</i> evolved the name for longer sections, and eventually for the Five Books of Moses."
"Numbers 5:31 <b>bear her iniquity:</b> So the punishment, or the removal of iniquity, is left up to God (cf. Schwartz 1994)."
"Numbers 6:2 <b>Consecrated-One:</b> Or “Separate-One,” “Dedicated-One.”"
Numbers 6:3 <b>any liquid of grapes:</b> So strict is the prohibition of alcohol here that no chances are taken.
"Numbers 6:7 <b>make-oneself-<i>tamei</i>:</b> Others, “render himself impure.”"
"Numbers 6:11 <b>sacrifice:</b> Lit. “do,” “perform” (as sacrifice). <b>became-contaminated:</b> Alternatively (or simultaneously), “incurred-sin.”"
Numbers 6:12 <b>fallen-away:</b> Null and void.
Numbers 6:14 <b>wholly-sound:</b> Unblemished and hence fit for sacrifice to God. <b><i>shalom</i>-offering:</b> Cf. Lev. 3.
"Numbers 6:15 <b><i>matzot:</i></b> Plural of <i>matza,</i> unleavened bread."
Numbers 6:21 <b>in addition to:</b> Or “in excess of.”
"Numbers 6:27 <b>put my name:</b> The meaning is unclear; is it abstract or concrete, in which case an amulet might have been meant?"
Numbers 7:1 <b>finished:</b> Or “Had finished.”
Numbers 7:12 <b>Nahshon:</b> The brother-in-law of Aharon (cf. Ex. 6:23).
Numbers 7:13 <b>bowl:</b> Heb. <i>mizrak;</i> used for holding blood that was to be dashed <i>(zarok)</i> against the altar.
Numbers 7:42 <b>De’uel:</b> Spelled <i>Re’uel</i> in 2:14.
"Numbers 7:89 <b>Purgation-Cover:</b> The cover of the Coffer (Ark), which was seen as the “footstool” of God in the manner of ancient Near Eastern kings. <b>winged-sphinxes:</b> Golden images of mythical creatures that served to flank God’s throne, and especially, as our text indicates, as the locus for divine communication with Moshe."
"Numbers 8:2 <b>draw up:</b> Others, “kindle.” <b>toward the front:</b> More specifically, toward the area in front."
Numbers 8:4 <b>stem … petals:</b> In keeping with the nature of the lampstand’s probable origin as a symbolic tree; cf. Ex. 25:31–35.
"Numbers 8:11 <b>elevate … elevation-offering:</b> An act of dedicating an offering to God. Also possible in this context is “present … presentation-offering.” Trad, “wave-offering,” which, as Milgrom shows, is probably incorrect. The usage of the expression to refer to the Levites is not, of course, meant literally as a sacrificial offering."
Numbers 8:19 <b>effect-ransom:</b> For the lives of Israelite firstborn.
Numbers 8:26 <b>keep the maintenance-duty:</b> As opposed to heavy physical labor.
"Numbers 9:1 <b>spoke:</b> Milgrom reads as “had spoken,” given that this chapter is set in time before the opening of the book. But the chronology here betrays an editorial hand; this chapter could not be the opening of the book for structural reasons (the census is the backbone of the book, as Olson has suggested)."
"Numbers 9:3 <b>between the setting-times:</b> Between sunset and total darkness; twilight. <b>according to all its laws … regulations:</b> This phrase, adapted in a short medieval poem, is still recited by Jews at the end of the Passover meal."
Numbers 9:12 <b>a bone is not to be broken:</b> So as not to mar its perfection; cf. Ex. 12:46.
Numbers 9:14 <b>sojourner:</b> A foreigner temporarily resident in Israel.
"Numbers 9:19 <b>keep the charge:</b> Milgrom, “guard the guard duty.”"
"Numbers 10:8 <b>a law:</b> That is, the priests will function as an institution in their capacity as trumpet-blowers."
"Numbers 10:14 <b>first:</b> This and other number designations in this passage refer to position, not time."
"Numbers 10:29 <b>Hovav:</b> There is some confusion about the name. One tradition holds that he is identical to Yitro in Ex. 2:18f.; yet there, Re’uel is Moshe’s father-in-law, while here he is a generation removed."
"Numbers 10:31 <b>you shall be for us as eyes:</b> More idiomatically, “you shall serve as our eyes.”"
"Numbers 10:34 <b>the cloud of Y<small>HWH</small> was over them by day:</b> The phraseology is almost identical to the ending of the book of Exodus (40:38)—so everything in between, all of Leviticus and Num. 1–10, is in a sense bracketed."
"Numbers 10:36 <b>divisions:</b> Or alternatively, “thousands.”"
"Numbers 11:4 <b>gathered-riffraff:</b> Heb. <i>asafsuf,</i> from the verb that means “to gather.” Perhaps parallel to the ragtag “mixed multitude” <i>(erev rav)</i> of Ex. 12:38. So the rebellion over food starts among the fringes of the community."
"Numbers 11:6 <b><i>mahn:</i></b> The “manna,” a substance found on plants that God had provided for their sustenance since Ex. 16."
Numbers 11:7 <b>aspect:</b> Or “color.” <b>bdellium:</b> A certain semiclear resin or sap.
Numbers 11:8 <b>crusher:</b> A mortar.
"Numbers 11:10 <b>by their clans:</b> Contrasting with the sacred order of lists and censuses early in the book, this time it is the rebellious weeping of the people that is somehow orderly!"
"Numbers 11:16 <b>seventy:</b> An inclusive number, indicating completeness or perfection. <b>stationing:</b> A verb often used before an appearance of God (Milgrom)."
"Numbers 11:18 <b>Hallow yourselves:</b> Ritually, as before Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:11,14–15)."
Numbers 11:20 <b>something-disgusting:</b> Or “something-nauseating.”
"Numbers 11:22 <b>Find-them-sufficient:</b> Lit. “overtake,” “reach” them."
"Numbers 11:23 <b>Is the arm of Y<small>HWH</small> (too) short:</b> After all, this is the God of the “outstretched arm” (Ex. 6:6)!"
"Numbers 11:25 <b>acted-like-prophets:</b> The <i>hitpa’el</i> form of Heb. <i>n-b-’</i>, as opposed to the <i>pi’el</i> form, meaning “to prophesy” (speak in God’s name) (Greenberg 1983). “Mantic” or “ecstatic” prophecy was known all over the ancient world. The prophet would go into a trance, or roll about, or shriek (or a combination of these); such behavior was considered inspired by the gods. While the famous prophets of the Bible, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, are largely (but not exclusively) men of the word, who report God’s messages to the people, they retain in their actions some of the characteristics of the enthusiastic kind of prophecy. <b>but did not continue:</b> But the Hebrew consonants could also be read “and did not stop!”"
Numbers 11:26 <b>Eldad … Meidad:</b> The names are obviously intended to rhyme; they may both indicate something like “beloved of God.”
Numbers 11:28 <b>Yehoshua:</b> Trad. English “Joshua.”
Numbers 11:29 <b>who would give:</b> “Would that” or “if only.”
"Numbers 11:31 <b>rush-of-wind:</b> Heb. <i>ruah</i> can mean both “spirit” and “wind,” as is clear from this chapter. Buber wrote extensively on this concept (1994). <b>two cubits:</b> Roughly a yard (or a meter)."
"Numbers 11:32 <b>spread them out:</b> In order to dry them. One ancient version has Heb. <i>sh-h-t</i>, “slew” (them) for <i>sh-t-h</i>, which appears in standard texts. <b><i>homers:</i></b> A <i>homer</i> was a large measure of volume, equal to about thirty gallons in one estimate."
"Numbers 12:1 <b>Cushite:</b> Either an Ethiopian, which some interpretive traditions hold to, and which would be clearly a racial slur, or a Midyanite. The first would indicate another wife of Moshe; the second, the Tzippora of Ex. 2."
"Numbers 12:3 <b>humble:</b> And not power-hungry. This description helps to prepare us for the confrontation with Korah in Chap. 16, where the rebels accuse Moshe of lording it over them. <b>earth:</b> Elsewhere rendered “soil.”"
"Numbers 12:6 <b>among-you-a-prophet:</b> The Hebrew is awkward, but solvable as an unusual syntactic form (Freedman 1972)."
"Numbers 12:13 <b>O God, pray, heal her, pray!:</b> Heb. <i>el na refa na la;</i> I could not find a way to reflect the sound of the Hebrew."
"Numbers 12:14 <b>If her father spat:</b> She cannot in any event be readmitted to the camp before seven days have passed. <b>be gathered-back:</b> Be allowed back into the holy camp. “Be readmitted” would have been more palatable, but I have retained “gathered” as a theme word prominent in the chapter."
Numbers 13:18 <b>see:</b> Or “survey.”
"Numbers 13:20 <b>trees, or not:</b> This phrase breaks the string of opposites in Moshe’s instructions, thus rhetorically ending it. <b>the days of the first ripe-grapes:</b> The reason for this intrusion is explained in v.23."
"Numbers 13:22 <b>Anakites:</b> Primeval giants, from whom the tall-seeming Canaanites were reputed to be descended. <b>Hevron:</b> Trad. English “Hebron.” <b>Tzo’an:</b> Tanis, the capital of Egypt at the time of the Israelite monarchy (tenth century <small>B.C.E.</small> and later)."
"Numbers 13:23 <b>on a bar (held) by two:</b> A striking image for the richness of the land, this symbol is today the logo of the Israeli Ministry of Tourism."
Numbers 13:24 <b>Wadi:</b> A riverbed that is usually dry in summer; a gorge.
Numbers 14:3 <b>little-ones:</b> From a Hebrew root that means “to take little steps”; a direct English equivalent might be “toddlers.”
"Numbers 14:4 <b>Let us head back:</b> So Ehrlich, JPS. Others, “Let us choose a head” (i.e., a new leader)."
"Numbers 14:5 <b>the entire assembled community</b> etc.: A unique phrase, perhaps indicating an emergency session of the whole people (Magonet)."
Numbers 14:9 <b>protector:</b> Lit. “shade” or “shadow”; the reference is probably to pagan gods.
"Numbers 14:13 <b>hear (about it):</b> That is, about the destruction of Israel by God."
Numbers 14:14 <b>eye to eye:</b> The equivalent of English “face to face.”
"Numbers 14:17 <b>as you have spoken:</b> Moshe cites the characterization of God in the Golden Calf story, which employs almost identical words (Ex. 34:6–7); he also argues in terms similar to the way he did there (Ex. 32:11ff.)."
Numbers 14:19 <b>pray grant-pardon</b> etc.: This verse is used in the Jewish liturgy of the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).
Numbers 14:22 <b>ten times:</b> Equivalent to “many times” in biblical parlance.
Numbers 14:23 <b>If they should see … :</b> Implied is an ending such as “I will destroy them.”
"Numbers 14:24 <b>another spirit:</b> In this case, courage. <b>followed-me-fully:</b> As Weinfeld (1991) notes, this is semantically equivalent to Avraham’s “being-whole(-hearted)” in Gen. 17:1. Both phrases are used in connection with covenant loyalty."
"Numbers 14:28 <b>if not … :</b> A rhetorical form meaning “I will do the following ….” Similarly, v.30 suggests that “none of you shall enter the land.”"
Numbers 14:29 <b>counted (for battle) … number:</b> The census-taking at the opening of the book now turns into a census of death.
Numbers 14:34 <b>hostility:</b> Or “constraining/frustrating (you).”
"Numbers 14:44 <b>went up recklessly:</b> Others, “stormed.”"
"Numbers 15:3 <b>and sacrifice a fire-offering</b> etc.: In Anderson’s assessment, this part of the chapter returns to the function of Lev. 1–7: a general statement about sacrificial procedure (in this case, the addition of the grain-gift and the poured-offering). <b>a soothing savor:</b> A description attached to many sacrifices; cf. Lev. 1:9."
Numbers 15:4 <b>bringing-near:</b> A verb used sometimes (especially in Leviticus) with the technical meaning “to offer/sacrifice.”
"Numbers 15:22 <b>err,/not doing:</b> That is, sin unwittingly. <b>these commandments:</b> Some, such as Milgrom, take this to refer to the two previous sections in the chapter; however, the wording, especially in v.23, is quite broad, and may constitute a new “teaching” about observance of the law (although not a law in and of itself) (Toeg, quoted in Fishbane 1988)."
Numbers 15:26 <b>So there shall be</b> etc.: Another verse that has found its way into the Yom Kippur prayers.
Numbers 15:30 <b>with a high hand:</b> Defiantly.
"Numbers 15:31 <b>his iniquity is on him:</b> That is, he must carry it around until it is “lifted off” him."
Numbers 15:34 <b>… clarified:</b> Or “there was no ruling [on how to deal with him]” (Fishbane 1988).
"Numbers 16:1 <b>there betook-himself:</b> This is a difficult text, since “take” in Hebrew (<i>lakoah</i>) usually requires a direct object. Commentators have proposed that Korah “took” the men mentioned, but the phrase is still not clear. <b>Pelet:</b> The Septuagint reads “Pallu,” in line with the genealogy presented in 26:5."
"Numbers 16:3 <b>They assembled … and said:</b> Strangely, Korah himself is never portrayed in the text as uttering a single word on his own—an interesting model for a rebel. <b>the entirety of them:</b> All of them. <b>exalt yourselves:</b> Or “act-as-leaders.”"
Numbers 16:6 <b>(fire-)pans:</b> For offering incense—a priestly task.
Numbers 16:7 <b>whom Y<small>HWH</small> chooses:</b> By accepting his offering.
Numbers 16:12 <b>We will not go up:</b> An ironic twist on what the entire people would not do in Chap. 13: “go up” to conquer the Promised Land.
"Numbers 16:13 <b>play-the-prince:</b> Here, near the end of Moshe’s life, an old canard returns. He had been accused at the outset of his career (in his first attempt to save the Israelites in Ex. 2:14) of “playing-the-prince” by intervening in a quarrel."
"Numbers 16:14 <b>not to a land</b> etc.: Now the rebels blame Moshe for the people’s failure in the incident of the spies. <b>The eyes … gouge out:</b> Commentators point out that this phrase is the equivalent, albeit a grisly one, of “pulling the wool over their eyes” or the like."
Numbers 16:15 <b>turn your face toward:</b> Look upon favorably.
"Numbers 16:19 <b>Glory:</b> Or “aura,” the visible manifestation of God in the cloud accompanying the Israelites and resident upon the Dwelling."
"Numbers 16:27 <b>dwellings:</b> The Hebrew word is, oddly, in the singular."
"Numbers 16:28 <b>heart:</b> I.e., mind."
"Numbers 16:30 <b>Sheol:</b> The underworld, which in the Bible is a non-descript, gray place, rather like the Greeks’ Hades—and not the later Heaven and Hell of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam."
Numbers 16:32 <b>their households:</b> A man’s family and property were considered an extension of his personality.
"Numbers 16:33 <b>So they went down … alive:</b> A famous later use of this motif, filtered through medieval Christian perspective, occurs in the great penultimate scene of Mozart’s opera <i>Don Giovanni</i>."
"Numbers 16:35 <b>fire … consumed:</b> Aharon’s sons Nadav and Avihu, who offered up “outside fire,” were similarly punished in Lev. 10."
Numbers 17:2 <b>become-holy:</b> And cannot be used for ordinary purposes.
"Numbers 17:11 <b>go quickly</b> etc.: Unable any more to respond to God’s “that I may consume them in an instant” (v.10) as he had in 16:21—by arguing with and pacifying God—Moshe resorts to priestly measures: Aharon must use incense to attempt obtaining forgiveness for the people. <b>effect-appeasement:</b> So Milgrom, citing a parallel use of incense in an Egyptian text."
"Numbers 17:14 <b>14,700:</b> Another multiple of the “perfect” number seven."
Numbers 17:17 <b>staff:</b> A good example of the pun inherent in Heb. <i>matte</i> (cf. note to 4:18).
Numbers 17:19 <b>Testimony:</b> Elliptical for “Coffer of Testimony.”
"Numbers 17:23 <b>almonds:</b> In Israel, almond trees are known for their dramatic blossoming in winter, before all other trees."
Numbers 17:24 <b>saw:</b> In the sense of “found” or “selected.”
"Numbers 18:1 <b>bear:</b> That is, upon yourselves, until it is eliminated. <b>iniquity (pertaining to) the Holy-Area:</b> That is, pollution attaching to the sanctuary, which is the burden of the priests."
"Numbers 18:2 <b>to be-joined:</b> Heb. <i>ve-yillavu</i>, a play on the name “Levi.”"
"Numbers 18:16 <b>in your assessment:</b> Lit. “in the your-assessment.” A grammatically “frozen” form, this functionally means “by assessment.”"
Numbers 18:19 <b>“covenant of salt”:</b> Plaut suggests that this means “an eternal covenant”; salt prevents decay.
Numbers 18:29 <b>choice-parts:</b> Lit. “fat”; English “cream [of the crop]” carries the same connotation.
"Numbers 19:2 <b>red:</b> Possibly indicating “brownish,” but the sound “red” is important here as a reminder of blood, a major purifying agent in the Israelite cult (especially in the <i>hattat</i> sacrifice; cf. Lev. 4:5–7) and a neutralizer of death, given its symbolic character as the life. <b>not yet yielded to a yoke:</b> Lit. “no yoke has gone upon it” (Heb. <i>lo ’ala ’aleha ’ol</i>); but the alliteration is a characteristic feature of this text."
Numbers 19:6 <b>cedar … hyssop … scarlet:</b> All suggesting the color (and efficacy) of blood.
"Numbers 19:7 <b><i>tamei:</i></b> As in previous texts, ritually impure."
Numbers 19:12 <b>with it:</b> With the ashes.
"Numbers 19:15 <b>no cover:</b> Apparently, a cover would prevent the transmission of impurity."
"Numbers 19:16 <b>human bones … a grave:</b> In antiquity, Jews usually buried their dead outside the city limits, to avoid ritual pollution of the public sector."
"Numbers 20:1 <b>Wilderness of Tzyn:</b> In Ex. 17, the parallel story, the location is the “Wilderness of Syn” (v.1). <b>the first New-Moon:</b> Of the final year of wandering."
"Numbers 20:2 <b>assembled against:</b> This verb, which occurs two more times in the narrative (vv.8 and 10), was also used twice in the Korah rebellion (16:3, 19)."
"Numbers 20:5 <b>a place of seeds</b> etc.: Another idealized remembering of Egypt, as in 11:5."
"Numbers 20:8 <b>boulder:</b> Heb. <i>sela’;</i> Ex. 17:6 has <i>tzur</i>, “rock.”"
"Numbers 20:10 <b>said to them:</b> It is to them, rather to the boulder, that Moshe speaks."
"Numbers 20:12–13 <b>treat-me-as-holy … hallowed:</b> Heb. root <i>k-d-sh</i>, echoing the name of the place, Kadesh."
"Numbers 20:17 <b>the King’s Road:</b> This major ancient road, paved in later (Roman) times, went from present-day Eilat on the Red Sea north through the part of the Rift Valley that is east of the Dead Sea, to present-day Amman, and then on to Damascus."
"Numbers 20:22 <b>Hill’s Hill:</b> Others, “Mount Hor”; Heb. <i>hor ha-har</i>."
"Numbers 20:26 <b>gathered:</b> To his ancestors; meant literally, as the eventual remains—the bones—would be placed together with those of the ancestors in the family burial pit."
"Numbers 20:29 <b>thirty days:</b> Equal to the mourning period for Moshe, and a good indication of Aharon’s stature."
Numbers 21:2 <b>devote … (to destruction):</b> The confiscation of people or property to God; the noun is <i>herem</i> (like the Arabic-derived English word “harem”).
"Numbers 21:6 <b>vipers:</b> Heb. <i>nehashim</i>, “snakes,” altered here in English because of the rhyming “viper of copper” (<i>nehash nehoshet</i>) in v.9 below. <b>burning-snakes:</b> Heb. obscure; perhaps linking up with the body’s reaction to the bite of this particular snake."
Numbers 21:9 <b>copper:</b> Elsewhere translated as “bronze.”
"Numbers 21:14 <b>the Book of the Wars of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> An ancient text that has been lost to us, like a number of other works alluded to in the Bible (e.g., “The Book of Yashar” mentioned in Josh. 10:13)."
Numbers 21:20 <b>Pisga:</b> The future site of Moshe’s death.
"Numbers 21:21 <b>Sihon:</b> The victories over him and Og king of Bashan (vv.33–35) are mentioned a number of times in later books such as Deuteronomy, Joshua, and Judges; their proximity to the Promised Land must have made them and their fate of great interest to traditional poets/singers."
"Numbers 21:24 <b>strong:</b> This could also be read as a place-name, Az, or as another location, [Y]az[er] (cf. v.32)."
Numbers 21:27 <b>parable-makers:</b> Or “bards.”
Numbers 21:29 <b>Kemosh:</b> The chief god of the Moabites (cf. I Kings 11).
"Numbers 21:33 <b>Og:</b> Often paired with Sihon in later retellings of the wilderness experience (e.g., Josh. 2:10, 9:10)."
"Numbers 22:1 <b>Jordan-Jericho:</b> The sense is clearly “on the east side of the Jordan River, opposite Jericho.”"
Numbers 22:2 <b>Tzippor:</b> The name means “bird.”
"Numbers 22:5 <b>the River:</b> The Euphrates. <b>sons of his kinspeople:</b> Some read <i>ammon</i>, “Ammon,” for <i>ammo</i>, “his kins-people.” <b>covers the aspect of the land:</b> Like locusts; the phrase was used to describe the eighth plague in Ex. 10:5."
Numbers 22:6 <b>too mighty (in number):</b> Identical to Pharaoh’s reaction to the Israelites in Ex. 1:9.
"Numbers 22:7 <b>tokens-of-augury:</b> Either payment for the cursing, or objects used in the act."
Numbers 22:18 <b>small or great:</b> A merism for “anything at all.”
"Numbers 22:22 <b>adversary:</b> Heb. <i>satan;</i> in later Jewish and Christian texts, of course, it was used as a proper name (and personality) “Satan.”"
Numbers 22:23 <b>And the she-ass saw Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger:</b> The motif of an animal who is able to see supernatural beings is widespread in world folklore (cf. Gaster 1969).
Numbers 22:24 <b>here … there:</b> On either side.
Numbers 22:29 <b>been capricious with:</b> As God “was capricious with” Egypt in Ex. 10:2.
Numbers 22:31 <b>brow:</b> Lit. “nostrils.”
Numbers 22:32 <b>rushed out:</b> Heb. unclear.
Numbers 22:33 <b>by now:</b> Echoing Bil’am’s words to the she-ass in v.29.
"Numbers 22:36 <b>Ir:</b> Others, “Ar.”"
Numbers 22:38 <b>able:</b> As if in reply to Balak’s “not able” in the previous verse.
"Numbers 22:41 <b>Heights of Baal:</b> Perhaps a shrine, and thus an appropriate location for pronouncing the curse. <b>see … the edge:</b> As Milgrom notes, the one who curses must be able to see his victim in order for the curse to work."
Numbers 23:1 <b>seven:</b> The use of the perfect number means that the curse should be effective.
"Numbers 23:3 <b>perhaps … encounter:</b> Note the chance aspect of Bil’am’s contact with God. <b>by-himself:</b> Heb. <i>shefi</i>, whose meaning is not clear; others, “to the height.”"
Numbers 23:5 <b>words:</b> Lit. “a [divine] word.”
"Numbers 23:10 <b>dust-clouds:</b> Heb. difficult, possibly meaning “(even) a fourth of.”"
"Numbers 23:13 <b>to another place:</b> Perhaps a different approach, literally, will be successful. Such change of venue also occurs in the nonbiblical Deir ‘Alla traditions about Bil’am (Moore)."
"Numbers 23:14 <b>Watchmen:</b> Gaster (1969), on the basis of Semitic parallels, suggests that Heb. <i>tzofim</i> here means “astrological observers.”"
Numbers 23:19 <b>retract:</b> Or “change his mind.”
Numbers 23:21 <b>fanfare:</b> A word used to describe the “trilling” of the marching trumpets in Chap. 10.
Numbers 23:22 <b>the horns of the wild-ox:</b> Greenstein suggests a parallel with Baal’s horned helmet in Ugaritic texts (personal communication).
"Numbers 23:23 <b>at once:</b> Buber (1988) understands this as “in time,” that is, in the real world, not through magic. <b>what God intends:</b> The King James Version reads “what hath God wrought”—in that form, the first message Samuel F. B. Morse sent by his new invention, the telegraph, in 1844."
"Numbers 24:1 <b>saw:</b> Finally, he “sees” clearly and knows that he cannot expect to curse the people. Cf. also vv.2–4 for the theme of seeing."
"Numbers 24:2 <b>by their tribes:</b> That is, the entire camp. <b>spirit of God:</b> Thus we know that what follows is truly from God."

"Numbers 24:16 <b>the Most-High:</b> Another name for God, found in Gen. 14:18–20."
"Numbers 24:17 <b>star … meteor:</b> The verse is difficult. It could also be rendered “There marches forth an army … there arises a tribe,” which likewise makes sense in the context. Rabbinic interpreters took the verse messianically; Rabbi Akiva understood “star,” <i>kokhav</i>, as a reference to his contemporary Simon Bar Kosiba, the leader of a major Jewish rebellion against Rome (132 <small>C.E.</small>), renaming him Bar Kokhba, “Son of a Star.” <b>pate … crown:</b> “Crown” (reading <i>kodkod</i> for <i>karkar</i>) in the sense of “head.” An alternate translation is “borderland … land.”"

Numbers 25:1 <b>to whore:</b> The common biblical term not only for sexual immorality but for idolatry as well.
"Numbers 25:3 <b>yoked:</b> A strong image of attachment, in a story of strong images. <b>Baal:</b> A major Canaanite god (of thunder and fertility) the worship of whom was considered the greatest danger to the Israelite people by the Prophets (cf. the clash between Elijah and the prophets of Baal in I Kings 17f.)."
"Numbers 25:6 <b>brought-near:</b> The reason is not specified; but he certainly is not hiding his deed. <b>before the eyes:</b> In broad daylight, as it were."
"Numbers 25:7 <b>Pin’has:</b> Trad. English “Phineas,” a name of Egyptian origin, like Moshe and Aharon."
Numbers 25:8 <b>private-chamber … private-parts:</b> Suggested by Plaut; Heb. <i>el ha-kubba … el kavota</i>. Later Jewish tradition was disturbed by the vigilante nature of Pin’has’s action.

"Numbers 26:9 <b>struggled:</b> A rather physical verb, especially as applied to God on the next line!"
"Numbers 26:11 <b>the sons of Korah did not die:</b> This despite the statement in 16:32 that the earth swallowed up Korah “and all his household.” The “Sons of Korah” were later renowned for their prowess as Temple singers, and fully eleven Psalms bear a superscription with their name."
"Numbers 26:17 <b>Arod:</b> Ancient versions, following Gen. 46:16, read “Arodi.”"
Numbers 26:19 <b>Er and Onan died:</b> Because they did not carry on their late brother’s line by fathering a son with his widow; cf. Gen. 38:6–10.

"Numbers 26:59 <b>who bore her:</b> The Hebrew is awkward, because the mother’s name apparently has been omitted."
Numbers 27:1 <b>came-near:</b> Here with the connotation of “came before the authorities.” <b>Mahla</b> etc.: Several of these names are the names of known towns.
Numbers 27:3 <b>for his own sin:</b> As distinct from the sin of taking part in the Korah rebellion.
Numbers 27:4 <b>holding:</b> An ancestral plot of land.

"Numbers 28:9 <b>And on the day of the Sabbath:</b> This and the following passages became part of the traditional Jewish liturgy (in the <i>Musaf</i>, “Additional” Service) for Sabbath and festivals."
Numbers 28:10 <b>its Sabbath:</b> Probably meaning “its particular Sabbath.”
"Numbers 28:11 <b>heads of your New-Moons:</b> Milgrom notes that the number of animals sacrificed here equals that for major festivals, indicating the biblical importance of the New Moon."
"Numbers 28:18 <b>a proclamation of holiness:</b> Others, “a holy convocation.” <b>servile work:</b> Heavy labor. Later Jewish tradition understood this to mean that certain “work,” like cooking, is in fact permitted."
"Numbers 29:1 <b>a day of (horn-)blasts:</b> Observed by Jews as Rosh Ha-Shanah, the “Head of the Year” (New Year) in the fall, and accompanied in synagogue by blasts on the <i>shofar</i>."

"Numbers 31:23 <b>However:</b> Qualifying Chap. 19 (Milgrom). <b>fire … water:</b> Two of the great purifiers in Israelite ritual; the third, and most potent, is blood."

"Numbers 35:4 <b>the wall:</b> That is, its outer surface (Milgrom). <b>a thousand cubits:</b> About 1500 yards, or somewhat less than a mile."
Numbers 35:5 <b>two thousand by the cubit:</b> This became the basis in later Jewish law for the maximum distance one could travel on the Sabbath (cf. Plaut for discussion).

"Numbers 35:17 <b>in hand:</b> That is, large enough to fit in the hand."
"Numbers 35:19 <b>meeting:</b> Or “coming across,” “encountering.”"
Numbers 35:25 <b>Great Priest:</b> High Priest.

Deuteronomy 1:4 <b>Sihon … Og:</b> Two kings vanquished by the Israelites in their march east and northeast of the Dead Sea (Num. 21).
"Deuteronomy 1:5 <b>Instruction:</b> In Leviticus, this term (<i>tora</i>) referred to a priestly rule or ritual; here, however, it has a broader significance, and seems to refer to a good part of the book of Deuteronomy. Only later does it come to mean The Five Books of Moses."
"Deuteronomy 1:7 <b>Hill-Country:</b> The mountainous backbone running north to south in the center of the country, geographically including Shechem and Jerusalem. <b>the Plains:</b> The Jordan Valley. <b>Lowlands:</b> The area west of the hill-country and east of the coastal plain. <b>Negev:</b> The southern region (south of Beersheba). <b>the Lebanon:</b> Usually including the definite article in the Bible, as here, this is approximately the region of modern Lebanon, a mountain range extending about 100 miles north of the land of Israel."

"Deuteronomy 1:19 <b>great and awe-inspiring:</b> Or “great and fearsome.” The phrase is used of the wilderness again in 8:15 but, interestingly, also of God in 7:21 and 10:17."
Deuteronomy 1:21 <b>given before you:</b> This oft-used phrase is equivalent to “laid at your feet.”
"Deuteronomy 1:22 <b>Then you came-near:</b> In Num. 13, the incentive for sending the spies comes from God. Here is yet another indication of the more human-oriented viewpoint of Deuteronomy."
"Deuteronomy 1:25 <b>they said: / Good:</b> In contrast to the Num. 13 narrative, where the majority report continues with an expression of the Israelites’ considerable fears about the inhabitants of the land."
"Deuteronomy 1:28 <b>Our brothers:</b> The spies. <b>Children of the Anakites:</b> The Anakites (the “Long-Necked”) were seen as original inhabitants of Canaan but, more importantly, were regarded as giants, as human ancestors often were in antiquity. See, similarly, the fantastic ages of the primordial figures in Gen. 5."
"Deuteronomy 1:29 <b>shake-in-fear … be afraid:</b> Deuteronomy has a large vocabulary of words connoting “fear”—oscillating between shoring up the Israelites’ military courage (as here) and warning them about the consequences of abandoning God (as, for instance, in 28:66)."
Deuteronomy 1:33 <b>who goes before you:</b> An expression connoting military leadership. <b>fire … cloud:</b> Cf. Ex. 13:21–22.
Deuteronomy 1:34 <b>voice:</b> Or “sound.”
Deuteronomy 1:35 <b>If they should get-to-see … !:</b> The ellipsis suggesting “No possibility!” as an answer.
Deuteronomy 1:36 <b>Calev:</b> Trad. English “Caleb.” Cf. Num. 13.30; he and Yehoshua (trad. English “Joshua”) are the only spies to encourage the people to undertake the conquest of Canaan. Notable in this text is the omission of Yehoshua (Plaut).
"Deuteronomy 1:39 <b>little-ones:</b> Heb. <i>taf</i>, lit. “toddlers.”"
Deuteronomy 1:40 <b>Reed Sea:</b> The site of the drowning of the Egyptian army in Ex. 14; the precise location still eludes scholars.
"Deuteronomy 1:43 <b>brazenly:</b> The root (here in the form <i>va-tahinu</i>) occurs only once in the Bible, and its derivation and meaning are uncertain; I concur with JPS here."
"Deuteronomy 1:44 <b>Horma:</b> Recalled in Num. 14:45 as a stinging defeat, but cited in Num. 21:3 as a victory."
"Deuteronomy 2:1 <b>days-and-years:</b> Heb. <i>yamin</i> often means a long period of time, not simply “days.”"
"Deuteronomy 2:5 <b>Se’ir:</b> Cf. Gen. 33:14–16, where Se’ir is mentioned as the home of Esav (Esau)."
Deuteronomy 2:6 <b>silver:</b> Money in the form of coinage was not yet used; here weights (Heb. <i>shekels</i>) of silver are meant.
"Deuteronomy 2:8 <b>Moav:</b> Trad. “Moab,” the area to the southeast of the Dead Sea (today Jordan)."
"Deuteronomy 2:10 <b>Emites/Frightful-Ones:</b> A folk memory of earlier inhabitants of Canaan. <b>Anakites:</b> Another early Canaanite group according to biblical tradition. Cf. the note to 1:28, and the account in Num. 13."
"Deuteronomy 2:11 <b>Refa’ites/Shades:</b> Like the previous two peoples, a part of folk memory; this is a term whose meaning has been subject to much scholarly debate, but is now taken to refer to the descendants of dead heroes."
"Deuteronomy 2:13 <b>Wadi Zered:</b> The border between Edom and Moab, east of the lower end of the Dead Sea."
Deuteronomy 2:15 <b>panic them:</b> Paralleling the experience of the Egyptian army in Ex. 14:24.
"Deuteronomy 2:20 <b>Zamzummites/Barbarians:</b> Lit. “mumblers,” like the derivation of the English “barbarians” (so-called because the Greeks characterized other peoples as speaking indistinctly). Gaster and others suggest an alternative interpretation taken from Arabic <i>zamzama</i>, the low noise made by desert spirits; hence our phrase would refer to the supernatural, just as the Anakites and Refa’ites were seen as giants and shades."
"Deuteronomy 2:22 <b>until this (very) day:</b> This rather imprecise historical note occurs frequently in the Torah, especially in Deuteronomy."
"Deuteronomy 2:23 <b>Kaftor:</b> The island of Crete, understood in the Bible as the place of origin of the Philistines, who figure so prominently injudges and Samuel as the archenemy of Israel."
"Deuteronomy 2:24 <b>Heshbon:</b> Across the Jordan from Jericho. <b>Start! Take-possession!:</b> In idiomatic English, “Start to take possession.”"
Deuteronomy 2:26 <b>I sent messengers … to Sihon:</b> Cf. Num. 21:21ff.
Deuteronomy 2:30 <b>hardened his spirit and stiffened his heart:</b> Reminiscent of Pharaoh in the plagues narrative of Exodus.
"Deuteronomy 2:34 <b>devoted-to-destruction:</b> Or “banned.” According to this biblical practice of <i>herem</i>, spoils of war were confiscated for God/the sanctuary, and people so designated were put to death. It is a concept of “holy war,” which seems to deny economic motives for warfare. For a thorough discussion, see Stern."
Deuteronomy 3:1 <b>Bashan:</b> The region to the east and southeast of the Sea of Galilee.
"Deuteronomy 3:8 <b>Mount Hermon:</b> The highest peak in the region (about 9,200 feet), located well northeast of the Sea of Galilee."

"Deuteronomy 3:12 <b>Re’uvenites … Gadites:</b> Along with half of the tribe of Menashe (v.13), these tribes were granted land on the east bank of the Jordan (cf. Num. 32)."
"Deuteronomy 3:15 <b>Makhir:</b> Like Ya’ir in the previous verse, a descendant (“son”) of Menashe."
Deuteronomy 3:17 <b>Kinneret:</b> Some suggest a connection with the shape of a lyre (Heb. <i>kinnor</i>); this is still the Hebrew name for the Sea of Galilee. <b>Sea of Salt:</b> Likewise the Hebrew name for the Dead Sea.
"Deuteronomy 3:18 <b>specially-drafted:</b> Or “hand-picked.” JPS, “shock troops.” <b>those of caliber:</b> Others, “warriors.”"
Deuteronomy 3:21 <b>these two kings:</b> Sihon and Og.
"Deuteronomy 3:26 <b>cross:</b> Playing on the oft-used “crossing over,” which appears here in vv.25, 27, and 28."

Deuteronomy 3:29 <b>Bet Pe’or:</b> Cf. “Baal Pe’or” in 4:3 below.
Deuteronomy 4:3 <b>Baal Pe’or:</b> Cf. Num. 25. This brief instance of Israelite idolatry is remembered in the Bible as one of the worst examples of its kind.
Deuteronomy 4:4 <b>But you</b> etc.: This verse is recited in synagogues whenever the Torah scroll is read.
Deuteronomy 4:9 <b>self:</b> Or “life.”
"Deuteronomy 4:10 <b>hold me in awe:</b> Others, “fear me,” “revere me.”"
Deuteronomy 4:13 <b>the Ten Words:</b> They are never called the “Ten Commandments” in the Hebrew Bible—only in subsequent Jewish and Christian tradition.
"Deuteronomy 4:16 <b>lest:</b> This particle occurs frequently in Deuteronomy, as part of its elaborate language of warning."
"Deuteronomy 4:21 <b>and he swore</b> etc.: Here it is to the people’s “words” (unspecified, but probably their refusal to enter the land in Num. 13–14), and not to Moshe’s own rebellious act in striking the rock in Num. 20, that the narrator attributes God’s barring the Promised Land to him."
Deuteronomy 4:27 <b>menfolk few-in-number:</b> Echoing Jacob’s fear in Gen. 34:30.
Deuteronomy 4:36 <b>discipline:</b> Or “rebuke.”
"Deuteronomy 4:37 <b>since he loved your fathers:</b> Often given as the reason for God’s mercy toward Israel; cf. Moshe’s plea in Ex. 32:13. <b>seed:</b> Meaning “offspring.” <b>with his presence:</b> Focusing on the direct intervention of God (as opposed to angels, for instance), is characteristic of Deuteronomy (Tigay)."
"Deuteronomy 5:3 <b>but with us … here today:</b> The extreme irony of this statement, if taken at face value, is apparent. But religious texts and practice emphasize the here-and-now of the religious experience."
"Deuteronomy 5:11 <b>take up … for emptiness:</b> That is, use God’s name for a false purpose."
"Deuteronomy 5:13 <b>serve:</b> Or “do serving-tasks,” labor."
Deuteronomy 5:16 <b>that your days may be prolonged:</b> That you may live long.
Deuteronomy 5:17 <b>And you are not to</b> etc.: The “and” is a change from the Ex. 20 version.
Deuteronomy 5:18 <b>desire:</b> As your own. <b>crave:</b> Added to the Exodus version here.
"Deuteronomy 5:21 <b>Glory:</b> God’s visible manifestation, his “aura.” <b>they can remain-alive:</b> In the Bible (cf. Ex. 33:20) as elsewhere in the ancient world, the divine usually cannot be directly viewed by humans."
Deuteronomy 5:26 <b>all the days:</b> Or “every day.”
"Deuteronomy 6:3 <b>exceedingly many:</b> Fulfilling the promise made to Abraham in Genesis on numerous occasions. <b>honey:</b> Alternatively, “nectar,” the syrup of dates."
"Deuteronomy 6:4 <b>Y<small>HWH</small> our God, Y<small>HWH</small> (is) One!:</b> Despite the centrality of this phrase as a rallying cry in later Jewish history and thought, its precise meaning is not clear. It most likely stipulates that the Israelites are to worship Y<small>HWH</small> alone; a secondary meaning might be reflected by the translation “Y<small>HWH</small> is (but) one” — that is, God has no partner or consort as in the mythology of neighboring cultures."
"Deuteronomy 6:5 <b>heart:</b> The word is often the equivalent of “mind” in biblical language. <b>being:</b> Heb. <i>nefesh</i> carries a host of meanings: “life” or “life-essence,” “breath,” “self,” and “appetite,” to mention a few. The traditional English “soul,” while stirring in these passages, gives the impression of something contrasted to the body—not an idea that appears in the Hebrew Bible. It should be mentioned that the couplet “heart and being,” which occurs a number of times in Deuteronomy, might also indicate “mind and emotions.” <b>substance:</b> Or “excess”; others, “might,” “capacity.” There are other examples of biblical Hebrew words for “strength” that also mean “wealth” (e.g., <i>hayil</i> in Deut. 33:11)."
"Deuteronomy 6:7 <b>repeat … with:</b> Others, “teach diligently to,” “impress upon.”"
Deuteronomy 6:11 <b>and you eat … satisfied:</b> Or “eat your fill.”
"Deuteronomy 6:16 <b>Massa/Testing:</b> Cf. Ex. 17:1–7, where the people grumble against their leaders because of thirst."
"Deuteronomy 6:20 <b>When your child</b> etc.: Children are to be taught the meaning of <i>all</i> the laws to follow, not just the Passover regulations as in Ex. 12:26–27 and 13:8–15 (Weinfeld). Nonetheless, vv.20–25 were used by the later rabbis to form a central part of the Passover ceremony. Many translate “son,” in keeping with a didactic image (father to son) found in biblical wisdom such as the book of Proverbs. In Weinfeld’s view, Deuteronomy originated in wisdom circles."
"Deuteronomy 6:25 <b>righteous-merit:</b> The word often means “righteousness,” but here and elsewhere clearly indicates merit in the eyes of God."
"Deuteronomy 7:1 <b>Hittite</b> etc.: The first nation on this list is not to be confused with the great Hittite empire of Anatolia (modern Turkey), which historically preceded the Israelites. The listing of seven nations here (Plaut notes that it is the only time in the Torah they all appear on the same list) is an indication of completeness; seven was a number of perfection in the ancient world. <b>Yevusite:</b> The inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Deuteronomy 7:6 <b>a treasured people:</b> As promised in Ex. 19:6.
"Deuteronomy 7:13 <b>grain … new-wine … offspring … fecundity:</b> The Hebrew terms for these products of the land, as Tigay notes, were originally names of gods."
Deuteronomy 7:20 <b>the hornet:</b> A known threat in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld).
"Deuteronomy 7:22 <b>you may not finish them off quickly:</b> An attempt to explain why the Canaanites still survived among the Israelites at a later date (cf. Judges 3:1). Here the reason, a weak one, is that genocide would have led to an unacceptable rise in the number of scavenging animals. Another tradition (Ex. 23:29–30) posits that the Canaanites were to function as a test for the Israelites’ faithfulness to God (curiously, medieval Christianity was to use the same argument to explain the survival of the Jews)."
"Deuteronomy 8:2 <b>the route:</b> The circuitous journey, in both geography and experience."
"Deuteronomy 8:3 <b><i>mahn:</i></b> Trad. “manna,” a vegetable substance that according to Ex. 16:14–15 sustained the Israelites in the wilderness. <b>not by bread alone</b> etc.: Trad. “Man does not live by bread alone.” <b>at Y<small>HWH</small>’s order:</b> Lit. “from Y<small>HWH</small>’s mouth.”"
Deuteronomy 8:7 <b>Ocean-flows:</b> The subterranean waters on which the earth rests in ancient thinking.
"Deuteronomy 8:10 <b>when you eat,</b> etc.: A phrase included by the ancient Rabbis in the Grace after Meals, and the basis for its practice in Judaism."
Deuteronomy 8:15 <b>burning snakes:</b> Cf. Num. 21:6. <b>water … from the flinty rock:</b> Cf. Ex. 17:6 and Num. 20:11.
Deuteronomy 9:6 <b>hard of neck:</b> Trad. “stiff-necked.” The image is that of a stubborn draft animal that will not yield to do its master’s work.
Deuteronomy 9:8 <b>at Horev:</b> Referring to the incident of the molten calf (trad. “Golden Calf”).
Deuteronomy 9:20 <b>I interceded also on behalf of Aharon:</b> A detail not mentioned in the Exodus version.
Deuteronomy 9:21 <b>I threw its dust into the stream:</b> The Exodus account has Moshe forcing the Israelites to drink it.
Deuteronomy 9:22 <b>Tav’era/Blazing:</b> Cf. Num. 11:1ff. <b>Kivrot ha-Taava/Burial-Sites of Craving:</b> Cf. Num. 11:4–34.
"Deuteronomy 9:9 <b>Y<small>HWH</small> is his inheritance:</b> A phrase used in later Jewish memorial prayers, referring not to the Levites but to the dead."
"Deuteronomy 9:15 <b>Only to your fathers:</b> Read in conjunction with the previous verse, this means “Even though he is the universal God, he loved your ancestors in particular.”"
"Deuteronomy 9:16 <b>circumcise the foreskin of your heart:</b> Figuratively, to peel away the “thick” part, thus enabling one to love / be loyal to God."

Deuteronomy 11:2 <b>the discipline:</b> God’s punishment of the Egyptians.
"Deuteronomy 11:6 <b>Datan and Aviram:</b> Principals in the great rebellion in Num. 16; note that the ringleader there, Korah, is not mentioned here, perhaps indicating a separate tradition."
Deuteronomy 11:10 <b>with your foot:</b> Apparently a reference to an ancient irrigating technique.
Deuteronomy 11:14 <b>shooting-rain: In the fall. later-rain:</b> The soaking rains that fall in the winter.
"Deuteronomy 11:18 <b>sign … bands:</b> Understood traditionally by Jews as <i>tefillin</i>, leather bands worn in daily morning prayer. They are connected to small boxes containing this passage, along with Ex. 13:9, 16 and Deut. 6:8."
Deuteronomy 11:18–20 <b>You are to place these words … upon your gates:</b> These three verses reiterate much of the wording of 6:5–9 above.
"Deuteronomy 11:24 <b>from the wilderness</b> etc: The Hebrew here is unclear. <b>Hindward Sea:</b> The Mediterranean, “behind” the land of Israel, in the usual orientation of facing eastward (Heb. <i>kedma</i>, “frontward”)."
Deuteronomy 11:29 <b>Gerizim … Eval:</b> Two mountains that frame the important political and cultic center of Shechem (today Nablus). Cf. 27:11–13 below.
"Deuteronomy 12:2 <b>demolish,</b> etc.: Like several other lists of laws in the Torah (e.g., Ex. 21–23), this one begins with the topic of proper worship of God."
Deuteronomy 12:4 <b>do … with:</b> Or “act … toward” (Tigay).
Deuteronomy 12:7 <b>enterprises:</b> Lit. “putting-forth.”
"Deuteronomy 12:8 <b>whatever is right in his (own) eyes:</b> A theme in Deuteronomistic literature, usually denoting chaos. Cf. the phrase at the ending of the book of Judges (21:25)."
Deuteronomy 12:12 <b>before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> This phrase usually denotes a location in the sanctuary.

"Deuteronomy 12:15 <b>[your] appetite’s [craving]:</b> Heb. <i>nefesh</i> elsewhere means “self” or “being,” but also refers to the seat of emotions and, as here, appetite. <b><i>tamei</i>:</b> Polluted in a ritual sense; a standard term in Leviticus. <b>deer … gazelle:</b> Animals fit for consumption but not for sacrifice (Plaut)."
Deuteronomy 12:16 <b>blood you are not to eat:</b> It is considered to represent the life essence (cf. v.23 below).

Deuteronomy 13:17 <b>mound:</b> The sign of a ruined city.
"Deuteronomy 13:18 <b>there is not to cling</b> etc.: Cf. the story of Akhan in Josh. 7, where such misappropriation of spoils leads to the death of the offender."

"Deuteronomy 14:12 <b>eagle:</b> others, “griffin vulture.”"
"Deuteronomy 14:16 <b>little-owl, … great-owl, … white-owl:</b> Despite the English, there is no sound connection between these words in Hebrew."
Deuteronomy 14:21 <b>you are not to boil</b> etc.: This law appears three times in the Torah (cf. also Ex. 23:19 and 34:26). It appears to prohibit the mixing of life (milk) and death. Its distinctive appearance here focuses on the aspect of food in general; in Exodus it occurs in the more limited context of rules regarding the spring ritual.
Deuteronomy 14:22 <b>tithe:</b> To give a tenth of one’s produce to the sanctuary. Cf. Num. 18.
"Deuteronomy 14:25 <b>make-the-gift in silver:</b> JPS, “you may convert them into money.”"

"Deuteronomy 15:6 <b>give-pledges:</b> That is, be in debt."
"Deuteronomy 15:11 <b>the needy will never be-gone:</b> A recognition of the human condition, and an indication that this law, at least, is realistic, not utopian (as opposed to the confident pronouncement of v.4)."

"Deuteronomy 15:16 <b>love:</b> The connotation here, as often in Deuteronomy, is one of loyalty."
"Deuteronomy 15:20 <b>you are to eat (it):</b> As in 14:26, the goods go to the offerer, not to the priests or Levites (for which, see Ex. 22:28 etc.) (Weinfeld)."

Deuteronomy 18:12 <b>them:</b> The Canaanites.
"Deuteronomy 18:13 <b>Wholehearted:</b> Used to describe Noah (Gen. 6:9) and Abraham (17:1). The identical word (Heb. <i>tamin</i>, “wholly-sound,”) ascribes animals fit for sacrifice in their purity and perfection."

"Deuteronomy 21:8 <b>atoned of:</b> Or “purged of,” “ransomed of.”"
"Deuteronomy 21:12 <b>shave … do her nails:</b> Apparently these acts were signs of mourning. In this case, “doing the nails” means cutting them."

Deuteronomy 21:17 <b>two-thirds:</b> Based on a cognate in Akkadian.

"Deuteronomy 23:3 <b><i>mamzer:</i></b> Pronounced mom-<i>zare</i>; apparently one born of a forbidden union (e.g., incest or adultery). The child of two unmarried parents, while rare in the Bible, is not condemned in the manner of this verse."
Deuteronomy 23:5 <b>Bil’am:</b> Cf. Num. 22–24.
Deuteronomy 23:7 <b>peace … well-being:</b> The phrase has an equivalent in treaties in Akkadian (Tigay).

Deuteronomy 23:15 <b>anything of “nakedness”:</b> Trad. “anything indecent.”
"Deuteronomy 23:19 <b>the fee of a whore</b> etc.: “Dog” is clearly a term of derision for a pagan priest. The verse comes to teach that tainted money is not acceptable in payment of a vow, which is, after all, a religious matter."
"Deuteronomy 23:21 <b>the foreigner you may charge-interest:</b> This verse became central to economic debates in the Middle Ages, when the church banned the charging of interest but permitted Jews to do it, thus funding many a state treasury or military campaign."

Deuteronomy 23:26 <b>but a sickle</b> etc.: The same applies in this case.

"Deuteronomy 24:6 <b>a handmill or an upper-millstone:</b> A major means of livelihood or survival in ancient Israel. This law, and the others regarding collateral in Deuteronomy (v.17 below and 24:11), expand the basic rule found in Ex. 22:25–26."

"Deuteronomy 26:5 <b>An Aramean Astray my Ancestor:</b> Heb. <i>arami oved avi</i>, a phrase clearly meant to be remembered, and referring to Yaakov and his children in Genesis. It has become part of the Passover ceremony, although its meaning there is changed (“an Aramean [Laban in Gen. 28–31] sought to destroy my Ancestor [Jacob]”)."
Deuteronomy 26:9-10 <b>he brought … I have brought:</b> The gift of the land is answered by the gift of its produce to God (Buber 1982).

Deuteronomy 28:8 <b>ordain:</b> Following JPS.
"Deuteronomy 28:27 <b>tumors:</b> Ancient scribes were uncomfortable with the text’s <i>afolim</i>, “hemorrhoids,” so they substituted <i>tehorim</i>, “tumors,” for reading aloud. The original word is nevertheless printed in the text, with a marginal note (see v.30 below for a similar case)."
"Deuteronomy 28:29 <b>with no deliverer:</b> The emotional tone of the phrase, which is repeated in v.31 with the additional “for you,” is captured by its first occurrence—in 22:27, where it refers to a rape victim being helpless."
"Deuteronomy 28:30 <b>lie with:</b> The Hebrew text reads <i>yishgalenna,</i> which medieval commentators understood as “treat like a concubine” or the like, a meaning close to an Akkadian cognate. Scribes stipulated that it be read as <i>yishkevenna, “</i>lie with,” which was seen as less upsetting (at least to the reader)."
"Deuteronomy 28:31 <b>with no deliverer:</b> The phrase breaks the sequence of “…, but…” that is characteristic of the previous verses; such a break in rhythm or structure is a common rhetorical flourish in biblical texts."
Deuteronomy 28:48 <b>he will put:</b> Referring to the enemy.
"Deuteronomy 28:50 <b>countenance:</b> “Face,” here altered so as not to clash with “fierce.”"
Deuteronomy 28:59 <b>blows:</b> The standard word for “plagues” (as in the Exodus story).
"Deuteronomy 28:63 <b>delighted … in doing-good:</b> Tigay: “was determined … to do-good.” <b>pulled up:</b> An idiom for “deport,” as in Akkadian (Weinfeld 1972a)."
Deuteronomy 28:66 <b>hang-by-a-thread:</b> Heb. difficult. Another possibility is “suffer-hardship.”

Deuteronomy 28:68 <b>put yourselves up for sale:</b> Following JPS.
Deuteronomy 28:5 <b>bread … wine:</b> The lack of these staples supports the characterization of Israel’s wilderness experience as liminal—away from the everyday.
"Deuteronomy 28:9 <b>your heads, your tribes:</b> Some ancient versions read “your tribal heads.”"
Deuteronomy 28:10 <b>woodchopper … waterhauler:</b> Equivalent to “every man jack among you.”
Deuteronomy 28:11 <b>cross over into the covenant:</b> The wording is a bit unusual. There may be a conscious play here on “crossing” in v.15 below. <b>oath-of-fealty:</b> Translated elsewhere as “oath-curse.”
Deuteronomy 28:14 <b>our God:</b> Some ancient versions read “your God” here and in v.17.
Deuteronomy 28:16 <b>idol-clods:</b> A derogatory term for pagan gods.
"Deuteronomy 28:18 <b>blesses himself in his heart:</b> JPS, “fancies himself immune.” <b>“sweeping away the watered and the parched (alike)”:</b> This seems to be an idiom denoting “total destruction.”"
"Deuteronomy 28:19 <b>anger:</b> Here, as usually in the Bible, the word literally means “nostrils.” <b>crouch upon him:</b> That is, be an unshakable burden."
Deuteronomy 28:22 <b>Sedom</b> etc.: Cf. Gen. 19:24–28 for a description of that famous destruction.
Deuteronomy 28:25 <b>he:</b> God.
Deuteronomy 30:3 <b>restore your fortunes:</b> Heb. <i>shav … shevutekha;</i> continuing the use of the root <i>shuv</i> (“return”) that echoes throughout the chapter.
Deuteronomy 30:6 <b>circumcise your heart:</b> See note to 10:16.
"Deuteronomy 30:13 <b>across the sea:</b> An especially daunting proposition for the Israelites, who were not coast dwellers."
Deuteronomy 31:1 <b>went and spoke:</b> Ancient versions read “(When) Moshe finished speaking” (<i>vykl</i> instead of <i>vylk</i>).
"Deuteronomy 31:2 <b>A hundred and twenty:</b> In the 60-based Mesopotamian number system, this number indicates the maximal duration of life (Tigay)."
"Deuteronomy 31:14 <b>days … drawing near … die:</b> Despite the English, the Hebrew here is not alliterative."
Deuteronomy 31:17 <b>conceal my face:</b> An oft-used biblical metaphor for God’s abandoning Israel.
Deuteronomy 31:19 <b>this song:</b> Which follows in 32:1–43.

"Deuteronomy 32:5 <b>His children have wrought-ruin</b> etc.: An extremely difficult verse that has been much debated. The solution here is based on Dillmann, quoted by Driver. An emendation cited by Tigay yields “his non-children violated their loyalty.”"
"Deuteronomy 32:8 <b>gods:</b> Ancient versions read “children of the gods.” The Hebrew text reads, uncomfortably, “by the number of the Children of Israel.”"
Deuteronomy 32:10 <b>surrounded … paid-him-regard … guarded:</b> The sense is that God <i>kept on doing</i> these things (Rainey).
Deuteronomy 32:11 <b>protecting:</b> Following O’Connor.
"Deuteronomy 32:13 <b>honey:</b> In Gaster’s (1969) opinion, this and the appearance of the eagle in v.11 are an allusion to the folk motif of the Exposed Child (a child left to die in the wild is saved and succored by the gods and/or friendly animals)."
"Deuteronomy 32:15 <b>gorged:</b> Some read Heb. <i>casita</i> as <i>nashita</i>, “forgot.”"
Deuteronomy 32:17 <b>had no idea:</b> Driver suggests “did not shudder.”
Deuteronomy 32:18 <b>produced-you-in-labor:</b> A reminder that God is not always perceived in exclusively male imagery in the Bible.
Deuteronomy 32:24 <b>Fiery-Plague:</b> Or “fire-bolts.”
"Deuteronomy 32:26 <b>cleave … in pieces:</b> A difficult expression; I follow Driver here, who relates it to Arabic."
Deuteronomy 32:31 <b>though our enemies</b> …: Heb. difficult. <b>Sedom … Amora:</b> The infamous Sodom and Gomorrah of Gen. 19.
Deuteronomy 32:36 <b>naught (left) of (both) fettered and free:</b> Perhaps a merism meaning “anybody.”
Deuteronomy 32:43 <b>avenge:</b> Or “exact retribution from.” <b>effecting-atonement</b> …: Heb. difficult. <b>for the soil of his people:</b> Heb. likewise difficult; JPS note suggests “wipe away his people’s tears.”
"Deuteronomy 32:44 <b>Hoshe’a:</b> An alternate version of “Yehoshua.” Although the names sound the same, the latter means “Y<small>HWH</small> is noble,” the former, “Y<small>HWH</small> delivers.”"

Deuteronomy 32:51 <b>at the waters of Merivat Kadesh:</b> Cf. Num. 20:1–13.
"Deuteronomy 33:2 <b>Sinai:</b> Unusual here, since Deuteronomy tends to use “Horev” for Sinai. <b>at his right-hand</b> etc.: Another difficult phrase; O’Connor, “from his Southland, the slopes, which are his.”"
"Deuteronomy 33:3 <b>the peoples:</b> The Septuagint reads “his people.” <b>bearing your words:</b> O’Connor, “they honor your commands.” The entire verse as we have it is enigmatic."
Deuteronomy 33:8 <b>quarreled:</b> Or “strove.”
Deuteronomy 33:10 <b>complete-offerings:</b> Completely consumed by fire on the altar.
Deuteronomy 33:11 <b>from rising up:</b> Some understand as “who will arise?”
"Deuteronomy 33:12 <b>He dwells securely upon him:</b> Avishur brings an iconographic parallel from Egypt, where a god, in the guise of a hawk, sits upon the shoulder or back of the one to be protected."
Deuteronomy 33:16 <b>consecrated-one:</b> The same phrase is used of Yosef in Gen. 49:26. It might also be rendered “the one set apart.”
"Deuteronomy 33:17 <b>together:</b> O’Connor reads as “incites,” based on an Arabic cognate. <b>the ends of the earth:</b> Follow JPS."
Deuteronomy 33:23 <b>sea:</b> Probably a reference to the Sea of Galilee.
Deuteronomy 33:25 <b>strength:</b> Another difficult word; the reading here is based on ancient versions.

Deuteronomy 34:1 <b>as far as Dan:</b> The northern border of Israel.
Deuteronomy 34:2 <b>all the land of Yehuda:</b> The center of the country.
"Deuteronomy 34:5 <b>at the order of</b> Y<small>HWH</small>: He dies as he has lived. It should also be noted that the literal meaning, “at the mouth of Y<small>HWH</small>,” gave rise to a Jewish tradition that, as the greatest religious figure in Israel’s history, Moshe died by a divine kiss."
"Deuteronomy 34:6 <b>no man has knowledge:</b> Apparently to prevent worship of the dead, which was quite familiar to the Israelites from an Egyptian context."
"Deuteronomy 34:10 <b>knew:</b> JPS: “singled out,” the likely meaning here."
Deuteronomy 34:12 <b>before the eyes:</b> Stressing that this is not secondhand information (Tigay).
