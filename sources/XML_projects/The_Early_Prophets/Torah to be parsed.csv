"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.1","… read the Bible as though it were something entirely unfamiliar, as though it had not been set before you ready-made…. Face the book with a new attitude as something new…. Let whatever may happen occur between yourself and it. You do not know which of its sayings and images will overwhelm and mold you…. But hold yourself open. Do not believe anything a priori; do not disbelieve anything a priori. Read aloud the words written in the book in front of you; hear the word you utter and let it reach you."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.2","<i>—adapted, from a lecture of Martin Buber, 1926</i>"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.3","T<small>HE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO DRAW THE READER INTO THE WORLD OF THE</small> Hebrew Bible through the power of its language. While this sounds simple enough, it is not usually possible in translation. Indeed, the premise of almost all Bible translations, past and present, is that the “meaning” of the text should be conveyed in as clear and comfortable a manner as possible in one’s own language. Yet the truth is that the Bible was not written in English in the twentieth or even the seventeenth century; it is ancient, sometimes obscure, and speaks in a way quite different from ours. Accordingly, I have sought here primarily to echo the style of the original, believing that the Bible is best approached, at least at the beginning, on its own terms. So I have presented the text in English dress but with a Hebraic voice."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.4","The result looks and sounds very different from what we are accustomed to encountering as the Bible, whether in the much-loved grandeur of the King James Version or the clarity and easy fluency of the many recent attempts. There are no old friends here; Eve will not, as in old paintings, give Adam an apple (nor will she be called “Eve”), nor will Moses speak of himself as “a stranger in a strange land,” as beautiful as that sounds. Instead, the reader will encounter a text which challenges him or her to rethink what these ancient books are and what they mean, and will hopefully be encouraged to become an active listener rather than a passive receiver."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.5","This translation is guided by the principle that the Hebrew Bible, like much of the literature of antiquity, was meant to be read aloud, and that consequently it must be translated with careful attention to rhythm and sound. The translation therefore tries to mimic the particular rhetoric of the Hebrew whenever possible, preserving such devices as repetition, allusion, alliteration, and wordplay. It is intended to echo the Hebrew, and to lead the reader back to the sound structure and form of the original."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.6","Such an approach was first espoused by Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig in their monumental German translation of the Bible (1925–1962) and in subsequent interpretive essays. <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is in many respects an offshoot of the Buber-Rosenzweig translation (hereafter abbreviated as B-R). I began with their principles: that translations of individual words should reflect “primal” root meanings, that translations of phrases, lines, and whole verses should mimic the syntax of the Hebrew, and that the vast web of allusions and wordplays present in the text should be somehow perceivable in the target language (for a full exposition in English, see now Buber and Rosenzweig 1994). In all these areas I have taken a more moderate view than my German mentors, partly because I think there are limitations to these principles and partly because recent scholarship points in broader directions. As a result, my translation is on the whole less radical and less strange in English than B-R was in German. This, however, does not mean that it is less different from conventional translations, or that I have abandoned the good fight for a fresh look at the Bible’s verbal power."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.7","Buber and Rosenzweig based their approach on the Romantic nineteenth-century notion that the Bible was essentially oral literature written down. In the present century there have been Bible scholars who have found this view attractive; on the other hand, there has been little agreement on how oral roots manifest themselves in the text. One cannot suggest that the Bible is a classic work of oral literature in the same sense as the <i>Iliad</i> or <i>Beowulf</i>. It does not employ regular meter or rhyme, even in sections that are clearly formal poetry. The text of the Bible that we possess is most likely a mixture of oral and written materials from a variety of periods and sources, and recovering anything resembling original oral forms would seem to be impossible. This is particularly true given the considerable chronological and cultural distance at which we stand from the text, which does not permit us to know how it was performed in ancient times."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.8","A more fruitful approach, less dependent upon theories whose historical accuracy is unprovable, might be to focus on the way in which the biblical text, <i>once</i> <i>completed</i>, was copied and read. Recent research reveals that virtually all literature in Greek and Roman times—the period when the Hebrew Bible was put into more or less the form in which it has come down to us (but not the period of its composition)—was read aloud. This holds for the process of copying or writing, and also, surprisingly, for solitary reading. As late as the last decade of the fourth century, Saint Augustine expressed surprise at finding a sage who read silently. Such practices and attitudes seem strange to us, for whom the very definition of a library, for instance, is a place where people have to keep quiet. But it was a routine in the world of antiquity, as many sources attest."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.9","So the Bible, if not an oral document, is certainly an aural one; it would have been read aloud as a matter of course. But the implications of this for understanding the text are considerable. The rhetoric of the text is such that many passages and sections are understandable in depth only when they are analyzed <i>as they are heard</i>. Using echoes, allusions, and powerful inner structures of sound, the text is often able to convey ideas in a manner that vocabulary alone cannot do. A few illustrations may suffice to introduce this phenomenon to the reader; it will be encountered constantly throughout this volume."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.10","Sound plays a crucial role in one of the climactic sequences in Genesis, Chapters 32–33. Jacob, the protagonist, has not seen his brother Esau for twenty years. Now a rich and successful adult, he is on his way back to Canaan after a long exile. He sends messengers to forestall Esau’s vengeance—for twenty years earlier, Jacob had stolen the birthright and the blessing which Esau felt were righdy his own. When Jacob finds out that his brother “is already coming … and four hundred men are with him” (32:7), he goes even further, preparing an elaborate gift for Esau in the hopes of appeasing his anger. The text in VV.21–22 presents Jacob’s thoughts and actions (the translation is taken from the New English Bible):"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.11","for he thought, “I will appease him with the present that I have sent on ahead, and afterwards, when I come into his presence, he will perhaps receive me kindly.” So Jacob’s present went on ahead of him. …"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.12","This is an accurate and highly idiomatic translation of the Hebrew, and the reader will notice nothing unusual about the passage as it reads in English. The sound of the Hebrew text, on the other hand, gives one pause. It is built on variations of the word <i>panim</i>, whose basic meaning is “face,” although the Hebrew uses it idiomatically to encompass various ideas. (Note: in Hebrew, the sound <i>p</i> is pronounced as <i>ph</i> under certain circumstances.) If the text is translated with attention to sound, its quite striking oral character emerges (italics mine):"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.13",For he said to himself:
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.14",I will wipe (the anger from) his <i>face (phanav)</i>
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.15",with the gift that goes ahead of my <i>face; (le-phanai)</i>
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.16","afterward, when I see his <i>face, (phanav)</i>"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.17",perhaps he will lift up my <i>face! (phanai)</i>
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.18",The gift crossed over ahead of his <i>face. … (alpanav)</i>
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.19","Comparison of these two English versions is instructive. In the New English Bible, as in most other contemporary versions, the translators are apparently concerned with presenting the text in clear, modern, idiomatic English. For example, they render the Hebrew <i>yissa phanai</i> as “receive me kindly.” The N.E.B. translates the <i>idea</i> of the text; at the same time it translates <i>out</i> the sound by not picking up on the repetition of <i>panim</i> words."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.20","What does the reader gain by hearing the literalness of the Hebrew? And what is lost by the use of its idiomatic meaning? As mirrored in the second translation, it is clear that our text is signaling something of significance. The motif of “face” (which might be interpreted as “facing” or “confrontation”) occurs at crucial points in the story. The night before his fateful meeting with Esau, as he is left to ponder the next day’s events, Jacob wrestles with a mysterious stranger—a divine being. After Jacob’s victory, the text reports (32:31):"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.21","Yaakov called the name of the place: Peniel/<i>Face of God</i>,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.22","for: I have seen God,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.23","<i>face to face</i>,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.24",and my life has been saved.
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.25","The repetition suggests a thematic link with what has gone before. One could interpret that once the hero has met and actually bested this divine being, his coming human confrontation is assured of success. Thus upon meeting Esau at last, Jacob says to him (33:10):"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.26","For I have, after all, seen <i>your face</i>, as one sees the <i>face</i> of God,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.27",and you have been gracious to me.
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.28","It could be said that in a psychological sense the meetings with divine and human adversaries are a unity, the representation of one human process in two narrative episodes. This is accomplished by the repetition of the word <i>panim</i> in the text."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.29","The above interpretation depends entirely on sound. Once that focus is dropped, either through the silent reading of the text or a standard translation, the inner connections are simply lost and the reader is robbed of the opportunity to make these connections for himself. Clearly there is a difference between translating what the text means and translating what it says."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.30","While the Jacob passages use the sound of a specific word to indicate an important motif in the narrative, there are other cases where sound brings out structure, and the structure itself conveys the principal idea of the passage. A striking example of this is found at the beginning of Genesis. God’s first acts of creation in 1:3–5 are portrayed in a highly ordered fashion, suggesting that creation itself is orderly, and this idea is the thematic backbone of the whole chapter. We are meant to experience the orderliness of God’s activity through the sensuality of the language and through the particular way in which the text speaks. A translation keyed to the sound of the Hebrew reads:"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.31",God said: Let there be light! And there was light.
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.32",God saw the light: that it was good.
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.33",God separated the light from the darkness.
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.34",God called the light: Day! and the darkness he called: Night!
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.35","The four occurrences of “God” plus verb accomplish the narrator’s goal, and give a tone to the creation account that makes it akin to poetry. In contrast, virtually all modern translations treat the passage as prose, rendering it into clear written English but simultaneously removing its inner structure. What remains is a statement of what is taking place in the narrative, but without its underlying thrust. Again the New English Bible:"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.36","God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light; and God saw that the light was good, and he separated light from darkness. He called the light day, and the darkness night."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.37","This translation is cast in good English style. For just that reason two occurrences of “God” have been omitted, and the passage consequently reads smoothly—so smoothly that one glides past it as if creation were the same as any other narrated action. But what has been lost is the characteristic oral ring of the text, and simultaneously its intent to say something beyond the content of words alone."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.38","Another example of translating with an ear to the sound and structure of the original, this time from the book of Exodus, comes from the dramatic story of the Sea of Reeds (14:11–12). The newly freed Israelites find themselves pursued by their former masters, the Pharaoh and his army; with their backs to the Sea, they panic, and bitterly harangue their would-be deliverer, Moses. The present translation, attempting to reflect the repetition and structure of the original, yields the following:"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.39",they said to Moshe:
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.40",Is it because there are no graves in Egypt
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.41",that you have taken us out to die in the wilderness?
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.42","What is this that you have done to us, bringing us out of Egypt?"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.43","Is this not the very word that we spoke to you in Egypt,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.44","saying: Let us alone, that we may serve Egypt!"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.45","Indeed, better for us serving Egypt"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.46",than our dying in the wilderness!
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.47","This passage demonstrates several aspects of a rhetorical translation method, if we may so term it: the laying out of the text in “cola” or lines meant to facilitate reading aloud (more on this below); the repetition of words—“Egypt” five times and “wilderness” twice—to stress the irony of the Israelites’ predicament (as they see it, Egypt means life, and the wilderness, certain death); and the double use of “serve,” the very word that Moses constantly drummed into Pharaoh’s ears in the early part of the book to denote the Israelites’ desire to go and worship their God (“Send free my people, that they may serve me”). If we juxtapose the above translation with that found in, say, the New International Version, the importance of this approach to the text becomes clear:"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.48","They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.49","Here the rhetorical force of the Hebrew has been ignored. The Hebrew text does not transpose “desert to die” to “die in the desert” at the end of the passage (the word order repeats in the original, for emphasis); it does not distinguish in sound between “Egypt” and “Egyptians”; and it certainly does not read like standard colloquial prose. Indeed, all of Chapter 14 of Exodus demonstrates the Bible’s use of an intermediate form between poetry and prose, a form designed to instruct as well as to inspire."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.50","But it is not only in narrative that the rhetoric of biblical language makes itself felt. Fully half of the book of Exodus is law or instruction, and one can find there further examples of the importance of sound structure in the Bible. Take, for instance, the law concerning the protection of widows and orphans (22:23–24). This time I shall present the text first through the eyes of the Jerusalem Bible:"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.51","You must not be harsh with the widow, or with the orphan; if you are harsh with them, they will surely cry out to me, and be sure that I shall hear their cry; my anger will flare and I shall kill you with the sword, your own wives will be widows, your own children orphans."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.52","This is powerful language, especially in a law code. But the Hebrew text goes much farther, utilizing as it does a double form of the verb rarely found in multiple sequence:"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.53",Any widow or orphan you are not to afflict.
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.54","Oh, if you afflict, afflict them …!"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.55","For (then) they will cry, cry out to me,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.56","and I will hearken, hearken to their cry,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.57",my anger will flare up
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.58","and I will kill you with the sword,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.59","so that your wives become widows, and your children, orphans!"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.60","Here the text is in effect slowed down by the division into lines, and the verb forms are isolated to underscore their unique rhetoric. The effect of the whole is to focus attention on this particular law among a host of others."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.61","Once the spokenness of the Bible is understood as a critical factor in the translation process, a number of practical steps become necessary which constitute radical changes from past translation practices. Buber and Rosenzweig introduced three such major innovations into their work: the form in which the text is laid out, the reproduction of biblical names and their meanings, and the “leading-word” technique by means of which important repetitions in the Hebrew are retained in translation."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.62","First, as is obvious from the excerpts quoted above, the translated text is printed in lines resembling blank verse. These “cola” are based primarily on spoken phrasing. In Buber’s view, each unit represents simultaneously a unit of breathing and of meaning, thus illustrating the deep connection between form and content in the Hebrew Bible. While current scholars, myself included, would not agree with Buber that the text’s rhetoric necessarily corresponds to “breathing,” cola divisions do facilitate reading aloud and make it possible for the listener to sense the text’s inner rhythm—and only at that point can the text begin to deliver its message with full force."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.63","Cola do not correspond to the traditional verse divisions found in printed Bibles. Those divisions are of late origin (perhaps from the ninth century, in written form), and were adopted for the sake of reference. Jews and Christians have used them in roughly the same form since the middle ages. Cola, on the other hand, arise from the experience of reading the Hebrew text aloud and of feeling its spoken rhythms. The specific divisions used in this volume are somewhat arbitrary; each reader will hear the text differently. My line divisions are sometimes identical to B-R, but often are not; they sometimes correspond to the punctuation laid down by Jewish tradition (the Masoretic accents or <i>trop</i>), but not always. What is most important, however, is that the practice of dividing the text into lines points away from the apprehension of the Bible as a written book and restores the sense of it as spoken performance."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.64","Second, personal and place names generally appear in Hebrew forms throughout this translation. Thus, for example, the Hebrew <i>Moshe</i> is retained instead of Moses, <i>Kayin</i> instead of Cain, <i>Rivka</i> instead of Rebecca, and <i>Bil’am</i> instead of Balaam. This practice stems from the central role that names play in biblical stories (as often in literature). In biblical Israel as throughout the ancient world, names are often meant to give clues about their bearer’s personality or fate. The meaning of a name is often explained outright in the text itself. In <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> this is represented by a slash in the text, as in the following example (Gen. 30:23–24):"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.65",She said:
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.66",God has removed/<i>asaf</i>
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.67",my reproach.
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.68","And she called his name: Yosef,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.69",saying:
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.70",May Y<small>HWH</small> add/<i>yosef</i>
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.71",another son to me.
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.72","The name here is a play on words, hinting at Joseph’s eventual fate (he will be a son “removed” and “added,” that is, lost and found by his family). By retaining the Hebrew sounds in translation, a meaningful portion of the narrative is thus moved from footnotes, where it appears in most modern translations, back to the body of the text. That this is important is demonstrated by the fact that virtually every major (usually male) character in Genesis has his name explained in this manner."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.73","It should be noted that such interpretations of names in the Bible are not based on philological derivations, that is, on scientific etymology. The name Jacob/Yaakov, for instance, which is understood in Gen. 25 as “Heel-Holder” and in Chapter 27 as “Heel-Sneak,” probably held the original meaning of “may (God) protect.” But the biblical writers were not so much concerned with what a name originally meant as they were with its sound, and with the associations inherent in that sound. Therefore what is important in our example is that “Yaakov” recalls <i>ekev</i>, “heel.” This kind of interpretation is known as “folk etymology” or “popular etymology.” A similar phenomenon appears in the naming of Moses (Ex. 2:10)."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.74","A third important technique with which biblical literature often conveys its message, and which must influence the translation of the text, is what Buber called the “leading-word” (<i>Leitwort</i>) principle. Key (“leading”) words are repeated within a text to signify major themes and concerns, like recurring themes in a piece of music (hence the similarity of Buber’s term to composer Richard Wagner’s word <i>Leitmotif</i>). A leading-word operates on the basis of sound: the repetition of a word or word root encourages the listener to make connections between diverse parts of a story (or even of a book), and to trace a particular theme throughout. This is not to be seen, however, as a static process. A leading-word may appear in different forms and contexts, with changed meaning, thus lending a sense of movement and development to the text and its characters. One example may be cited here; others appear throughout this book."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.75","Buber’s essay, “Abraham the Seer,” traces the biblical tradition’s portrayal of Abraham through the use of key words and phrases in the text. Chief among these is the verb “to see” (Hebrew <i>ra’o</i>), which appears constantly in the Abraham narratives and which tells us something significant about both the man himself and how he is meant to be remembered. At the outset of Abraham’s journey to Canaan, which signals his entry into biblical tradition as an independent personality, God sends him off to a land that he will “let him see” (12:1). Arriving in the land, Abraham is granted a communication from God, expressed by the phrase “Y<small>HWH</small> was seen by Avram …” (12:7). God subsequently promises the land to him and his descendants (“see from the place that you are … for all the land that you see, to you I give it and to your seed, for the ages” [13:15]). “Seeing” comes to the fore in the story of Abraham’s concubine Hagar; her encounter with God’s messenger ends with her addressing a “God of Seeing” (16:13). Further meetings between Abraham and God (17:1, 18:1) likewise express themselves visually, with the latter scene, where God announces Isaac’s impending birth at Abraham’s tent, almost unique in the Bible for its bold picture of God appearing directly to human beings. Finally, with the great test of Abraham in Chapter 22, the “Binding of Isaac,” the theme of seeing is brought to a climax. Buber describes the use of the leading-word in that passage, summarizing how it rounds out the entire Abraham cycle:"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.76","It appears here more often than in any previous passage. Abraham sees the place where the act must be accomplished, at a distance. To the question of his son, he replies that God will provide (“see to”) the lamb for the burnt offering. In the saving moment he lifts up his eyes and sees the ram. And now he proclaims over the altar the name that makes known the imperishable essence of this place, Mount Moriah: Y<small>HWH</small> Will See. … God sees man, and man sees God. God sees Abraham, and tests him by seeing him as the righteous and “whole” man who walks before his God (17:1), and now, at the end of his road, he conquers even this final place, the holy temple mountain, by acting on God’s behalf. Abraham sees God with the eye of his action and so recognizes Him, just as Moses, seeing God’s glory “from behind,” will recognize Him as Gracious and Merciful.*<sup>*</sup><i class=""footnote"">Martin Buber, <i>On the Bible: Eighteen Studies</i>, edited by Nahum N. Glatzer (New York: Schocken Books, 1982), p. 42.</i>"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.77","Buber goes one step further in his analysis of the leading-word <i>see:</i> he views it as a clue to the biblical concept of Abraham’s role in history. Taking the hint from I Sam. 9:9 (“the prophet of our day was formerly called a seer”), he posits that the Bible wants us to understand Abraham as the spiritual father of the later prophets. Abraham, then, is preeminent as the first man in the Bible of whom it is reported that God “was seen by him.”"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.78","Such an understanding of the role of leading-words as crucial to biblical style rarely makes itself felt in translation. Bible translators are reluctant to reproduce repetitions of Hebrew words in the text because they are generally fearful of creating a tedious English style. However, once one abandons the idea of the Bible as primarily a written work, the repetitiveness of leading-words becomes a signal rather than a stumbling block, freeing the reader to experience the dynamic manner in which the Bible expresses itself. That this sometimes entails a loss of nuance in the translation (where “see” in Hebrew may signify “perceive” or “understand” in a particular passage, for instance) is a price that must be paid; yet such a translation may in fact retain more of the breadth of the Hebrew than is immediately apparent."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.79","A final word needs to be said about the leading-word technique. It may serve a purpose in the text beyond conveying meaning: it may play a structural role, unifying sections that have been culled from different sources within biblical Israel to form a composite account. The ancient redactors of the Bible apparently crafted the material they received into an organic whole. Using such means as leading-word repetition, they in effect created a new literature in which deep relationships exist between the parts of the whole."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.80","The above three translation techniques—setting out the text in cola, transliterating and explaining Hebrew names, and reproducing leading-words—form the crux of an approach to the Bible’s spokenness, but there are other methods used by the text to the same end. Three are particularly worthy of mention: wordplay, allusion, and what I have termed small-scale repetition."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.81","The Bible uses wordplay to make a point forcefully, especially in prophetic passages or those with a prophetic flavor. In Gen. 40:13 and 19, for instance, Joseph predicts that the king of Egypt will end the imprisonment of two of his courtiers. When the cupbearer is to be restored to his former position, Joseph says,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.82",in another three days
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.83",Pharaoh will lift up your head. …
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.84","In contrast, when Joseph predicts that the chief baker will be executed, the text reads:"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.85",in another three days Pharaoh will lift up your head
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.86",from off you. …
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.87","By beginning both statements with the same phrasing, the narrator is able to heighten the impact of “from off you” on both audience and victim."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.88","A powerful example of the second device, allusion, occurs near the beginning of Exodus. Baby Moses, floating precariously yet fetus-like on the Nile, is one of the enduring images in the book, as children have long attested. Modern English readers, however, are seldom aware that the Hebrew word for Moses’s floating cradle—rendered by virtually all standard translations as “basket”—is the same as the one used in Gen. 6:14ff. to describe Noah’s famous vessel (<i>teiva</i>). Preserving the connection between the two, as I have tried to do in the Exodus passage with “little-ark” (and which, incidentally, the authors of the King James Version did with “ark”), is to keep open the play of profound meaning that exists between the two stories."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.89","Finally, we may give an example of small-scale repetition. Unlike the leading-word technique, this is limited to a brief report and is used to express one specific idea. In Gen. 6:11–13, for instance, it illustrates an important biblical concept: just punishment. Three times in the passage we hear the word “ruin,” indicating what human evil has done to the world; the fourth time (v.13) it appears in a causative form, to show that God retaliates in exactly the same terms, measure for measure."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.90",Now the earth had gone-to-<i>ruin</i> before God; the earth was filled with wrongdoing.
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.91","God saw the earth, and here: it had gone-to-<i>ruin</i>,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.92",for all flesh had <i>ruined</i> its way upon the earth.
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.93",God said to Noah:
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.94","An end of all flesh has come before me,"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.95",for the earth is filled with wrongdoing through them;
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.96","here, I will bring-<i>ruin</i> upon them, along with the earth."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.97","The Bible is fond of this technique, which it uses in a number of narratives that deal with human misbehavior (e.g., the Tower of Babel story in Gen. 11). It is another example of how the form in which the text is cast goes a long way toward expressing its intent."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.98","From the above examples it may appear that it is not difficult to carry out the Buber-Rosenzweig principles in a translation. In practice, however, the translator who wishes to bring the language spoken by his audience into consonance with the style of the Hebrew text runs the risk of doing violence to that language, forced as he or she is into “hebraizing” the language. There will of necessity be a certain strangeness and some awkward moments in such a translation. Buber and Rosenzweig themselves came under fire for creating a strange new kind of German in their work; one critic in 1933 accused them of “unusual affectations.” My renditions of the Torah books, while limited in what they wreak with the English language both by my cautiousness and by the less pliable nature of English (than German), have been liable to similar characterization, especially in the legal sections."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.99","This problem, however, is inherent in this kind of undertaking, and I have accepted its risks willingly. In the last generation there have been any number of clear, smooth-reading translations of the Bible, all aimed at making the text readily accessible to the reader. I have taken a different road, arguing (along with Buber and Rosenzweig) that the reader must be prepared to meet the Bible at least halfway and must become an active participant in the process of the text, rather than a passive listener. To this end, there is no alternative but to force the language of the translation to become the instrument through which the Hebraic voice of the text speaks."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.100","I have taken pains to illustrate some of the rhetorical devices that emerge from an oral reading of the text in order to indicate the direction taken in <i>The Five Books of Moses</i>. A concluding observation must be made. Every critic knows, or should know, that art defies categorization and exact description. We try to understand what makes a masterpiece tick, whether it be a painting, a piece of music, or a work of literature, yet in the end our analyses fall silent before the greatness and subtlety of the work itself. The techniques that I have described above must remain suggestive rather than definitive; they point out a direction rather than speak directly. Biblical narratives do not end with the phrase “The moral of the story is …,” any more than biblical laws overtly spell out their assumptions. Translating with attention to sound therefore may help to preserve not only the message of the text but also its ambiguity and open-endedness. In that persona the Bible has been familiar to Jewish and Christian interpreters, who for centuries have sought to fill in the gaps and resolve the difficulties in the text by means of their own ingenuity. This volume is aimed at helping present-day readers to share in that experience."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.101","Reading the Bible in the literary, rhetorical manner I have just explicated is grounded in certain assumptions about the text. <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> stays close to the basic “masoretic” text-type of the Torah, that is, the vocalized text that has been with us for certain for about a millennium. Deviations from that form, in the interest of solving textual problems, are duly mentioned in the Notes. In following the traditional Hebrew text, I am presenting to the English reader an unreconstructed book, but one whose form is at least verifiable in a long-standing tradition. This translation, therefore, is not a translation of some imagined “original” text, or of the Torah of Moses’ or Solomon’s or even Jeremiah’s time. These documents, could they be shown to have existed for certain or in recognizable form, have not been found, and give little promise of ever being found. <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is, rather, a translation of the biblical text as it might have been known in the formative, postbiblical period of Judaism and early Christianity (the Roman era). As far as the prehistory of the text is concerned, readers who have some familiarity with biblical criticism will note that in my Commentary I have made scant reference to the by-now classic dissection of the Torah into clear-cut prior “sources” (designated J, E, P, and D by the Bible scholars of the past century). Such analysis has been dealt with comprehensively by others (cfi, for instance, Levine on the book of Numbers). In addition, it remains a theoretical construct, and the nature of biblical texts militates against recovering the exact process by which the Bible came into being. In any event, virtually all the standard introductions to the Bible deal with this topic; beyond these, readers may find Friedman (1989) of particular clarity and usefulness."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.102","Given the text that I am using, what has interested me here is chiefly the final form of the Torah books, how they fit together as artistic entities, and how they have combined traditions to present a coherent religious message. This was surely the goal of the final “redactor(s),” but it was not until recently a major goal of biblical scholars. While, therefore, I am not committed to refuting the tenets of source criticism in the strident manner of Benno Jacob and Umberto Cassuto, I have concentrated in this volume on the “wholeness” of biblical texts, rather than on their growth out of fragments. My Commentary is aimed at helping the reader to search for unities and thematic development."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.103","At the same time, in recent years I have found it increasingly fascinating to encounter the text’s complex layering. It appears that every time a biblical story or law was put in a new setting or redaction, its meaning, and the meaning of the whole, must have been somewhat altered. A chorus of different periods and concerns is often discernible, however faintly. Sometimes these function to “deconstruct” each other, and sometimes they actually create a new text. In offering a rendition that does not try to gloss over stylistic differences, I hope that this book will make it possible for an inquisitive reader to sense that process at work. As far as analysis of the text in this manner is concerned, I would recommend to the reader the brilliant work of Greenstein (1985a) and Damrosch (1987)."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.104","Some readers may wonder whether <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is merely an English translation of B-R. It is not. Although B-R served as the theoretical basis for my work, I have found it necessary to modify their approach in the present setting. There are a number of reasons for this."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.105","For one, Bible scholarship has made notable advances since Buber’s heyday (Rosenzweig had already died in 1929). Although he completed the German translation in 1961, and kept abreast of work in the field, it must be said that Buber did not greatly modify the text of the Pentateuch translation, philologically speaking, between 1930 when the second edition appeared and the revised printings of the mid-1950s. It seemed imperative to me to bring the work of postwar biblical philology to bear on the English translation, rather than relying solely on Buber’s etymologies. Some of the changes in this area have been cited in the Notes to the text (as “B-R uses …”)."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.106","Second, in the attempt to make the German translation mirror the Hebrew original Rosenzweig did not hesitate to either create new German words or reach back into the German literature of past ages to find forms suitable for rendering certain Hebrew expressions. To perform a corresponding feat in English would simply not work; the language is not flexible, and usages change so quickly that an artful appeal to the past seems futile except for the benefit of linguistic historians. While I have endeavored to produce an English text that reflects the style of biblical Hebrew, I have in the main shied away from pushing the language beyond reasonable and comprehensible limits."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.107","There are other significant deviations from B-R here. I have used a different rendering of the name of God, which had been a distinctive B-R trademark (for an explanation, see “On the Name of God and Its Translation”). I have sometimes opted for different line divisions, based on my own hearing of the Hebrew; indented purely poetic passages, a practice not followed by B-R in narrative texts; read a large number of clauses differently from a grammatical or syntactical point of view; and loosened the practice, sometimes overdone in B-R, of reproducing a Hebrew root by a single English one wherever it occurs."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.108","It will be noted that I have included here one element that many readers felt was sorely lacking in B-R: notes and commentary. Every translation of the Bible implies a commentary, but few have included one with the text. <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> especially requires such an apparatus, both to explain its translation technique and to show how it may be used fruitfully in interpreting the Bible. Read in conjunction with the text, the explanatory material presents a methodology for studying and teaching the Bible."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.109","Finally, there is the personal aspect of this work. It was conceived as an act of homage to the B-R translation; at the beginning, I desired solely (and rashly) to bring their accomplishment over into English. It was therefore a labor of love, and despite the amount of work involved, a relatively safe one; I did not, at least initially, have to make my own decisions about the biblical text. I should certainly never have undertaken my own translation at that stage."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.110","But working on a project of this nature inevitably leads to things that are not predictable at the outset. It happened exactly as Rosenzweig wrote about his own involvement: like a seduction. It soon became apparent that, not only could I not in good conscience do to English what especially Rosenzweig had done to German, but I was also beginning to find my own voice as creator and scholar in the translation. Thus—although this was not my original intention—I am quite aware that in this book I am presenting a piece of myself as well as an approach to the Bible for English readers."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.111","This having been said, <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is still very much in the B-R tradition. It retains the general approach of its predecessor, exclusive of those principles that are dependent on the form and character of the German language. It is therefore the child of B-R, with all the links and independent features that a parent-child relationship implies. It may also be seen as an attempt to bring the work of B-R into a new era of Bible scholarship, and as an artistic endeavor in its own right."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.112","<i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is heavily indebted to B-R, but one may also view it in a more contemporary context. Over the past two decades, there has been an explosion of “literary” study of the Bible. Numerous scholars have turned their attention to the form and rhetoric of the biblical text, concentrating on its finished form rather than on trying to reconstruct history or the development of the text. Such an approach is hardly new. Already in late antiquity, Jewish interpretation of the Bible often centered around the style and precise wording of the text, especially as heard when read aloud. Similarly, the medieval Jewish commentators of Spain and France showed great sensitivity to the linguistic aspects of the Bible. In both cases, however, no systematic approach was developed; literary interpretation remained interwoven with very different concerns such as homiletics, mysticism, and philosophy."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.113","It has remained for twentieth-century scholars, reacting partly against what they perceived to be the excessive historicizing of German Bible scholarship, to press for a literary reading of the Bible. Early pioneers in this regard include Umberto Cassuto, Buber and (later) Meir Weiss in Israel, and Benno Jacob (who was consulted frequently during the writing of B-R) in Germany. More recently we might mention James Muilenberg (who labeled his holistic approach “Rhetorical Criticism”), Edwin Good, James Ackerman, and Robert Alter in the U.S.; and J. P. Fokkelman in Holland. These names are now the tip of the iceberg, and one can speak of a whole school of interpreters in a literary or rhetorical vein. The reader will find a number of stimulating studies listed in “Suggestions for Further Reading.”"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.114","<i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is akin to many of these efforts, and has benefited directly from them. Although I began my work independently of the literary movement, I have come to feel a kinship with it, and regard my text as one that may be used to study the Bible in a manner consistent with its findings. At the same time, I am not committed to throwing out historical scholarship wholesale. It would be a mistake to set up the two disciplines in an adversarial relationship, as has often been done. The Hebrew Bible is by nature a complex and multi-faceted literature, in both its origins and the history of its use and interpretation. No one “school” can hope to illuminate more than part of the whole picture, and even then, one’s efforts are bound to be fragmentary. Probably, only a synthesis of all fruitful approaches available into a fully interdisciplinary methodology will provide a satisfactory overview of the biblical text (see Greenstein 1989). In this respect, approaching the Bible is analogous to dealing with the arts in general, where a multitude of disciplines from aesthetics to the social and natural sciences is needed to flesh out the whole. I hope that <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> will make a contribution toward this process, by providing an English text, and an underlying reading of the Hebrew, that balances what has appeared previously."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.115","There is another more recent movement in biblical studies which deserves both mention and study. As of this writing, feminist Bible criticism has come into its own. A substantial number of thoughtful and thought-provoking studies have appeared in recent years that examine the portrayal and position of women in biblical texts. One of the glaring gaps in previous Bible scholarship—and one of the difficult issues for contemporary readers of the Bible—lies in coming to terms with the social/sexual milieu assumed by the text. Wrestling with this issue is an appropriate complement to the other types of text-wrestling that have taken place throughout the ages. I have tried to present some of the findings of feminist criticism on the text, and I have listed some appropriate recent works in “Suggestions for Further Reading.”"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.116","To what extent can any translation of the Bible be said to be more “authentic” than another? Because of lack of information about the various original audiences of our text, the translator can only try to be as faithful as the information will allow. This is particularly true where a work as universally known as the Bible is concerned. Even if the precise circumstances surrounding its writing and editing were known, the text would still be affected by the interpretations of the centuries. It is as if a Beethoven symphony were to be performed on period instruments, using nineteenth-century performance techniques: would it still sound as fresh and radical to us as it did in Beethoven’s own day? Thus I would suggest that it is almost impossible to reproduce the Bible’s impact on its contemporaries; all that the translator can do is to perform the task with as much honesty as possible, with a belief in one’s artistic intuition and a consciousness of one’s limitations."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.117","Yet how are we to distinguish the point where explication ends and personal interpretation begins? From the very moment of the Bible’s editing and promulgation, there began the historical process of interpretation, a process which has at times led to violent disagreement between individuals and even nations. Everyone who has ever taken the Bible seriously has staked so much on a particular interpretation of the text that altering it has become close to a matter of life and death. Nothing can be done about this situation, unfortunately, and once again the translator must do the best he or she can. Art, by its very nature, gives rise to interpretation—else it is not great art. The complexity and ambiguity of great literature invites interpretation, just as the complexities and ambiguities of its interpreters encourage a wide range of perspectives. The Hebrew Bible, in which very diverse material has been juxtaposed in a far-ranging collection spanning centuries, rightly or wrongly pushes the commentator and reader to make inner connections and draw overarching conclusions. My interpretations in this book stem from this state of affairs. I have tried to do my work as carefully and as conscientiously as I can, recognizing the problems inherent in this kind of enterprise. I hope the result is not too far from what the biblical editors had intended."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.118","My ultimate goal in this volume has been to show that reading the Hebrew Bible is a process, in the same sense that performing a piece of music is a process. Rather than carrying across (“translating”) the content of the text from one linguistic realm to another, I have tried to involve the reader in the experience of giving it back (“rendering”), of returning to the source and recreating some of its richness. My task has been to present the raw material of the text as best I can in English, and to point out some of the method that may be fruitfully employed in wrestling with it."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.119","Buber and Rosenzweig translated the Bible out of the deep conviction that language has the power to bridge worlds and to redeem human beings. They both, separately and together, fought to restore the power of ancient words and to speak modern ones with wholeness and genuineness. Despite the barriers in their own lives—Buber’s early disappointments, Rosenzweig’s struggle with German idealism and later with a terrible paralysis that left him unable to speak—they each came to see dialogue as a central fact of interhuman and human-divine relations."
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.120","The era in which we live, seventy years after the first appearance of the Buber-Rosenzweig <i>Im Anfang</i> (Genesis), is, however, heir to many decades of a very different experience. Since 1933, but beginning certainly well before, the Western world has experienced the debasement and trivialization of human language, and thus of divine language as well. From Stalin’s and Hitler’s speeches, to Orwell’s visions, to the reality of Vietnam War jargon and on to the babble of television and advertising, words seem to have lost their elemental meaningfulness in a way that the optimistic nineteenth century into which Buber and Rosenzweig were born could not have dared to believe. In this situation, can a translation of ancient books, even though they are from the Bible, have anything to say, or are they merely a “message from a dead man,” to use Kafka’s poignant expression?"
"Torah, Introduction, Translator’s Preface.121","Yet Buber and Rosenzweig knew that language lives only in the mouths of speakers, human beings who face each other and who at every moment of conversation and contact literally translate for one another. The reading of the Bible is hopefully a cultural means for reawakening that conversation, for in the struggle to understand and apply these texts, one may come to perceive the importance of real words. A Bible translation should be the occasion for reaffirming the human desire to speak and be heard, for encouraging people to view their lives as a series of statements and responses—conversations, really. In sending the reader back to the text, the Buber-Rosenzweig Bible sought to counter the deadness of contemporary language and contemporary living which were all too apparent at the turn of the century, even before war and genocide began to take their toll. As we approach the end of that century, the same problems remain, altered further by the present revolution in communications. Amid the overcrowded air of cyberspace, the Hebrew Bible may still come to tell us that we do not live by bread alone, and that careful and loving attention to ancient words may help us to form the modern ones that we need."

"Torah, Introduction, On the Name of God and Its Translation.1","T<small>HE READER WILL IMMEDIATELY NOTICE THAT THE PERSONAL NAME OF THE BIBLICAL</small> God appears in this volume as “Y<small>HWH</small>.” That is pretty standard scholarly practice, but it does not indicate how the name should be pronounced. I would recommend the use of traditional “the Lord” in reading aloud, but others may wish to follow their own custom. While the visual effect of “Y<small>HWH</small>” may be jarring at first, it has the merit of approximating the situation of the Hebrew text as we now have it, and of leaving open the unsolved question of the pronunciation and meaning of God’s name. Some explanation is in order."
"Torah, Introduction, On the Name of God and Its Translation.2","The name of God has undergone numerous changes in both its writing and translation throughout the history of the Bible. At an early period the correct pronunciation of the name was either lost or deliberately avoided out of a sense of religious awe. Jewish tradition came to vocalize and pronounce the name as “Adonai,” that is, “the/my Lord,” a usage that has remained in practice since late antiquity. Another euphemism, regularly used among Orthodox Jews today, is “Ha-Shem,” literally, “The Name.”"
"Torah, Introduction, On the Name of God and Its Translation.3","Historically, Jewish and Christian translations of the Bible into English have tended to use “Lord,” with some exceptions (notably, Moffatt’s “The Eternal”). Both old and new attempts to recover the “correct” pronunciation of the Hebrew name have not succeeded; neither the sometimes-heard “Jehovah” nor the standard scholarly “Yahweh” can be conclusively proven."
"Torah, Introduction, On the Name of God and Its Translation.4","For their part, Buber and Rosenzweig sought to restore some of what they felt was the name’s ancient power; early drafts of their Genesis translation reveal a good deal of experimentation in this regard. They finally settled on a radical solution: representing the name by means of capitalized personal pronouns. The use of You, He, Him, etc., stemmed from their conviction that God’s name is not a proper name in the conventional sense, but rather one which evokes his immediate presence. Buber and Rosenzweig—both of whom wrote a great deal about their interpretation (see Buber and Rosenzweig 1994) based it on their reading of Ex. 3:14, a text in which another verbal form of Y<small>HWH</small> appears, and which they translated as “I will be-there howsoever I will be-there” (i.e., my name is not a magical handle through which I can be conjured up; I am ever-present). For more on this passage, and the name, see the Commentary and Notes in the text below."
"Torah, Introduction, On the Name of God and Its Translation.5","The B-R rendering has its attractiveness in reading aloud, as is demonstrated by recordings of Buber reading his text, but it is on doubtful grounds etymologically. It also introduces an overly male emphasis through its constant use of “H<small>E</small>,” an emphasis which is not quite so pronounced in the Hebrew. For these reasons, and out of a desire to reflect the experience of the Hebrew reader, I have followed the practice of transcribing the name as Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Introduction, On the Name of God and Its Translation.6","Readers who are uncomfortable with the maleness of God in these texts may wish to substitute “God” for “he” in appropriate passages. While, as a translator, I am committed to reproducing the text as faithfully as I can, it is also true that the ancient Hebrews viewed God as a divinity beyond sexuality, and modern readers as well may see fit to acknowledge this."

"Torah, Introduction, To Aid the Reader of Genesis and Exodus.2","Since I have espoused a “rhetorical” approach to biblical texts in my work, I have decided to limit myself largely to literary remarks in the Commentary: indicating themes and motifs as they appear and are developed in these books and elsewhere in the Bible; pointing out structural aspects of the text; and treating issues of character development in the narrative. I have by and large eschewed historical issues, and those pertaining to the origins and textual history of Genesis and Exodus. These matters, which are highly theoretical and subject to detailed and often heated scholarly discussion, are treated comprehensively in standard works such as Speiser (1964) for Genesis and Childs (1974) for Exodus (see also the volumes of the Jewish Publication Society’s <i>The Torah Commentary</i>, currently appearing). More detailed information on the ancient Near Eastern background and parallels to Genesis and Exodus can be found in Cassuto (1967, 1972/1974) and Sarna (1966, 1986). Readers whose interest is primarily archaeological will seek works such as Mazar (1990)."
"Torah, Genesis.1.1","<i>God as Creator</i> (1:1–2:4a): Three principal themes emerge from the great creation account with which Genesis opens. The first is the total and uncompromised power of God as creator; the second, the intrinsic order and balance of the created world; and the third, humankind’s key position in the scheme of creation. These themes are brought home as much by the form in which they are presented as by their actual mention."
"Torah, Genesis.1.2","God (Heb. <i>elohim</i>, a generic term) is introduced into the narrative without any description of origins, sex, or limitations of power. As the only functioning character of the chapter, he occupies center stage. There is no opposition, no resistance to his acts of creation, which occur in perfect harmony with his express word."
"Torah, Genesis.1.3","As a sign of both God’s total control and his intent, the world unfolds in symmetrical order. The division of God’s labor into six days, plus a seventh for rest, itself indicates a powerful meaningfulness at work, as well as providing the external structure for the narrative. Interpreters have tended to divide these into either three groups of two days or two groups of three, with always the same results: a balanced and harmonious whole. In addition, the number seven is significant (as it will be elsewhere in the Bible) as a symbol of perfection, not only in Israel but in the ancient world in general."
"Torah, Genesis.1.4","The narrative uses several repeating words and phrases to both unify the story and underscore the theme of order. These include “God said,” “Let there be…,” “God saw that it was good,” “It was so,” and “There was setting, there was dawning. …”"

"Torah, Genesis.1.6","The text is so formed as to highlight the creation of humankind.

Humanity, created in the divine “image,” is to hold sway over the rest of creation. Only with the addition of humankind is God able to survey his newly formed world and to pronounce it “exceedingly good” (v.31)."
"Torah, Genesis.1.7","At least two motifs appear in this chapter which will become important later in Genesis. The three occurrences of “blessing” (1:22, 1:28, 2:3) point to a central idea in the Patriarchal stories. In addition the concept of order and its logical conclusion—that history makes sense—figures prominently in the familial histories of the book. This is accomplished largely by the meaningful use of numbers, as above."
"Torah, Genesis.1.8","The entire account concludes (2:1–3) with a tightly structured poem. “God,” “the seventh day,” “work,” and “made” are mentioned three times, “finished,” “ceased,” and “all” twice; and “created” returns, echoing 1:1, to round out the whole creation narrative."
"Torah, Genesis.1.9","The postscript (2:4a; some scholars align it with what follows in Chap. 2 instead) introduces the key structural phrase of Genesis, “These are the begettings.…” It may also indicate the polemical intent of the creation story. Rosenzweig understood the verse to contrast “begetting,” i.e., sexual creation as it occurs in non-Israelite myths, with the “true” creation."
"Torah, Genesis.1.10","In that vein, a final word needs to be said about extrabiblical evidence. As has often been pointed out, Gen. I is unmistakably reacting against prevailing Near Eastern cosmogonies of the time. Most of the cultures surrounding ancient Israel had elaborate creation stories, highlighting the birth, sexuality, and violent uprisings of the gods. As we indicated at the outset, the concept of God presented here militates against such ideas, arguing chiefly out of omission and silence. (It should also be noted that in poetic books such as Isaiah, Job, and Psalms, a tradition about violent conflict at creation has been preserved.) The Genesis narrative has taken such old mythological motifs as battles with the primeval (female) waters or with sea monsters and eliminated or neutralized them. What remains is both utterly simple and radical in its time."

"Torah, Genesis.1.93",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.1.94","1 <b>At the beginning…</b>:This phrase, which has long been the focus of debate among grammarians, is traditionally read: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” B-R agrees, I have followed several medieval commentators, and most moderns, in my rendition, <b>creating:</b> Indicative of God’s power and not used in reference to humans, although later in the chapter such words as “make” and “form” do appear, <b>the heavens and the earth:</b> Probably a merism—an inclusive idiom meaning “everything” or “everywhere“—such as in Hamlet’s “There are more things in heaven and earth. …”"
"Torah, Genesis.1.95","2 <b>when the earth … :</b> Gen. 1 describes God’s bringing order out of chaos, not creation from nothingness. <b>wild and waste:</b> Heb. <i>tohu va-vohu</i>, indicating “emptiness.” <b>Ocean:</b> The primeval waters, a common (and usually divine) image in ancient Near Eastern mythology, <b>rushing-spirit:</b> Others, “wind.” The Hebrew word <i>ruah</i> can mean both “spirit” and “wind.” See Ps. 33:6. <b>hovering:</b> Or “flitting.” The image suggested by the word (see Deut. 32:11) is that of an eagle protecting its young."
"Torah, Genesis.1.96","3-5 <b>God said … God saw … God separated … God called:</b> Here, from the outset of the story, the principle of order is stressed, through the rhythmic structure of “God” plus verb, four times."
"Torah, Genesis.1.97","4 <b>God saw … that it was good:</b> The syntax is emphatic; others use “God saw how good it was.” The phrase is reminiscent of ancient Near Eastern descriptions of a craftsman being pleased with his work. <b>separated:</b> The verb occurs four more times early in the chapter (vv.6, 7, 14, 18), and further points to the motif of order."
"Torah, Genesis.1.98",5 <b>setting … dawning:</b> The Heb. terms <i>erev</i> and <i>boker</i> are rather more specific than the usual “evening” and “morning.” Elsewhere I have used “sunset” and “daybreak”; the latter would have clashed with “day” in these lines.
"Torah, Genesis.1.99","6 <b>dome:</b> Heb. <i>raki’a</i>, literally a beaten sheet of metal."
"Torah, Genesis.1.100",8 <b>Heaven!:</b> The sky.
"Torah, Genesis.1.101","11 <b>sprout forth with sprouting-growth … seed forth seeds … fruit trees … fruit:</b> The three sound doublets create a poetic effect in God’s pronouncement. Note that they are not repeated by the narrator in verse 12. See also v.20, “… swarm with a swarm …” <b>after their kind:</b> Here as in a number of passages in the translation I have shifted some words that occur in the singular (especially collectives) for the sake of clarity. See, for example, 6:3, 5."
"Torah, Genesis.1.102",14 <b>lights:</b> In the sense of “lamps.” <b>for signs—for set-times …</b>: Hebrew difficult.
"Torah, Genesis.1.103",21 <b>great sea-serpents:</b> The rebellious primeval monster of Ps. 74:13 (and common in ancient Near Eastern myth) is here depicted as merely another one of God’s many creations.
"Torah, Genesis.1.104","22 <b>And God blessed them:</b> The first occurrence in Genesis of the key motif of blessing, which recurs especially throughout the Patriarchal stories. <b>Bear fruit and be many and fill:</b> Heb. <i>peru u-revu u-mil’u</i>."
"Torah, Genesis.1.105","26 <b>in our image:</b> The “our” is an old problem. Some take it to refer to the heavenly court (although, not surprisingly, no angels are mentioned here)."
"Torah, Genesis.1.106","27 <b>God created humankind:</b> The narrative breaks into verse, stressing the importance of human beings. “Humankind” (Heb. <i>adam</i>) does not specify sex, as is clear from the last line of the poem."
"Torah, Genesis.1.107",29 <b>I give you:</b> “You” in the plural.
"Torah, Genesis.1.108","30 <b>all green plants for eating:</b> Human beings in their original state were not meat-eaters. For the change, see 9:3ff."
"Torah, Genesis.1.109","31 <b>exceedingly good … the sixth day:</b> The two qualifiers “exceedingly” and “the” are deviations from the previous expressions in the story, and underscore the sixth day (when humankind was created) as the crowning achievement of creation (or else serve as a summary to the whole)."
"Torah, Genesis.2.1","<i>Garden and Expulsion</i> (2:4–3:24): From the perspective of God in Chap. 1, we now switch to that of humankind (note how the opening phrase in 2:4, “earth and heaven,” reverses the order found in 1:1). This most famous of all Genesis stories contains an assortment of mythic elements and images which are common to human views of prehistory: the lush garden, four central rivers located (at least partially) in fabled lands, the mysterious trees anchoring the garden (and the world?), a primeval man and woman living in unashamed nakedness, an animal that talks, and a God who converses regularly and intimately with his creatures. The narrative presents itself, at least on the surface, as a story of origins. We are to learn the roots of human sexual feelings, of pain in childbirth, and how the anomalous snake (a land creature with no legs) came to assume its present form. Most strikingly, of course, the story seeks to explain the origin of the event most central to human consciousness: death."
"Torah, Genesis.2.2","The narrative unfolds through a series of contrasts: good and evil, life and death, heaven and earth, give and take, knowledge and ignorance, humans and animals, hiding and revealing. Some of these concepts appear literally as key words in the text. The characters also appear through contrasts: man as God’s image and as dust, woman as helper and hinderer, the snake as shrewd and (after the curse) lowly."
"Torah, Genesis.2.3","A further focus is provided by the echoing of the word “eat,” whose connotation changes from sustenance/bounty (2:9, 16) to prohibition (2:17) to misunderstanding (3:1–5) and disobedience (3:6, 11–13), and finally to curse (3:14, 17, 19). Such a flexible use of words sets up a rhythmic drama which, as much of Genesis, bears resemblance to poetry rather than to prose."
"Torah, Genesis.2.4","Part I of the story (Chap. 2) sets the stage in the garden, focusing on <i>Adam</i>, “Everyman” (see <i>Cambridge Bible Commentary</i>, Gen. I–II). God is here regularly called “Y<small>HWH</small>, God,” a rare designation which may suggest a preexpulsion view of the wholeness of God as well as of humankind. Man continues his status as “God’s image” (1:26–27), imitating the divine act of giving names (1:5, 8, 10). He is also nevertheless a creature of the dust, both at the beginning (2:7) and end (3:19) of the story."
"Torah, Genesis.2.5","The bridge to Part II (Chap. 3) is deftly accomplished by linking two identical­sounding words in the Hebrew, <i>arum</i> (here, “nude” and “shrewd”). The choice of the snake as the third character is typically ancient Near Eastern (it is so used in other stories about death and immortality, such as the <i>Gilgamesh Epic</i> from Mesopotamia). Some interpreters have seen sexual overtones in this choice as well. Yet a plain reading of the text need not overemphasize the snake, who disappears as a personality once the fatal fruit has been eaten."
"Torah, Genesis.2.6","The ending of the story has also raised questions of interpretation. Buber was among those who see in the act of expulsion from the garden a deed of mercy rather than one of fear or jealousy. Certainly a creature whose first act upon acquiring new “knowledge” is to cover himself up poses no threat to the Creator. The text, like its late successor, the book of Job, may be suggesting that in the human sphere, unlike the divine, knowledge and mortality are inextricably linked. This is a tragic realization, but it is also the world as human beings know it."
"Torah, Genesis.2.7","Although the specifics of this story are never again referred to in the Hebrew Bible, and are certainly not crucial for the rest of Genesis, one general theme <i>is</i> central to the Bible’s worldview. This is that rebellion against or disobedience toward God and his laws results in banishment/estrangement and, literally or figuratively, death. Thus from the beginning the element of <i>choice</i>, so much stressed by the Prophets later on, is seen as the major element in human existence."
"Torah, Genesis.2.8","All this said, it should be recognized that the garden story, like many biblical texts, has been the subject of endless interpretation. One line of thought takes the psychological point of view. The story resembles a vision of childhood and of the transition to the contradictions and pain of adolescence and adulthood. In every way—moral, sexual, and intellectual—Adam and Havva are like children, and their actions after partaking of the fruit seem like the actions of those who are unable to cope with newfound powers. The resolution of the story, banishment from the garden, suggests the tragic realization that human beings must make their way through the world with the knowledge of death and with great physical difficulty. At the same time the archetypal man and woman do not make the journey alone. They are provided with protection (clothing), given to them by the same God who punished them for their disobedience. We thus symbolically enter adulthood with the realization that being turned out of Paradise does not mean eternal rejection or hopelessness."
"Torah, Genesis.2.9","2:1 Thus were finished the heavens and the earth, with all of their array."
"Torah, Genesis.2.10","2 God had finished, on the seventh day, his work that he had made,"
"Torah, Genesis.2.11","and then he ceased, on the seventh day, from all his work that he had made."
"Torah, Genesis.2.12","3 God gave the seventh day his blessing, and he hallowed it,"
"Torah, Genesis.2.13","for on it he ceased from all his work, that by creating, God had made."
"Torah, Genesis.2.14",4 These are the begettings of the heavens and the earth: their being created.

"Torah, Genesis.2.22",he blew into his nostrils the breath of life
"Torah, Genesis.2.23",and the human became a living being.
"Torah, Genesis.2.24","8 Y<small>HWH</small>, God, planted a garden in Eden/Land-of-Pleasure, in the east,"
"Torah, Genesis.2.25",and there he placed the human whom he had formed.

"Torah, Genesis.2.28",and the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden
"Torah, Genesis.2.29",and the Tree of the Knowing of Good and Evil.
"Torah, Genesis.2.30","10 Now a river goes out from Eden, to water the garden,"
"Torah, Genesis.2.31",and from there it divides and becomes four stream-heads.

"Torah, Genesis.2.47","19 So Y<small>HWH</small>, God, formed from the soil every living-thing of the field and every fowl of the heavens"

"Torah, Genesis.2.52","21 So Y<small>HWH</small>, God, caused a deep slumber to fall upon the human, so that he slept,"
"Torah, Genesis.2.53",he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.
"Torah, Genesis.2.54","22 Y<small>HWH</small>, God, built the rib that he had taken from the human into a woman"

In addition the concept of <i>sin</i> is introduced (Rosenzweig), having not appeared by name previously."
"Torah, Genesis.3.2","One may observe significant links to the garden story. Once again human beings are given a choice; once again disregarding the warning leads to death and estrangement from God; and once again the primal bond between humanity and the soil is ruptured. Chapter 3 is directly recalled by the use of specific wording: God echoes the curse he had put on the woman (3:16) in his warning to Kayin (4:7), and “Where is Hevel your brother?” (4:9) brings to mind “Where are you?” (3:9), which had been addressed to Kayin’s father."
"Torah, Genesis.3.3","The text is punctuated by the use of “brother,” a meaningful seven times, as well as by changing connotations of the word “face” (Kayin, unable to bring about a lifting of his own face, becomes estranged from God’s). Repetition also helps to convey the harshness of Kayin’s punishment: he is exiled to the “land of Nod/Wandering” (v.16), for which we have been prepared by the “wavering and wandering” of verses 12 and 14."
"Torah, Genesis.3.4","Although this story may well have originated as a tale of enmity between two ways of life (farmer and shepherd), or in another context, it has obviously been transformed into something far more disturbing and universal."

The first of these deals with origins: of cities, of certain crafts, and of worship. The former two are associated (perhaps negatively) with Kayin s line. The only personality in these texts about whom we learn anything is Lemekh—and his “saying” (vv.23–24) seems hopelessly obscure. Some interpreters have understood it as a challenge to God, and thus believe that it has been included here as an example of the wickedness typical of the generations that preceded the Flood."
"Torah, Genesis.3.6",The names of Adam and Havva’s son and grandson (vv.25–26) are sad reminders of Hevel’s death—a personal touch in an otherwise prosaic section of narrative.

"Torah, Genesis.3.47","14 Here, you drive me away today from the face of the soil,"
"Torah, Genesis.3.48","and from your face must I conceal myself,"
"Torah, Genesis.3.49",I must be wavering and wandering on earth—
"Torah, Genesis.3.50",now it will be
"Torah, Genesis.3.51",that whoever comes upon me will kill me!
"Torah, Genesis.3.52",15 Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.3.53","No, therefore,"
"Torah, Genesis.3.54","whoever kills Kayin, sevenfold will it be avenged!"
"Torah, Genesis.3.55","So Y<small>HWH</small> set a sign for Kayin,"

"Torah, Genesis.3.57",16 Kayin went out from the face of Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Genesis.3.58","and settled in the land of Nod/Wandering, east of Eden."
"Torah, Genesis.3.59",17 Kayin knew his wife;
"Torah, Genesis.3.60",she became pregnant and bore Hanokh.
"Torah, Genesis.3.61",Now he became the builder of a city

Cassuto has tried to fit them into a defined scheme, showing that the purpose, and achieved effect, of our text is to convey that human history follows a meaningful pattern. Pride of place on the list is occupied by the seventh member, Hanokh, who is portrayed as the first man of God. He serves as a preparation for Noah, who also “walks in accord with God” (6:9). Hanokh’s life span, 365 years, exemplifies the number scheme of Genesis: as an expression of numerical perfection (the number of days in a year), it symbolizes moral perfection."

"Torah, Genesis.4.56","5:1 <b>At the time …:</b> The language is reminiscent of the earlier poem in 1:27. In this case, however, the Hebrew creates a rhyming effect. The cola of the poem here end thus: <i>bera’am / otam / shemam: Adam / hibare’am</i>. Such a rhyming scheme is rare in biblical Hebrew, and usually endows a passage with particular significance (see also, for instance, II Sam. 12:11)."
"Torah, Genesis.4.57",18 <b>Hanokh:</b> Trad. English “Enoch.”
"Torah, Genesis.4.58","22 <b>and Hanokh walked in accord with God … three hundred years:</b> The variation from the rigid formulations of this chapter draws attention to this key figure, the first pious man (similarly with Noah, 5:29). “Walked in accord with God” means walked in God’s ways, led a righteous life."
"Torah, Genesis.4.59","24 <b>then he was no more:</b> He died. Later interpreters found the phrase ambiguous, and fantastic postbiblical legends arose concerning Hanokh (see Ginzberg)."
"Torah, Genesis.4.60","31 <b>seventy-seven years and seven hundred years:</b> As in 4:24, a man named Lemekh is linked to multiples of seven."
"Torah, Genesis.5.1","<i>Antiquity and the Preparation for the Flood</i> (6:1–8): The final pre-Flood section of the text includes a theme common to other ancient tales: the biological mixing of gods and men in dim antiquity. Perhaps this fragment, which initially seems difficult to reconcile with biblical ideas about God, has been retained here to round out a picture familiar to ancient readers, and to recall the early closeness of the divine and the human which, according to many cultures, later dissolved. It is also possible that the episode serves as another example of a world that has become disordered, thus providing further justification for a divinely ordered destruction."
"Torah, Genesis.5.2","The stage is set for the Flood by means of a powerful sound reference. In 5:29 Noah was named, ostensibly to comfort his elders’ “sorrow” over human “pains” in tilling the soil. Here (6:6), however, the meaning of the name has been ironically reversed. The one who was supposed to bring comfort only heralds God’s own being “sorry” and “pained” (vv. 6–7). A similar ironic wordplay, where the audience knows what the name-bestower does not, occurs in Ex. 2:3; curiously, the hero of that passage, the baby Moses, is also connected with an “ark”—the term for the little basket in which he is set adrift."
"Torah, Genesis.5.3","<i>The Deluge</i> (6:9–8:19): The biblical account of the Flood is replete with echoes and allusions which point to three clear motifs: God’s justice, the totality of punishment, and a new beginning patterned after Gen. I."
"Torah, Genesis.5.4","The first of these is brought out in 6:11–13: the repetition of the word “ruin” indicates not only the sorry state of society but also the principle of just retaliation, for God is to “bring ruin” upon the earth (v.13)."
"Torah, Genesis.5.5","The totality of the disaster is conveyed by the repeated use of the word “all” in 7:21–23, as well as by the completeness of the list of those destroyed (7:21–23). Humans, as befits their place in the order of creation, appear last, but actually it is they who drag virtually all of creation down with them. This reflects a deeply held biblical idea that human action directly affects the orderly and otherwise neutral functioning of nature."
"Torah, Genesis.5.6","There are striking parallels between the Flood narrative and the creation account of Chap. 1. Just as the animals were created, each “according to its kind,” their rescue, both in boarding and leaving the Ark, is similarly worded. “Ocean” and the great “rushing-wind” which existed at creation (1:2) return here, the former to signify a lapse into chaos and the latter, the restoration of order and peace (7:11, 8:1). Finally, after the Flood (9:1–3) Noah is blessed in wording that recalls Adam’s blessing in 1:28–30. The world thus begins anew, with the implication of some hope for the future."
"Torah, Genesis.5.7","Repetition emphasizes other aspects of the story’s message. In general the word-stem “live” occurs constantly throughout the text, highlighting the rescue and renewal of life as well as its destruction. Noah’s obedience, another major theme, is indicated by variations on the phrase “according to all that God commanded him, so he did” (6:22). Of rhythmical, almost ritual-sounding import is the phrase “you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives.”"
"Torah, Genesis.5.8","Our story has often been compared, with much justification, to the several Mesopotamian Flood accounts (e.g., in the <i>Gilgamesh</i> and <i>Atrahasis</i> epics), with which it shares a great deal of detail. At one time scholars were quick to concentrate on the parallels, but the differences are now recognized as being much more significant. In general one may say that in contrast to the earlier (Mesopotamian) versions the biblical one is unambiguous in both tone and intent. It has been placed in Genesis to exemplify a God who judges the world according to human behavior, punishes evil and rescues the righteous. This is a far cry from the earlier accounts, where the gods plan the destruction of the world for reasons that are unclear (or in one version, because humankind’s noise is disturbing the sleep of the gods), and where the protagonist, Utnapishtim, is saved as the result of a god’s favoritism without any moral judgments being passed."
"Torah, Genesis.5.9",6:1 Now it was when humans first became many on the face of the soil
"Torah, Genesis.5.10","and women were born to them,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.11","2 that the divine beings saw how beautiful the human women were,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.12","so they took themselves wives, whomever they chose."
"Torah, Genesis.5.13",3 Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"Torah, Genesis.5.14","My rushing-spirit shall not remain in humankind for ages, for they too are flesh;"
"Torah, Genesis.5.15",let their days be then a hundred and twenty years!
"Torah, Genesis.5.16","4 The giants were on earth in those days,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.17","and afterward as well,"

"Torah, Genesis.5.19",and they bore them (children)—
"Torah, Genesis.5.20","they were the heroes who were of former ages, the men of name."
"Torah, Genesis.5.21",5 And Y<small>HWH</small> saw
"Torah, Genesis.5.22",that great was humankind’s evildoing on earth
"Torah, Genesis.5.23",and every form of their heart’s planning was only evil all the day.
"Torah, Genesis.5.24",6 Then Y<small>HWH</small> was sorry
"Torah, Genesis.5.25","that he had made humankind on earth,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.26",and it pained his heart.
"Torah, Genesis.5.27",7 Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"Torah, Genesis.5.28","I will blot out humankind, whom I have created, from the face of the soil,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.29","from man to beast, to crawling thing and to the fowl of the heavens,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.30",for I am sorry that I made them.

"Torah, Genesis.5.32",9 These are the begettings of Noah.
"Torah, Genesis.5.33","Noah was a righteous, wholehearted man in his generation,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.34",in accord with God did Noah walk.
"Torah, Genesis.5.35","10 Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Yefet."
"Torah, Genesis.5.36","11 Now the earth had gone-to-ruin before God, the earth was filled with wrongdoing."
"Torah, Genesis.5.37","12 God saw the earth, and here: it had gone-to-ruin,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.38",for all flesh had ruined its way upon the earth.
"Torah, Genesis.5.39",13 God said to Noah:
"Torah, Genesis.5.40","An end of all flesh has come before me,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.41",for the earth is filled with wrongdoing through them;
"Torah, Genesis.5.42","here, I am about to bring-ruin upon them, along with the earth."
"Torah, Genesis.5.43","14 Make yourself an Ark of <i>gofer</i> wood,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.44","with reeds make the Ark,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.45",and cover it within and without with a covering-of-pitch.
"Torah, Genesis.5.46",15 And this is how you are to make it:
"Torah, Genesis.5.47","Three hundred cubits the length of the Ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height."
"Torah, Genesis.5.48","16 A skylight you are to make for the Ark, finishing it to a cubit upward."
"Torah, Genesis.5.49",The entrance of the Ark you are to set in its side;
"Torah, Genesis.5.50","with a lower, a second, and a third deck you are to make it."
"Torah, Genesis.5.51","17 As for me,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.52","here, I am about to bring on the Deluge, water upon the earth,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.53","to bring ruin upon all flesh that has rush of life in it, from under the heavens,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.54",all that is on earth will perish.
"Torah, Genesis.5.55",18 But I will establish my covenant with you:
"Torah, Genesis.5.56","you are to come into the Ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.57","19 and from all living-things, from all flesh, you are to bring two from all into the Ark, to remain alive with you."
"Torah, Genesis.5.58","They are to be a male and a female (each),"

"Torah, Genesis.5.63","it shall be for you and for them, for eating."
"Torah, Genesis.5.64","22 Noah did it,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.65","according to all that God commanded him, so he did."
"Torah, Genesis.5.66",7:1 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Noah:
"Torah, Genesis.5.67","Come, you and all your household, into the Ark!"
"Torah, Genesis.5.68",For you I have seen as righteous before me in this generation.
"Torah, Genesis.5.69","2 From all (ritually) pure animals you are to take seven and seven (each), a male and his mate,"

"Torah, Genesis.5.72",to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
"Torah, Genesis.5.73",4 For in yet seven days
"Torah, Genesis.5.74",I will make it rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights
"Torah, Genesis.5.75","and will blot out all existing-things that I have made, from the face of the soil."
"Torah, Genesis.5.76","5 Noah did it, according to all that Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him."
"Torah, Genesis.5.77","6 Noah was six hundred years old when the Deluge occurred, water upon the earth;"

"Torah, Genesis.5.79",8 From the pure animals and from the animals that are not pure and from the fowl and all that crawls about on the soil—
"Torah, Genesis.5.80","9 two and two (each) came to Noah, into the Ark, male and female, as God had commanded Noah."
"Torah, Genesis.5.81",10 After the seven days it was
"Torah, Genesis.5.82",that the waters of the Deluge were upon the earth.
"Torah, Genesis.5.83","11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second New-Moon, on the seventeenth day after the New-Moon,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.84",on that day:
"Torah, Genesis.5.85",then burst all the well-springs of the great Ocean
"Torah, Genesis.5.86",and the sluices of the heavens opened up.
"Torah, Genesis.5.87",12 The torrent was upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.
"Torah, Genesis.5.88","13 On that very day came Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Yefet, Noah’s sons, and Noah’s wife and his three sons’ wives with them, into the Ark,"
"Torah, Genesis.5.89","14 they and all wildlife after their kind, all herd-animals after their kind, all crawling things that crawl upon the earth after their kind, all fowl after their kind, all chirping-things, all winged-things;"

"Torah, Genesis.5.92",as God had commanded him.
"Torah, Genesis.5.93",Y<small>HWH</small> closed (the door) upon him.
"Torah, Genesis.5.94",17 The Deluge was forty days upon the earth.
"Torah, Genesis.5.95","The waters increased and lifted the Ark, so that it was raised above the earth;"

"Torah, Genesis.5.124","7:2 <b>(ritually) pure:</b> An anachronism, referring to later Israelite laws about sacrifice and eating, <b>seven and seven each:</b> The contradiction between this and 6:19 has led scholars to posit two different sources for the story, <b>male:</b> Lit. “a man.”"

"Torah, Genesis.6.1","<i>Aftermath</i> (8:20–9:19): The passages immediately following the Flood narrative speak of a God who is remarkably receptive to a human kind of change. From having been “sorry” that he created humankind (6:6), he now evinces a change of heart about the entire issue of evil, conceding human imperfections (8:21). In a wonderfully structured declaration, where “never again” moves in position from the middle to the beginning of the phrase (8:21–22), God as it were chooses to restrain his own ability to radically disturb the processes of nature. Where later on in Genesis the human characters exhibit the capacity to change, here it is God himself."
"Torah, Genesis.6.2","The blessing in 9:1–3 establishes Noah as a kind of second Adam (and it might be noted that chronologically Noah is the first man born after Adam dies). It repeats the basic formulation of the blessing in 1:28–30, with an important exception: meat-eating is now to be allowed, as part of God’s concession to human nature. Previously only the plant world had been accessible to humankind for food. However—and this very word punctuates the text twice in 9:4–5—there is to be an accounting for willful bloodshed, as if to suggest that the eating of meat is being permitted only under strict conditions. To underscore the importance of this concept, the section about bloodshed uses the vocabulary of creation: human beings are made “in the image of God.”"
"Torah, Genesis.6.3","With vv.8 and 9 the key concept of “covenant” is established in fact for the first time in the Bible. It is accompanied, as is usual in the Bible, by a symbol or “sign” (in this case, the rainbow). We are led back to the creation story again, as other biblical texts speak of the Sabbath as a “sign of the covenant” between God and Israel (e.g., Ex. 31:12–17)."
"Torah, Genesis.6.4",The sixfold repetition of the phrase “never again” provides a thematic unity in these passages.
"Torah, Genesis.6.5","8:1 But God paid mind to Noah and all living-things, all the animals that were with him in the Ark,"
"Torah, Genesis.6.6","and God brought a rushing-wind across the earth, so that the waters abated."

"Torah, Genesis.6.11","4 And the Ark came to rest in the seventh New-Moon, on the seventeenth day after the New-Moon, upon the mountains of Ararat."
"Torah, Genesis.6.12",5 Now the waters continued to advance and diminish until the tenth New-Moon.
"Torah, Genesis.6.13","On the tenth, on the first day of the New-Moon, the tops of the mountains could be seen."
"Torah, Genesis.6.14",6 At the end of forty days it was: Noah opened the window of
"Torah, Genesis.6.15","7 the Ark that he had made, / and sent out a raven;"
"Torah, Genesis.6.16","it went off, going off and returning, until the waters were"
"Torah, Genesis.6.17",dried up from upon the earth.
"Torah, Genesis.6.18","8 Then he sent out a dove from him, to see whether the waters had subsided from the face of the soil."
"Torah, Genesis.6.19","9 But the dove found no resting-place for the sole of her foot,"
"Torah, Genesis.6.20","so she returned to him into the Ark,"
"Torah, Genesis.6.21",for there was water upon the face of all the earth.
"Torah, Genesis.6.22","He sent forth his hand and took her, and brought her to him into the Ark."
"Torah, Genesis.6.23",10 Then he waited yet another seven days

"Torah, Genesis.6.36","14 Now in the second New-Moon, on the twenty-seventh day after the New-Moon, the earth was (completely) dry."

The soil, which evidently has not entirely shaken off its primeval curse, proves once again to be a source of trouble. The nature of the crime mentioned here (“seeing the father’s nakedness”) has been variously interpreted; Buber and others see in it a reference to the sexual “immorality” of the Canaanites, which the Israelites found particularly abhorrent.

"Torah, Genesis.7.39",between God and all living beings—
"Torah, Genesis.7.40",all flesh that is upon the earth.
"Torah, Genesis.7.41",17 God said to Noah:
"Torah, Genesis.7.42",This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
"Torah, Genesis.7.43","18 Noah’s sons who went out of the Ark were Shem, Ham, and Yefet."
"Torah, Genesis.7.44",Now Ham is the father of Canaan.
"Torah, Genesis.7.45","19 These three were Noah’s sons, and from these were scattered abroad all the earth-folk."
"Torah, Genesis.7.46",20 And Noah was the first man of the soil; he planted a vineyard.
"Torah, Genesis.7.47","21 When he drank from the wine, he became drunk and exposed himself in the middle of his tent."
"Torah, Genesis.7.48","22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside."
"Torah, Genesis.7.49","23 Then Shem and Yefet took a cloak, they put it on the shoulders of the two of them,"
"Torah, Genesis.7.50","and walked backward, to cover their father’s nakedness."
"Torah, Genesis.7.51","—Their faces were turned backward, their father’s nakedness they did not see."
"Torah, Genesis.7.52","24 When Noah awoke from his wine, it became known (to him) what his littlest son had done to him."
"Torah, Genesis.7.53",25 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.7.54","Damned be Canaan,"
"Torah, Genesis.7.55",servant of servants may he be to his brothers!
"Torah, Genesis.7.56",26 And he said:
"Torah, Genesis.7.57","Blessed be Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Shem,"

"Torah, Genesis.7.64","29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred years and fifty years,"
"Torah, Genesis.7.65",then he died.

"Torah, Genesis.8.1","<i>The Table of the Nations</i> (10): Genesis, with its typically ancient Near Eastern emphasis on “begettings,” now traces the development of humanity from the sons of Noah. The key formula throughout is “their lands, their nations.” Commentators have noted numerical unity in the list, citing a total of seventy nations (once repetitions are omitted) laid out in multiples of seven. That number, as we have indicated, represents the concept of totality and perfection in the Bible. Thus the stage is set for the Babel story of the next chapter, with its condemnation of humanity’s attempt to forestall the divinely willed “scattering” into a well-ordered world."
"Torah, Genesis.8.2","Many of the names in this chapter have been identified (see Speiser), but some are still not known with certainty. Israel is conspicuous in its absence; despite the biblical narrative’s ability to trace Israel’s origins, those origins are meant to be seen not solely in biological terms but rather in terms of God’s choice. Similarly, Israel arises from women who begin as barren—thus pointing to divine intervention in history, rather than the perfectly normal account that we have here."
"Torah, Genesis.8.3","10:1 Now these are the begettings of the sons of Noah,"
"Torah, Genesis.8.4","Shem, Ham, and Yefet."
"Torah, Genesis.8.5",Sons were born to them after the Deluge.

"Torah, Genesis.8.14",the Sons of Ra’ma—Sheva and Dedan.
"Torah, Genesis.8.15",8 Cush begot Nimrod; he was the first mighty man on earth.
"Torah, Genesis.8.16","9 He was a mighty hunter before Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Genesis.8.17",therefore the saying is:
"Torah, Genesis.8.18","Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Genesis.8.19","10 His kingdom, at the beginning, was Bavel, and Erekh, Accad and"

"Torah, Genesis.8.45",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.8.46","10:2 <b>Sons:</b> Here, and later, it may mean “descendants.”"
"Torah, Genesis.8.47","4 <b>Dodanites:</b> Some read “Rodanites,” following I Chron. 1:7."
"Torah, Genesis.8.48",6 <b>Mitzrayim:</b> The biblical name for Egypt (the modern Egyptian name is <i>Misr</i>).

"Torah, Genesis.8.53","15 <b>Yevusite, etc.:</b> Collective names."
"Torah, Genesis.9.1","<i>The Unfinished Citadel</i> (11:1–9): At its most obvious, in an isolated context, this famous story is about the overweening pride of man, as represented by his technology. God’s actions here recall the ending of the garden story, where humanity was also within reach of the divine."
"Torah, Genesis.9.2","Yet more is involved than a threat. Buber felt that this episode has been inserted at this point to show that humanity has failed again, as at the time of the Flood. It has not spread out and divided into nations, as in Chap. 10. The failure paves the way for a new divine plan, which is to be realized through one man (Avraham) and his descendants."
"Torah, Genesis.9.3","Structurally, the story is a tiny literary masterpiece. It utilizes numerous plays on sound which make meaningful and often ironic linkages between sections and ideas in the text. Most significant is how the general message—that God’s response occurs in exactly the same terms as the human challenge (i.e., divine justice)—is transmitted by means of form. Fokkelman has provided a detailed study; it will suffice here to indicate only the outline. The divine “Come-now!” of v.7 clearly stands as an answer to humankind’s identical cry in vv.3 and 4. In addition humans, who congregated in order to establish a “name” and to avoid being “scattered over the face of all the earth” (v.4), are contravened by the action of God, resulting in the ironic name “Babble” and a subsequent “scattering” of humanity (v.9). The text is thus another brilliant example of biblical justice, a statement about a worldview in which the laws of justice and morality are as neatly balanced as we like to think the laws of nature are."
"Torah, Genesis.9.4","There is an important cultural background to the story. “Shinar” refers to Mesopotamia, and the “tower,” undoubtedly, to the ubiquitous <i>ziggurratu</i> (now unearthed by archeologists) which served as man-made sacred mountains (i.e., temples). By portraying an unfinished tower, by dispersing the builders, and by in essence making fun of the mighty name of Babylon, the text functions effectively to repudiate the culture from which the people of Israel sprang (Avram’s “Ur” of 11:28 was probably the great Mesopotamian metropolis). From Chap. 12 on, a new worldview is created."
"Torah, Genesis.9.5","<i>Noah to Avram</i> (11:10–32): Here are enumerated another ten generations, making the orderly connection between the origins of the world (Noah was viewed as a second Adam) and the origins of the people of Israel. The life spans are considerably shorter than those of Chap. 5, yet some sort of careful number scheme seems evident here as well (see Cassuto 1972)."
"Torah, Genesis.9.6","Beginning with v.26 we are introduced to Avram, with little hint of what is to come in his momentous life. For the moment he is only a son, a brother, and a husband, and a man whose early life is marked principally by the death of the old world (Haran and Terah), with little hope for the new (his wife is barren)."
"Torah, Genesis.9.7",11:1 Now all the earth was of one language and one set-of-words.
"Torah, Genesis.9.8",2 And it was when they migrated to the east that they found a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there.
"Torah, Genesis.9.9","3 They said, each man to his neighbor:"
"Torah, Genesis.9.10",Come-now! Let us bake bricks and let us burn them well-burnt!
"Torah, Genesis.9.11","So for them brick-stone was like building-stone, and raw-bitumen was for them like red-mortar."
"Torah, Genesis.9.12",4 And they said:
"Torah, Genesis.9.13","Come-now! Let us build ourselves a city and a tower, its top in the heavens,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.14","and let us make ourselves a name,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.15",lest we be scattered over the face of all the earth!
"Torah, Genesis.9.16",5 But Y<small>HWH</small> came down to look over the city and the tower that the humans were building.
"Torah, Genesis.9.17",6 Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"Torah, Genesis.9.18","Here, (they are) one people with one language for them all, and this is merely the first of their doings—"
"Torah, Genesis.9.19",now there will be no barrier for them in all that they scheme to do!
"Torah, Genesis.9.20","7 Come-now! Let us go down and there let us baffle their language,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.21",so that no man will understand the language of his neighbor.
"Torah, Genesis.9.22","8 So Y<small>HWH</small> scattered them from there over the face of all the earth,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.23",and they had to stop building the city.
"Torah, Genesis.9.24","9 Therefore its name was called Bavel/Babble,"

"Torah, Genesis.9.26","and from there, Y<small>HWH</small> scattered them over the face of all the earth."
"Torah, Genesis.9.27",10 These are the begettings of Shem:
"Torah, Genesis.9.28","Shem was a hundred years old, then he begot Arpakhshad, two years after the Deluge,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.29","11 and Shem lived after he begot Arpakhshad five hundred years, and begot (other) sons and daughters."
"Torah, Genesis.9.30","12 Arpakhshad lived thirty-five years, then he begot Shelah,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.31","13 and Arpakhshad lived after he begot Shelah three years and four hundred years, and begot (other) sons and daughters."
"Torah, Genesis.9.32","14 Shelah lived thirty years, then he begot Ever,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.33","15 and Shelah lived after he begot Ever three years and four hundred years, and begot (other) sons and daughters."
"Torah, Genesis.9.34","16 When Ever had lived thirty-four years, he begot Peleg,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.35","17 and Ever lived after he begot Peleg thirty years and four hundred years, and begot other (sons) and daughters."
"Torah, Genesis.9.36","18 When Peleg had lived thirty years, he begot Re’u,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.37","19 and Peleg lived after he begot Re’u nine years and two hundred years, and begot other (sons) and daughters."
"Torah, Genesis.9.38","20 When Re’u had lived thirty-two years, he begot Serug,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.39","21 and Re’u lived after he begot Serug seven years and two hundred years, and begot (other) sons and daughters."
"Torah, Genesis.9.40","22 When Serug had lived thirty years, he begot Nahor,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.41","23 and Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and begot (other) sons and daughters."
"Torah, Genesis.9.42","24 When Nahor had lived twenty-nine years, he begot Terah,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.43","25 and Nahor lived after he begot Terah nineteen years and a hundred years, and begot (other) sons and daughters."
"Torah, Genesis.9.44","26 When Terah had lived seventy years, he begot Avram, Nahor, and Haran."
"Torah, Genesis.9.45",27 Now these are the begettings of Terah:
"Torah, Genesis.9.46","Terah begot Avram, Nahor, and Haran;"
"Torah, Genesis.9.47",and Haran begot Lot.
"Torah, Genesis.9.48","28 Haran died in the living-presence of Terah his father in the land of his kindred, in Ur of the Chaldeans."
"Torah, Genesis.9.49",29 Avram and Nahor took themselves wives;
"Torah, Genesis.9.50","the name of Avram’s wife was Sarai,"
"Torah, Genesis.9.51","the name of Nahor’s wife was Milca—daughter of Haran, father of Milca and father of Yisca."
"Torah, Genesis.9.52","30 Now Sarai was barren, she had no child."

"Torah, Genesis.9.54","they set out together from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go to the land of Canaan."
"Torah, Genesis.9.55","But when they had come as far as Harran, they settled there."
"Torah, Genesis.9.56","32 And the days of Terah were five years and two hundred years,"

"Torah, Genesis.10.1","<i>The Call and the Journey</i> (12:1–9): The Avraham cycle begins decisively, with a command from God to leave the past behind and go to an unnamed land. Prominent in this speech, clearly, is the concept of blessing, which will be realized by the gifts of land (Canaan) and seed (Yitzhak, the son)."
"Torah, Genesis.10.2","The classic mythological motif of the journey, where the hero meets such dangers as monsters and giants, has here been avoided. All that the text wishes us to know about is God’s speech and Avram’s immediate obedience; as in Chap. 22, all other details of the actual trip have been omitted."
"Torah, Genesis.10.3",<i>The Wife—I</i> (12:10–20): Almost immediately upon his arrival in the promised land Avram is forced to leave it. It will be his son Yitzhak’s task to remain there on a more permanent basis.
"Torah, Genesis.10.4",This is the first of three such stories which are practically identical (see Chaps. 20 and 26). All pose a challenge for the interpreter. An honored man of God seeks to save his own skin by passing his wife off as his sister; in each case the Patriarch emerges safely and with increased wealth.
"Torah, Genesis.10.5","Speiser has tried to use the analogy of Hurrian (i.e., from Harran) law in which a wife can be elevated to the status of “sister” as one element in the expansion of her status. The legal background, however, is unclear and may not be decisive here. Coming as it does after God’s promise to biologically found “a great nation” (v.2) through Avram, the story in its first version is probably best understood as an example of God’s protection not only of the key male figure, but of the Matriarch as well. Harming Sarai, or even the threat of violating her sexuality, brings with it divine punishment. In addition the story also enables Avram to expand his wealth—itself a sign of God’s favor and the Patriarch’s importance or “weightiness” (see Polzin 1975)."
"Torah, Genesis.10.6",12:1 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Avram:

"Torah, Genesis.11.1","<i>Lot; The Land</i> (13): We return to the theme of the land. Not for the last time, Avram’s nephew Lot is used as a foil. Their “parting” shows how Lot makes a bad choice—the “wicked and sinful” area of Sedom and Amora—while Avram settles “in the land of Canaan,” which had been promised to him. From here (vv.14ff.), Avram is given God’s twofold promise again, with that of descendants being spelled out more vividly this time."
"Torah, Genesis.11.2",This section is linked to the previous one by the repetition of the phrase “he and his wife and all that was his.”
"Torah, Genesis.11.3","13:1 Avram traveled up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that was his, and Lot with him, to the Negev."
"Torah, Genesis.11.4","2 And Avram was exceedingly heavily laden with livestock, with silver and with gold."
"Torah, Genesis.11.5","3 He went on his journeyings from the Negev as far as Bet-El, as far as the place where his tent had been at the first, between Bet-El and Ai,"
"Torah, Genesis.11.6",4 to the place of the slaughter-site that he had made there at the beginning.
"Torah, Genesis.11.7",There Avram called out the name of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Genesis.11.8","5 Now also Lot, who had gone with Avram, had sheep and oxen and tents."
"Torah, Genesis.11.9","6 And the land could not support them, to settle together,"
"Torah, Genesis.11.10",for their property was so great that they were not able to settle together.
"Torah, Genesis.11.11",7 So there was a quarrel between the herdsmen of Avram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock.
"Torah, Genesis.11.12",Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then settled in the land.
"Torah, Genesis.11.13",8 Avram said to Lot:
"Torah, Genesis.11.14","Pray let there be no quarreling between me and you, between my herdsmen and your herdsmen,"
"Torah, Genesis.11.15",for we are brother men!
"Torah, Genesis.11.16",9 Is not all the land before you?
"Torah, Genesis.11.17",Pray part from me!
"Torah, Genesis.11.18","If to the left, then I to the right,"
"Torah, Genesis.11.19","if to the right, then I to the left."
"Torah, Genesis.11.20",10 Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the plain of the Jordan—
"Torah, Genesis.11.21","how well-watered was it all, before Y<small>HWH</small> brought ruin upon Sedom and Amora,"
"Torah, Genesis.11.22","like Y<small>HWH</small>’s garden, like the land of Egypt, as you come toward Tzo’ar."
"Torah, Genesis.11.23",11 So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan.
"Torah, Genesis.11.24","Lot journeyed eastward, and they parted, each man from the other:"
"Torah, Genesis.11.25","12 Avram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the plain, pitching-his-tent near Sedom."
"Torah, Genesis.11.26",13 Now the men of Sedom were exceedingly wicked and sinful before Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Genesis.11.27","14 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Avram, after Lot had parted from him:"
"Torah, Genesis.11.28","Pray lift up your eyes and see from the place where you are, to the north, to the Negev, to the east, to the Sea:"
"Torah, Genesis.11.29","15 indeed, all the land that you see, I give it to you"
"Torah, Genesis.11.30","and to your seed, for the ages."
"Torah, Genesis.11.31","16 I will make your seed like the dust of the ground,"
"Torah, Genesis.11.32","so that if a man were able to measure the dust of the ground, so too could your seed be measured."
"Torah, Genesis.11.33","17 Up, walk about through the land in its length and in its breadth,"
"Torah, Genesis.11.34",for I give it to you.
"Torah, Genesis.11.35","18 Avram moved-his-tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are by Hevron."

Consistent with his character as we will come to know it, he stands by his kinsman, acts intrepidly, and refuses the spoils of war. Equally important, he is respected by foreigners, a theme that will return both in Genesis and later. Perhaps this very different story has been included here as part of the early sections of the cycle in order to establish Avram’s status and stature. He is no longer merely a wanderer but well on the road to becoming a powerful local figure."
"Torah, Genesis.12.2","Whether the events described in this chapter are historical or part of an elaborate symbolic or mythical scheme has been the subject of debate among biblical scholars. The issue, barring unexpected archeological finds, is likely to remain unsolved."

This last motif, especially with its setting of “great darkness” and “night-blackness,” takes Avram far beyond the earlier figure of Noah into a special and fateful relationship with God."

"Torah, Genesis.14.1","<i>The Firstborn Son</i> (16): In the face of Sarai’s inability to bear children, Avram is given the legitimate option of producing an heir through her maid, Hagar. Somewhat embarrassing to later interpreters, this practice was nevertheless common in the ancient Near East (see also 30:3ff., 30:9ff.). Hagar abuses her temporarily exalted position (as her son Yishmael apparently does in a parallel story, in Chap. 21), but is saved by God’s intervention. The motif of “affliction” is continued from Chap. 15 (here, in vv.6, 9, and 11); also mentioned three times is God’s “hearkening” (hence the name Yishmael/God Hearkens). Buber understood this vocabulary to allude to the Exodus story, which in its early chapters uses the same terms."
"Torah, Genesis.14.2","Although Yishmael is not ultimately the chosen heir, he is nonetheless protected by God (see 21:20) and is eventually made into “a great nation” (17:20), as befits a child of Avram."

"Torah, Genesis.14.57","10 <b>too many to count:</b> Apparently fulfilling God’s blessing and promise to Avram in 15:5. Until 17:16, nothing indicates that Yishmael is not Avram’s long-awaited heir."

"Torah, Genesis.15.1","<i>The Covenant of Circumcision</i> (17): As Plaut notes, up to this point the covenant between God and Avram has been rather one-sided. In this chapter Avram is given a command to perform—not only of circumcision, but to be moral and upright (v.1, expanded in 18:19). Circumcision is but the symbol of the ongoing imperative to do “what is just.”"
"Torah, Genesis.15.2","In many societies circumcision has been connected directly to puberty and marriage, usually taking place (as it does here to Yishmael) at around the age of thirteen. Our passage’s moving back of the rite essentially to birth is a daring reinterpretation, at once defusing the act of exclusively sexual content while at the same time suggesting that the covenant, a lifelong commitment, is nevertheless passed down biologically through the generations. The males of the tribe are not simply made holy for marriage. They bear the mark upon their bodies as a sacred reminder of their mission."
"Torah, Genesis.15.3","The chapter echoes with repetition: “exceedingly, exceedingly” (vv.6 and 20, referring to the fruitfulness of Avram’s descendants), “you and your seed after you” (vv.7, 10; see also v.19), “for the ages” (covenant and land, vv.7, 8, 13, 19), and “into your generations” (vv.7, 9, 12)."
"Torah, Genesis.15.4","Preparatory to Avram’s assumption of fatherhood—of an individual and of a people—his name is changed (v.5), as is that of Sarai (v.15). This act is of the utmost significance in the biblical world. Since a person’s name was indicative of personality and fate, the receiving of a new one signified a new life or a new stage in life. Similarly, Yaakov (and in a sort of coronation, Yosef) will undergo a change of name. Such a practice still survives among kings and popes."
"Torah, Genesis.15.5",17:1 Now when Avram was ninety years and nine years old
"Torah, Genesis.15.6",Y<small>HWH</small> was seen by Avram and said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.15.7",I am God Shaddai.
"Torah, Genesis.15.8",Walk in my presence! And be wholehearted!
"Torah, Genesis.15.9","2 I set my covenant between me and you,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.10","I will make you exceedingly, exceedingly many."
"Torah, Genesis.15.11",3 Avram fell upon his face.
"Torah, Genesis.15.12","God spoke with him,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.13",saying:
"Torah, Genesis.15.14","4 As for me,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.15","here, my covenant is with you,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.16",so that you will become the father of a throng of nations.
"Torah, Genesis.15.17","5 No longer shall your name be called Avram,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.18","rather shall your name be Avraham,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.19",for I will make you <i>Av Hamon Goyyim</i>/Father of a Throng of Nations!
"Torah, Genesis.15.20","6 I will cause you to bear fruit exceedingly, exceedingly,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.21","I will make nations of you,"

"Torah, Genesis.15.26",and I will be God to them.
"Torah, Genesis.15.27",9 God said to Avraham:
"Torah, Genesis.15.28","As for you,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.29","you are to keep my covenant, you and your seed after you, throughout their generations."
"Torah, Genesis.15.30","10 This is my covenant which you are to keep, between me and you and your seed after you:"
"Torah, Genesis.15.31",every male among you shall be circumcised.
"Torah, Genesis.15.32","11 You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.33",so that it may serve as a sign of the covenant between me and you.
"Torah, Genesis.15.34","12 At eight days old, every male among you shall be circumcised, throughout your generations,"

"Torah, Genesis.15.37",so that my covenant may be in your flesh as a covenant for the ages.
"Torah, Genesis.15.38","14 But a foreskinned male,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.39","who does not have the foreskin of his flesh circumcised,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.40",that person shall be cut off from his kinspeople—
"Torah, Genesis.15.41",he has violated my covenant!
"Torah, Genesis.15.42",15 God said to Avraham:
"Torah, Genesis.15.43","As for Sarai your wife—you shall not call her name Sarai,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.44",for Sara/Princess is her name!
"Torah, Genesis.15.45","16 I will bless her, and I will give you a son from her,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.46",I will bless her
"Torah, Genesis.15.47","so that she becomes nations,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.48",kings of peoples shall come from her!
"Torah, Genesis.15.49","17 But Avraham fell on his face and laughed,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.50",he said in his heart:
"Torah, Genesis.15.51",To a hundred-year-old man shall there be (children) born ?
"Torah, Genesis.15.52",Or shall ninety-year-old Sara give birth?
"Torah, Genesis.15.53",18 Avraham said to God:
"Torah, Genesis.15.54",If only Yishmael might live in your presence!
"Torah, Genesis.15.55",19 God said:
"Torah, Genesis.15.56","Nevertheless,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.57","Sara your wife is to bear you a son,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.58",you shall call his name: Yitzhak/He Laughs.
"Torah, Genesis.15.59","I will establish my covenant with him as a covenant for the ages, for his seed after him."
"Torah, Genesis.15.60","20 And as for Yishmael, I hearken to you:"
"Torah, Genesis.15.61","Here, I will make him blessed, I will make him bear fruit, I will make him many, exceedingly, exceedingly—"
"Torah, Genesis.15.62","he will beget twelve (tribal) leaders, and I will make a great nation of him."
"Torah, Genesis.15.63","21 But my covenant I will establish with Yitzhak, whom Sara will bear to you at this set-time, another year hence."
"Torah, Genesis.15.64","22 When he had finished speaking with Avraham,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.65","God went up, from beside Avraham."
"Torah, Genesis.15.66","23 Avraham took Yishmael his son and all those born in his house and all those bought with his money,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.67","all the males among Avraham’s household people,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.68","and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins on that same day,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.69",as God had spoken to him.
"Torah, Genesis.15.70","24 Avraham was ninety-nine years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised,"
"Torah, Genesis.15.71",25 and Yishmael his son was thirteen years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised.

"Torah, Genesis.15.74","27 and all his household people, whether house-born or money-bought from a foreigner, were circumcised with him."
"Torah, Genesis.15.75",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.15.76","17:1 <b>Ninety years and nine years:</b> Thirteen years have elapsed since the events of the previous chapter. Now that Yishmael is entering puberty, God can no longer conceal that he is not the promised heir. See vv.16, 18. <b>Shaddai:</b> Hebrew obscure. Traditionally translated “Almighty”; others use “of the mountains.” In Genesis the name is most often tied to promises of human fertility, as in v.2. <b>Walk … be wholehearted:</b> Contrasted to Noah (6:9), Avram is a genuine religious man who lives his faith actively."
"Torah, Genesis.15.77","2 <b>set:</b> Heb. <i>va-ettena</i>. The root <i>n-t-n</i> is repeated throughout the chapter (as “make” in vv.5 and 6, and as “give” in vv.8 and 16)."

"Torah, Genesis.15.79",5 <b>Avraham:</b> Trad. English ‘Abraham.”
"Torah, Genesis.15.80","8 <b>I will be God to them:</b> Often reiterated as part of the biblical covenant (e.g., 28:21)."
"Torah, Genesis.15.81","12 <b>house-born or bought with money:</b> I.e., slaves. The entire household, as an extension of the man’s personality, is to be brought into the covenant."
"Torah, Genesis.15.82","15 <b>you shall not call her name Sarai:</b> Significantly, Sara is the only woman in the Bible to have her name changed by God."
"Torah, Genesis.15.83",16 <b>so that she becomes nations:</b> Sara in essence shares the blessing of God. She is not merely the biological means for its fulfillment.
"Torah, Genesis.15.84",17 <b>laughed:</b> Laughter becomes the key word of most of the stories about Yitzhak.
"Torah, Genesis.15.85",19 <b>Yitzhak:</b> Trad. English “Isaac.”
"Torah, Genesis.15.86",20 <b>make him blessed … make him bear fruit … make him many:</b> Heb. <i>berakhti oto ve-hifreiti oto vehirbeiti oto</i>. <b>twelve princes:</b> Thus equaling the twelve sons/tribes of Israel?
"Torah, Genesis.15.87","21 <b>another year:</b> Not nine months (Sara does not immediately become pregnant). Again the events seem to take place in a realistic framework, rather than in a strictly supernatural one."
"Torah, Genesis.15.88","22 <b>God went up, from beside Avraham:</b> Perhaps a formula used to signify the end of the conversation."
"Torah, Genesis.15.89","23 <b>on that same day:</b> Underlining Avraham’s customary obedience, <b>as God had spoken to him:</b> Like Noah in 6:22, 7:5, and 7:9, Avraham scrupulously follows God’s commands without question (so too in 21:4 and 22:3)."
"Torah, Genesis.16.1","<i>Visit and Promise</i> (18:1–15): The announcement of Sara’s impending child is set in the familiar ancient garb of a tale about divine travelers who visit an old couple. Central, as is usual in folklore, is the idea of hospitality, emphasized in the text by the threefold use of “pray” (please) (vv.3–4), “pass on/by” (vv.3–5), and by Avraham’s flurry of activity (he himself “runs” twice, “hastens” three times, and “fetches” four times in serving his guests)."
"Torah, Genesis.16.2","<i>The Great Intercession</i> (18:16–33): With v.17 the narrative is interrupted, and there begins a remarkable scene in which man confronts God. As if to emphasize the importance of this encounter, the text presents God as thinking out loud, and using the intimate term “know” (see 4:1) to describe his relationship to Avraham. And Avraham, the man through whom the nations “will find blessing” (v.18; see 12:3), the progenitor of “a great … nation” (v.18; see 12:2) that will see injustice its great goal, is now confronted with an urgent question of justice. While Avraham seems to be testing God in this story, it may in fact be precisely the reverse that is intended. Perhaps here more than anywhere else in the entire cycle (with the possible exception of Chap. 22), Avraham appears as the worthy father of his people, the one who will “charge his sons and his household … to do what is right and just” (v.19). Without this story Avraham would be a man of faith but not a man of compassion and moral outrage, a model consistent with Moses and the Prophets of Israel."
"Torah, Genesis.16.3","The tightly structured, almost formal dialogue allows us to focus totally on the issue at hand. Predominating as refrains are the words “innocent” and “guilty,” along with the expected versions of “just/justice” that pervade Avraham’s remarks."
"Torah, Genesis.16.4",18:1 And Y<small>HWH</small> was seen by him by the oaks of Mamre
"Torah, Genesis.16.5",as he was sitting at the entrance to his tent at the heat of the day.
"Torah, Genesis.16.6",2 He lifted up his eyes and saw:
"Torah, Genesis.16.7","here, three men standing over against him."
"Torah, Genesis.16.8","When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the entrance to his tent and bowed to the earth"
"Torah, Genesis.16.9",3 and said:
"Torah, Genesis.16.10","My lords,"

"Torah, Genesis.16.12",pray do not pass by your servant!

"Torah, Genesis.16.14","5 let me fetch (you) a bit of bread, that you may refresh your hearts,"
"Torah, Genesis.16.15",then afterward you may pass on—
"Torah, Genesis.16.16","for you have, after all, passed your servant’s way!"
"Torah, Genesis.16.17",They said:
"Torah, Genesis.16.18","Do thus, as you have spoken."
"Torah, Genesis.16.19",6 Avraham hastened into his tent to Sara and said:
"Torah, Genesis.16.20","Make haste! Three measures of choice flour! Knead it, make bread-cakes!"
"Torah, Genesis.16.21","7 Avraham ran to the oxen,"
"Torah, Genesis.16.22","he fetched a young ox, tender and fine, and gave it to a serving-lad, that he might hasten to make it ready;"
"Torah, Genesis.16.23","8 then he fetched cream and milk and the young ox that he had made ready, and placed it before them."
"Torah, Genesis.16.24",Now he stood over against them under the tree while they ate.
"Torah, Genesis.16.25",9 They said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.16.26",Where is Sara your wife?
"Torah, Genesis.16.27",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.16.28",Here in the tent.
"Torah, Genesis.16.29",Now he said:
"Torah, Genesis.16.30","10 I will return, yes, return to you when time revives,"
"Torah, Genesis.16.31",and Sara your wife will have a son!
"Torah, Genesis.16.32","Now Sara was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him."
"Torah, Genesis.16.33","11 And Avraham and Sara were old, advanced in days,"
"Torah, Genesis.16.34",the way of women had ceased for Sara.
"Torah, Genesis.16.35","12 Sara laughed within herself, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.16.36","After I have become worn, is there to be pleasure for me? And my lord is old!"
"Torah, Genesis.16.37",13 But Y<small>HWH</small> said to Avraham:
"Torah, Genesis.16.38","Now why does Sara laugh and say: Shall I really give birth, now that I am old?"
"Torah, Genesis.16.39",14 Is anything beyond Y<small>HWH</small>?
"Torah, Genesis.16.40","At that set-time I will return to you, when time revives, and Sara will have a son."
"Torah, Genesis.16.41","15 Sara pretended (otherwise), saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.16.42","No, I did not laugh."
"Torah, Genesis.16.43",For she was afraid.
"Torah, Genesis.16.44",But he said:
"Torah, Genesis.16.45","No, indeed you laughed."
"Torah, Genesis.16.46","16 The men arose from there, and looked down upon the face of Sedom,"
"Torah, Genesis.16.47",and Avraham went with them to escort them.
"Torah, Genesis.16.48",17 Now Y<small>HWH</small> had said (to himself):
"Torah, Genesis.16.49",Shall I cover up from Avraham what I am about to do?
"Torah, Genesis.16.50","18 For Avraham is to become, yes, become a great nation and mighty (in number),"
"Torah, Genesis.16.51",and all the nations of the earth will find blessing through him.

"Torah, Genesis.16.55","to do what is right and just,"
"Torah, Genesis.16.56",in order that Y<small>HWH</small> may bring upon Avraham what he spoke concerning him.
"Torah, Genesis.16.57",20 So Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"Torah, Genesis.16.58",The outcry in Sedom and Amora—how great it is!
"Torah, Genesis.16.59",And their sin—how exceedingly heavily it weighs!

"Torah, Genesis.16.65","22 The men turned from there and went toward Sedom,"
"Torah, Genesis.16.66",but Avraham still stood in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Genesis.16.67",23 Avraham came close and said:

"Torah, Genesis.17.1","<i>The End of Sedom and Amora</i> (19): The detailed and colorful story of Lot in Sedom and in flight from it adds a great deal to the Avraham cycle. On the one hand there is the portrayal of Lot’s continuing his uncle’s tradition of hospitality (vv.1–3), even to the extent of being willing to sacrifice his own daughters’ virginity. On the other hand Lot comes across as timid (vv.7–8) and fearful (vv.18–20). In fact the word “pray” (which we noted in Chap. 18 as a “hospitality term,” and which serves that function in verse 2 here as well) is used later in this chapter in a way that almost suggests whining. He thus once again brings Avraham’s personality into sharper focus."
"Torah, Genesis.17.2","The crimes of Sedom and Amora are at last indicated more openly: abuse of the sacred duty of hospitality, and sexual immorality (v.5). The latter theme returns at the end of the story, with the incestuous incident that takes place at the instigation of Lot’s daughters."
"Torah, Genesis.17.3","The story uses some stylized vocabulary. In v.13, the messengers talk of “bringing ruin,” just as we encountered in the Flood narrative (6:13). The narrative also gives negative twists to words which were positive in the previous chapter: “know” and “just” are changed to indicate illicit sex (v.5) and a condemnation of the alien Lot (v.9, “act-the-judge and adjudicate”). Here too, “door/entrance” is transformed from a place of contact with God to one of confrontation with men."
"Torah, Genesis.17.4","The account of the destruction itself is terse and mysterious, but it also reveals the predicament of an all-too-human man, Lot."
"Torah, Genesis.17.5","The final section of the Sedom and Amora story recounts the origins of two of Israel’s neighbors, the Moabites and Ammonites. As traditional enemies, they are not treated very kindly, any more than was the ancestor of the Canaanites in 9:20–27."

"Torah, Genesis.17.12","spend the night, wash your feet;"
"Torah, Genesis.17.13",(starting-early) you may go on your way.
"Torah, Genesis.17.14",They said:
"Torah, Genesis.17.15","No, rather we will spend the night in the square."
"Torah, Genesis.17.16","3 But he pressed them exceedingly hard,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.17",so they turned in to him and came into his house.
"Torah, Genesis.17.18","He made them a meal-with-drink and baked flat-cakes, and they ate."
"Torah, Genesis.17.19","4 They had not yet lain down, when the men of the city, the men of Sedom, encircled the house,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.20","from young lad to old man, all the people (even) from the outskirts."
"Torah, Genesis.17.21",5 They called out to Lot and said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.17.22",Where are the men who came to you tonight?
"Torah, Genesis.17.23","Bring them out to us, we want to know them!"
"Torah, Genesis.17.24","6 Lot went out to them, to the entrance, shutting the door behind him"
"Torah, Genesis.17.25",7 and said:
"Torah, Genesis.17.26","Pray, brothers, do not be so wicked!"
"Torah, Genesis.17.27","8 Now pray, I have two daughters who have never known a man,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.28","pray let me bring them out to you, and you may deal with them however seems good in your eyes;"
"Torah, Genesis.17.29","only to these men do nothing,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.30","for they have, after all, come under the shadow of my roof-beam!"
"Torah, Genesis.17.31",9 But they said:
"Torah, Genesis.17.32",Step aside!
"Torah, Genesis.17.33",and said:
"Torah, Genesis.17.34","This one came to sojourn and (wants to) judge, play-the-judge?!"
"Torah, Genesis.17.35",Now we will do worse to you than (to) them!
"Torah, Genesis.17.36","And they pressed exceedingly hard against the man, against Lot, and stepped closer to break down the door."
"Torah, Genesis.17.37","10 But the men put out their hand and brought Lot in to them, into the house, and shut the door."
"Torah, Genesis.17.38","11 And the men who were at the entrance to the house, they struck with dazzling-light—(all men) great and small,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.39",so that they were unable to find the entrance.
"Torah, Genesis.17.40",12 The men said to Lot:
"Torah, Genesis.17.41","Whom else have you here—a son-in-law, sons, daughters?"
"Torah, Genesis.17.42",Bring anyone whom you have in the city out of the place!
"Torah, Genesis.17.43","13 For we are about to bring ruin on this place,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.44",for how great is their outcry before Y<small>HWH</small>!
"Torah, Genesis.17.45",And Y<small>HWH</small> has sent us to bring it to ruin.
"Torah, Genesis.17.46","14 Lot went out to speak to his sons-in-law, those who had taken his daughters (in marriage), and said:"
"Torah, Genesis.17.47","Up, out of this place, for Y<small>HWH</small> is about to bring ruin on the city!"
"Torah, Genesis.17.48","But in the eyes of his sons-in-law, he was like one who jests."
"Torah, Genesis.17.49","15 Now when the dawn came up,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.50","the messengers pushed Lot on, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.17.51","Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.52",lest you be swept away in the iniquity of the city!
"Torah, Genesis.17.53","16 When he lingered,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.54","the men seized his hand, his wife’s hand, and the hand of his two daughters"
"Torah, Genesis.17.55",—because Y<small>HWH</small>’s pity was upon him—
"Torah, Genesis.17.56","and, bringing him out, they left him outside the city."
"Torah, Genesis.17.57","17 It was, when they had brought him outside, that (one of them) said:"
"Torah, Genesis.17.58","Escape for your life, do not gaze behind you, do not stand still anywhere in the plain:"
"Torah, Genesis.17.59","to the hill-country escape, lest you be swept away!"
"Torah, Genesis.17.60",18 Lot said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.17.61","No, pray, my lord!"
"Torah, Genesis.17.62","19 Now pray, your servant has found favor in your eyes,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.63","you have shown great faithfulness in how you have dealt with me, keeping me alive—"
"Torah, Genesis.17.64","but I, I am not able to escape to the hill-country,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.65","lest the wickedness cling to me, and I die!"
"Torah, Genesis.17.66","20 Now pray, that town is near enough to flee to, and it is so tiny;"
"Torah, Genesis.17.67",pray let me escape there—is it not tiny?—and stay alive!
"Torah, Genesis.17.68",21 He said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.17.69","Here then, I lift up your face in this matter as well,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.70",by not overturning this town of which you speak.
"Torah, Genesis.17.71","22 Make haste, escape there,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.72",for I am not able to do anything until you come there.
"Torah, Genesis.17.73",Therefore the name of the town was called: Tzo’ar/Tiny.
"Torah, Genesis.17.74",23 (Now) the sun was going out over the earth as Lot came to Tzo’ar.
"Torah, Genesis.17.75","24 But Y<small>HWH</small> rained down brimstone and fire upon Sedom and Amora, coming from Y<small>HWH</small>, from the heavens,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.76","25 he overturned those cities and all of the plain, all those settled in the cities and the vegetation of the soil."
"Torah, Genesis.17.77","26 Now his wife gazed behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
"Torah, Genesis.17.78","27 Avraham started-early in the morning to the place where he had stood in Y<small>HWH</small>’s presence,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.79",28 he looked down upon the face of Sedom and Amora and upon the whole face of the plain-country
"Torah, Genesis.17.80",and saw:
"Torah, Genesis.17.81","here, the dense-smoke of the land went up like the dense-smoke of a furnace!"
"Torah, Genesis.17.82","29 Thus it was, when God brought ruin on the cities of the plain,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.83","that God kept Avraham in mind and sent out Lot from the overturning,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.84",when he overturned the cities where Lot had settled.
"Torah, Genesis.17.85","30 Lot went up from Tzo’ar and settled in the hill-country, his two daughters with him,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.86",for he was afraid to settle in Tzo’ar.
"Torah, Genesis.17.87","So he settled in a cave, he and his two daughters."
"Torah, Genesis.17.88",31 The firstborn said to the younger:
"Torah, Genesis.17.89","Our father is old,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.90",and there is no man in the land to come in to us as befits the way of all the earth!
"Torah, Genesis.17.91","32 Come, let us have our father drink wine and lie with him"
"Torah, Genesis.17.92",so that we may keep seed alive by our father.
"Torah, Genesis.17.93","33 So they had their father drink wine that night,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.94",then the firstborn went in and lay with her father—
"Torah, Genesis.17.95",but he knew nothing of her lying down or her rising up.
"Torah, Genesis.17.96",34 It was on the morrow that the firstborn said to the younger:
"Torah, Genesis.17.97","Here, yesternight I lay with father."
"Torah, Genesis.17.98","Let us have him drink wine tonight as well,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.99","then you go in and lie with him,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.100",so that we may keep seed alive by our father.
"Torah, Genesis.17.101","35 They had their father drink wine that night as well,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.102","then the younger arose and lay with him,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.103",but he knew nothing of her lying down or her rising up.
"Torah, Genesis.17.104",36 And Lot’s two daughters became pregnant by their father.
"Torah, Genesis.17.105","37 The firstborn bore a son and called his name: Mo’av/By Father,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.106",he is the tribal-father of Mo’av of today.
"Torah, Genesis.17.107","38 The younger also bore a son, and called his name: Ben-Ammi/Son of My Kinspeople,"
"Torah, Genesis.17.108",he is the tribal-father of the children of Ammon of today.

In this long variation on the theme, God is most active and Avraham most revealing of his past. He emerges from danger as a man who clearly enjoys God’s full protection and bounty."
"Torah, Genesis.18.2","The story almost draws a web of magic around Sara. Avimelekh is nearly killed by God, and Sara’s childlessness is inflicted upon all the women in the king’s household—even though there is not the slightest doubt of his innocence (he “had not come near her”)."
"Torah, Genesis.18.3","20:1 Avraham traveled from there to the Negev, and settled between Kadesh and Shur, sojourning in Gerar."
"Torah, Genesis.18.4",2 Avraham said of Sara his wife: She is my sister.
"Torah, Genesis.18.5",So Avimelekh king of Gerar sent and had Sara taken.
"Torah, Genesis.18.6",3 But God came to Avimelekh in a dream of the night and said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.18.7","Here, you must die because of the woman whom you have taken,"
"Torah, Genesis.18.8",for she is a wedded wife!
"Torah, Genesis.18.9",4 Avimelekh had not come near her. He said:

"Torah, Genesis.18.12","5 Did he not say to me: She is my sister,"

"Torah, Genesis.18.16","I also know that it was with a whole heart that you did this,"
"Torah, Genesis.18.17","and so I also held you back from being at fault against me,"
"Torah, Genesis.18.18",therefore I did not let you touch her.

"Torah, Genesis.18.24","8 Early in the morning Avimelekh called all his servants,"
"Torah, Genesis.18.25","he spoke all these words in their ears, and the men became exceedingly afraid."
"Torah, Genesis.18.26",9 Then Avimelekh had Avraham called and said to him:

"Torah, Genesis.18.28","In what did I fail you,"
"Torah, Genesis.18.29",that you have brought me and my kingdom into such great fault?
"Torah, Genesis.18.30","Deeds which are not to be done, you have done to me!"
"Torah, Genesis.18.31",10 And Avimelekh said to Avraham:
"Torah, Genesis.18.32","What did you foresee, that you did this thing?"
"Torah, Genesis.18.33",11 Avraham said:
"Torah, Genesis.18.34","Indeed, I said to myself:"

"Torah, Genesis.18.36",they will kill me on account of my wife!
"Torah, Genesis.18.37","12 Then, too, she is truly my sister, my fathers daughter,"

"Torah, Genesis.18.42","in every place that we come, say of me: He is my brother."
"Torah, Genesis.18.43","14 Avimelekh took sheep and oxen, servants and maids, and gave them to Avraham,"

"Torah, Genesis.18.58",5 <b>With a whole heart:</b> Lit. “In the wholeness of my heart.”
"Torah, Genesis.18.59","6 <b>being at fault:</b> Or “sinning,” which is perhaps too theological a translation."
"Torah, Genesis.18.60",8 <b>morning:</b> Heb. <i>boker</i> sometimes has this more general meaning.
"Torah, Genesis.18.61","11 <b>awe:</b> Others, “fear.”"
"Torah, Genesis.18.62","13 <b>roam:</b> A word which in Genesis suggests a wandering that is nevertheless directed by God. See 21:14 and 37:15 for other examples. This passage gives us a fascinating glimpse of Avraham’s own perception of the events in Chap. 12. It is not unusual for the biblical storyteller to give out informa-tion in this manner (in a later speech of the protagonist), <b>faithfulness:</b> Or “favor.”"
"Torah, Genesis.18.63",16 <b>a covering for the eyes:</b> Hebrew obscure; apparently it has legal connotations (see also “decided for” at the end of the verse).
"Torah, Genesis.18.64","18 <b>Y<small>HWH</small> had obstructed:</b> On account of Sara, the “obstructed” one of 16:2."
"Torah, Genesis.19.1","<i>Yitzhak Born</i> (21:1–8): Two principal ideas punctuate this climax for which we have waited since Chap. 12: God keeps his promises (hence the poem in v.1), and the key word in the stories about Yitzhak: “laughter” (here the result of the actual birth)."
"Torah, Genesis.19.2","<i>Yishmael Banished</i> (21:9–21): Once Yitzhak has been born, separation must be made between heir and firstborn. Despite Avraham’s obvious love for him, Yishmael must leave; his mother must repeat her ordeal of Chap. 16 as well. Nonetheless the text emphasizes that God is there “with the lad” (v.20); twice the Yishmael motif of “God hearkening” resounds (v.17); and God promises that the boy will eventually attain the same exalted status as his brother (vv.13, 18)."
"Torah, Genesis.19.3","Structurally, this brief tale foreshadows the next chapter, the ordeal of Yitzhak. It speaks of a journey into the unknown, a child at the point of death, the intervention of God’s “messenger,” the parent’s sighting of the way out, and the promise of future blessing. Of course the differences between the two stories are equally important."
"Torah, Genesis.19.4","<i>Treaty</i> (21:22–34): This interlude, which usefully separates the life threats to Avraham’s two sons (for a similar example, see I Sam. 25), is one of many scenes demonstrating Avraham’s relationship with local princes."
"Torah, Genesis.19.5","21:1 Now Y<small>HWH</small> took account of Sara as he had said, Y<small>HWH</small> dealt with Sara as he had spoken."
"Torah, Genesis.19.6","2 Sara became pregnant and bore Avraham a son in his old age,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.7",at the set-time of which God had spoken to him.

"Torah, Genesis.19.11",5 Avraham was a hundred years old when Yitzhak his son was born to him.
"Torah, Genesis.19.12",6 Now Sara said:
"Torah, Genesis.19.13","God has made laughter for me,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.14",all who hear of it will laugh for me.
"Torah, Genesis.19.15",7 And she said:
"Torah, Genesis.19.16",Who would have declared to Avraham:
"Torah, Genesis.19.17",Sara will nurse sons?
"Torah, Genesis.19.18","Well, I have borne him a son in his old age!"
"Torah, Genesis.19.19","8 The child grew and was weaned,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.20",and Avraham made a great drinking-feast on the day that Yitzhak was weaned.
"Torah, Genesis.19.21","9 Once Sara saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian-woman, whom she had borne to Avraham, laughing. …"
"Torah, Genesis.19.22",10 She said to Avraham:
"Torah, Genesis.19.23","Drive out this slave-woman and her son,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.24","for the son of this slave-woman shall not share-inheritance with my son, with Yitzhak!"
"Torah, Genesis.19.25",11 The matter was exceedingly bad in Avraham’s eyes because of his son.
"Torah, Genesis.19.26",12 But God said to Avraham:
"Torah, Genesis.19.27",Do not let it be bad in your eyes concerning the lad and concerning your slave-woman;
"Torah, Genesis.19.28","in all that Sara says to you, hearken to her voice,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.29",for it is through Yitzhak that seed will be called by your (name).
"Torah, Genesis.19.30","13 But also the son of the slave-woman—a nation will I make of him,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.31",for he too is your seed.
"Torah, Genesis.19.32","14 Avraham started-early in the morning,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.33",he took some bread and a skin of water
"Torah, Genesis.19.34",and gave them to Hagar—placing them upon her shoulder—together with the child and sent her away.
"Torah, Genesis.19.35",She went off and roamed in the wilderness of Be’er-Sheva.
"Torah, Genesis.19.36","15 And when the water in the skin was at an end, she cast the child under one of the bushes,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.37","16 and went and sat by herself, at-a-distance, as far away as a bowshot,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.38",for she said to herself:
"Torah, Genesis.19.39",Let me not see the child die!
"Torah, Genesis.19.40","So she sat at-a-distance, and lifted up her voice and wept."
"Torah, Genesis.19.41","17 But God heard the voice of the lad,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.42",God’s messenger called to Hagar from heaven and said to her:
"Torah, Genesis.19.43","What is (the matter) with you, Hagar? Do not be afraid,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.44",for God has heard the voice of the lad there where he is.
"Torah, Genesis.19.45","18 Arise, lift up the lad and grasp him with your hand,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.46",for a great nation will I make of him!
"Torah, Genesis.19.47","19 God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water;"
"Torah, Genesis.19.48","she went, filled the skin with water, and gave the lad to drink."
"Torah, Genesis.19.49","20 And God was with the lad as he grew up,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.50","he settled in the wilderness, and became an archer, a bowman."
"Torah, Genesis.19.51","21 He settled in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took him a wife from the land of Egypt."
"Torah, Genesis.19.52","22 It was at about that time that Avimelekh, together with Pikhol the commander of his army, said to Avraham:"
"Torah, Genesis.19.53",God is with you in all that you do.
"Torah, Genesis.19.54","23 So-now, swear to me here by God:"
"Torah, Genesis.19.55","If you should ever deal falsely with me, with my progeny and my posterity … !"
"Torah, Genesis.19.56","Rather, faithfully, as I have dealt with you, deal with me, and with the land in which you have sojourned."
"Torah, Genesis.19.57",24 Avraham said:
"Torah, Genesis.19.58",I so swear.
"Torah, Genesis.19.59",25 But Avraham rebuked Avimelekh
"Torah, Genesis.19.60",because of a well of water that Avimelekfrs servants had seized.
"Torah, Genesis.19.61",26 Avimelekh said:
"Torah, Genesis.19.62","I do not know who did this thing,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.63","nor have you ever told me, nor have I heard of it apart from today."
"Torah, Genesis.19.64","27 So Avraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Avimelekh,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.65",and the two of them cut a covenant.
"Torah, Genesis.19.66",28 Then Avraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock aside.
"Torah, Genesis.19.67",29 Avimelekh said to Avraham:
"Torah, Genesis.19.68",What mean these seven ewe-lambs that you have set aside?
"Torah, Genesis.19.69",30 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.19.70","Indeed, these seven ewe-lambs you should take from my hand,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.71",so that they may be a witness for me that I dug this well.
"Torah, Genesis.19.72","31 Therefore that place was called Be’er-Sheva/Well of the Seven-Swearing,"
"Torah, Genesis.19.73",for there the two of them swore (an oath).
"Torah, Genesis.19.74",32 Thus they cut a covenant in Be’er-Sheva.
"Torah, Genesis.19.75",Then Avimelekh and Pikhol the commander of his army arose
"Torah, Genesis.19.76",and returned to the land of the Philistines.
"Torah, Genesis.19.77",33 And he planted a tamarisk in Be’er-Sheva
"Torah, Genesis.19.78",and there he called out the name: Y<small>HWH</small> God of the Ages.
"Torah, Genesis.19.79",34 And Avraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.
"Torah, Genesis.19.80",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.19.81",21:6 <b>laugh for me:</b> Out of joy or disbelief. Some suggest “laugh at.”
"Torah, Genesis.19.82",9 <b>laughing:</b> Perhaps mockingly. The theme of Yitzhak’s life continues.
"Torah, Genesis.19.83",11 <b>bad in Avraham’s eyes:</b> Displeasing or upsetting to him.
"Torah, Genesis.19.84","12 <b>seed will be called:</b> I.e., your line will be continued."

"Torah, Genesis.20.1","<i>The Great Test</i> (22): This story is certainly one of the masterpieces of biblical literature. In a famous article by Erich Auerbach it is remarked how biblical style as exemplified here, in contradistinction to that of Homer and other epic bards, eschews physical and psychological details in favor of one central preoccupation: a man’s decision in relation to God. The result of this style is a terrible intensity, a story which is so stark as to be almost unbearable."
"Torah, Genesis.20.2","Chap. 22 is a tale of God’s seeming retraction of his promise (of “seed”) to Avraham. The fact that other issues may be involved here (i.e., Israel’s rejection of local and widely practiced ideas of child sacrifice) may be quite beside the point. Coming just one chapter after the birth of the long-awaited son, the story completely turns around the tension of the whole cycle and creates a new, frightening tension of its own. The real horror of the story lies in this threatened contradiction to what has gone before."
"Torah, Genesis.20.3","Most noticeable in the narrative is Avraham’s silence, his mute acceptance of, and acting on, God’s command. We are told of no sleepless night, nor does he ever say a word to God. Instead he is described with a series of verbs: starting-early, saddling, taking, splitting, arising, going (v.3; similarly in vv.6 and 9–10). Avraham the bargainer, so willing to enter into negotiations with relations (Chap. 13), allies (Chap. 14), local princes (Chap. 20), and even God himself (Chap. 18), here falls completely silent."
"Torah, Genesis.20.4","The chapter serves an important structural function in the Avraham cycle, framing it in conjunction with Chap. 12. The triplet in v.2 (“Pray take your son,/ your only-one,/ whom you love”) recalls “from your land/ from your kindred/ from your father’s house” in 12:1; “go-you-forth” and “the land that I will tell you of” (v.2; the latter, three times in the story) similarly point back to Avraham’s call (12:1, “Go-you-forth … to the land that I will let you see”). There he had been asked to give up the past (his father); here, the future (his son). Between the two events lies Avraham’s active life as man of God, ancestor, and intercessor. After this God will never speak with him again."
"Torah, Genesis.20.5","In many ways this story is the midpoint of Genesis. It brings the central theme of continuity and discontinuity to a head in the strongest possible way. After Moriyya, we can breathe easier, knowing that God will come to the rescue of his chosen ones in the direst of circumstances. At the same time we are left to ponder the difficulties of being a chosen one, subject to such an incredible test."
"Torah, Genesis.20.6","The story is also the paradigmatic narrative of the entire book. The Patriarch passes the test, and we know that the fulfillment of the divine promise is assured. Yet there is an ominous note: love, which occurs here by name for the first time, leads almost to heartbreak. So it will be for the rest of Genesis."
"Torah, Genesis.20.7",22:1 Now after these events it was
"Torah, Genesis.20.8",that God tested Avraham
"Torah, Genesis.20.9",and said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.20.10",Avraham!
"Torah, Genesis.20.11",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.20.12",Here I am.
"Torah, Genesis.20.13",2 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.20.14","Pray take your son,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.15","your only-one,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.16","whom you love,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.17","Yitzhak,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.18","and go-you-forth to the land of Moriyya/Seeing,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.19",and offer him up there as an offering-up
"Torah, Genesis.20.20",upon one of the mountains
"Torah, Genesis.20.21",that I will tell you of.
"Torah, Genesis.20.22","3 Avraham started-early in the morning,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.23","he saddled his donkey,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.24","he took his two serving-lads with him and Yitzhak his son,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.25",he split wood for the offering-up
"Torah, Genesis.20.26",and arose and went to the place that God had told him of.
"Torah, Genesis.20.27",4 On the third day Avraham lifted up his eyes
"Torah, Genesis.20.28",and saw the place from afar.
"Torah, Genesis.20.29",5 Avraham said to his lads:
"Torah, Genesis.20.30","You stay here with the donkey,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.31","and I and the lad wish to go yonder,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.32",we wish to bow down and then return to you.
"Torah, Genesis.20.33","6 Avraham took the wood for the offering-up,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.34","he placed them upon Yitzhak his son,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.35",in his hand he took the fire and the knife.
"Torah, Genesis.20.36",Thus the two of them went together.
"Torah, Genesis.20.37","7 Yitzhak said to Avraham his father, he said:"
"Torah, Genesis.20.38",Father!
"Torah, Genesis.20.39",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.20.40","Here I am, my son."
"Torah, Genesis.20.41",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.20.42","Here are the fire and the wood,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.43",but where is the lamb for the offering-up?
"Torah, Genesis.20.44",8 Avraham said:
"Torah, Genesis.20.45","God will see-for-himself to the lamb for the offering-up,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.46",my son.
"Torah, Genesis.20.47",Thus the two of them went together.
"Torah, Genesis.20.48",9 They came to the place that God had told him of;
"Torah, Genesis.20.49",there Avraham built the slaughter-site
"Torah, Genesis.20.50",and arranged the wood
"Torah, Genesis.20.51",and bound Yitzhak his son
"Torah, Genesis.20.52",and placed him on the slaughter-site atop the wood.
"Torah, Genesis.20.53","10 And Avraham stretched out his hand,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.54",he took the knife to slay his son.
"Torah, Genesis.20.55",11 But Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger called to him from heaven
"Torah, Genesis.20.56",and said:
"Torah, Genesis.20.57",Avraham! Avraham!
"Torah, Genesis.20.58",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.20.59",Here I am.
"Torah, Genesis.20.60",12 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.20.61","Do not stretch out your hand against the lad,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.62",do not do anything to him!
"Torah, Genesis.20.63",For now I know
"Torah, Genesis.20.64",that you are in awe of God—
"Torah, Genesis.20.65","you have not withheld your son, your only-one, from me."
"Torah, Genesis.20.66",13 Avraham lifted up his eyes and saw:
"Torah, Genesis.20.67","there, a ram caught behind in the thicket by its horns!"
"Torah, Genesis.20.68","Avraham went,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.69",he took the ram
"Torah, Genesis.20.70",and offered it up as an offering-up in place of his son.
"Torah, Genesis.20.71",14 Avraham called the name of that place: Y<small>HWH</small> Sees.
"Torah, Genesis.20.72",As the saying is today: On Y<small>HWH</small>’s mountain (it) is seen.
"Torah, Genesis.20.73",15 And Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger called to Avraham a second time from heaven
"Torah, Genesis.20.74",16 and said:
"Torah, Genesis.20.75",By myself I swear
"Torah, Genesis.20.76",—Y<small>HWH</small>’s utterance—
"Torah, Genesis.20.77","indeed, because you have done this thing, have not withheld your son, your only-one,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.78","17 indeed, I will bless you, bless you,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.79","I will make your seed many, yes, many,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.80",like the stars of the heavens and like the sand that is on the shore of the sea;
"Torah, Genesis.20.81","your seed shall inherit the gate of their enemies,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.82","18 all the nations of the earth shall enjoy blessing through your seed,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.83",in consequence of your hearkening to my voice.
"Torah, Genesis.20.84","19 Avraham returned to his lads,"
"Torah, Genesis.20.85",they arose and went together to Be’er-Sheva.
"Torah, Genesis.20.86",And Avraham stayed in Be’er-Sheva.
"Torah, Genesis.20.87","20 Now after these events it was, that it was told to Avraham, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.20.88","Here, Milca too has borne, sons to Nahor your brother:"
"Torah, Genesis.20.89","21 Utz his firstborn and Buz his brother, Kemuel father of"

His purchase of a burial plot for Sara shows us once more his dealings with his neighbors, here as their equal, and also establishes at last his legal foothold in Canaan, albeit with a small piece of land. The long conversations and considerable formality of the chapter, which are not unusual in an ancient Near Eastern context, contrast with the extreme brevity of the previous chapter."
"Torah, Genesis.21.2","The narrative strikes a curious balance between the emotional reality of the situation (e.g., the repetition of “dead,” “presence,” and “bury”) and the requirements of legal procedure (“Hear me,” “give title,” and “holding”)."

Its leisurely pace, attention to detail, and concentration on speeches as well as action belie the importance of what is being recounted: the finding of a wife for Yitzhak, who is biologically to continue the line. Yet after all that has happened in the previous chapters, we know that this will be taken care of by God. That is implied in Avraham’s assured “he himself [God] will send his messenger on before you” (v.7)."
"Torah, Genesis.22.2","Many meeting/betrothal scenes in the Bible take place at a well (e.g., Yaakov, Moshe); this was probably a literary convention (see Culley 1976b and Alter 1981 for a discussion of the significance of such a phenomenon). Like other crucial moments in Avraham’s life the chapter involves a journey, albeit one made by his emissary. It is therefore natural that the key words of the chapter are “go,” “journey,” and “grant success.” “Take” also appears frequently, as the biblical term often used for “marry.”"

"Torah, Genesis.22.71","Blessed be Y<small>HWH</small>, God of my lord Avraham,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.72",who has not relinquished his faithfulness and his trustworthiness from my lord!
"Torah, Genesis.22.73","While as for me, Y<small>HWH</small> has led me on the journey to the house of my lord’s brothers!"
"Torah, Genesis.22.74",28 The maiden ran and told her mother’s household according to these words.
"Torah, Genesis.22.75","29 Now Rivka had a brother, his name was Lavan."
"Torah, Genesis.22.76","Lavan ran to the man, outside, to the spring:"
"Torah, Genesis.22.77","30 and it was,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.78","as soon as he saw the nose-ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.79","and as soon as he heard Rivka his sister’s words, saying: Thus the man spoke to me,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.80","that he came out to the man—there, he was still standing by the camels, by the spring—"
"Torah, Genesis.22.81",31 and said:
"Torah, Genesis.22.82","Come, you who are blessed by Y<small>HWH</small>, why are you standing outside?"
"Torah, Genesis.22.83",I myself have cleared out the house and a place for the camels!
"Torah, Genesis.22.84","32 The man came into the house and unbridled the camels,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.85",they gave straw and fodder to the camels
"Torah, Genesis.22.86",and water for washing his feet and the feet of the men that were with him.
"Torah, Genesis.22.87","33 (Food) was put before him to eat, but he said:"
"Torah, Genesis.22.88",I will not eat until I have spoken my words.
"Torah, Genesis.22.89",He said: Speak!
"Torah, Genesis.22.90",34 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.22.91",I am Avraham’s servant.
"Torah, Genesis.22.92","35 Y<small>HWH</small> has blessed my lord exceedingly, so that he has become great,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.93","he has given him sheep and oxen, silver and gold, servants and maids, camels and donkeys."
"Torah, Genesis.22.94","36 Sara, my lord’s wife, bore my lord a son after she had grown old,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.95",and he has given him all that is his.
"Torah, Genesis.22.96","37 And my lord had me swear, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.22.97","You are not to take a wife for my son from the women of the Canaanites, in whose land I am settled!"
"Torah, Genesis.22.98","38 No! To my father’s house you are to go, to my clan,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.99",and take a wife for my son.
"Torah, Genesis.22.100",39 I said to my lord:
"Torah, Genesis.22.101",Perhaps the woman will not go after me!
"Torah, Genesis.22.102",40 He said to me:
"Torah, Genesis.22.103","Y<small>HWH</small>, in whose presence I have walked, will send his messenger with you,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.104","he will grant success to your journey,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.105",so that you take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father’s house.
"Torah, Genesis.22.106",41 Only then will you be clear from my oath-curse:
"Torah, Genesis.22.107","When you come to my clan,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.108","if they do not give her to you, you will be clear from my oath-curse."
"Torah, Genesis.22.109",42 Now I came to the well today and said:
"Torah, Genesis.22.110","Y<small>HWH</small>, God of my lord Avraham,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.111","pray, if you wish to grant success to the journey on which I am going,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.112",43 here: I have stationed myself by the water spring;
"Torah, Genesis.22.113",may it be
"Torah, Genesis.22.114","that the girl who comes out to draw,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.115","to whom I say: Pray give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.116","44 and she says to me: You drink, and I will also draw for your camels—"
"Torah, Genesis.22.117",let her be the woman whom Y<small>HWH</small> has decided on for the son of my lord.
"Torah, Genesis.22.118","45 (And) I, even before I had finished speaking in my heart,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.119","here, Rivka came out, her pitcher on her shoulder,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.120",she went down to the spring and drew.
"Torah, Genesis.22.121",I said to her: Pray give me to drink!
"Torah, Genesis.22.122",46 In haste she let down her pitcher from herself and said:
"Torah, Genesis.22.123","Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink."
"Torah, Genesis.22.124","I drank, and she also gave the camels to drink."
"Torah, Genesis.22.125","47 Then I asked her, I said: Whose daughter are you?"
"Torah, Genesis.22.126","She said: The daughter of Betuel, son of Nahor, whom Milca bore to him."
"Torah, Genesis.22.127","I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.128","48 and in homage I bowed low before Y<small>HWH</small>, and blessed Y<small>HWH</small>, God of my lord Avraham,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.129",who led me on the true journey to take the daughter of my lord’s brother for his son.
"Torah, Genesis.22.130","49 So-now, if you wish to deal faithfully and truly with my lord, tell me,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.131","and if not, tell me,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.132",that I may (know to) turn right or left.
"Torah, Genesis.22.133","50 Lavan and Betuel answered, they said:"
"Torah, Genesis.22.134",The matter has come from Y<small>HWH</small>;
"Torah, Genesis.22.135",we cannot speak anything to you evil or good.
"Torah, Genesis.22.136","51 Here is Rivka before you,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.137","take her and go, that she may be a wife for the son of your lord,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.138",as Y<small>HWH</small> has spoken.
"Torah, Genesis.22.139",52 It was
"Torah, Genesis.22.140","when Avraham’s servant heard their words, that he bowed to the ground before Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Genesis.22.141","53 And the servant brought out objects of silver and objects of gold and garments, and gave them to Rivka,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.142",and he gave presents to her brother and to her mother.
"Torah, Genesis.22.143","54 They ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and spent the night."
"Torah, Genesis.22.144","When they arose at daybreak, he said:"
"Torah, Genesis.22.145",Send me off to my lord.
"Torah, Genesis.22.146",55 But her brother and her mother said:
"Torah, Genesis.22.147","Let the maiden stay with us a few days, perhaps ten—after that she may go."
"Torah, Genesis.22.148",56 He said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.22.149","Do not delay me, for Y<small>HWH</small> has granted success to my journey;"
"Torah, Genesis.22.150","send me off, that I may go back to my lord."
"Torah, Genesis.22.151",57 They said:
"Torah, Genesis.22.152",Let us call the maiden and ask (for an answer from) her own mouth.
"Torah, Genesis.22.153",58 They called Rivka and said to her:
"Torah, Genesis.22.154",Will you go with this man?
"Torah, Genesis.22.155",She said:
"Torah, Genesis.22.156",I will go.
"Torah, Genesis.22.157","59 They sent off Rivka their sister with her nurse, and Avraham’s servant with his men,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.158",60 and they gave Rivka farewell-blessing and said to her:
"Torah, Genesis.22.159","Our sister, may you become thousandfold myriads!"
"Torah, Genesis.22.160",May your seed inherit the gate of those who hate him!
"Torah, Genesis.22.161","61 Rivka and her maids arose, they mounted the camels and went after the man."
"Torah, Genesis.22.162",The servant took Rivka and went away.
"Torah, Genesis.22.163",62 Now Yitzhak had come from where you come to the Well of the Living-One Who-Sees-Me—for he had settled in the Negev.
"Torah, Genesis.22.164",63 And Yitzhak went out to stroll in the field around the turning of sunset.
"Torah, Genesis.22.165","He lifted up his eyes and saw: here, camels coming!"
"Torah, Genesis.22.166",64 Rivka lifted up her eyes and saw Yitzhak;
"Torah, Genesis.22.167",65 she got down from the camel and said to the servant:
"Torah, Genesis.22.168",Who is the man over there that is walking in the field to meet us?
"Torah, Genesis.22.169",The servant said:
"Torah, Genesis.22.170",That is my lord.
"Torah, Genesis.22.171",She took a veil and covered herself.
"Torah, Genesis.22.172",66 And the servant recounted to Yitzhak all the things that he had done.
"Torah, Genesis.22.173","67 Yitzhak brought her into the tent of Sara his mother,"
"Torah, Genesis.22.174","he took Rivka and she became his wife, and he loved her."
"Torah, Genesis.22.175",Thus was Yitzhak comforted after his mother.

"Torah, Genesis.24.1","<i>Rivka’s Children</i> (25:19–34): Two stories of sibling confrontation begin the Yaakov cycle. From the first, vv. 19–28, all the necessary conditions are introduced for what is to come: struggle in the womb (foreshadowing Yaakov’s wrestling match in Chap. 32, the structural resolution of this earlier one), God’s plan for the younger son to outdo the older one, the importance of names as clues to personalities, and parental preference. This last point seals the fate of the two boys."
"Torah, Genesis.24.2","The second story (vv.29–34) is Yaakov’s first act of stealth, and sets the pattern for his whole life. Note at the same time the text’s emphasis on Esav’s role (v.34), “Thus did Esav despise the firstborn-right.”"
"Torah, Genesis.24.3","As before, these episodes point in two temporal directions. Esav resembles Yishmael, the man of the bow; and parental preference will launch the initially tragic action in the Yosef story (Chap. 37)."
"Torah, Genesis.24.4","19 Now these are the begettings of Yitzhak, son of Avraham."
"Torah, Genesis.24.5",Avraham begot Yitzhak.

"Torah, Genesis.24.13",why do I exist?
"Torah, Genesis.24.14",And she went to inquire of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Genesis.24.15",23 Y<small>HWH</small> said to her:

"Torah, Genesis.24.23","26 After that his brother came out, his hand grasping Esav’s heel,"
"Torah, Genesis.24.24",so they called his name: Yaakov/Heel-Holder.
"Torah, Genesis.24.25",Yitzhak was sixty years old when she bore them.
"Torah, Genesis.24.26",27 The lads grew up:
"Torah, Genesis.24.27","Esav became a man who knew the hunt, a man of the field,"
"Torah, Genesis.24.28","but Yaakov was a plain man, staying among the tents."
"Torah, Genesis.24.29","28 Yitzhak grew to love Esav, for (he brought) hunted-game for his mouth,"
"Torah, Genesis.24.30",but Rivka loved Yaakov.
"Torah, Genesis.24.31","29 Once Yaakov was boiling boiled-stew,"
"Torah, Genesis.24.32","when Esav came in from the field, and he was weary."
"Torah, Genesis.24.33",30 Esav said to Yaakov:
"Torah, Genesis.24.34","Pray give me a gulp of the red-stuff, that red-stuff,"
"Torah, Genesis.24.35",for I am so weary!
"Torah, Genesis.24.36",Therefore they called his name: Edom/Red-One.
"Torah, Genesis.24.37",31 Yaakov said:
"Torah, Genesis.24.38",Sell me your firstborn-right here-and-now.
"Torah, Genesis.24.39",32 Esav said:
"Torah, Genesis.24.40","Here, I am on my way to dying, so what good to me is a firstborn-right?"
"Torah, Genesis.24.41",33 Yaakov said:
"Torah, Genesis.24.42",Swear to me here-and-now.
"Torah, Genesis.24.43",He swore to him and sold his firstborn-right to Yaakov.
"Torah, Genesis.24.44",34 Yaakov gave Esav bread and boiled lentils;
"Torah, Genesis.24.45",he ate and drank and arose and went off.
"Torah, Genesis.24.46",Thus did Esav despise the firstborn-right.
"Torah, Genesis.24.47",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.24.48","25:20 <b>forty years old:</b> Another schematic number. Twenty years later (see v.26), his wife will bear him children. <b>Aramean:</b> Three times in this verse the root ‘Aram” confirms what we learned in the previous chapter—the importance of family and lineage here, <b>country of Aram:</b> Others leave this untranslated, as “Padan-Aram.”"
"Torah, Genesis.24.49",22 <b>almost crushed:</b> Others use “struggled.” <b>inquire:</b> Consult an oracle. Note that there is no indication that Yitzhak is aware of what God wants.

"Torah, Genesis.24.51","24 <b>here:</b> The text speaks from the point of view of the onlookers, not of Rivka, who is perfectly aware that she has twins."

"Torah, Genesis.24.55",28 <b>(he brought) hunted-game:</b> Hebrew difficult.
"Torah, Genesis.24.56","29 <b>boiling boiled-stew:</b> This phrase may connote plotting, as in our English “cook up,” ‘brew,” “concoct,” or “stir up” trouble. Other forms of the Hebrew denote “insolence” or “intentional evil.”"
"Torah, Genesis.24.57",31 <b>here-and-now:</b> Others use “at once”; apparently a legal term.

"Torah, Genesis.25.1","<i>In the Land</i> (26:1–6): As we have suggested, there is no true collection of stories about Yitzhak. That is, virtually nowhere does Yitzhak appear in a tale where, as a distinct individual, he is a central character. And unlike Yaakov and Yosef, Yitzhak never directly receives his father’s blessing. This is bestowed by God, and one gets the impression that even Avraham does not deal with his son as an individual. This is not surprising, given Yitzhak’s function in his father’s life."
"Torah, Genesis.25.2","For the narrative, his main purpose, as we have stressed above, is simply to remain in the land (note the repetition of the word “land” in this section). It is almost as if Avraham, the man who lives in the shadow of sacred trees, plants one in the person of his son. In this chapter Yitzhak is forbidden to go beyond the borders of Canaan. Even his death, so seemingly out of place in Chap. 35, occurs after Yaakov has returned home from his wanderings: only when it is assured that there will be continuity in the land is he allowed to die—despite the fact that as a result the text must leave him blind and dying for twenty years."
"Torah, Genesis.25.3","<i>The Wife—III</i> (26:7–11): Here is the final “Yitzhak version” of the tale, constructed around the same king whom Avraham had encountered in Chap. 20. Its individual coloring is supplied by the “laughing-and-loving” of v.8, playing on Yitzhak’s name. Otherwise, just as in the following episode, he is merely repeating his father’s experience."
"Torah, Genesis.25.4","<i>Blessing</i> (26:12–33): Confirmation of Yitzhak’s status as heir comes in vv.12–14, in the form of material blessings (already referred to immediately after Avraham’s death, 25:11). It will be Yaakov’s task to reclaim and continue the spiritual side of the tradition."
"Torah, Genesis.25.5","The first episode is centered around not Yitzhak but Avraham. The phrase “his father” reverberates; and Avimelekh returns. In the second episode, Avraham’s treaty with that king (Chap. 21) is replayed, with the same result as before: an explanation of the name Be’er-Sheva."
"Torah, Genesis.25.6","<i>Deceit and Blessing</i> (26:34–28:9): Of all the stories of Genesis, this is perhaps the most brilliantly staged. Nowhere is the narrative so vivid as here, and nowhere, even including Chap. 22, is the tension so masterfully drawn out."
"Torah, Genesis.25.7","Despite the fact that the story line is a simple one, involving deception and the “taking” of the blessing, the text is imbued with great subtlety. Most striking is the sensuality it invokes: seven times we hear of “game,” six of the “delicacy” (or “tasty-dish”), and three times Yitzhak “feels” Yaakov (who “comes close” four times). In fact the story makes use of all five of the senses. One sense—that of sight—is defective, and on that deficiency will turn the action of the story. Yet another level of meaning is apparent: “to see” in ancient Israel, as in many cultures, was a term connected to prophetic powers, as we observed regarding Avraham. So here, ironically, Yitzhak’s blindness leads to both deception and to the proper transferral of the blessing."
"Torah, Genesis.25.8","Structurally the story is framed by two references to Esav and his wives: 26:34–35 prepares the way for his loss of the blessing, by showing that he has alienated himself from his parents (and broken Avraham’s charge regarding Yitzhak in 24:3), and 28:6–9 finds Esav obeying his father and making a rather pathetic attempt to reassure himself of his love."
"Torah, Genesis.25.9",Some of the story’s motifs will return later. The threefold “as he loves” looks to the crucial role that the theme of “love” will play later on in Genesis (as well as being a key to the story itself). The general theme of nonrecognition will return with an interesting twist in the Yosef novella (especially in Chaps. 42–44).
"Torah, Genesis.25.10","26:1 Now there was a famine in the land, aside from the former famine which there had been in the days of Avraham,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.11","so Yitzhak went to Avimelekh, king of the Philistines, to Gerar."
"Torah, Genesis.25.12",2 And Y<small>HWH</small> was seen by him and said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.13",Do not go down to Egypt;
"Torah, Genesis.25.14","continue to dwell in the land that I tell you of,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.15","3 sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will give you blessing—"
"Torah, Genesis.25.16",for to you and to your seed I give all these lands
"Torah, Genesis.25.17",and will fulfill the sworn-oath that I swore to Avraham your father:
"Torah, Genesis.25.18","4 I will make your seed many, like the stars of the heavens,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.19",and to your seed I will give all these lands;
"Torah, Genesis.25.20",all the nations of the earth shall enjoy blessing through your seed—
"Torah, Genesis.25.21",5 in consequence of Avraham’s hearkening to my voice
"Torah, Genesis.25.22","and keeping my charge: my commandments, my laws, and my instructions."
"Torah, Genesis.25.23",6 So Yitzhak stayed in Gerar.
"Torah, Genesis.25.24","7 When the men of the place asked about his wife, he said: She is my sister,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.25",for he was afraid to say: my wife—
"Torah, Genesis.25.26","(thinking): Otherwise the people of the place will kill me on account of Rivka, for she is beautiful to look at."
"Torah, Genesis.25.27","8 But it was, when he had been there a long time,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.28","that Avimelekh, king of the Philistines, looked out through a window"
"Torah, Genesis.25.29",and saw: there was Yitzhak laughing-and-loving with Rivka his wife!
"Torah, Genesis.25.30",9 Avimelekh had Yitzhak called and said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.31","But here, she must be your wife!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.32",So how could you say: She is my sister?
"Torah, Genesis.25.33",Yitzhak said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.25.34","Indeed, I said to myself: Otherwise I will die on account of her!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.35",10 Avimelekh said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.36",What is this that you have done to us!
"Torah, Genesis.25.37","One of the people might well have lain with your wife,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.38",and then you would have brought guilt upon us!
"Torah, Genesis.25.39","11 Avimelekh commanded the entire people, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.25.40","Whoever touches this man or his wife must be put to death, yes, death!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.41","12 Yitzhak sowed in that land, and reaped in that year a hundred measures;"
"Torah, Genesis.25.42",thus did Y<small>HWH</small> bless him.
"Torah, Genesis.25.43","13 The man became great, and went on, went on becoming greater, until he was exceedingly great:"
"Torah, Genesis.25.44","14 he had herds of sheep and herds of oxen and a large retinue-of-servants,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.45",and the Philistines envied him.
"Torah, Genesis.25.46","15 And all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Avraham his father, the Philistines stopped up and filled with earth."
"Torah, Genesis.25.47",16 Avimelekh said to Yitzhak:
"Torah, Genesis.25.48","Go away from us, for you have become exceedingly more mighty (in number) than we!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.49","17 So Yitzhak went from there, he encamped in the wadi of Gerar"
"Torah, Genesis.25.50",and settled there.
"Torah, Genesis.25.51","18 Yitzhak again dug up the wells of water which had been dug in the days of Avraham his father, the Philistines having stopped them up after Avraham’s death,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.52","and he called them by the names, the same names, by which his father had called them."
"Torah, Genesis.25.53","19 Yitzhak’s servants also dug in the wadi, and found there a well of living water."
"Torah, Genesis.25.54","20 And the shepherds of Gerar quarreled with the shepherds of Yitzhak, saying: The water is ours!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.55","So he called the name of the well: Esek/Bickering, because they had bickered with him."
"Torah, Genesis.25.56","21 They dug another well, and quarreled also over it,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.57",so he called its name: Sitna/ Animosity.
"Torah, Genesis.25.58","22 He moved on from there and dug another well, but they did not quarrel over it,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.59","so he called its name: Rehovot/Space,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.60","and said: Indeed, now Y<small>HWH</small> has made space for us, so that we may bear fruit in the land!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.61",23 He went up from there to Be’er-Sheva.
"Torah, Genesis.25.62",24 And Y<small>HWH</small> was seen by him on that night and said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.63",I am the God of Avraham your father.
"Torah, Genesis.25.64","Do not be afraid, for I am with you,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.65","I will bless you and will make your seed many, for the sake of Avraham my servant."
"Torah, Genesis.25.66",25 He built a slaughter-site there
"Torah, Genesis.25.67",and called out the name of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Genesis.25.68","He spread his tent there, and Yitzhak’s servants excavated a well there."
"Torah, Genesis.25.69","26 Now Avimelekh went to him from Gerar, along with Ahuzzat his aide and Pikhol the commander of his army."
"Torah, Genesis.25.70",27 Yitzhak said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.25.71",Why have you come to me?
"Torah, Genesis.25.72",For you hate me and have sent me away from you!
"Torah, Genesis.25.73",28 They said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.74","We have seen, yes, seen that Y<small>HWH</small> has been with you,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.75","so we say: Pray let there be an oath-curse between us, between us and you,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.76",we want to cut a covenant with you:
"Torah, Genesis.25.77",29 If ever you should deal badly with us … !
"Torah, Genesis.25.78",Just as we have not harmed you and just as we have only dealt well with you and have sent you away in peace—
"Torah, Genesis.25.79",you are now blessed by Y<small>HWH</small>!
"Torah, Genesis.25.80","30 He made them a drinking-feast, and they ate and drank."
"Torah, Genesis.25.81",31 Early in the morning they swore (an oath) to one another;
"Torah, Genesis.25.82","then Yitzhak sent them off, and they went from him in peace."
"Torah, Genesis.25.83",32 Now it was on that same day
"Torah, Genesis.25.84","that Yitzhak’s servants came and told him about the well that they had been digging,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.85",they said to him: We have found water!
"Torah, Genesis.25.86",33 So he called it: Shiv’a/Swearing-Seven;
"Torah, Genesis.25.87",therefore the name of the city is Be’er-Sheva until this day.
"Torah, Genesis.25.88","34 When Esav was forty years old, he took to wife Yehudit daughter of B’eri the Hittite and Ba’semat daughter of Elon the Hittite."
"Torah, Genesis.25.89",35 And they were a bitterness of spirit to Yitzhak and Rivka.
"Torah, Genesis.25.90","27:1 Now when Yitzhak was old and his eyes had become too dim for seeing,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.91","he called Esav, his elder son, and said to him:"
"Torah, Genesis.25.92",My son!
"Torah, Genesis.25.93",He said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.25.94",Here I am.
"Torah, Genesis.25.95",2 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.96","Now here, I have grown old, and do not know the day of my death."
"Torah, Genesis.25.97","3 So now, pray pick up your weapons—your hanging-quiver and your bow,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.98","go out into the field and hunt me down some hunted-game,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.99","4 and make me a delicacy, such as I love;"
"Torah, Genesis.25.100","bring it to me, and I will eat it,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.101",that I may give you my own blessing before I die.
"Torah, Genesis.25.102","5 Now Rivka was listening as Yitzhak spoke to Esav his son,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.103","and so when Esav went off into the fields to hunt down hunted-game to bring (to him),"
"Torah, Genesis.25.104","6 Rivka said to Yaakov her son, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.25.105","Here, I was listening as your father spoke to Esav your brother, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.25.106","7 Bring me some hunted-game and make me a delicacy, I will eat it"
"Torah, Genesis.25.107","and give you blessing before Y<small>HWH</small>, before my death."
"Torah, Genesis.25.108","8 So-now, my son, listen to my voice, to what I command you:"
"Torah, Genesis.25.109","9 Pray go to the flock and take me two fine goat kids from there,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.110","I will make them into a delicacy for your father, such as he loves;"
"Torah, Genesis.25.111","10 you bring it to your father, and he will eat,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.112",so that he may give you blessing before his death.
"Torah, Genesis.25.113",11 Yaakov said to Rivka his mother:
"Torah, Genesis.25.114","Here, Esav my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.115","12 perhaps my father will feel me—then I will be like a trickster in his eyes,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.116",and I will bring a curse and not a blessing on myself!
"Torah, Genesis.25.117",13 His mother said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.25.118","Let your curse be on me, my son!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.119","Only: listen to my voice and go, take them for me."
"Torah, Genesis.25.120","14 He went and took and brought them to his mother, and his mother made a delicacy, such as his father loved."
"Torah, Genesis.25.121","15 Rivka then took the garments of Esav, her elder son, the choicest ones that were with her in the house,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.122","16 and clothed Yaakov, her younger son;"
"Torah, Genesis.25.123","and with the skins of the goat kids, she clothed his hands and the smooth-parts of his neck."
"Torah, Genesis.25.124",17 Then she placed the delicacy and the bread that she had made in the hand of Yaakov her son.
"Torah, Genesis.25.125",18 He came to his father and said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.126",Father!
"Torah, Genesis.25.127",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.128","Here I am. Which one are you, my son?"
"Torah, Genesis.25.129",19 Yaakov said to his father:
"Torah, Genesis.25.130","I am Esav, your firstborn."
"Torah, Genesis.25.131",I have done as you spoke to me:
"Torah, Genesis.25.132","Pray arise, sit and eat from my hunted-game,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.133",that you may give me your own blessing.
"Torah, Genesis.25.134",20 Yitzhak said to his son:
"Torah, Genesis.25.135","How did you find it so hastily, my son?"
"Torah, Genesis.25.136","He said: Indeed, Y<small>HWH</small> your God made it happen for me."
"Torah, Genesis.25.137",21 Yitzhak said to Yaakov:
"Torah, Genesis.25.138","Pray come closer, that I may feel you, my son,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.139",whether you are really my son Esav or not.
"Torah, Genesis.25.140",22 Yaakov moved closer to Yitzhak his father.
"Torah, Genesis.25.141",He felt him and said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.142","The voice is Yaakov’s voice, the hands are Esav’s hands—"
"Torah, Genesis.25.143","23 but he did not recognize him, for his hands were like the hands of Esav his brother, hairy."
"Torah, Genesis.25.144","Now he was about to bless him,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.145",24 when he said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.146","Are you he, my son Esav?"
"Torah, Genesis.25.147",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.148",I am.
"Torah, Genesis.25.149","25 So he said: Bring it close to me, and I will eat from the hunted-game of my son,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.150",in order that I may give you my own blessing.
"Torah, Genesis.25.151","He put it close to him and he ate,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.152",he brought him wine and he drank.
"Torah, Genesis.25.153",26 Then Yitzhak his father said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.25.154","Pray come close and kiss me, my son."
"Torah, Genesis.25.155",27 He came close and kissed him.
"Torah, Genesis.25.156",And he smelled the smell of his garments
"Torah, Genesis.25.157",and blessed him and said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.158","See, the smell of my son"
"Torah, Genesis.25.159",is like the smell of a field
"Torah, Genesis.25.160",that Y<small>HWH</small> has blessed.
"Torah, Genesis.25.161",28 So may God give you
"Torah, Genesis.25.162","from the dew of the heavens,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.163","from the fat of the earth,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.164",(along with) much grain and new-wine!
"Torah, Genesis.25.165","29 May peoples serve you,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.166",may tribes bow down to you;
"Torah, Genesis.25.167","be master to your brothers,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.168",may your mother’s sons bow down to you!
"Torah, Genesis.25.169","Those who damn you, damned!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.170","Those who bless you, blessed!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.171","30 Now it was, when Yitzhak had finished blessing Yaakov,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.172","yes it was—Yaakov had just gone out, out from the presence of Yitzhak his father—"
"Torah, Genesis.25.173",that Esav his brother came back from his hunting.
"Torah, Genesis.25.174",31 He too made a delicacy and brought it to his father.
"Torah, Genesis.25.175",He said to his father:
"Torah, Genesis.25.176","Let my father arise and eat from the hunted-game of his son,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.177",that you may give me your own blessing.
"Torah, Genesis.25.178",32 Yitzhak his father said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.25.179",Which one are you?
"Torah, Genesis.25.180",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.181","I am your son, your firstborn, Esav."
"Torah, Genesis.25.182",33 Yitzhak trembled with very great trembling
"Torah, Genesis.25.183",and said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.184",Who then was he
"Torah, Genesis.25.185",that hunted down hunted-game and brought it to me—I ate it all before you came
"Torah, Genesis.25.186",and I gave him my blessing!
"Torah, Genesis.25.187",Now blessed he must remain!
"Torah, Genesis.25.188","34 When Esav heard the words of his father,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.189","he cried out with a very great and bitter cry,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.190",and said to his father:
"Torah, Genesis.25.191","Bless me, me also, father!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.192",35 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.193",Your brother came with deceit and took away your blessing.
"Torah, Genesis.25.194",36 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.195",Is that why his name was called Yaakov/Heel-Sneak? For he has now sneaked against me twice:
"Torah, Genesis.25.196","My firstborn-right he took, and now he has taken my blessing!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.197",And he said:
"Torah, Genesis.25.198",Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?
"Torah, Genesis.25.199","37 Yitzhak answered, saying to Esav:"
"Torah, Genesis.25.200","Here, I have made him master to you,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.201","and all his brothers I have given him as servants,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.202",with grain and new-wine I have invested him—
"Torah, Genesis.25.203","so for you, what then can I do, my son?"
"Torah, Genesis.25.204",38 Esav said to his father:
"Torah, Genesis.25.205","Have you only a single blessing, father?"
"Torah, Genesis.25.206","Bless me, me also, father!"
"Torah, Genesis.25.207",And Esav lifted up his voice and wept.
"Torah, Genesis.25.208","39 Then Yitzhak his father answered, saying to him:"
"Torah, Genesis.25.209","Behold, from the fat of the earth"
"Torah, Genesis.25.210","must be your dwelling-place,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.211",from the dew of the heavens above.
"Torah, Genesis.25.212","40 You will live by your sword,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.213",you will serve your brother.
"Torah, Genesis.25.214",But it will be
"Torah, Genesis.25.215","that when you brandish it,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.216",you will tear his yoke from your neck.
"Torah, Genesis.25.217",41 And Esav held-a-grudge against Yaakov because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him.
"Torah, Genesis.25.218",Esav said in his heart:
"Torah, Genesis.25.219",Let the days of mourning for my father draw near
"Torah, Genesis.25.220",and then I will kill Yaakov my brother!
"Torah, Genesis.25.221","42 Rivka was told of the words of Esav, her elder son."
"Torah, Genesis.25.222","She sent and called for Yaakov, her younger son,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.223",and said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.25.224","Here, Esav your brother is consoling himself about you, with (the thought of) killing you."
"Torah, Genesis.25.225","43 So now, my son, listen to my voice:"
"Torah, Genesis.25.226","Arise and flee to Lavan my brother in Harran,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.227","44 and stay with him for some days, until your brother’s fury has turned away,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.228",45 until his anger turns away from you and he forgets what you did to him.
"Torah, Genesis.25.229",Then I will send and have you taken from there—
"Torah, Genesis.25.230",for should I be bereaved of you both in a single day?
"Torah, Genesis.25.231",46 So Rivka said to Yitzhak:
"Torah, Genesis.25.232",I loathe my life because of those Hittite women;
"Torah, Genesis.25.233","if Yaakov should take a wife from the Hittite women—like these, from the women of the land,"
"Torah, Genesis.25.234",why should I have life?

"Torah, Genesis.26.1","<i>Yaakov Sets Out</i> (28:10–22): Yaakov’s journey takes him not only to a foreign land, but to the portals of adulthood. It begins fittingly with a dream vision, so that we will know from the start that God is with him. In fact Yaakov always encounters God at crucial life junctures, at the point of journeys (31:3—leaving Aram; 32:25ff.—meeting Esav; 35:1— returning to Bet-El; 35:9ff.—the homecoming; and 46:2ff.—on the way to Egypt)."
"Torah, Genesis.26.2","The setting for this particular encounter is highly unusual, especially when compared to the generally nongeographical nature of the revelations to Avraham. The idea of a sacred site (“place,” a biblical word with these connotations, occurs three times) is strongly suggested. The notion of a ladder or ramp (or “gateway,” v.17) between the divine and human worlds is well known in ancient stories. A variation of the theme occurs in 32:2–3, where Yaakov sees “messengers” again in an “encounter”; these two stories frame the middle of the entire cycle."
"Torah, Genesis.26.3","As Yaakov enters his adult life, he resembles both his grandfather Avraham, the visionary, and his son Yosef, the dreamer."
"Torah, Genesis.26.4","28:1 So Yitzhak called for Yaakov,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.5","he blessed him and commanded him, saying to him:"
"Torah, Genesis.26.6",You are not to take a wife from the women of Canaan;
"Torah, Genesis.26.7","2 arise, go to the country of Aram, to the house of Betuel, your mother’s father,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.8","and take yourself a wife from there, from the daughters of Lavan, your mother’s brother."
"Torah, Genesis.26.9","3 May God Shaddai bless you,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.10","may he make you bear fruit and make you many,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.11",so that you become a host of peoples.
"Torah, Genesis.26.12","4 And may he give you the blessing of Avraham,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.13","to you and to your seed with you,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.14","for you to inherit the land of your sojournings,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.15",which God gave to Avraham.
"Torah, Genesis.26.16",5 So Yitzhak sent Yaakov off;
"Torah, Genesis.26.17","he went to the country of Aram, to Lavan son of Betuel the Aramean,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.18","the brother of Rivka, the mother of Yaakov and Esav."
"Torah, Genesis.26.19",6 And Esav saw
"Torah, Genesis.26.20","that Yitzhak had given Yaakov farewell-blessing and had sent him to the country of Aram, to take himself a wife from there,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.21","(and that) when he had given him blessing, he had commanded him, saying: You are not to take a wife from the women of Canaan!"
"Torah, Genesis.26.22",7 And Yaakov had listened to his father and his mother and had gone to the country of Aram.
"Torah, Genesis.26.23",8 And Esav saw
"Torah, Genesis.26.24","that the women of Canaan were bad in the eyes of Yitzhak his father,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.25","9 so Esav went to Yishmael and took Mahalat daughter of Yishmael son of Avraham, sister of Nevayot, in addition to his wives as a wife."
"Torah, Genesis.26.26","10 Yaakov went out from Be’er-Sheva and went toward Harran,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.27",11 and encountered a certain place.
"Torah, Genesis.26.28","He had to spend the night there, for the sun had come in."
"Torah, Genesis.26.29",And he took one of the stones of the place
"Torah, Genesis.26.30",and set it at his head
"Torah, Genesis.26.31",and lay down in that place.
"Torah, Genesis.26.32",12 And he dreamt:
"Torah, Genesis.26.33","Here, a ladder was set up on the earth,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.34","its top reaching the heavens,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.35",and here: messengers of God were going up and down on it.
"Torah, Genesis.26.36",13 And here:
"Torah, Genesis.26.37",Y<small>HWH</small> was standing over against him.
"Torah, Genesis.26.38",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.26.39","I am Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.40",the God of Avraham your father and the God of Yitzhak.
"Torah, Genesis.26.41",The land on which you lie
"Torah, Genesis.26.42",I give to you and to your seed.
"Torah, Genesis.26.43",14 Your seed will be like the dust of the earth;
"Torah, Genesis.26.44","you will burst forth, to the Sea, to the east, to the north, to the Negev."
"Torah, Genesis.26.45",All the clans of the soil will find blessing through you and through your seed!
"Torah, Genesis.26.46","15 Here, I am with you,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.47",I will watch over you wherever you go
"Torah, Genesis.26.48",and will bring you back to this soil;
"Torah, Genesis.26.49","indeed, I will not leave you"
"Torah, Genesis.26.50",until I have done what I have spoken to you.
"Torah, Genesis.26.51",16 Yaakov awoke from his sleep
"Torah, Genesis.26.52",and said:
"Torah, Genesis.26.53","Why,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.54","Y<small>HWH</small> is in this place,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.55","and I, I did not know it!"
"Torah, Genesis.26.56",17 He was awestruck and said:
"Torah, Genesis.26.57",How awe-inspiring is this place!
"Torah, Genesis.26.58","This is none other than a house of God,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.59",and that is the gate of heaven!
"Torah, Genesis.26.60","18 Yaakov started-early in the morning,"
"Torah, Genesis.26.61",he took the stone that he had set at his head
"Torah, Genesis.26.62",and set it up as a standing-pillar
"Torah, Genesis.26.63",and poured oil on top of it.
"Torah, Genesis.26.64",19 And he called the name of the place: Bet-El/House of God—
"Torah, Genesis.26.65","however, Luz was the name of the city in former times."
"Torah, Genesis.26.66",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.26.67","28:2 <b>arise, go to the country of Aram:</b> It is curious that Yitzhak sends his son on a journey that he himself had been forbidden to undertake."

"Torah, Genesis.27.2","Lavan is once again the chief representative of the family, as he was in the betrothal account of Chap. 24."
"Torah, Genesis.27.3","20 And Yaakov vowed a vow, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.27.4",If God will be with me
"Torah, Genesis.27.5",and will watch over me on this way that I go
"Torah, Genesis.27.6","and will give me food to eat and a garment to wear,"

"Torah, Genesis.27.11","I shall tithe, tithe it to you."
"Torah, Genesis.27.12",29:1 Yaakov lifted his feet and went to the land of the Easterners.
"Torah, Genesis.27.13","2 He looked around him, and there: a well in the field, and there were three herds of sheep crouching near it,"
"Torah, Genesis.27.14",for from that well they used to give the herds to drink.
"Torah, Genesis.27.15","Now the stone on the mouth of the well was large,"
"Torah, Genesis.27.16","3 so when all the herds were gathered there,"
"Torah, Genesis.27.17","they used to roll the stone from the mouth of the well, give the sheep to drink, and put the stone back on the mouth of the well in its place."
"Torah, Genesis.27.18",4 Yaakov said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.27.19","Brothers, where are you from?"
"Torah, Genesis.27.20",They said:
"Torah, Genesis.27.21",We are from Harran.
"Torah, Genesis.27.22",5 He said to them:

"Torah, Genesis.27.24",They said:

"Torah, Genesis.27.26",6 He said to them:

"Torah, Genesis.27.28",They said:
"Torah, Genesis.27.29",It is well—
"Torah, Genesis.27.30",and here comes Rahel his daughter with the sheep!
"Torah, Genesis.27.31",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.27.32","21 <b>in peace:</b> Or “safely.” This functions as a key word in the Yaakov cycle, extending into the Yosef story as well. Yaakov, the “sneak” and wanderer, seeks peace and safety; he does not find it until the end of his life, albeit in a foreign land."

"Torah, Genesis.28.1","<i>Deception Repaid</i> (29:15–30): The language of the text here, as well as the tenor of the situation, suggest that the Bible has set up Yaakov’s punishment for having stolen Yitzhak’s blessing from his brother. “Deceived” (v.25) and “younger … firstborn” (v.26) echo the Chap. 27 narrative, and provide another example of biblical justice."
"Torah, Genesis.28.2",7 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.28.3","Indeed, it is still broad daylight,"
"Torah, Genesis.28.4","it is not time to gather in the livestock,"
"Torah, Genesis.28.5","so give the sheep to drink and go back, tend them."
"Torah, Genesis.28.6",8 But they said:
"Torah, Genesis.28.7","We cannot, until all the herds have been gathered;"
"Torah, Genesis.28.8","only then do they roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and then we give the sheep to drink."
"Torah, Genesis.28.9","9 While he was still speaking with them,"
"Torah, Genesis.28.10",Rahel came with the sheep that were her father’s
"Torah, Genesis.28.11",—for she was a shepherdess.
"Torah, Genesis.28.12","10 Now it was when Yaakov saw Rahel, the daughter of Lavan"
"Torah, Genesis.28.13","and the sheep of Lavan his mother’s brother,"
"Torah, Genesis.28.14","that Yaakov came close,"
"Torah, Genesis.28.15",he rolled the stone from the mouth of the well
"Torah, Genesis.28.16",and gave drink to the sheep of Lavan his mother’s brother.
"Torah, Genesis.28.17","11 Then Yaakov kissed Rahel, and lifted up his voice and wept."

"Torah, Genesis.28.20",and that he was Rivka’s son.
"Torah, Genesis.28.21",She ran and told her father.

"Torah, Genesis.28.23","that he ran to meet him, embraced him and kissed him, and brought him into his house."
"Torah, Genesis.28.24",And he recounted all these events to Lavan.
"Torah, Genesis.28.25",14 Lavan said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.28.26","Without doubt you are my bone, my flesh!"
"Torah, Genesis.28.27",And he stayed with him the days of a Renewing-of-the-Moon.
"Torah, Genesis.28.28",15 Lavan said to Yaakov:
"Torah, Genesis.28.29","Just because you are my brother, should you serve me for nothing?"
"Torah, Genesis.28.30","Tell me, what shall your wages be?"

"Torah, Genesis.29.1","<i>Love, Jealousy, and Children</i> (29:31–30:24): The narrative now demonstrates (1) how Yaakov prospers in exile, increasing both in wealth and in progeny, and thus (2) how God fulfills his promise to the Patriarchs to “make them many.” Characteristically for the Bible, this takes place as a result of human emotions: the jealousy of two sisters who are married to the same man. The emotions, interestingly, are portrayed largely through the names given to Yaakov’s sons. In the end Lea seems to be the victor, at least in the terms of a culture that prizes the production of male children; she becomes the mother of fully half of the sons of Israel (Redak)."
"Torah, Genesis.29.2","16 Now Lavan had two daughters: the name of the elder was Lea, the name of the younger was Rahel."
"Torah, Genesis.29.3","17 Lea’s eyes were delicate, but Rahel was fair of form and fair to look at."
"Torah, Genesis.29.4",18 And Yaakov fell in love with Rahel.
"Torah, Genesis.29.5",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.29.6","I will serve you seven years for Rahel, your younger daughter."
"Torah, Genesis.29.7",19 Lavan said:
"Torah, Genesis.29.8",My giving her to you is better than my giving her to another man;
"Torah, Genesis.29.9",stay with me.
"Torah, Genesis.29.10","20 So Yaakov served seven years for Rahel,"
"Torah, Genesis.29.11","yet they were in his eyes as but a few days, because of his love for her."
"Torah, Genesis.29.12",21 Then Yaakov said to Lavan:
"Torah, Genesis.29.13","Come-now, (give me) my wife, for my days-of-labor have been fulfilled,"
"Torah, Genesis.29.14",so that I may come in to her.
"Torah, Genesis.29.15",22 Lavan gathered all the people of the place together and made a drinking-feast.
"Torah, Genesis.29.16",23 Now in the evening
"Torah, Genesis.29.17","he took Lea his daughter and brought her to him,"
"Torah, Genesis.29.18",and he came in to her.
"Torah, Genesis.29.19","24 Lavan also gave her Zilpa his maid,"
"Torah, Genesis.29.20",for Lea his daughter as a maid.
"Torah, Genesis.29.21",25 Now in the morning:

"Torah, Genesis.29.23",He said to Lavan:
"Torah, Genesis.29.24",What is this that you have done to me!
"Torah, Genesis.29.25",Was it not for Rahel that I served you?
"Torah, Genesis.29.26",Why have you deceived me?
"Torah, Genesis.29.27",26 Lavan said:
"Torah, Genesis.29.28","Such is not done in our place, giving away the younger before the firstborn;"
"Torah, Genesis.29.29","27 just fill out the bridal-week for this one, then we shall give you that one also,"
"Torah, Genesis.29.30",for the service which you will serve me for yet another seven years.
"Torah, Genesis.29.31","28 Yaakov did so—he fulfilled the bridal-week for this one,"
"Torah, Genesis.29.32",and then he gave him Rahel his daughter as a wife.
"Torah, Genesis.29.33","29 Lavan also gave Rahel his daughter Bilha his maid,"
"Torah, Genesis.29.34",for her as a maid.
"Torah, Genesis.29.35","30 So he came in to Rahel also,"
"Torah, Genesis.29.36","and he loved Rahel also,"

"Torah, Genesis.29.38",Then he served him for yet another seven years.
"Torah, Genesis.29.39","31 When Y<small>HWH</small> saw that Lea was hated,"
"Torah, Genesis.29.40","he opened her womb,"

The repeating words point to major themes: “serve,” “wages,” “face” (which will become central to the whole cycle by Chap. 32), and a whole vocabulary of trickery: “steal” (with the variations “be stealthy” and “steal the wits”), “take away” (see Chap. 27), “snatch,” and “rob.”"

"Torah, Genesis.30.17",15 She said to her:
"Torah, Genesis.30.18",Is your taking away my husband such a small thing
"Torah, Genesis.30.19",that you would now take away my son’s love-apples?
"Torah, Genesis.30.20",Rahel said:
"Torah, Genesis.30.21","Very well, he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son’s love-apples."
"Torah, Genesis.30.22","16 So when Yaakov came home from the fields in the evening, Lea went out to meet him and said:"
"Torah, Genesis.30.23","You must come in to me,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.24","for I have hired, yes, hired you for my son’s love-apples."
"Torah, Genesis.30.25",So he lay with her that night.
"Torah, Genesis.30.26","17 And God hearkened to Lea,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.27",so that she became pregnant and bore Yaakov a fifth son.
"Torah, Genesis.30.28",18 Lea said:
"Torah, Genesis.30.29","God has given me my hired-wages,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.30",because I gave my maid to my husband!
"Torah, Genesis.30.31",So she called his name: Yissakhar/There-Is-Hire.
"Torah, Genesis.30.32","19 Once again Lea became pregnant, and she bore a sixth son to Yaakov."
"Torah, Genesis.30.33",20 Lea said:
"Torah, Genesis.30.34","God has presented me with a good present,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.35",this time my husband will prize me—
"Torah, Genesis.30.36",for I have borne him six sons!
"Torah, Genesis.30.37",So she called his name: Zevulun/Prince.
"Torah, Genesis.30.38","21 Afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name Dina."
"Torah, Genesis.30.39","22 But God kept Rahel in mind,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.40","God hearkened to her and opened her womb,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.41",23 so that she became pregnant and bore a son.
"Torah, Genesis.30.42",She said:
"Torah, Genesis.30.43",God has removed/<i>asaf</i>
"Torah, Genesis.30.44",my reproach!
"Torah, Genesis.30.45","24 So she called his name: Yosef,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.46",saying:
"Torah, Genesis.30.47",May Y<small>HWH</small> add/<i>yosef</i>
"Torah, Genesis.30.48",another son to me!
"Torah, Genesis.30.49","25 Now it was, once Rahel had borne Yosef, that Yaakov said to Lavan:"
"Torah, Genesis.30.50","Send me free, that I may go back to my place, to my land,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.51","26 give over my wives and my children,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.52","for whom I have served you,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.53",and I will go.
"Torah, Genesis.30.54","Indeed, you yourself know my service that I have served you!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.55",27 Lavan said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.30.56","Pray, if I have found favor in your eyes …"
"Torah, Genesis.30.57","I have become wealthy,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.58",and Y<small>HWH</small> has blessed me on account of you.
"Torah, Genesis.30.59","28 And he said: Specify the wages due you from me, and I will give you payment."
"Torah, Genesis.30.60",29 He said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.30.61",You yourself know
"Torah, Genesis.30.62","how I have served you,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.63",and how it has gone with your livestock in my charge.
"Torah, Genesis.30.64","30 For you had but few before me,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.65",and they have since burst out into a multitude.
"Torah, Genesis.30.66",Thus has Y<small>HWH</small> blessed you at my every step!
"Torah, Genesis.30.67","But now, when may I too do something for my household?"
"Torah, Genesis.30.68",31 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.30.69",What shall I give you?
"Torah, Genesis.30.70",Yaakov said:
"Torah, Genesis.30.71",You are not to give me anything—
"Torah, Genesis.30.72","only do this thing for me,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.73","then I will return, I will tend your flock, I will keep watch:"
"Torah, Genesis.30.74",32 Let me go over your whole flock today
"Torah, Genesis.30.75",removing from there every speckled and dappled head;
"Torah, Genesis.30.76","and every dark head among the lambs, and each dappled and speckled-one among the goats—they shall be my wages."
"Torah, Genesis.30.77",33 And may my honesty plead for me on a future day:
"Torah, Genesis.30.78","when you come-to-check my wages (that are) before you,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.79","whatever is not speckled or dappled among the goats, or dark among the lambs,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.80",it will be as though stolen by me.
"Torah, Genesis.30.81",34 Lavan said:
"Torah, Genesis.30.82","Good, let it be according to your words."
"Torah, Genesis.30.83",35 And on that (very) day he removed the streaked and dappled he-goats
"Torah, Genesis.30.84","and every speckled and dappled she-goat, every one that had any white on it,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.85","and every dark-one among the lambs,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.86",and handed them over to his sons.
"Torah, Genesis.30.87",36 Then he put a three-days’ journey between himself and Yaakov.
"Torah, Genesis.30.88",Now Yaakov was tending Lavan’s remaining flock.
"Torah, Genesis.30.89","37 Yaakov took himself rods from moist poplar, almond, and plane trees"
"Torah, Genesis.30.90","and peeled white peelings in them, exposing the white that was on the rods,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.91","38 then he presented the rods that he had peeled in the gutters, in the water troughs where the flock would come to drink, in front of the flock."
"Torah, Genesis.30.92",Now they would be in heat as they came to drink;
"Torah, Genesis.30.93","39 thus the flock came to be in heat by the rods,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.94","and the flock bore streaked, speckled, and dappled (young)."
"Torah, Genesis.30.95","40 But the sheep, Yaakov set apart,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.96",and gave position among the flock to each streaked-one and every dark-one among Lavan’s flocks;
"Torah, Genesis.30.97","thus he made special herds for himself, but did not make them for Lavan’s flock."
"Torah, Genesis.30.98","41 So it was that whenever the robust flock-animals were in heat,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.99","Yaakov would put the rods in sight of the flock-animals, in the gutters, to make them be in heat next to the rods."
"Torah, Genesis.30.100","42 But when the flock-animals were feeble, he would not put them there."
"Torah, Genesis.30.101","And so it was that the feeble-ones became Lavan’s, and the robust-ones, Yaakov’s."
"Torah, Genesis.30.102","43 The man burst-forth-with-wealth exceedingly, yes, exceedingly, he came to have many flock-animals and maids and servants, and camels and donkeys."
"Torah, Genesis.30.103","31:1 Now he heard the words of Lavan’s sons, (that they) said:"
"Torah, Genesis.30.104","Yaakov has taken away all that was our father’s,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.105",and from what was our father’s he has made all this weighty-wealth!
"Torah, Genesis.30.106",2 And Yaakov saw by Lavan’s face:
"Torah, Genesis.30.107","here, he was no longer with him as yesterday and the day-before."
"Torah, Genesis.30.108",3 And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yaakov:
"Torah, Genesis.30.109","Return to the land of your fathers, to your kindred!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.110",I will be with you!
"Torah, Genesis.30.111","4 So Yaakov sent and had Rahel and Lea called to the field, to his animals,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.112",5 and said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.30.113",I see by your father’s face:
"Torah, Genesis.30.114","indeed, he is no longer toward me as yesterday and the day-before."
"Torah, Genesis.30.115",But the God of my father has been with me!
"Torah, Genesis.30.116","6 You yourselves know that I have served your father with all my might,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.117","7 but your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times over,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.118",yet God has not allowed him to do me ill.
"Torah, Genesis.30.119","8 If he said thus: The speckled-ones shall be your wages,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.120","all the animals would bear speckled-ones,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.121","and if he said thus: The streaked-ones shall be your wages,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.122",all the animals would bear streaked-ones.
"Torah, Genesis.30.123",9 So God has snatched away your father’s livestock and given them to me.
"Torah, Genesis.30.124",10 Now it was at the time of the animals’ being in heat
"Torah, Genesis.30.125",that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream:
"Torah, Genesis.30.126","here, the he-goats that mount the animals—streaked, speckled, and spotted!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.127",11 And God’s messenger said to me in the dream: Yaakov!
"Torah, Genesis.30.128",I said: Here I am.
"Torah, Genesis.30.129",12 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.30.130",Pray lift up your eyes and see:
"Torah, Genesis.30.131","All the he-goats that mount the animals—streaked, speckled, and spotted!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.132",For I have seen all that Lavan is doing to you.
"Torah, Genesis.30.133","13 I am the God of Bet-El,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.134","where you anointed the pillar,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.135",where you vowed a vow to me.
"Torah, Genesis.30.136","So-now, arise,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.137","get out of this land,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.138",return to the land of your kindred!
"Torah, Genesis.30.139","14 Rahel and Lea answered him, they said to him:"
"Torah, Genesis.30.140","Do we still have a share, an inheritance in our father’s house?"
"Torah, Genesis.30.141",15 Is it not as strangers that we are thought of by him?
"Torah, Genesis.30.142","For he has sold us and eaten up, yes, eaten up our purchase-price!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.143","16 Indeed, all the riches that God has snatched away from our father—"
"Torah, Genesis.30.144",they belong to us and to our children.
"Torah, Genesis.30.145","So-now, whatever God has said to you, do!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.146","17 So Yaakov arose, he lifted his children and his wives onto the camels"
"Torah, Genesis.30.147","18 and led away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.148","the acquired-livestock of his own acquiring which he had gained in the country of Aram,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.149",to come home to Yitzhak his father in the land of Canaan.
"Torah, Genesis.30.150",19 Now Lavan had gone to shear his flock;
"Torah, Genesis.30.151","Rahel, meanwhile, stole the <i>terafim</i> that belonged to her father."
"Torah, Genesis.30.152","20 And Yaakov stole-the-wits of Lavan the Aramean,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.153",by not telling him that he was about to flee.
"Torah, Genesis.30.154","21 And flee he did, he and all that was his;"
"Torah, Genesis.30.155","he arose and crossed the River, setting his face toward the hill-country of Gil’ad."
"Torah, Genesis.30.156",22 Lavan was told on the third day that Yaakov had fled;
"Torah, Genesis.30.157","23 he took his tribal-brothers with him and pursued him, a seven-days’ journey,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.158",and caught up with him in the hill-country of Gil’ad.
"Torah, Genesis.30.159",24 But God came to Lavan the Aramean in a dream of the night
"Torah, Genesis.30.160",and said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.30.161",Be on your watch
"Torah, Genesis.30.162","lest you speak to Yaakov, be it good or ill!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.163","25 When Lavan caught up with Yaakov,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.164","—Yaakov had pegged his tent in the mountains, and Lavan along with his brothers had pegged (his tent) in the hill-country of Gil’ad—"
"Torah, Genesis.30.165",26 Lavan said to Yaakov:
"Torah, Genesis.30.166",What did you mean to do
"Torah, Genesis.30.167",by stealing my wits and leading my daughters away like captives of the sword?
"Torah, Genesis.30.168","27 Why did you secretly flee and steal away on me, without even telling me,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.169","—for I would have sent you off with joy and with song, with drum and with lyre—"
"Torah, Genesis.30.170",28 and you did not even allow me to kiss my grandchildren and my daughters?
"Torah, Genesis.30.171",You have done foolishly now!
"Torah, Genesis.30.172",29 It lies in my hand’s power to do (all of) you ill!
"Torah, Genesis.30.173","But yesterday night the God of your father said to me, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.30.174",Be on your watch
"Torah, Genesis.30.175","from speaking to Yaakov, be it good or ill!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.176","30 Well now, you had to go, yes, go, since you longed, longed for your father’s house—"
"Torah, Genesis.30.177",Why did you steal my gods?
"Torah, Genesis.30.178",31 Yaakov answered and said to Lavan:
"Torah, Genesis.30.179","Indeed, I was afraid, for I said to myself: Perhaps you will even rob me of your daughters!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.180",32 With whomever you find your gods—he shall not live;
"Torah, Genesis.30.181","here in front of our brothers, (see if) you recognize anything of yours with me, and take it!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.182",Yaakov did not know that Rahel had stolen them.
"Torah, Genesis.30.183","33 Lavan came into Yaakov’s tent and into Lea’s tent and into the tents of the two maids, but he did not find anything."
"Torah, Genesis.30.184",Then he went out of Lea’s tent and came into Rahel’s tent.
"Torah, Genesis.30.185","34 Now Rahel had taken the <i>terafim</i> and had put them in the basket-saddle of the camels, and had sat down upon them."
"Torah, Genesis.30.186","Lavan felt all around the tent, but he did not find anything."
"Torah, Genesis.30.187",35 She said to her father:
"Torah, Genesis.30.188","Do not let upset be in my lord’s eyes that I am not able to rise in your presence,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.189",for the manner of women is upon me.
"Torah, Genesis.30.190","So he searched, but he did not find the <i>terafim.</i>"
"Torah, Genesis.30.191","36 And Yaakov became upset and took up quarrel with Lavan,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.192","Yaakov spoke up, saying to Lavan:"
"Torah, Genesis.30.193","What is my offense, what is my sin,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.194","that you have dashed hotly after me,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.195",37 that you have felt all through my wares?
"Torah, Genesis.30.196",What have you found from all your household-wares?
"Torah, Genesis.30.197","Set it here in front of your brothers and my brothers,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.198",that they may decide between us two!
"Torah, Genesis.30.199",38 It is twenty years now that I have been under you:
"Torah, Genesis.30.200","your ewes and your she-goats have never miscarried,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.201","the rams from your flock I never have eaten,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.202",39 none torn-by-beasts have I ever brought you—
"Torah, Genesis.30.203","I would make good the loss,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.204","at my hand you would seek it,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.205",stolen by day or stolen by night.
"Torah, Genesis.30.206",40 (Thus) I was:
"Torah, Genesis.30.207","by day, parching-heat consumed me, and cold by night,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.208",and my sleep eluded my eyes.
"Torah, Genesis.30.209",41 It is twenty years for me now in your house:
"Torah, Genesis.30.210","I have served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your animals,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.211",yet you have changed my wages ten times over.
"Torah, Genesis.30.212","42 Had not the God of my father,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.213","the God of Avraham and the Terror of Yitzhak,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.214","been-there for me,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.215","indeed, you would have sent me off now, empty-handed!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.216","But God has seen my being afflicted and the toil of my hands,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.217",and yesterday night he decided.
"Torah, Genesis.30.218","43 Lavan gave answer, he said to Yaakov:"
"Torah, Genesis.30.219","The daughters are my daughters,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.220","the children are my children,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.221",the animals are my animals—
"Torah, Genesis.30.222","all that you see, it is mine!"
"Torah, Genesis.30.223","But to my daughters—what can I do to them today, or to their children whom they have borne?"
"Torah, Genesis.30.224","44 So now, come,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.225","let us cut a covenant, I and you,"
"Torah, Genesis.30.226",and let (something here) serve as a witness between me and you.
"Torah, Genesis.30.227",45 Yaakov took a stone and erected it as a standing-pillar.
"Torah, Genesis.30.228",46 And Yaakov said to his brothers:
"Torah, Genesis.30.229",Collect stones!
"Torah, Genesis.30.230",They fetched stones and made a mound.
"Torah, Genesis.30.231",And they ate there by the mound.

This is the key to understanding the meeting between Yaakov and his brother in its entirety: Yaakov will have to deal with God before he can resolve his problem with Esav."

"Torah, Genesis.31.11","50 If you should ever afflict my daughters,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.12",if you should ever take wives besides my daughters … !
"Torah, Genesis.31.13","No man is here with us,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.14","(but) see, God is witness between me and you!"
"Torah, Genesis.31.15",51 And Lavan said to Yaakov:
"Torah, Genesis.31.16","Here is this mound, here is the pillar that I have sunk between me and you:"
"Torah, Genesis.31.17","52 witness is this mound, witness is the pillar"
"Torah, Genesis.31.18",that I will not cross over this mound to you
"Torah, Genesis.31.19","and you will not cross over this mound and this pillar to me, for ill!"
"Torah, Genesis.31.20",53 May the God of Avraham and the God of Nahor keep-justice between us—the God of their father.
"Torah, Genesis.31.21",And Yaakov swore by the Terror of his father Yitzhak.
"Torah, Genesis.31.22",54 Then Yaakov slaughtered a slaughter-meal on the mountain
"Torah, Genesis.31.23",and called his brothers to eat bread.
"Torah, Genesis.31.24",They ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.
"Torah, Genesis.31.25","32:1 Lavan started-early in the morning, kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.26",and Lavan went to return to his place.
"Torah, Genesis.31.27","2 As Yaakov went on his way,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.28",messengers of God encountered him.
"Torah, Genesis.31.29",3 Yaakov said when he saw them:
"Torah, Genesis.31.30",This is a camp of God!
"Torah, Genesis.31.31",And he called the name of that place: Mahanayim/Double-Camp.
"Torah, Genesis.31.32","4 Yaakov sent messengers on ahead of him to Esav his brother in the land of Se’ir, in the territory of Edom,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.33","5 and commanded them, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.31.34","Thus say to my lord, to Esav:"
"Torah, Genesis.31.35",Thus says your servant Yaakov:
"Torah, Genesis.31.36",I have sojourned with Lavan and have tarried until now.
"Torah, Genesis.31.37","6 Ox and donkey, sheep and servant and maid have become mine."
"Torah, Genesis.31.38","I have sent to tell my lord, to find favor in your eyes."
"Torah, Genesis.31.39","7 The messengers returned to Yaakov, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.31.40","We came to your brother, to Esav—"
"Torah, Genesis.31.41","but he is already coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him!"
"Torah, Genesis.31.42",8 Yaakov became exceedingly afraid and was distressed.
"Torah, Genesis.31.43","He divided the people that were with him and the sheep and the oxen and the camels into two camps,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.44",9 saying to himself:
"Torah, Genesis.31.45","Should Esav come against the one camp and strike it, the camp that is left will escape."
"Torah, Genesis.31.46",10 Then Yaakov said:
"Torah, Genesis.31.47","God of my father Avraham,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.48","God of my father Yitzhak,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.49","O Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.50","who said to me: Return to your land, to your kindred, and I will deal well with you!—"
"Torah, Genesis.31.51",11 Too small am I for all the faithfulness and trust that you have shown your servant.
"Torah, Genesis.31.52","For with only my rod did I cross this Jordan, and now I have become two camps."
"Torah, Genesis.31.53","12 Pray save me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esav!"
"Torah, Genesis.31.54","For I am in fear of him,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.55","lest he come and strike me down, mothers and children alike!"
"Torah, Genesis.31.56","13 But you, you have said:"
"Torah, Genesis.31.57","I will deal well, well with you,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.58","I will make your seed like the sand of the sea, which is too much to count!"
"Torah, Genesis.31.59","14 Spending the night there that night,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.60","he took a gift from what was at hand, for Esav his brother:"
"Torah, Genesis.31.61","15 she-goats, two hundred, and kids, twenty,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.62","ewes, two hundred, and rams, twenty,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.63","16 nursing camels and their young, thirty,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.64","cows, forty, and bulls, ten,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.65","she-asses, twenty, and colts, ten;"
"Torah, Genesis.31.66","17 he handed them over to his servants, herd by herd separately,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.67",and said to his servants:
"Torah, Genesis.31.68","Cross on ahead of me, and leave room between herd and herd."
"Torah, Genesis.31.69","18 He charged the first group, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.31.70",When Esav my brother meets you
"Torah, Genesis.31.71","and asks you, saying: To whom do you belong, where are you going, and to whom do these ahead of you belong?"
"Torah, Genesis.31.72",19 Then say:
"Torah, Genesis.31.73","—to your servant, to Yaakov, it is a gift sent to my lord, to Esav,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.74","and here, he himself is also behind us."
"Torah, Genesis.31.75","20 Thus he charged the second, and thus the third, and thus all that were walking behind the herds, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.31.76",According to this word shall you speak to Esav when you come upon him:
"Torah, Genesis.31.77","21 You shall say: Also—here, your servant Yaakov is behind us."
"Torah, Genesis.31.78",For he said to himself:
"Torah, Genesis.31.79",I will wipe (the anger from) his face
"Torah, Genesis.31.80",with the gift that goes ahead of my face;
"Torah, Genesis.31.81","afterward, when I see his face,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.82",perhaps he will lift up my face!
"Torah, Genesis.31.83","22 The gift crossed over ahead of his face,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.84",but he spent the night on that night in the camp.
"Torah, Genesis.31.85","23 He arose during that night,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.86","took his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven children"
"Torah, Genesis.31.87",to cross the Yabbok crossing.
"Torah, Genesis.31.88",24 He took them and brought them across the river; he brought across what belonged to him.
"Torah, Genesis.31.89",25 And Yaakov was left alone—
"Torah, Genesis.31.90",And a man wrestled with him until the coming up of dawn.
"Torah, Genesis.31.91","26 When he saw that he could not prevail against him,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.92",he touched the socket of his thigh;
"Torah, Genesis.31.93",the socket of Yaakov’s thigh had been dislocated as he wrestled with him.
"Torah, Genesis.31.94",27 Then he said:
"Torah, Genesis.31.95","Let me go,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.96",for dawn has come up!
"Torah, Genesis.31.97",But he said:
"Torah, Genesis.31.98",I will not let you go
"Torah, Genesis.31.99",unless you bless me.
"Torah, Genesis.31.100",28 He said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.31.101",What is your name?
"Torah, Genesis.31.102",And he said: Yaakov.
"Torah, Genesis.31.103",29 Then he said:
"Torah, Genesis.31.104","Not as Yaakov/Heel-Sneak shall your name be henceforth uttered,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.105","but rather as Yisrael/ God-Fighter,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.106",for you have fought with God and men
"Torah, Genesis.31.107",and have prevailed.
"Torah, Genesis.31.108",30 Then Yaakov asked and said:
"Torah, Genesis.31.109",Pray tell me your name!
"Torah, Genesis.31.110",But he said:
"Torah, Genesis.31.111",Now why do you ask after my name?
"Torah, Genesis.31.112",And he gave him farewell-blessing there.
"Torah, Genesis.31.113","31 Yaakov called the name of the place: Peniel/Face of God,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.114","for: I have seen God,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.115","face to face,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.116",and my life has been saved.
"Torah, Genesis.31.117","32 The sun rose on him as he crossed by Penuel,"
"Torah, Genesis.31.118",and he was limping on his thigh.
"Torah, Genesis.31.119",33 —Therefore the Children of Israel do not eat the sinew that is on
"Torah, Genesis.31.120","the socket of the thigh until this day,"

"Torah, Genesis.32.2","The great wrestling scene at the Yabbok both symbolizes and resolves beforehand Yaakov’s meeting with Esav, much as Shakespeare’s prebattle dream scenes (e.g., <i>Julius Caesar, Richard III, Macbeth</i>) will do with his characters. Struggle, the motif already introduced in the mother’s womb (Chap. 25), returns here, but that is not the only consideration. At issue is Yaakov’s whole life and personality, which despite his recent material successes are still under the pall of Esav’s curse (27:36). Central, then, is the change of name in v.29, which suggests both a victorious struggle and the emergence of a new power. This is further supported by the Hebrew plays on sound: <i>Y’KB</i> (Yaakov), <i>YBK</i> (Yabbok), and <i>Y’BK</i> (wrestling)."

The narrative is brought full circle in vv.10 and 11, where “face” is once again highlighted and where Yaakov’s gift is termed a “token-of-blessing.” At last the tension of Yaakov’s early life seems resolved."
"Torah, Genesis.33.2",33:1 Yaakov lifted up his eyes and saw:
"Torah, Genesis.33.3","there was Esav coming, and with him, four hundred men!"
"Torah, Genesis.33.4","He divided the children among Lea, Rahel, and the two maids:"

"Torah, Genesis.33.15",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.33.16",—the children with whom God has favored your servant.

"Torah, Genesis.33.18",7 Then Lea and her children came close and bowed low.

"Torah, Genesis.33.26",10 Yaakov said:
"Torah, Genesis.33.27","No, I pray!"
"Torah, Genesis.33.28","Pray, if I have found favor in your eyes,"
"Torah, Genesis.33.29",then take this gift from my hand.

"Torah, Genesis.33.35",12 Then he said:
"Torah, Genesis.33.36","Let us travel on, and I will go on at your side."
"Torah, Genesis.33.37",13 But he said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.33.38",My lord knows
"Torah, Genesis.33.39","that the children are frail,"
"Torah, Genesis.33.40",and the sheep and the oxen are suckling in my care;

"Torah, Genesis.33.42","14 Pray let my lord cross on ahead of his servant,"

"Torah, Genesis.33.44","at the pace of the gear ahead of me and at the pace of the children,"
"Torah, Genesis.33.45","until I come to my lord, at Se’ir."
"Torah, Genesis.33.46",15 Esav said:
"Torah, Genesis.33.47",Pray let me leave with you some of the people who are mine.
"Torah, Genesis.33.48",But he said:
"Torah, Genesis.33.49",For what reason?
"Torah, Genesis.33.50",May I only find favor in my lord’s eyes!
"Torah, Genesis.33.51","16 So Esav started back that same day on his journey to Se’ir,"
"Torah, Genesis.33.52",17 while Yaakov traveled to Succot.
"Torah, Genesis.33.53","He built himself a house there, and for his livestock he made sheds."
"Torah, Genesis.33.54",Therefore they called the name of the place: Succot/Sheds.
"Torah, Genesis.33.55","18 Yaakov came home in peace to the city of Shekhem, which is in the land of Canaan,"
"Torah, Genesis.33.56","on his homecoming from the country of Aram,"
"Torah, Genesis.33.57",and he encamped facing the city.
"Torah, Genesis.33.58","19 And he acquired the piece of territory where he had spread out his tent, from the Sons of Hamor, Shekhem’s father, for a hundred lambs’-worth."
"Torah, Genesis.33.59",20 There he set up a slaughter-site
"Torah, Genesis.33.60",and called it:
"Torah, Genesis.33.61","<i>El</i>/God, the God of Yisrael!"

"Torah, Genesis.34.1","<i>Home: Peace and Violence</i> (33:18–34:31): “Yaakov came home in peace to the city of Shekhem” (33:18) continues the theme of resolution. Not only has Esav accepted his gift, but Yaakov has arrived home safely, in fulfillment of his prayer in 28:21. Like Avraham he purchases land; again like him he builds an altar."
"Torah, Genesis.34.2","Chap. 34, however, shatters the newly created atmosphere of security and peace (“peaceably disposed” in v.21 is a bitter twist). Whereas Avraham and Yitzhak had been able to conclude treaties with the inhabitants of Canaan, Yaakov winds up in the opposite position. The text implies, as usual, that Canaanite sexual behavior is odious (v.7, “such [a thing] is not to be done!”), and this provides the spring for the action. Interestingly, Yaakov’s sons act somewhat like their father had, “with deceit” (v.13); and love once again leads to an unfortunate end."
"Torah, Genesis.34.3","The vengefulness and brutality of Yaakov’s sons in this story anticipates their later behavior in the Yosef story (Chap. 37); surprisingly, it is for the present crime and not the sale of Yosef that their father condemns them on his deathbed (49:5–7)."
"Torah, Genesis.34.4","The chapter is notable for the latitude it allows its characters to express their thoughts and emotions: Shekhem’s desire and love, the sons’ anger and cunning, the Hivvites’ gullibility and greed, and Yaakov’s fear. Like other stories in the Yaakov cycle, it presents us with a somewhat ambiguous situation, where right and wrong are not always simple and the putative heroes are not always heroic."
"Torah, Genesis.34.5","34:1 Dina, Lea’s daughter, whom she had borne to Yaakov, went out to see the women of the land."
"Torah, Genesis.34.6","2 And Shekhem son of Hamor the Hivvite, the prince of the land, saw her:"
"Torah, Genesis.34.7","he took her and lay with her, forcing her."

"Torah, Genesis.34.13","but since his sons were with his livestock in the fields, Yaakov kept silent until they came home."
"Torah, Genesis.34.14","6 Hamor, Shekhem’s father, went out to Yaakov, to speak with him."
"Torah, Genesis.34.15","7 But Yaakov’s sons came back from the fields when they heard,"

First (vv.1–7) there is the return to Bet-El, where he builds an altar and has the “foreign” gods of his household people put away—thus fulfilling his promise in Chap. 28. This passage is built upon the Hebrew word <i>El,</i> God (related actually to an earlier Northwest Semitic name for a god)."
"Torah, Genesis.35.2","Apparently a second version of Yaakov’s name change is recorded in vv.9–15. As in the case of Avraham, seed and land are promised by God. The land can be given to him and “to your seed after you” only upon his return."
"Torah, Genesis.35.3","Finally, spread out through the chapter are the accounts of three deaths: Devora, Rivka’s nurse (v.8—a veiled reference to Rivka’s own death?), Rahel (vv.16–20), and finally Yitzhak (vv.28–29). Yaakov’s youth is over, with the dramatic break with those close to him in that period."

"Torah, Genesis.35.7",for that would be a reproach for us!
"Torah, Genesis.35.8",15 Only on this (condition) will we comply with you:
"Torah, Genesis.35.9","if you become like us, by having every male among you circumcised."
"Torah, Genesis.35.10","16 Then we will give you our daughters, and your daughters we will take for ourselves,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.11","and we will settle among you, so that we become a single people."
"Torah, Genesis.35.12","17 But if you do not hearken to us, to be circumcised,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.13",we will take our daughter and go.
"Torah, Genesis.35.14","18 Their words seemed good in the eyes of Hamor and in the eyes of Shekhem son of Hamor,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.15","19 and the young man did not hesitate to do the thing,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.16",for he desired Yaakov’s daughter.
"Torah, Genesis.35.17",Now he carried more weight than anyone in his father’s house.
"Torah, Genesis.35.18","20 When Hamor and Shekhem his son came back to the gate of their city,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.19","they spoke to the men of their city, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.35.20",21 These men are peaceably disposed toward us;
"Torah, Genesis.35.21","let them settle in the land and travel about in it,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.22",for the land is certainly wide-reaching enough for them!
"Torah, Genesis.35.23","Let us take their daughters as wives for ourselves, and let us give them our daughters."
"Torah, Genesis.35.24","22 But only on this (condition) will the men comply with us, to settle among us, to become a single people:"
"Torah, Genesis.35.25","that every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised."
"Torah, Genesis.35.26","23 Their acquired livestock, their acquired property and all their beasts—will they not then become ours?!"
"Torah, Genesis.35.27","Let us only comply with them, that they may settle among us!"
"Torah, Genesis.35.28","24 So they hearkened to Hamor and to Shekhem his son, all who go out (to war) from the gate of his city:"
"Torah, Genesis.35.29","all the males were circumcised, all who go out (to war) from the gate of his city."
"Torah, Genesis.35.30","25 But on the third day it was, when they were still hurting,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.31","that two of Yaakov’s sons, Shim’on and Levi, Dina’s full-brothers, took each man his sword,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.32","they came upon the city (feeling) secure, and killed all the males,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.33",26 and Hamor and Shekhem his son they killed by the sword.
"Torah, Genesis.35.34",Then they took Dina from Shekhem’s house and went off.
"Torah, Genesis.35.35","27 Yaakov’s (other) sons came up upon the corpses and plundered the city,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.36",because they had defiled their sister.
"Torah, Genesis.35.37","28 Their sheep, their oxen, their donkeys—whatever was inside the city and out in the field, they took,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.38","29 all their riches, all their little-ones and their wives they captured and plundered,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.39",as well as all that was in the houses.
"Torah, Genesis.35.40",30 But Yaakov said to Shim’on and to Levi:
"Torah, Genesis.35.41","You have stirred-up-trouble for me,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.42","making me reek among the settled-folk of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites!"
"Torah, Genesis.35.43",For I have menfolk few in number;
"Torah, Genesis.35.44","they will band together against me and strike me,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.45","and I will be destroyed, I and my household!"
"Torah, Genesis.35.46",31 But they said:
"Torah, Genesis.35.47",Should our sister then be treated like a whore?
"Torah, Genesis.35.48",35:1 God said to Yaakov:
"Torah, Genesis.35.49","Arise,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.50","go up to Bet-El and stay there,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.51",and construct a slaughter-site there
"Torah, Genesis.35.52",to the God/<i>El</i> who was seen by you when you fled from Esav your brother.
"Torah, Genesis.35.53",2 Yaakov said to his household and to all who were with him:
"Torah, Genesis.35.54",Put away the foreign gods that are in your midst!
"Torah, Genesis.35.55",Purify yourselves! Change your garments!
"Torah, Genesis.35.56","3 Let us arise and go up to Bet-El,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.57",there I will construct a slaughter-site
"Torah, Genesis.35.58",to the God who answered me on the day of my distress
"Torah, Genesis.35.59",—he was with me on the way that I went!
"Torah, Genesis.35.60","4 So they gave Yaakov all the foreign gods that were in their hand, along with the sacred-rings that were in their ears,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.61",and Yaakov concealed them under the oak/ <i>ela</i> that is near Shekhem.
"Torah, Genesis.35.62",5 Then they moved on.
"Torah, Genesis.35.63","Now a dread from God lay upon the towns that were around them,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.64",so that they did not pursue Yaakov’s sons.
"Torah, Genesis.35.65","6 So Yaakov came back to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan—that is now Bet-El—he and all the people that were with him."
"Torah, Genesis.35.66",7 There he built a slaughter-site
"Torah, Genesis.35.67",and called the place:
"Torah, Genesis.35.68",Godhead/<i>El</i> of Bet-El!
"Torah, Genesis.35.69","For there had the power-of-God been revealed to him, when he fled from his brother."
"Torah, Genesis.35.70","8 Devora, Rivka’s nurse, died."
"Torah, Genesis.35.71","She was buried below Bet-El, beneath the oak;"
"Torah, Genesis.35.72",they called its name: Allon Bakhut/Oak of Weeping.
"Torah, Genesis.35.73","9 God was seen by Yaakov again, when he came back from the country of Aram,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.74",and he gave him blessing:
"Torah, Genesis.35.75",10 God said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.35.76","Yaakov is your name,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.77","Yaakov shall your name be called no more,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.78",for your name shall be Yisrael!
"Torah, Genesis.35.79",And he called his name: Yisrael!
"Torah, Genesis.35.80",11 God said further to him:
"Torah, Genesis.35.81",I am God Shaddai.
"Torah, Genesis.35.82",Bear fruit and be many!
"Torah, Genesis.35.83","Nation, yes, a host of nations shall come from you,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.84",kings shall go out from your loins!
"Torah, Genesis.35.85",12 The land
"Torah, Genesis.35.86","that I gave to Avraham and to Yitzhak,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.87","to you I give it,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.88",and to your seed after you I give the land.
"Torah, Genesis.35.89","13 God went up from beside him, at the place where he had spoken with him."
"Torah, Genesis.35.90","14 And Yaakov set up a standing-pillar at the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.91",he poured out a poured-offering on it and cast oil upon it.
"Torah, Genesis.35.92",15 And Yaakov called the name of the place where God had spoken with him:
"Torah, Genesis.35.93",Bet-El/House of God!
"Torah, Genesis.35.94",16 They departed from Bet-El.
"Torah, Genesis.35.95","But when there was still a stretch of land to come to Efrat,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.96","Rahel began to give birth,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.97",and she had a very hard birthing.
"Torah, Genesis.35.98","17 It was, when her birthing was at its hardest,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.99",that the midwife said to her:
"Torah, Genesis.35.100","Do not be afraid,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.101",for this one too is a son for you!
"Torah, Genesis.35.102","18 It was, as her life was slipping away"

"Torah, Genesis.35.111",19 So Rahel died;
"Torah, Genesis.35.112",she was buried along the way to Efrat—that is now Bet-Lehem.
"Torah, Genesis.35.113","20 And Yaakov set up a standing-pillar over her burial-place,"
"Torah, Genesis.35.114",that is Rahel’s burial pillar of today.

"Torah, Genesis.35.118",Now the sons of Yaakov were twelve:
"Torah, Genesis.35.119","23 The sons of Lea: Yaakov’s firstborn, Re’uven; Shim’on, Levi and Yehuda, Yissakhar and Zevulun."
"Torah, Genesis.35.120",24 The sons of Rahel: Yosef and Binyamin.

"Torah, Genesis.36.1","<i>Re’uven</i> (35:21–22): The following tiny fragment, concerning Re’uven’s usurping his father’s concubine, serves to presage his fall as firstborn later on. Such an act had symbolic value in biblical society; Avshalom (Absalom) sleeps with David’s concubines as a sign of rebellion and a desire to attain the crown (II Sam. 16:21–22)."
"Torah, Genesis.37.1","<i>Esav’s Descendants</i> (36): The complicated genealogies and dynasties of this chapter close out the first part of the Yaakov cycle, strictly speaking. Fitting in the context of a society which lay great store by kinship and thus by careful remembering of family names, it may also indicate the greatness of Yitzhak’s line, as Chap. 25 had earlier done for Avraham. Certainly the lists give evidence of a time when the Edomites were more than merely Israel’s neighbors, assuming great importance in historical recollection (Speiser)."
"Torah, Genesis.37.2",36:1 And these are the begettings of Esav—that is Edom.
"Torah, Genesis.37.3",2 Esav took his wives from the women of Canaan:

"Torah, Genesis.38.1","<i>Young Yosef: Love and Hate</i> (37): As has been the pattern with the Avraham and Yaakov cycles, the opening chapter here introduces the key themes of the entire story. These include the father’s love, the power of words, dreams, “ill” as a key word (here denoting evil intent but eventually encompassing misfortune, among other concepts), and of course, the brothers’ hatred, which at first glance is the motivating force behind the action."
"Torah, Genesis.38.2","But the initial blame for what happens clearly lies with the father (vv.3–4), and is made unbearable by Yosef’s own behavior. In point of fact he is largely responsible for his own downfall, bearing tales about his brothers (v.2) even before Yaakov’s preference for him is noted. His insistence on telling his dreams to his brothers must be galling, particularly the second time (v.9), coming as it does after the report that “they hated him still more for his dreams” (v.8)."
"Torah, Genesis.38.3","The key word of the chapter, not surprisingly, is “brother,” culminating in Yehuda’s ironic words (v.27): “let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother….” Shortly afterward Yosef, their “(own) flesh,” is sold into slavery and probable death."

"Torah, Genesis.38.40",12 His brothers went to tend their father’s sheep in Shekhem.
"Torah, Genesis.38.41",13 Yisrael said to Yosef:
"Torah, Genesis.38.42",Are not your brothers tending sheep in Shekhem?
"Torah, Genesis.38.43","Come, I will send you to them!"
"Torah, Genesis.38.44",He said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.38.45",Here I am.
"Torah, Genesis.38.46",14 And he said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.38.47","Come, pray, look into the well-being of your brothers and into the well-being of the sheep,"
"Torah, Genesis.38.48",and bring me back word.
"Torah, Genesis.38.49","So he sent him out from the valley of Hevron, and he came to Shekhem."
"Torah, Genesis.38.50","15 And a man came upon him—here, he was roaming in the field;"
"Torah, Genesis.38.51","the man asked him, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.38.52",What do you seek?
"Torah, Genesis.38.53",16 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.38.54","I seek my brothers,"
"Torah, Genesis.38.55",pray tell me where they are tending-sheep.
"Torah, Genesis.38.56",17 The man said:
"Torah, Genesis.38.57","They have moved on from here,"
"Torah, Genesis.38.58","indeed, I heard them say: Let us go to Dotan."
"Torah, Genesis.38.59",Yosef went after his brothers and came upon them in Dotan.
"Torah, Genesis.38.60","18 They saw him from afar,"
"Torah, Genesis.38.61","and before he had gotten near them, they plotted-cunningly against him to cause his death."
"Torah, Genesis.38.62",19 They said each man to his brother:
"Torah, Genesis.38.63",Here comes that dreamer!
"Torah, Genesis.38.64","20 So-now, come, let us kill him and cast him into one of these pits"
"Torah, Genesis.38.65",and say: An ill-tempered beast has devoured him!
"Torah, Genesis.38.66",Then we will see what becomes of his dreams!
"Torah, Genesis.38.67","21 When Re’uven heard it he tried to rescue him from their hand, he said:"
"Torah, Genesis.38.68",Let us not take his life!
"Torah, Genesis.38.69",22 And Re’uven said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.38.70",Do not shed blood!
"Torah, Genesis.38.71","Cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness,"
"Torah, Genesis.38.72",but do not lay a hand upon him!
"Torah, Genesis.38.73","—in order that he might save him from their hand, to return him to his father."
"Torah, Genesis.38.74","23 So it was, when Yosef came to his brothers,"
"Torah, Genesis.38.75","that they stripped Yosef of his coat,"
"Torah, Genesis.38.76","the ornamented coat that he had on,"
"Torah, Genesis.38.77",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.38.78","37:2 <b>begettings:</b> In the sense of “family history.” As noted above, the Yosef story is a continuation of the Yaakov saga. <b>seventeen:</b> Together with 47:28, this provides another example of numerical balance in these stories (see the Commentary on “The Patriarchal Narratives,” p. 51). Yosef lives with Yaakov for the first seventeen years of his life and for the last seventeen of his father’s. <b>along with his brothers:</b> A hint that he would one day “shepherd” (rule) his brothers? The Hebrew is open to that interpretation (Redford). <b>brought a report:</b> Or “gossip.” Although the doting father’s love is crucial, it seems really to be Yosef’s own behavior (which precedes the information about his coat) that causes his abuse by the brothers."
"Torah, Genesis.38.79",3 <b>ornamented:</b> Hebrew obscure; B-R uses “ankle-length.”
"Torah, Genesis.38.80","4 <b>hated:</b> Such a violent emotion nevertheless has once before (with Lea in 29:31) led not to disaster but to the fulfillment of the divine plan (there, the hatred results in the competition to have children). <b>in peace:</b> Or “civilly”—again the key Yaakov word, “peace.”"
"Torah, Genesis.38.81",6 <b>hear:</b> Which can also mean “understand” in biblical Hebrew.
"Torah, Genesis.38.82","8 <b>king, yes, king … rule, yes, rule:</b> The doubling might reflect the brothers’ astonishment and bitterness. See also v. 10."
"Torah, Genesis.38.83",10 <b>your mother:</b> The fact that she had died in Chap. 35 does not detract from the symbol of the dream.
"Torah, Genesis.38.84",11 <b>remembered:</b> Or “kept in mind.”
"Torah, Genesis.38.85",12 <b>Shekhem:</b> In our text this city’s name (three times here) reminds the reader of the disastrous events of Chap. 34.
"Torah, Genesis.38.86",13 <b>Come:</b> Repeated in vv.20 and 27; it is ironically Yaakov’s decision to send Yosef to his brothers that sets this part of the plot into action.
"Torah, Genesis.38.87","14 <b>well-being:</b> Heb. <i>shalom,</i> translated as “peace” in v.4 and elsewhere."
"Torah, Genesis.38.88",15 <b>a man:</b> Possibly another divine messenger (like the “man” in 32:25). See also the note to “roaming” in 20:13.
"Torah, Genesis.38.89","20 <b>ill-tempered:</b> Others, “wild.”"
"Torah, Genesis.38.90",21 <b>take his life:</b> Lit. “strike him mortally.”
"Torah, Genesis.39.1","<i>Yehuda and Tamar</i> (38): Chap. 38 has been the subject of many discussions, for it seems to be out of place. It interrupts the story of Yosef at a crucial dramatic spot, and is not chronologically fully consistent with it (Yehuda ages considerably; then we return to Yosef as a seventeen-year-old). Some feel that the suspension in the drama helps to raise tension; others argue that this is the only possible place to put an important tradition about the important brother. While these and other arguments may have their merit, one may discern some significant thematic connections as well, both within the context of the Yosef story and of Genesis as a whole."
"Torah, Genesis.39.2","The episode first of all demonstrates the growth of Yehuda as a character who is central to the Yosef novella. Already in Chap. 37 he had demonstrated active leadership, albeit in a questionable cause. There he actually saved Yosef’s life, in contrast to Re’uven’s unsuccessful and ultimately self-centered rescue attempt. As the one who basically assumes responsibility, he will be made to undergo an inner development in the narrative, and again becomes the one to take charge of the youngest son (Binyamin, in Chaps. 43 and 44). The missing piece that begins to explain his nobility in this regard (Chap. 44) is the present chapter. Yehuda here learns what it is to lose sons, and to want desperately to protect his youngest. Although his failure to marry off Tamar to the youngest son leads to public humiliation (twice, actually), his response shows that he immediately accepts blame: “She is in-the-right more than I” (v.26). Such an interpretation is further confirmed by the restriction of the word “pledge” to here and 43:9. Yehuda has learned what it means to stake oneself for a principle."
"Torah, Genesis.39.3","Only after we have been informed of Yehuda’s change can the narrative resume with Chap. 39. True to biblical thinking, redemption may start only after the crime has been punished (e.g., the Samson story, where the hero’s hair begins to grow immediately after his imprisonment)."
"Torah, Genesis.39.4","Actually the chronology works out quite well. We are told via 41:46, 53–54, that about twenty years elapse between the sale of Yosef and his meetings with the brothers in Egypt; this often signifies a period in biblical parlance and could encompass a generation or a bit less. Since Yehuda was quite possibly a father already in Chap. 37, the present story could well end just before the events reported in Chap. 43—in other words, Yehuda reaches full inner maturity just in time."
"Torah, Genesis.39.5","The other function of this story seems to be to carry out the major theme of Genesis as we have presented it: continuity and discontinuity between the generations. What is at stake here is not merely the line of one of the brothers, but the line which (as the biblical audience must have been fully aware) will lead to royalty—King David was a descendant of Peretz of v.29. This should not be surprising in a book of origins; we noted the possible mention of Jerusalem in 14:18. Apparently a popular early theme, connected as we have noted to the power of God in history, continuity/discontinuity is repeated in somewhat similar circumstances in the book of Ruth (which contains the only other mention of “begettings” outside of Genesis and Num.3:1)."
"Torah, Genesis.39.6","The narrator has woven Chaps. 38 and 37 together with great skill. Again a man is asked to “recognize” objects, again the use of a kid, and again a brother (this time a dead one) is betrayed."
"Torah, Genesis.39.7",24 and took him and cast him into the pit.
"Torah, Genesis.39.8",Now the pit was empty—no water in it.
"Torah, Genesis.39.9",25 And they sat down to eat bread.
"Torah, Genesis.39.10",They lifted up their eyes and saw:
"Torah, Genesis.39.11","there was a caravan of Yishmaelites coming from Gil’ad,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.12","their camels carrying balm, balsam, and ladanum,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.13",traveling to take them down to Egypt.
"Torah, Genesis.39.14",26 Yehuda said to his brothers:
"Torah, Genesis.39.15",What gain is there
"Torah, Genesis.39.16",if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
"Torah, Genesis.39.17","27 Come, let us sell him to the Yishmaelites—"
"Torah, Genesis.39.18","but let not our hand be upon him,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.19","for he is our brother, our flesh!"
"Torah, Genesis.39.20",And his brothers listened to him.
"Torah, Genesis.39.21","28 Meanwhile, some Midyanite men, merchants, passed by;"
"Torah, Genesis.39.22",they hauled up Yosef from the pit
"Torah, Genesis.39.23","and sold Yosef to the Yishmaelites, for twenty pieces-of-silver."
"Torah, Genesis.39.24",They brought Yosef to Egypt.
"Torah, Genesis.39.25",29 When Re’uven returned to the pit:
"Torah, Genesis.39.26","here, Yosef was no more in the pit!"
"Torah, Genesis.39.27",He rent his garments
"Torah, Genesis.39.28",30 and returned to his brothers and said:
"Torah, Genesis.39.29",The child is no more!
"Torah, Genesis.39.30",And I—where am I to go?
"Torah, Genesis.39.31","31 But they took Yosef’s coat,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.32",they slew a hairy goat
"Torah, Genesis.39.33",and dipped the coat in the blood.
"Torah, Genesis.39.34",32 They had the ornamented coat sent out
"Torah, Genesis.39.35",and had it brought to their father and said:
"Torah, Genesis.39.36",We found this;
"Torah, Genesis.39.37",pray recognize
"Torah, Genesis.39.38",whether it is your son’s coat or not!
"Torah, Genesis.39.39",33 He recognized it
"Torah, Genesis.39.40",and said:
"Torah, Genesis.39.41",My son’s coat!
"Torah, Genesis.39.42",An ill-tempered beast has devoured him!
"Torah, Genesis.39.43","Yosef is torn, torn-to-pieces!"
"Torah, Genesis.39.44","34 Yaakov rent his clothes,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.45",he put sackcloth on his loins
"Torah, Genesis.39.46",and mourned his son for many days.
"Torah, Genesis.39.47","35 All his sons and daughters arose to comfort him,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.48",but he refused to be comforted.
"Torah, Genesis.39.49",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.39.50","No,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.51",I will go down to my son
"Torah, Genesis.39.52","in mourning, to Sheol!"
"Torah, Genesis.39.53",Thus his father wept for him.
"Torah, Genesis.39.54","36 Meanwhile, the Midyanites had sold him into Egypt"
"Torah, Genesis.39.55","to Potifar, Pharaoh’s court-official,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.56",Chief of the (palace) Guard.
"Torah, Genesis.39.57",38:1 Now it was at about that time
"Torah, Genesis.39.58","that Yehuda went down, away from his brothers"
"Torah, Genesis.39.59",and turned aside to an Adullamite man—his name was Hira.
"Torah, Genesis.39.60","2 There Yehuda saw the daughter of a Canaanite man—his name was Shua,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.61",he took her (as his wife) and came in to her.
"Torah, Genesis.39.62","3 She became pregnant and bore a son, and he called his name: Er."
"Torah, Genesis.39.63","4 She became pregnant again and bore a son, and she called his name: Onan."
"Torah, Genesis.39.64","5 Once again she bore a son, and she called his name: Shela."
"Torah, Genesis.39.65",Now he was in Ceziv when she bore him.
"Torah, Genesis.39.66","6 Yehuda took a wife for Er, his firstborn—her name was Tamar."
"Torah, Genesis.39.67","7 But Er, Yehuda’s firstborn, did ill in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>, and"
"Torah, Genesis.39.68",Y<small>HWH</small> caused him to die.
"Torah, Genesis.39.69",8 Yehuda said to Onan:
"Torah, Genesis.39.70","Come in to your brother’s wife, do a brother-in-law’s duty by her,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.71",to preserve seed for your brother!
"Torah, Genesis.39.72","9 But Onan knew that the seed would not be his,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.73","so it was, whenever he came in to his brother’s wife, he let it go to ruin on the ground,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.74",so as not to provide seed for his brother.
"Torah, Genesis.39.75","10 What he did was ill in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.76",and he caused him to die as well.
"Torah, Genesis.39.77",11 Now Yehuda said to Tamar his daughter-in-law:
"Torah, Genesis.39.78",Sit as a widow in your father’s house
"Torah, Genesis.39.79",until Shela my son has grown up.
"Torah, Genesis.39.80",For he said to himself:
"Torah, Genesis.39.81","Otherwise he will die as well, like his brothers!"
"Torah, Genesis.39.82",So Tamar went and stayed in her father’s house.
"Torah, Genesis.39.83",12 And many days passed.
"Torah, Genesis.39.84","Shua’s daughter, Yehuda’s wife, died."
"Torah, Genesis.39.85","When Yehuda had been comforted,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.86","he went up to his sheep-shearers, he and his friend Hira the Adullamite, to Timna."
"Torah, Genesis.39.87","13 Tamar was told, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.39.88","Here, your father-in-law is going up to Timna to shear his sheep."
"Torah, Genesis.39.89","14 She removed her widow’s garments from her,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.90","covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.91","and sat down by the entrance to Enayim/Two-Wells, which is on the way to Timna,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.92","for she saw that Shela had grown up, yet she had not been given to him as a wife."
"Torah, Genesis.39.93","15 When Yehuda saw her, he took her for a whore, for she had covered her face."
"Torah, Genesis.39.94",16 So he turned aside to her by the road and said:
"Torah, Genesis.39.95","Come-now, pray let me come in to you—"
"Torah, Genesis.39.96",for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.
"Torah, Genesis.39.97",She said:
"Torah, Genesis.39.98",What will you give me for coming in to me?
"Torah, Genesis.39.99",17 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.39.100",I myself will send out a goat kid from the flock.
"Torah, Genesis.39.101",She said:
"Torah, Genesis.39.102","Only if you give me a pledge, until you send it."
"Torah, Genesis.39.103",18 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.39.104",What is the pledge that I am to give you?
"Torah, Genesis.39.105",She said:
"Torah, Genesis.39.106","Your seal, your cord, and your staff that is in your hand."
"Torah, Genesis.39.107",He gave them to her and then he came in to her—and she became pregnant by him.
"Torah, Genesis.39.108","19 She arose and went away,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.109",then she put off her veil from her and clothed herself in her widow’s garments.
"Torah, Genesis.39.110","20 Now when Yehuda sent the goat kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to fetch the pledge from the woman’s hand,"
"Torah, Genesis.39.111",he could not find her.

"Torah, Genesis.39.127","10 <b>What he did was ill:</b> Onan dies because he does not fulfill his legal obligation to continue his brother’s line. The later interpretation, that his crime was masturbation (“onanism”), has no basis in this text."

"Torah, Genesis.40.1","<i>Yosef: Rise and Fall</i> (39): This chapter prefigures Yosef’s eventual rise to power and simultaneously chronicles his lowest point, literally and figuratively. The two strands of the plot are woven together into a pattern of success/authority → imprisonment → success/authority. This also mirrors the larger story, which progresses from favorite son → slavery → viceroy of Egypt. The integration takes place partly through the medium of a key word, “hand”—which also occurred four times at the end of Chap. 38 and thus acts as a further textual connector. Yosef’s success is tied six times to the phrase “in his hands” (vv.3, 4, 6, 8, 22, 23); he is thrown into prison because of the garments that he left in his mistress’s “hands” (vv.12, 13). Similarly, the movement of the chapter is mirrored in the word “eyes,” which is linked first to the theme of authority (v.4), then to the attempted seduction (v.7), and finally to authority again (v.21) (Alter)."
"Torah, Genesis.40.2","The chapter also repeats the phrase “And it was” (in one form or another) some twelve times, as a distinct stylistic pattern."
"Torah, Genesis.40.3","Yosef’s temporary downfall occurs here for reasons beyond literary balance or suspense. It is in a very real sense the punishment for the bratty behavior of his adolescence. Once again words (this time not his own) get him into trouble (vv.17, 19), as they did in 37:8. And once again a garment is displayed as proof of a fabricated crime."

"Torah, Genesis.40.55",that his lord’s wife fixed her eyes upon Yosef
"Torah, Genesis.40.56",and said:
"Torah, Genesis.40.57",Lie with me!
"Torah, Genesis.40.58","8 But he refused,"
"Torah, Genesis.40.59",he said to his lord’s wife:
"Torah, Genesis.40.60","Look, my lord need not concern himself with anything in the house, with me here,"
"Torah, Genesis.40.61","and everything that belongs to him, he has placed in my hands."
"Torah, Genesis.40.62",9 He is no greater in this house than I
"Torah, Genesis.40.63",and has withheld nothing from me
"Torah, Genesis.40.64","except for yourself,"
"Torah, Genesis.40.65",since you are his wife.
"Torah, Genesis.40.66",So how could I do this great ill?
"Torah, Genesis.40.67",I would be sinning against God!
"Torah, Genesis.40.68","10 Now it was, as she would speak to Yosef day after day, that he would not hearken to her, to lie beside her, to be with her—"
"Torah, Genesis.40.69","11 so it was, on such a day,"
"Torah, Genesis.40.70","when he came into the house to do his work,"
"Torah, Genesis.40.71",and none of the house-people was there in the house—
"Torah, Genesis.40.72","12 that she grabbed him by his garment, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.40.73",Lie with me!
"Torah, Genesis.40.74","But he left his garment in her hand and fled, escaping outside."
"Torah, Genesis.40.75","13 Now it was, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,"
"Torah, Genesis.40.76",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.40.77","21 <b>prostitute:</b> Heb. <i>kedesha,</i> which in cognate languages may indicate a “holy” official, here seems to describe a woman who is similarly outside the usual constraints of family."
"Torah, Genesis.40.78","27ff. <b>Now it was … :</b> The scene here rather strikingly recalls Yaakov and Esav at birth: twins, the hand reaching out, and the struggle to be first."
"Torah, Genesis.40.79",29 <b>breach:</b> Not in the sense of a “breach birth.”
"Torah, Genesis.40.80","30 <b>Zerah:</b> Possibly connoting “red of dawn”—connecting with the scarlet thread of v.28 (and possibly paralleling Esav, who was also known as Edom, the “Red One”)."

We are thus given an indirect clue about the source of Yaakov’s doting behavior in the Yosef story."
"Torah, Genesis.40.85","9 <b>sinning:</b> Or “at fault.” <b>against God:</b> From this point on, it is clear that Yosef is no longer the spoiled brat of Chap. 37. At key points in his life he consistently makes mention of God as the source of his success and good fortune (40:8; 41:16; 45:5, 7, 9)."
"Torah, Genesis.40.86","10 <b>to lie beside her, to be with her:</b> A curious expression. Why does not the text say, as in v.7, “to he with her”? There is an additional irony: “to be with” usually refers to God (see v.2, for example)."
"Torah, Genesis.41.1","<i>The Rise to Power: Dreams</i> (40:1–41:52): Continued are the themes of Yosef’s success in adversity and skill in interpreting dreams (yet his father and brother, and not he, had done the interpreting in Chap. 37!). In Chap. 37 dreams had brought about his downfall; here (Chap. 40) they will help the cupbearer and in Chap. 41 ultimately save a country, his family, and himself. Yosef’s self-assurance and reliance on God, already evident in 39:9, here mean that it will not be long before he stands at the pinnacle."
"Torah, Genesis.41.2","Yosef’s dramatic rise to power is an old and favorite motif in folklore. The text colorfully presents Pharaoh’s dreams, in great detail, especially in his emotional retelling. All the more striking then is Yosef’s simple interpretation (41:23–27)."
"Torah, Genesis.41.3","14 that she called in her house-people and said to them, saying:"

"Torah, Genesis.41.7","but I called out with a loud voice,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.8","15 and it was, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and called out"
"Torah, Genesis.41.9","that he left his garment beside me and fled, escaping outside!"
"Torah, Genesis.41.10","16 And she kept his garment beside her, until his lord came back to the house."
"Torah, Genesis.41.11","17 Then she spoke to him according to these words, saying:"

"Torah, Genesis.41.13","18 but it was, when I lifted up my voice and called out,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.14",that he left his garment beside me and fled outside.

"Torah, Genesis.41.17",that his anger flared up;
"Torah, Genesis.41.18","20 Yosef’s lord took him and put him in the dungeon house,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.19",in the place where the king’s prisoners are imprisoned.
"Torah, Genesis.41.20","But while he was there in the dungeon house,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.21",21 Y<small>HWH</small> was with Yosef and extended kindness to him:
"Torah, Genesis.41.22",he put his favor in the eyes of the dungeon warden.
"Torah, Genesis.41.23",22 And the dungeon warden put in Yosef’s hands all the prisoners that were in the dungeon house;

"Torah, Genesis.41.29",40:1 Now after these events it was
"Torah, Genesis.41.30","that the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt fell afoul of their lord, the king of Egypt."
"Torah, Genesis.41.31","2 Pharaoh became infuriated with his two officials, with the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.32","3 and he placed them in custody in the house of the chief of the guard, in the dungeon house, the place where Yosef was imprisoned."
"Torah, Genesis.41.33","4 The chief of the guard appointed Yosef for them, that he should wait upon them."
"Torah, Genesis.41.34",They were in custody for many days.
"Torah, Genesis.41.35","5 And then the two of them dreamt a dream, each man his own dream, in a single night,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.36","each man according to his dream’s interpretation,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.37","the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were imprisoned in the dungeon house."
"Torah, Genesis.41.38","6 When Yosef came to them in the morning and saw them, here, they were dejected!"
"Torah, Genesis.41.39","7 So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were with him in custody in the house of his lord, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.41.40",Why are your faces in such ill-humor today?
"Torah, Genesis.41.41",8 They said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.41.42","We have dreamt a dream, and there is no interpreter for it!"
"Torah, Genesis.41.43",Yosef said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.41.44",Are not interpretations from God?
"Torah, Genesis.41.45",Pray recount them to me!
"Torah, Genesis.41.46","9 The chief cupbearer recounted his dream to Yosef, he said to him:"
"Torah, Genesis.41.47",In my dream—
"Torah, Genesis.41.48","here, a vine was in front of me,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.49","10 and on the vine, three winding-tendrils,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.50","and just as it was budding, the blossom came up,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.51",(and) its clusters ripened into grapes.
"Torah, Genesis.41.52",11 Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand—
"Torah, Genesis.41.53",I picked the grapes
"Torah, Genesis.41.54",and squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup
"Torah, Genesis.41.55",and put the cup in Pharaoh’s palm.
"Torah, Genesis.41.56",12 Yosef said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.41.57",This is its interpretation:
"Torah, Genesis.41.58",The three windings are three days—
"Torah, Genesis.41.59",13 in another three days
"Torah, Genesis.41.60","Pharaoh will lift up your head,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.61",he will restore you to your position
"Torah, Genesis.41.62","so that you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand (once more),"
"Torah, Genesis.41.63","according to the former practice, when you were his cupbearer."
"Torah, Genesis.41.64","14 But keep me in mind with you, when it goes well for you,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.65","pray deal kindly with me and call me to mind to Pharaoh,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.66",so that you have me brought out of this house.
"Torah, Genesis.41.67","15 For I was stolen, yes, stolen from the land of the Hebrews,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.68",and here too I have done nothing
"Torah, Genesis.41.69",that they should have put me in the pit.
"Torah, Genesis.41.70","16 When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted for good,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.71",he said to Yosef:
"Torah, Genesis.41.72","I too, in my dream—"
"Torah, Genesis.41.73","here, three baskets of white-bread were on my head,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.74","17 and in the uppermost basket, all sorts of edibles for Pharaoh, baker’s work,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.75","and birds were eating them from the basket, from off my head."
"Torah, Genesis.41.76","18 Yosef gave answer, he said:"
"Torah, Genesis.41.77",This is its interpretation:
"Torah, Genesis.41.78",The three baskets are three days—
"Torah, Genesis.41.79",19 in another three days
"Torah, Genesis.41.80",Pharaoh will lift up your head
"Torah, Genesis.41.81","from off you,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.82","he will hang you on a tree,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.83",and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.
"Torah, Genesis.41.84","20 And thus it was, on the third day,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.85","Pharaoh’s birthday,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.86","that he made a great drinking-feast for all his servants,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.87",and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker amidst his servants:
"Torah, Genesis.41.88","21 he restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearership,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.89","so that he put the cup in Pharaoh’s palm (once more),"
"Torah, Genesis.41.90","22 but the chief baker he hanged,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.91",just as Yosef had interpreted to them.
"Torah, Genesis.41.92","23 But the chief cupbearer did not keep Yosef in mind,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.93",he forgot him.
"Torah, Genesis.41.94",41:1 Now at the end of two years’-time it was
"Torah, Genesis.41.95",that Pharaoh dreamt:
"Torah, Genesis.41.96","here, he was standing by the Nile-Stream,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.97","2 and here, out of the Nile, seven cows were coming up,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.98","fair to look at and fat of flesh,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.99",and they grazed in the reed-grass.
"Torah, Genesis.41.100","3 And here, seven other cows were coming up after them out of the Nile,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.101","ill to look at and lean of flesh,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.102",and they stood beside the other cows on the bank of the Nile.
"Torah, Genesis.41.103",4 Then the cows ill to look at and lean of flesh ate up
"Torah, Genesis.41.104","the seven cows fair to look at, the fat-ones."
"Torah, Genesis.41.105",Pharaoh awoke.
"Torah, Genesis.41.106",5 He fell asleep and dreamt a second time:
"Torah, Genesis.41.107","here, seven ears-of-grain were going up on a single stalk, fat and good,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.108","6 and here, seven ears, lean and scorched by the east wind, were springing up after them."
"Torah, Genesis.41.109",7 Then the lean ears swallowed up
"Torah, Genesis.41.110",the seven ears fat and full.
"Torah, Genesis.41.111","Pharaoh awoke,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.112",and here: (it was) a dream!
"Torah, Genesis.41.113","8 But in the morning it was, that his spirit was agitated,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.114",so he sent and had all of Egypt’s magicians and all of its wisemen called.
"Torah, Genesis.41.115","Pharaoh recounted his dream to them,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.116",but no one could interpret them to Pharaoh.
"Torah, Genesis.41.117","9 Then the chief cupbearer spoke up to Pharaoh, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.41.118",I must call my faults to mind today!
"Torah, Genesis.41.119",10 Pharaoh was once infuriated with his servants
"Torah, Genesis.41.120","and placed me in custody, in the house of the chief of the guard,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.121",myself and the chief baker.
"Torah, Genesis.41.122","11 And we dreamt a dream in a single night, I and he,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.123",we dreamt each-man according to the interpretation of his dream.
"Torah, Genesis.41.124","12 Now there was a Hebrew lad there with us, a servant of the chief of the guard;"
"Torah, Genesis.41.125","we recounted them to him, and he interpreted our dreams to us,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.126",for each-man according to his dream he interpreted.
"Torah, Genesis.41.127","13 And thus it was: As he interpreted to us, so it was—"
"Torah, Genesis.41.128","I was restored to my position, and he was hanged."
"Torah, Genesis.41.129",14 Pharaoh sent and had Yosef called.
"Torah, Genesis.41.130",They hurriedly brought him out of the pit;
"Torah, Genesis.41.131","he shaved, changed his clothes, and came before Pharaoh."
"Torah, Genesis.41.132",15 Pharaoh said to Yosef:
"Torah, Genesis.41.133","I have dreamt a dream, and there is no interpreter for it!"
"Torah, Genesis.41.134",But I have heard it said of you
"Torah, Genesis.41.135",that you but need to hear a dream in order to interpret it!
"Torah, Genesis.41.136","16 Yosef answered Pharaoh, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.41.137",Not I!
"Torah, Genesis.41.138",God will answer what is for Pharaoh’s welfare.
"Torah, Genesis.41.139",17 Pharaoh spoke to Yosef:
"Torah, Genesis.41.140",In my dream—
"Torah, Genesis.41.141","here, I was standing on the bank of the Nile,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.142","18 and here, out of the Nile were coming up seven cows,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.143","fat of flesh and fair of form,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.144",and they grazed in the reed-grass.
"Torah, Genesis.41.145","19 And here, seven other cows were coming up after them,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.146","wretched and exceedingly ill of form and lank of flesh,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.147",in all the land of Egypt I have never seen their like for ill-condition!
"Torah, Genesis.41.148",20 Then the seven lank and ill-looking cows ate up
"Torah, Genesis.41.149","the first seven cows, the fat-ones."
"Torah, Genesis.41.150","21 They entered their body, but you would not know that they had entered their body, for they were as ill-looking as at the beginning!"
"Torah, Genesis.41.151",Then I awoke.
"Torah, Genesis.41.152",22 And I saw (again) in my dream:
"Torah, Genesis.41.153","here, seven ears were going up on a single stalk, full and good,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.154","23 and here, seven ears, hardened, lean, and scorched by the east wind, were springing up after them."
"Torah, Genesis.41.155",24 Then the lean ears swallowed up
"Torah, Genesis.41.156",the seven good ears!
"Torah, Genesis.41.157","Now I have spoken with the magicians, but there is no one that can tell me the answer!"
"Torah, Genesis.41.158",25 Yosef said to Pharaoh:
"Torah, Genesis.41.159",Pharaoh’s dream is one.
"Torah, Genesis.41.160","What God is about to do, he has told Pharaoh."
"Torah, Genesis.41.161",26 The seven good cows
"Torah, Genesis.41.162","are seven years,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.163",the seven good ears
"Torah, Genesis.41.164","are seven years,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.165",the dream is one.
"Torah, Genesis.41.166",27 And the seven lank and ill-looking cows that were coming up after them
"Torah, Genesis.41.167","are seven years,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.168","and the seven ears, hollow and scorched by the east wind,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.169",will be seven years of famine!
"Torah, Genesis.41.170",28 That is the word that I spoke to Pharaoh:
"Torah, Genesis.41.171","what God is about to do, he has let Pharaoh see."
"Torah, Genesis.41.172","29 Here,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.173",seven years are coming
"Torah, Genesis.41.174",of great abundance in all the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Genesis.41.175","30 But seven years of famine will arise after them,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.176",when all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten.
"Torah, Genesis.41.177","The famine will destroy the land,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.178",31 and you will not know of that abundance in the land
"Torah, Genesis.41.179","because of that famine afterward,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.180",for it will be exceedingly heavy.
"Torah, Genesis.41.181","32 Now as for the twofold repetition of the dream to Pharaoh: it means that the matter is determined by God,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.182",and God is hastening to do it.
"Torah, Genesis.41.183","33 So now, let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.184",and set him over the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Genesis.41.185","34 Let Pharaoh do this: let him appoint appointed-overseers for the land,"
"Torah, Genesis.41.186",dividing the land of Egypt into five parts during the seven years of abundance.

"Torah, Genesis.42.1","<i>Famine: The Brothers Come</i> (41:53–42:38): Worldwide famine creates the backdrop for the family drama that is about to unfold. The ancients understood famine as sent by the gods, often as punishment; and the events of our text suggest that God is indeed the prime mover here. We are again presented with the characters of Chap. 37, all of whom have somehow changed. Yaakov emerges as more pitiful than ever (a shadow of the wrestler at the Yabbok), Yosef as powerful governor, not only of all Egypt but of his family’s destiny as well, and the brothers, remarkably, are repentant (42:21–22). We also see Yosef’s emotional side for the first time. He weeps in 42:24, as he will do three times again (43:30; 45:2, 14–15)."

"Torah, Genesis.42.5","for the seven years of famine that will occur in the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.6",so that the land will not be cut off by the famine.

"Torah, Genesis.42.18","42 And Pharaoh removed his signet-ring from his hand and placed it on Yosef’s hand,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.19",he had him clothed in linen garments and put the gold chain upon his neck;
"Torah, Genesis.42.20","43 he had him mount the chariot of his second-in-rank, and they called out before him: <i>Avrekh!/</i> Attention!"
"Torah, Genesis.42.21",Thus he placed him over all the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Genesis.42.22",44 Pharaoh said to Yosef:
"Torah, Genesis.42.23","I am Pharaoh,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.24","but without you, no man shall raise hand or foot in all the land of Egypt!"
"Torah, Genesis.42.25",45 Pharaoh called Yosef’s name: <i>Tzafenat Pane’ah/</i> The God Speaks and He Lives.
"Torah, Genesis.42.26","He gave him Asenat, daughter of Poti Fera, priest of On, as a wife."
"Torah, Genesis.42.27",And Yosef’s (influence) went out over all the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Genesis.42.28","46 Now Yosef was thirty years old when he stood in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt."
"Torah, Genesis.42.29",Yosef went out from Pharaoh’s presence and passed through all the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Genesis.42.30",47 In the seven years of abundance the land produced in handfuls.
"Torah, Genesis.42.31","48 And he collected all kinds of provisions from those seven years that occurred in the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.32",and placed provisions in the towns.
"Torah, Genesis.42.33","The provisions from the fields of a town, surrounding it, he placed in it (as well)."
"Torah, Genesis.42.34","49 So Yosef piled up grain like the sand of the sea, exceedingly much, until they had to stop counting, for it was uncountable."
"Torah, Genesis.42.35","50 Now two sons were born to Yosef, before the year of famine came,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.36","whom Asenat, daughter of Poti Fera, priest of On, bore to him."
"Torah, Genesis.42.37","51 Yosef called the name of the firstborn: Menashe/He-Who-Makes-Forget,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.38","meaning: God has made-me-forget all my hardships, all my father’s house."
"Torah, Genesis.42.39","52 And the name of the second he called: Efrayim/Double-Fruit,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.40",meaning: God has made me bear fruit in the land of my affliction.
"Torah, Genesis.42.41","53 There came to an end the seven years of abundance that had occurred in the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.42","54 and there started to come the seven years of famine, as Yosef had said."
"Torah, Genesis.42.43","Famine occurred in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
"Torah, Genesis.42.44","55 But when all the land of Egypt felt the famine, and the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.45",Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians:
"Torah, Genesis.42.46","Go to Yosef, whatever he says to you, do!"
"Torah, Genesis.42.47",56 Now the famine was over all the surface of the earth.
"Torah, Genesis.42.48","Yosef opened up all (storehouses) in which there was (grain), and gave-out-rations to the Egyptians,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.49",since the famine was becoming stronger in the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Genesis.42.50","57 And all lands came to Egypt to buy rations, to Yosef,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.51",for the famine was strong in all lands.
"Torah, Genesis.42.52","42:1 When Yaakov saw that there were rations in Egypt,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.53",Yaakov said to his sons:
"Torah, Genesis.42.54",Why do you keep looking at one another?
"Torah, Genesis.42.55",2 And he said:
"Torah, Genesis.42.56","Here, I have heard that there are rations in Egypt,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.57","go down there and buy us rations from there,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.58",that we may live and not die.
"Torah, Genesis.42.59","3 So Yosef’s brothers went down, ten (of them),"
"Torah, Genesis.42.60",to buy some rationed grain from Egypt.
"Torah, Genesis.42.61","4 But Binyamin, Yosef’s brother, Yaakov would not send with his brothers,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.62",for he said: Lest harm befall him!
"Torah, Genesis.42.63","5 The sons of Yisrael came to buy rations among those that came,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.64",for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
"Torah, Genesis.42.65","6 Now Yosef was the governor over the land, it was he who supplied rations to all the people of the land."
"Torah, Genesis.42.66","And Yosef’s brothers came and bowed low to him, brow to the ground."
"Torah, Genesis.42.67","7 When Yosef saw his brothers, he recognized them,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.68",but he pretended-no-recognition of them and spoke harshly with them.
"Torah, Genesis.42.69",He said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.42.70",From where do you come?
"Torah, Genesis.42.71","They said: From the land of Canaan, to buy food-rations."
"Torah, Genesis.42.72","8 Now although Yosef recognized his brothers, for their part, they did not recognize him."
"Torah, Genesis.42.73",9 And Yosef was reminded of the dreams that he had dreamt of them.
"Torah, Genesis.42.74",He said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.42.75",You are spies!
"Torah, Genesis.42.76",It is to see the nakedness of the land that you have come!
"Torah, Genesis.42.77",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.42.78","10 They said to him: No, my lord!"
"Torah, Genesis.42.79","Rather, your servants have come to buy food-rations."
"Torah, Genesis.42.80","11 We are all of us the sons of a single man,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.81","we are honest,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.82",your servants have never been spies!
"Torah, Genesis.42.83",12 But he said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.42.84",No!
"Torah, Genesis.42.85",For it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see!
"Torah, Genesis.42.86",13 They said:
"Torah, Genesis.42.87","Your servants are twelve,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.88","we are brothers,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.89",sons of a single man in the land of Canaan:
"Torah, Genesis.42.90","the youngest is with our father now,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.91",and one is no more.
"Torah, Genesis.42.92",14 Yosef said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.42.93","It is just as I spoke to you, saying: You are spies!"
"Torah, Genesis.42.94",15 Hereby shall you be tested:
"Torah, Genesis.42.95",As Pharaoh lives!
"Torah, Genesis.42.96",You shall not depart from this (place)
"Torah, Genesis.42.97",unless your youngest brother comes here!
"Torah, Genesis.42.98","16 Send one of you to fetch your brother,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.99",while (the rest of) you remain as prisoners.
"Torah, Genesis.42.100","Thus will your words be tested, whether there is truth in you or not—"
"Torah, Genesis.42.101","as Pharaoh lives, indeed, you are spies!"
"Torah, Genesis.42.102",17 He removed them into custody for three days.
"Torah, Genesis.42.103",18 Yosef said to them on the third day:
"Torah, Genesis.42.104","Do this, and stay alive,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.105",for I hold God in awe:
"Torah, Genesis.42.106","19 if you are honest,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.107","let one of your brothers be held prisoner in the house of your custody,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.108","and as for you, go, bring back rations for the famine-supply of your households."
"Torah, Genesis.42.109","20 Then bring your youngest brother back to me,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.110","so that your words will be proven truthful, and you will not die."
"Torah, Genesis.42.111",They (prepared to) do so.
"Torah, Genesis.42.112","21 But they said, each man to his brother:"
"Torah, Genesis.42.113","Truly,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.114",we are guilty:
"Torah, Genesis.42.115",concerning our brother!
"Torah, Genesis.42.116",—that we saw his heart’s distress
"Torah, Genesis.42.117","when he implored us,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.118",and we did not listen.
"Torah, Genesis.42.119",Therefore this distress has come upon us!
"Torah, Genesis.42.120","22 Re’uven answered them, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.42.121","Did I not say to you, say: Do not sin against the child!"
"Torah, Genesis.42.122","But you would not listen,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.123","so for his blood—now, (satisfaction) is demanded!"
"Torah, Genesis.42.124","23 Now they did not know that Yosef was listening, for a translator was between them."
"Torah, Genesis.42.125",24 But he turned away from them and wept.
"Torah, Genesis.42.126","When he was able to return to them, he spoke to them and had Shim’on taken away from them, imprisoning him before their eyes."
"Torah, Genesis.42.127","25 Then Yosef commanded that they fill their vessels with grain and return their silver-pieces into each man’s sack,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.128",and give them victuals for the journey.
"Torah, Genesis.42.129",They did so for them.
"Torah, Genesis.42.130",26 Then they loaded their rations onto their donkeys and went from there.
"Torah, Genesis.42.131","27 But as one opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the night-camp,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.132",he saw his silver—there it was in the mouth of his pack!
"Torah, Genesis.42.133",28 He said to his brothers:
"Torah, Genesis.42.134","My silver has been returned—yes, here in my pack!"
"Torah, Genesis.42.135","Their hearts gave way, and they trembled to one another, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.42.136",What is this that God has done to us?
"Torah, Genesis.42.137","29 They came home to Yaakov their father, in the land of Canaan,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.138","and told him all that had befallen them, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.42.139","30 The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly with us,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.140",he took us for those that spy on the land!
"Torah, Genesis.42.141","31 Now we said to him: We are honest, we have never been spies!"
"Torah, Genesis.42.142","32 We are twelve, brothers all, sons of our father:"
"Torah, Genesis.42.143","one is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan."
"Torah, Genesis.42.144","33 Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us:"
"Torah, Genesis.42.145",Hereby shall I know whether you are honest:
"Torah, Genesis.42.146","Leave one of your brothers with me,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.147","and as for the famine-supply of your households, take it and go."
"Torah, Genesis.42.148","34 But bring your youngest brother back to me,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.149","so that I may know that you are not spies, that you are honest."
"Torah, Genesis.42.150","(Then) I will give your brother back to you, and you may travel about the land."
"Torah, Genesis.42.151","35 But it was, when they emptied their sacks: there was each man’s silver pouch in his sack!"
"Torah, Genesis.42.152","They looked at their silver pouches, they and their father, and became frightened."
"Torah, Genesis.42.153",36 Yaakov their father said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.42.154",It is I that you bereave!
"Torah, Genesis.42.155","Yosef is no more,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.156","Shim’on is no more,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.157",now you would take Binyamin—
"Torah, Genesis.42.158",upon me has all this come!
"Torah, Genesis.42.159","37 Re’uven said to his father, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.42.160",My two sons you may put to death
"Torah, Genesis.42.161",if I do not bring him back to you!
"Torah, Genesis.42.162","Place him in my hands, and I myself will return him to you."
"Torah, Genesis.42.163",38 But he said:
"Torah, Genesis.42.164",My son is not to go down with you!
"Torah, Genesis.42.165","For his brother is dead,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.166",and he alone is left!
"Torah, Genesis.42.167","Should harm befall him on the journey on which you are going,"
"Torah, Genesis.42.168",you will bring down my gray hair in grief to Sheol!

"Torah, Genesis.43.1","<i>The Test</i> (43–44): Yosef’s testing of his brothers is masterful, not only because of the plan itself, but also because of the depth of emotion that the text evokes in its characterizations. It demonstrates how well the whole story has been integrated into the Yaakov material, for here as well as there long conversations are used to reveal complex passions."
"Torah, Genesis.43.2","Some have questioned the morality of Yosef’s actions, seeing that the aged Yaakov might well have died while the test was progressing, without ever finding out that Yosef had survived. But that is not the point of the story. What it <i>is</i> trying to teach (among other things) is a lesson about crime and repentance. Only by recreating something of the original situation—the brothers are again in control of the life and death of a son of Rahel—can Yosef be sure that they have changed. Once the brothers pass the test, life and covenant can then continue."
"Torah, Genesis.43.3",43:1 But the famine was heavy in the land.
"Torah, Genesis.43.4","2 And so it was, when they had finished eating the rations that they had brought from Egypt,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.5",that their father said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.43.6","Return, buy us some food-rations."
"Torah, Genesis.43.7",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.43.8","3 But Yehuda said to him, saying:"

"Torah, Genesis.43.50",he said to the steward of his house:
"Torah, Genesis.43.51","Bring the men into the house, slaughter some slaughter-animals and prepare them,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.52",for it is with me that these men shall eat at noon.

"Torah, Genesis.43.58","19 They came close to the man, to the steward of Yosef’s house, and spoke to him at the entrance to the house,"

"Torah, Genesis.43.61","We came down, came down before to buy food-rations,"

"Torah, Genesis.43.72",and gave them water so that they might wash their feet
"Torah, Genesis.43.73",and gave them fodder for their donkeys.
"Torah, Genesis.43.74","25 They prepared the gift, until Yosef came back at noon,"

"Torah, Genesis.43.83",and in homage they bowed low.
"Torah, Genesis.43.84","29 He lifted up his eyes and saw Binyamin his brother, his mother’s son,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.85",and he said:
"Torah, Genesis.43.86","Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?"
"Torah, Genesis.43.87",And he said:
"Torah, Genesis.43.88","May God show you favor, my son!"
"Torah, Genesis.43.89",30 And in haste—for his feelings were so kindled toward his brother that he had to weep—
"Torah, Genesis.43.90",Yosef entered a chamber and wept there.
"Torah, Genesis.43.91","31 Then he washed his face and came out, he restrained himself, and said:"
"Torah, Genesis.43.92",Serve bread!
"Torah, Genesis.43.93","32 They served him by himself and them by themselves and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.94",for Egyptians will not eat bread with Hebrews—for that is an abomination for Egyptians.
"Torah, Genesis.43.95",33 But they were seated in his presence:
"Torah, Genesis.43.96",the firstborn according to his rank-as-firstborn and the youngest according to his rank-as-youngest.
"Torah, Genesis.43.97",And the men stared at each other in astonishment over it.
"Torah, Genesis.43.98","34 He had courses taken to them from his presence,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.99",and Binyamin’s course was five times greater than all their courses.
"Torah, Genesis.43.100",Then they drank and became drunk with him.
"Torah, Genesis.43.101","44:1 Now he commanded the steward of his house, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.43.102","Fill the men’s packs with food, as much as they are able to carry,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.103",and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his pack.
"Torah, Genesis.43.104","2 And my goblet, the silver goblet, put in the mouth of the youngest’s pack, along with the silver for his rations."
"Torah, Genesis.43.105",He did according to Yosef’s word which he had spoken.
"Torah, Genesis.43.106","3 At the light of daybreak, the men were sent off, they and their donkeys;"
"Torah, Genesis.43.107",4 they were just outside the city—they had not yet gone far—when Yosef said to the steward of his house:
"Torah, Genesis.43.108","Up, pursue the men, and when you have caught up with them, say to them:"
"Torah, Genesis.43.109",Why have you paid back ill for good?
"Torah, Genesis.43.110",5 Is not this (goblet) the one that my lord drinks with?
"Torah, Genesis.43.111","And he also divines, yes, divines with it!"
"Torah, Genesis.43.112",You have wrought ill in what you have done!
"Torah, Genesis.43.113","6 When he caught up with them, he spoke those words to them."
"Torah, Genesis.43.114",7 They said to him:
"Torah, Genesis.43.115",Why does my lord speak such words as these?
"Torah, Genesis.43.116",Heaven forbid for your servants to do such a thing!
"Torah, Genesis.43.117","8 Here, the silver that we found in the mouth of our packs, we returned to you from the land of Canaan;"
"Torah, Genesis.43.118",so how could we steal silver or gold from the house of your lord?
"Torah, Genesis.43.119","9 He with whom it is found among your servants, he shall die,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.120",and we also will become my lord’s servants!
"Torah, Genesis.43.121",10 He said:
"Torah, Genesis.43.122","Now as well, according to your words, so be it:"
"Torah, Genesis.43.123","he with whom it is found shall become my servant, but you shall be clear."
"Torah, Genesis.43.124","11 With haste each-man let down his pack to the ground, each-man opened his pack."
"Torah, Genesis.43.125",12 and then he searched: with the eldest he started and with the youngest he finished—
"Torah, Genesis.43.126",and the goblet was found in Binyamin’s pack!
"Torah, Genesis.43.127","13 They rent their clothes,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.128","each-man loaded up his donkey, and they returned to the city."
"Torah, Genesis.43.129",14 Yehuda and his brothers came into Yosef’s house
"Torah, Genesis.43.130",—he was still there—
"Torah, Genesis.43.131",and flung themselves down before him to the ground.
"Torah, Genesis.43.132",15 Yosef said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.43.133",What kind of deed is this that you have done!
"Torah, Genesis.43.134","Do you not know that a man like me can divine, yes, divine?"
"Torah, Genesis.43.135",16 Yehuda said:
"Torah, Genesis.43.136",What can we say to my lord?
"Torah, Genesis.43.137","What can we speak, by what can we show ourselves innocent?"
"Torah, Genesis.43.138",God has found out your servants’ crime!
"Torah, Genesis.43.139","Here we are, servants to my lord, so we, so the one in whose hand the goblet was found."
"Torah, Genesis.43.140",17 But he said:
"Torah, Genesis.43.141",Heaven forbid that I should do this!
"Torah, Genesis.43.142","The man in whose hand the goblet was found—he shall become my servant,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.143",but you—go up in peace to your father!
"Torah, Genesis.43.144",18 Now Yehuda came-closer to him and said:
"Torah, Genesis.43.145","Please, my lord,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.146","pray let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.147","and do not let your anger flare up against your servant,"
"Torah, Genesis.43.148",for you are like Pharaoh!
"Torah, Genesis.43.149","19 My lord asked his servants, saying: Do you have a father or (another) brother?"

"Torah, Genesis.43.253","11 <b>Take:</b> Three times, culminating in the pathetic “And as for your brother, take him!” (v.13). <b>balsam … honey, balm and ladanum, pistachio nuts and almonds:</b> Another example of concealment in the story.

"Torah, Genesis.43.261",44:2 <b>my goblet:</b> The ensuing scene is somewhat parallel to Rahel’s theft of the <i>terafim</i> (compare v.9 with 31:32).

"Torah, Genesis.44.1","<i>Reconciliation</i> (45): In revealing his true identity at last, Yosef makes two points: first, that it was all part of God’s plan; and second, that the family must immediately prepare for migration to Egypt. Thus the personal story is intertwined with the national one, and the text therefore gives limited time and space to psychological details. The motif of God’s plan is stressed by the repetition of “God sent me” (vv.5, 7, 8), while the anticipated bounties of settling in Egypt are brought out by the threefold “good-things of Egypt” (vv.18, 20, 23) and by the repeated exhortation to “come” (vv.18, 19)."
"Torah, Genesis.44.2","31 it will be, that when he sees that the lad is no more, he will die,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.3","and your servant will have brought down the gray hair of your servant, our father, in grief to Sheol!"

"Torah, Genesis.44.8",but let the lad go up with his brothers!
"Torah, Genesis.44.9","34 For how can I go up to my father, when the lad is not with me?"
"Torah, Genesis.44.10",Then would I see the ill-fortune that would come upon my father!
"Torah, Genesis.44.11","45:1 Yosef could no longer restrain himself in the presence of all who were stationed around him,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.12",he called out:
"Torah, Genesis.44.13",Have everyone leave me!
"Torah, Genesis.44.14",So no one stood (in attendance upon) him when Yosef made himself known to his brothers.
"Torah, Genesis.44.15",2 He put forth his voice in weeping:
"Torah, Genesis.44.16","the Egyptians heard, Pharaoh’s household heard."
"Torah, Genesis.44.17",3 Then Yosef said to his brothers:
"Torah, Genesis.44.18",I am Yosef. Is my father still alive?
"Torah, Genesis.44.19","But his brothers were not able to answer him,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.20",for they were confounded in his presence.
"Torah, Genesis.44.21",4 Yosef said to his brothers:
"Torah, Genesis.44.22",Pray come close to me!
"Torah, Genesis.44.23",They came close.
"Torah, Genesis.44.24",He said:
"Torah, Genesis.44.25","I am Yosef your brother, whom you sold into Egypt."
"Torah, Genesis.44.26","5 But now, do not be pained,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.27",and do not let upset be in your eyes that you sold me here!
"Torah, Genesis.44.28",For it was to save life that God sent me on before you.
"Torah, Genesis.44.29","6 For it is two years now that the famine has been in the midst of the land,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.30",and there are still another five years in which there shall be no plowing or harvest.
"Torah, Genesis.44.31",7 So God sent me on before you
"Torah, Genesis.44.32","to make you a remnant on earth,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.33",to keep you alive as a great body-of-survivors.
"Torah, Genesis.44.34","8 So-now,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.35","it was not you that sent me here, but God!"
"Torah, Genesis.44.36",He has made me Father to Pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Genesis.44.37","9 Make haste, go up to my father and say to him:"
"Torah, Genesis.44.38","Thus says your son, Yosef:"
"Torah, Genesis.44.39",God has made me lord of all Egypt;
"Torah, Genesis.44.40","come down to me, do not remain!"
"Torah, Genesis.44.41","10 You shall stay in the region of Goshen, you shall be near me,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.42","you and your sons and the sons of your sons,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.43","your sheep, your oxen, and all that is yours."
"Torah, Genesis.44.44","11 I will sustain you there,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.45",for there are still five years of famine left
"Torah, Genesis.44.46","—lest you be as disinherited, you and your household and all that is yours."
"Torah, Genesis.44.47","12 Here, your eyes see, as well as my brother Binyamin’s eyes, that it is my mouth that speaks to you!"
"Torah, Genesis.44.48","13 So tell my father of all the weight I carry in Egypt, and of all that you have seen,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.49","and make haste, bring my father down here!"
"Torah, Genesis.44.50","14 He flung himself upon his brother Binyamin’s neck and wept,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.51",and Binyamin wept upon his neck.
"Torah, Genesis.44.52",15 Then he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them.
"Torah, Genesis.44.53",After this his brothers spoke with him.
"Torah, Genesis.44.54","16 The news was heard in Pharaoh’s household, they said:"
"Torah, Genesis.44.55",Yosef’s brothers have come!
"Torah, Genesis.44.56",It was good in Pharaoh’s eyes and in the eyes of his servants.
"Torah, Genesis.44.57",17 And Pharaoh said to Yosef:
"Torah, Genesis.44.58",Say to your brothers:
"Torah, Genesis.44.59",Do this—
"Torah, Genesis.44.60","load your animals and go,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.61",come back to the land of Canaan;
"Torah, Genesis.44.62",18 fetch your father and your households
"Torah, Genesis.44.63",and come to me!
"Torah, Genesis.44.64","I will give you the good-things of the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.65",so that you will eat of the fat of the land!
"Torah, Genesis.44.66",_____________
"Torah, Genesis.44.67","19 And you, you have been commanded:"
"Torah, Genesis.44.68",Do this—
"Torah, Genesis.44.69","take you wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.70",and carry your father down
"Torah, Genesis.44.71",and come!
"Torah, Genesis.44.72","20 Let not your eyes look-with-regret on your household-wares,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.73",for the good-things of all the land of Egypt—they are yours!
"Torah, Genesis.44.74","21 The sons of Yisrael did so,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.75",Yosef gave them wagons in accordance with Pharaoh’s orders
"Torah, Genesis.44.76",and gave them victuals for the journey.
"Torah, Genesis.44.77","22 To all of them, each man, he gave changes of clothes,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.78","but to Binyamin he gave three hundred pieces-of-silver and five changes of clothes,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.79",23 and to his father he sent in like manner:
"Torah, Genesis.44.80","ten donkeys, carrying the good-things of Egypt,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.81","and ten she-asses, carrying grain and bread,"
"Torah, Genesis.44.82","and food for his father, for the journey."
"Torah, Genesis.44.83","24 Then he sent off his brothers, and they went;"
"Torah, Genesis.44.84",he said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.44.85",Do not be agitated on the journey!
"Torah, Genesis.44.86","25 They went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to"
"Torah, Genesis.44.87","Yaakov their father,"

"Torah, Genesis.45.1","<i>Migration to Egypt</i> (45:16–47:12): Yaakov’s descent to Egypt involves three meetings: with God, with Yosef, and with Pharaoh. The first is God’s final revelation to Yaakov. God had previously forbidden Yitzhak to go to Egypt during a famine (26:1–2), but his son may now go as part of the divine plan, his people’s destiny. The blessing given to Avraham’s children (particularly to Yishmael) is repeated in 46:3, and God will be “with” Yaakov (46:4) on this journey as he has been on others."
"Torah, Genesis.45.2","The meeting between father and long-lost son is brief but powerful, returning as it does to the “face” motif (46:30). Immediately afterward Yosef gives the family advice on how to demonstrate their usefulness to the Egyptians, and one is struck by the precariousness of their situation in even this best of circumstances."
"Torah, Genesis.45.3","Yaakov’s brief audience with Pharaoh is both moving and pathetic. The Patriarch sums up his life in depressing terms, and it becomes clear that long life (he believes his own to be short), in addition to wealth and fertility, is considered a sign of divine favor."
"Torah, Genesis.45.4","The actual migration is sketched in a few brief strokes. The list of names in 46:8–27 has been constructed on patterned numbers, with a total of seventy."
"Torah, Genesis.45.5",46:1 Yisrael traveled with all that was his
"Torah, Genesis.45.6","and came to Be’er-Sheva,"
"Torah, Genesis.45.7",and he slaughtered slaughter-offerings to the God of his father Yitzhak.
"Torah, Genesis.45.8","2 And God said to Yisrael in visions of the night,"

"Torah, Genesis.45.33",all the persons were sixty-six.
"Torah, Genesis.45.34","27 Now Yosef’s sons, who had been born to him in Egypt: the persons were two."
"Torah, Genesis.45.35",(Thus) all the persons of Yaakov’s household who came to Egypt were seventy.
"Torah, Genesis.45.36","28 Now Yehuda he had sent on ahead of him, to Yosef,"

"Torah, Genesis.45.38","When they came to the region of Goshen,"
"Torah, Genesis.45.39","29 Yosef had his chariot harnessed and went up to meet Yisrael his father, to Goshen."
"Torah, Genesis.45.40",When he caught sight of him
"Torah, Genesis.45.41",he flung himself upon his neck
"Torah, Genesis.45.42",and wept upon his neck continually.
"Torah, Genesis.45.43",30 Yisrael said to Yosef:
"Torah, Genesis.45.44","Now I can die,"
"Torah, Genesis.45.45","since I have seen your face, that you are still alive!"
"Torah, Genesis.45.46",31 Yosef said to his brothers and to his father’s household:

"Torah, Genesis.46.1","<i>Yosef the Life-Giver</i> (47:13–26): The events of this section are not attested historically in Egyptian records. Perhaps they have been included here to confirm Yosef’s stature as Rescuer, not only of his family but of all Egypt as well (see note to 42:2). The description of Yosef’s power is now complete: just as the brothers were ready to “become my lord’s servants” (44:9), so now are the Egyptians (47:25)."
"Torah, Genesis.46.2","Some have seen the episode as an ironic reversal of what is to come in Exodus, with the Egyptians’ enslavement of the Israelites; if so, this interlude may have been an amusing one to ancient Israelite audiences."
"Torah, Genesis.46.3",The text uses the repetition of the phrase “to/for Pharaoh” to effectively paint the legal transaction.
"Torah, Genesis.46.4","47:1 So Yosef came and told Pharaoh, he said:"
"Torah, Genesis.46.5","My father and my brothers, their sheep and their oxen and all that is theirs, have come from the land of Canaan,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.6","and here, they are in the region of Goshen!"
"Torah, Genesis.46.7",2 Now from the circle of his brothers he had picked out five men and had set them in Pharaoh’s presence.
"Torah, Genesis.46.8",3 Pharaoh said to his brothers:
"Torah, Genesis.46.9",What is it that you do?
"Torah, Genesis.46.10",They said to Pharaoh:
"Torah, Genesis.46.11","Your servants are shepherds of flocks, so we, so our fathers."
"Torah, Genesis.46.12",4 And they said to Pharaoh:
"Torah, Genesis.46.13","It is to sojourn in the land that we have come,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.14","for there is no grazing for the flocks that are your servants’,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.15",for the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan.
"Torah, Genesis.46.16","So now,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.17",pray let your servants settle in the region of Goshen!
"Torah, Genesis.46.18","5 Pharaoh said to Yosef, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.46.19",(So) your father and your brothers have come to you:

"Torah, Genesis.46.23","And if you know that there are able men among them,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.24",make them chiefs of livestock over what is mine.
"Torah, Genesis.46.25",7 Yosef brought Yaakov his father and had him stand in Pharaoh’s presence.
"Torah, Genesis.46.26",And Yaakov gave Pharaoh a blessing-of-greeting.
"Torah, Genesis.46.27",8 Pharaoh said to Yaakov:
"Torah, Genesis.46.28",How many are the days and years of your life?
"Torah, Genesis.46.29",9 Yaakov said to Pharaoh:
"Torah, Genesis.46.30",The days and years of my sojourn are thirty and a hundred years;
"Torah, Genesis.46.31","few and ill-fated have been the days and years of my life,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.32",they have not attained the days and years of my fathers’ lives in the days of their sojourn.
"Torah, Genesis.46.33",10 Yaakov gave Pharaoh a blessing-of-farewell
"Torah, Genesis.46.34",and went out from Pharaoh’s presence.
"Torah, Genesis.46.35","11 So Yosef settled his father and his brothers,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.36","giving them holdings in the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.37","in the goodliest-part of the land, in the region of Ra’meses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
"Torah, Genesis.46.38","12 Yosef sustained his father, his brothers, and his father’s entire household with bread, in proportion to the little-ones."
"Torah, Genesis.46.39","13 But bread there was none in all the land,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.40","for the famine was exceedingly heavy,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.41",and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted by the famine.
"Torah, Genesis.46.42","14 Yosef had collected all the silver that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, from the rations that they had bought,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.43",and Yosef had brought the silver into Pharaoh’s house.
"Torah, Genesis.46.44","15 When the silver in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan had run out,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.45","all the Egyptians came to Yosef, saying:"
"Torah, Genesis.46.46","Come-now, (let us have) bread!"
"Torah, Genesis.46.47","Why should we die in front of you, because the silver is gone?"
"Torah, Genesis.46.48",16 Yosef said:
"Torah, Genesis.46.49","Come-now, (let me have) your livestock, and I will give you (bread) for your livestock, since the silver is gone."
"Torah, Genesis.46.50","17 So they brought their livestock to Yosef, and Yosef gave them bread (in exchange) for the horses, the sheep-livestock, the oxen-livestock, and the donkeys;"
"Torah, Genesis.46.51",he got-them-through with bread (in exchange) for all their livestock in that year.
"Torah, Genesis.46.52","18 But when that year had run out, they came back to him in the second year and said to him:"
"Torah, Genesis.46.53",We cannot hide from my lord
"Torah, Genesis.46.54","that if the silver has run out and the animal-stocks are my lord’s,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.55",nothing remains for my lord except for our bodies and our soil!
"Torah, Genesis.46.56","19 Why should we die before your eyes, so we, so our soil?"
"Torah, Genesis.46.57","Acquire us and our soil for bread,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.58",and we and our soil will become servants to Pharaoh.
"Torah, Genesis.46.59",Give (us) seed-for-sowing
"Torah, Genesis.46.60","that we may live and not die,"
"Torah, Genesis.46.61",that the soil may not become desolate!
"Torah, Genesis.46.62",20 So Yosef acquired all the soil of Egypt for Pharaoh
"Torah, Genesis.46.63","—for each of the Egyptians sold his field, for the famine was strong upon them—"
"Torah, Genesis.46.64",and the land went over to Pharaoh.
"Torah, Genesis.46.65","21 As for the people, he transferred them into the cities, from one edge of Egypt’s border to its other edge."

"Torah, Genesis.48.1","<i>Yaakov’s Testament and Death</i> (49): In this ancient piece of poetry, Yaakov addresses his sons, not as they are, but as they will be. There is little resemblance, for instance, between the Binyamin as the beloved and protected youngest son of the Yosef story and the preying wolf of v.27, but the Benjaminites were later to be known for their military skills. Scholars have therefore seen the entire poem as a retrojection of Israel as it came to be on the days of the Patriarchs."
"Torah, Genesis.48.2","As in the fuller Yosef narrative, the first three sons are quickly disqualified from active leadership, paving the way for the rise of Yehuda (the tribe from which sprang David and the royal house of Israel). Despite this, Yosef still receives the richest blessing."

"Torah, Genesis.49.2","Interestingly, the <i>Iliad</i> also ends with an elaborate burial scene. The contrast is instructive: the Homeric epic celebrates the deeds and mourns the lost youth of a hero (Hector); Genesis reflects Yosef’s standing at court and the desire to bury Yaakov in the land of Canaan, in the family plot. Note too that Genesis has two more scenes, tending to lessen the impact of this impressive funeral sequence."
"Torah, Genesis.50.1","<i>The End of the Matter</i> (50:15–26): Drawing out the tension inherent in the Patriarchs’ family relationships to the very end, the text repeats an earlier situation in Yaakov’s life—his brother’s feelings of “grudge” and threats to kill him—in the guise of his sons’ fears toward Yosef. Here, however, there can be no question of personal vengeance, since Yosef sees the brothers’ betrayal of him as but part of a larger purpose. In his words of v.20, “God planned-it-over for good … to keep many people alive,” the text resolves two of the great hanging issues that have persisted throughout Genesis: sibling hatred and the threat to generational continuity."
"Torah, Genesis.50.2","Left hanging, of course, is the issue of the promised land, since the narrative concludes “in Egypt,” but these final chapters lead to the assurance that God will “take account” (vv.24–25) of the Sons of Israel, as they are soon to be termed."

"Torah, Genesis.50.38","11 When the settled-folk of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at Threshing-Floor of Atad,"

"Torah, Genesis.50.46","—Avraham had acquired that field as a burial holding from Efron the Hittite, (the field) facing Mamre."

"Torah, Genesis.50.48","he and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father,"
"Torah, Genesis.50.49",after he had buried his father.
"Torah, Genesis.50.50","15 When Yosef’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said:"
"Torah, Genesis.50.51",What if Yosef holds a grudge against us
"Torah, Genesis.50.52","and repays, yes, repays us for all the ill that we caused him!"
"Torah, Genesis.50.53","16 So they charged Yosef, saying:"

"Torah, Genesis.50.57","Now, pray forgive the offense of the servants of your father’s God!"
"Torah, Genesis.50.58",Yosef wept as they spoke to him.
"Torah, Genesis.50.59","18 And his brothers themselves came, they flung themselves down before him and said:"
"Torah, Genesis.50.60","Here we are, servants to you!"
"Torah, Genesis.50.61",19 But Yosef said to them:
"Torah, Genesis.50.62",Do not be afraid! For am I in place of God?
"Torah, Genesis.50.63","20 Now you, you planned ill against me,"
"Torah, Genesis.50.64","(but) God planned-it-over for good,"
"Torah, Genesis.50.65",in order to do (as is) this very day—

"Torah, Genesis.50.68",I myself will sustain you and your little-ones!
"Torah, Genesis.50.69",And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts.
"Torah, Genesis.50.70","22 So Yosef stayed in Egypt, he and his father’s household."
"Torah, Genesis.50.71",Yosef lived a hundred and ten years;
"Torah, Genesis.50.72","23 Yosef saw from Efrayim sons of the third generation,"
"Torah, Genesis.50.73",and also the sons of Makhir son of Menashe were born on Yosef’s knees.
"Torah, Genesis.50.74",24 Yosef said to his brothers:

"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.0","(1-50)"
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.1","T<small>HE TEXT OF</small> G<small>ENESIS SEEMS TO SPEAK WITH MANY VOICES</small>. F<small>OR A BOOK WHOSE BASIC</small> arrangement is chronological, tracing the history of a single family, it exhibits a good deal of discontinuity on the surface. Here time flows uniformly, there it takes startling jumps; fragments are followed by more or less full-blown tales; genres alternate, from mythic to genealogical to folkloristic. In addition, scholars often portray Genesis as a collection of historically diverse materials that were compiled by scribes for whom deviating from received tradition was anathema. Hence the repetitions, the inconsistencies, and the irregular pacing."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.2","Is Genesis then, at best, a collection of stories related to the origins of Israel, with most of its seams still showing? Such an assessment does not do justice to what must have been a complex process of addition and growth or to the final product. An overview of the book does produce a certain scheme; at some point in the text’s history a coherent picture must have begun to emerge from the disparate materials handed down. For the modern reader, utilizing the Buber-Rosenzweig method of focusing on repeating words and key themes as the text presents them may make it possible to generalize about the organization of the book and also to speculate on its overall intent in the form in which it has come down to us."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.3","On its most obvious level Genesis is a book about origins. It seeks to link the origin of the people of Israel with that of the world, relating in the process how various human characteristics and institutions arose."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.4","On the surface this parallels much of ancient literature and folklore. All peoples are interested in their own beginnings, picturing them in a way which validates their present existence. Genesis, however, is different in that, like the rest of the Torah, it downplays the heroic element of the people’s origins and in its place stresses God’s role in them. Moreover the one great omission—the origin of God—establishes from the beginning a unique basis for a tribal chronicle. From Genesis and subsequent books we learn primarily about God’s relationship to the people and what he expects of them; almost everything else is subordinated to this purpose."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.5",Preliminarily one can speak of at least seven major themes whose recurrence establishes their importance in the book:
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.6","1. <i>Origins:</i> Of the world, of humanity, and of the people of Israel.<br>2. <i>Order/Meaning in History:</i> By means of stylized or patterned chronology—reliance on certain round numbers such as 3, 7, and 40—it is suggested that human events are not random but somehow planned.<br>3. <i>Blessing:</i> From creation onward God bestows blessings on his creatures in general and on the fathers and mothers of Israel in particular.<br>4. <i>Covenant:</i> God concludes agreements with human beings.<br>5. <i>God Punishes Evildoing:</i> God is provoked to anger not by his capriciousness but by human failure to uphold justice and morality.<br>6. <i>Sibling Conflict, with the Younger Usually Emerging the Victor:</i> The order of nature (primacy of the firstborn) is overturned, demonstrating that God, not nature, is the ruling principle in human affairs.<br>7. <i>Testing:</i> God tests those who are to carry forth his mission; the result is the development of moral character."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.7","Superseding these important themes, which occur throughout the Bible in various forms, is the dominant one of <i>continuity</i>, represented by the unifying word in Genesis <i>toledot</i> (“begettings”). The word appears eleven times, often accompanied by long genealogical lists. The names may deflect attention from what is central to Genesis. The major thrust of the book would seem to be toward human fecundity, following the early divine command to “bear fruit and be many” (1:28), and pointing toward the eventual fecundity of the people of Israel (which will only be realized in the book of Exodus). Such an emphasis seems appropriate in a book about origins."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.8","Ironically, however, the undercurrent in Genesis points not to life and its continuation, but rather to its threatened extinction. In story after story the protagonist, his people, and occasionally the entire world are threatened. In at least one case (Avraham) a perfectly legal and natural solution is found—the birth of Yishmael as his heir—only to be rejected by God in favor of a more difficult one: a son born to an elderly woman."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.9","It is clear that the stress on continuity and discontinuity has one purpose: to make clear that God is in control of history. Human fertility and continuity in history come not from magical rites or from the arbitrary decisions of the gods, but from a God who bases his rule on justice. Nature disappears as a ruling factor in human affairs, replaced by a principle of morality which is unshakable precisely because it comes from a God who is beyond the rules of nature."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.10","But the result is a book which abounds in tension. From the beginnings of human history (Chap. 4) we encounter contradictions and opposites, whether on a small scale (fertility and barrenness) or a large one (promise and delayed fulfillment). Nowhere is this so clear as in the dramatic high point of the book, Chap. 22. As Avraham stands with knife upraised, the entire enterprise of Genesis hangs in the balance. But the entire book is replete with such tensions and continuity-threatening situations. There are barren wives, brothers vowing to kill brothers, cities and even a world being destroyed by an angry God. The main characters of Genesis thus emerge as survivors, above all else. Noah sets the pattern, but he is merely the first, and too passive an example. The Patriarchs must brave hostile foreigners, bitter intrafamily struggles, and long wanderings before they can find peace."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.11","While by the end of the book many of the tensions have been resolved, one conspicuously has not: God’s promise of the land of Canaan. As the book ends, “in Egypt,” we are left to ponder how this God, who keeps his promises to “those who love him” (Ex. 20:6), will bring the people back to their land—a land inhabited by someone else and in which the Children of Israel own only a burial site. Yet despite the tension, we may assume from the experiences of the Patriarchs that God will indeed “take account of” the Israelites (50:24), that he will take whatever ill has been planned against them and “plan-it-over for good” (50:20)."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.12","A word should also be said here about hero traditions. In the great epics of the ancient world the hero often stands as a lonely figure. He must overcome obstacles, fight monsters, acquire helpers (whether women, “sidekicks,” or magic objects); and his triumph in the end signals man’s triumph over his archenemy, Death. Every battle won, every obstacle hurdled, is psychologically a victory for us, the audience, a cathartic release from our own frustrating battle against death."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.13","The Bible sees things rather differently. Death is also overcome, but not only by the individual’s struggle. It is rather through the covenant community, bound together by God’s laws and his promises, that the heroic vision is lived out. Despite the triumphs of the characters in Genesis, it is really in the book of Exodus that the great battle scenes (the plagues in Egypt, the Red Sea) and meetings with the divine (Mount Sinai) take place. And it is therefore God himself who is most properly the “hero” of these stories. No major character in Genesis achieves success without depending fully on God, and the standards that are held up to them are ultimately seen as God’s own, to be imitated by imperfect humankind."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.14","The book of Genesis falls naturally into four large sections. The first, usually termed the “Primeval History” (Chaps, 11–11), begins with creation and progresses through the early generations of humanity, ending in Mesopotamia. The second (Chaps. 12 through 25:18) is the cycle of stories concerning Avraham, the father of the people of Israel. Part III (Gen. 25:19 through Chap. 36) deals in the main with stories about his grandson Yaakov. The final section (Chaps. 37–50) is the tale of Yosef and of how the Children of Israel came to live in Egypt (thus paving the way for the book of Exodus)."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.15","The following skeletal outline will lay out some of the interesting structural features of the book. There is an elemental symmetry that emerges from the four sections; further comments, especially about how the sections cohere, will be found in the explanatory material accompanying the text in this volume."

"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.44","There is of course great variety within this bare structure; each version of a motif has its own special characteristics and emphases. Yet the patterning observed above gives the book a general coherence, above and beyond differences. It also demonstrates a conscious hand at work, one concerned about the texture of the book as a whole and able, despite the possible rigidity of what had been handed down, to shape the received material into a plastic and breathing unity."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.45","Two general observations about Genesis will round out the picture here. First, as the book progresses there is a tendency for the style of the literature to become smoother. The abrupt changes and sometimes fragmentary nature of the material in Part I, and the vignettes built around Avraham’s life in Part II, give way to a greater coherence and concentration in Part III, and finally to a relatively flowing and psychologically complete narrative in Part IV Along with this, the characters in the latter half of the book seem to be more changeable and human, in contrast to Noah and Avraham, who often appear almost perfect models of piety."
"Torah, Genesis, On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure.46","Second, contact with God becomes less and less direct as Genesis moves on. Avraham’s dreams and visions seem a far cry from Adam’s conversations with God in the garden (although see Chap. 18); Yaakov’s encounters with God are less frequent than Avraham’s; and finally, Yosef never has a conversation with God, although he receives dream interpretations from him. This process of distancing may reflect an often-observed tendency in religions to think of primeval times as a “golden age” of closeness between gods and men, as contrasted to today (whenever one is writing), when humankind finds itself tragically distant from the divine and in need of communication."
"Torah, Genesis, I: the Primeval History.1",(1-2)
"Torah, Genesis, I: the Primeval History.2",T<small>HE COLLECTION OF STORIES WHICH FORMS PART I OF</small> G<small>ENESIS HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED</small> for a number of purposes:
"Torah, Genesis, I: the Primeval History.3","1. History is traced from the creation of the world, in a direct line, down to Avraham, father of the People of Israel. Through use of the leading-word <i>toledot</i>, “begettings,” we are meant to view him as the logical end point in God’s preliminary plan in history."
"Torah, Genesis, I: the Primeval History.4","2. The nature of God, as he will appear throughout the Hebrew Bible, is firmly established. He is seen as a Creator who is beyond fate, nature, and sexuality; as an all-powerful orderer and giver of meaning to history; as a bestower of blessing to living creatures; as a giver of choice to human beings; as a just punisher of evil and, simultaneously, a merciful ruler; and as a maker of covenants. The one quality of God which does not unfold until the Patriarchal stories (Parts II-IV) is his shaping of human destiny through focusing on the People of Israel. It is portrayed as the logical outcome of the characteristics just mentioned."
"Torah, Genesis, I: the Primeval History.5","3. It appears that the Mesopotamian origins of Israel are reflected in such narratives as the Creation, the Flood, and the Tower of Babel, and are transformed or repudiated in the biblical versions. What in the older culture appears arbitrary and chaotic has been changed in the Bible into stories that stress morality and order. Further, human beings in Genesis Chapters 1–11, despite their failure to five up to God’s expectations, are nevertheless considered capable of doing so, in contrast to the Mesopotamian view that humankind was created merely to be slaves to the gods."
"Torah, Genesis, I: the Primeval History.6","4. Like virtually all other creation stories, Part I is concerned with the origin of the world and its institutions. Chapter 1 expounds on the origins of earth, sky, vegetation, animals, and human beings (as well as the Sabbath); Chapter 2, of sexuality, death, pain in childbirth, and work; Chapter 4, of sin, hatred, and murder, as well as of cities and crafts; Chapter 6, of giants; and Chapter 10, of nations (including the low status of the Canaanites) and languages."
"Torah, Genesis, I: the Primeval History.7","In sum, Part I serves as a fitting Prologue, not only to Genesis but to the entire Bible. The reader’s chief task in interpreting it is to be able to determine the reason for the inclusion of any one section into the whole."
"Torah, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives.0","(12-50)"
"Torah, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives.1","T<small>HE STORIES ABOUT THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF</small> I<small>SRAEL, AS A COLLECTION, ARE</small> almost contrapuntal in their richness. Life experiences are repeated and common themes recur; yet at the same time there is a remarkable variety of personalities."
"Torah, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives.2","Two prominent themes throughout are God’s promises (of land and descendants) and his blessing. The texts revolve around the question of whether and how God will fulfill his promises, and how people will effect the transfer of the blessing. Each generation portrayed in the narratives must deal with the inherent tensions raised by these questions, since their resolution does not occur easily."
"Torah, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives.3","The stories are also marked by each figure’s struggle to develop a concept of the religious life, of “walking in accord with God.” Each one carves out his own distinct path, to arrive at a mature understanding of what it means to be a father of the people of Israel. In order to bring about such an understanding, God apparently “tests” them in both obvious and more oblique ways, often against a backdrop of bitter sibling rivalry. One also observes a physical unsettledness about the Patriarchs’ quest; only Yitzhak is spared the wanderings that occur so regularly in the stories."
"Torah, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives.4","Rather interestingly, although the texts purport to be about “fathers,” it is God himself who most consistently fits that role for the characters. God acts <i>in loco parentis</i> for each of the Patriarchs, always, significantly, after the loss of the human father. He first appears to Avraham after the death of Terah; to Yitzhak after that of Avraham; to Yaakov after he leaves home (and a seemingly dying father); and he helps Yosef directly, after he has left his father’s home."
"Torah, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives.5","Numbers play an important role in the Patriarchal stories, as they did in Part I. It has been pointed out (see Sarna 1966) that the life spans of the Patriarchs fit into a highly ordered pattern. Avraham lives for 175 years, equaling 7 × 5<sup>2</sup>; Yitzhak, for 180 years, equaling 5 × 6<sup>2</sup>; and Yaakov, for 147 years, or 3 × 7<sup>2</sup>. This is unmistakably a purposeful scheme, meant to convey that human history is orderly and meaningful. Similarly an examination of the stories reveals that Avraham lives for 75 years in the lifetime of his father and 75 years in the lifetime of his son, while Yaakov spends 20 years away from his father, with Yosef roughly following suit in the next generation."
"Torah, Genesis, The Patriarchal Narratives.6","Last, it should be noted that the Patriarchal stories in various details anticipate the later Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. The specific references will be mentioned in the Notes."
"Torah, Genesis, Ii: Avraham.1",<b>(12–25:18)</b>
"Torah, Genesis, Ii: Avraham.2","A<small>LTHOUGH</small> A<small>VRAHAM IS THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER OF</small> I<small>SRAEL, THE DIVERSE TRADITIONS</small> about him which have been collected and connected to form a cycle of stories give evidence of much more. The cycle portrays an active <i>Homo religiosis</i> who converses with God, sometimes with an air of doubt and questioning, who proclaims God’s name at various sacred sites, who is concerned about justice and the treatment of the oppressed, and who makes dramatic life decisions without flinching. The stories thus reveal struggle, despite the fact that Avraham often appears to be the “perfect” man, always obeying God’s bidding and prospering."
"Torah, Genesis, Ii: Avraham.3","Buber (1982), noting the unifying effect of the verb “see” throughout the cycle, understood Avraham as the father of the Prophets of Israel (formerly called “seers”). He also viewed the cycle as based around the series of tests that Avraham must undergo, tests quite different, we might add, from the labors of Hercules and other such ancient challenges."
"Torah, Genesis, Ii: Avraham.4","Other than “see,” a number of leading-words launch the major concerns of the Patriarchs: “bless,” “seed,” and “land.” At the same time the cycle contains previously encountered motifs, albeit with interesting refinements: punishment for sin (this time, with human questioning), intimacy with God (here through visions), and sibling rivalry (with more complex results than murder). Above all we note the singling out of one man to perform the will of God, a man very different from the rather passive Noah."
"Torah, Genesis, Ii: Avraham.5","Avraham stands at the core of the entire book of Genesis, as his experiences will in many ways be reflected in those who follow him. At the core of both the book and the cycle looms the disturbing Chapter 22, which brings together and resolves, for the moment, the major themes encountered so far."
"Torah, Genesis, Iii: Yaakov.1",(25:19–36:43); See also 37–50
"Torah, Genesis, Iii: Yaakov.2","B<small>EFORE COMMENTING ON THE</small> Y<small>AAKOV CYCLE, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO CONSIDER WHY HIS</small> father Yitzhak, the second of the Patriarchs, receives no true separate group of stories on his own."
"Torah, Genesis, Iii: Yaakov.3","Yitzhak functions in Genesis as a classic second generation—that is, as a transmitter and stabilizing force, rather than as an active participant in the process of building the people. There hardly exists a story about him in which he is anything but a son and heir, a husband, or a father. His main task in life seems to be to take roots in the land of Canaan, an admittedly important task in the larger context of God’s promises in Genesis. What this means, unfortunately, is that he has almost no personality of his own. By Chapter 27, a scant two chapters after his father dies, he appears as (prematurely?) old, blind in both a literal and figurative sense, and as we will see, he fades out of the text entirely, only to die several chapters, and many years, later."
"Torah, Genesis, Iii: Yaakov.4","The true dynamic figure of the second generation here is Rivka. It is she to whom God reveals his plan, and she who puts into motion the mechanism for seeing that it is properly carried out. She is ultimately the one responsible for bridging the gap between the dream, as typified by Avraham, and the hard-won reality, as realized by Yaakov."
"Torah, Genesis, Iii: Yaakov.5","Avraham is a towering figure, almost unapproachable as a model in his intimacy with God and his ability to hurdle nearly every obstacle. Adding to this the fact that Yitzhak is practically a noncharacter, and that Yosef, once his rise begins, also lacks dimension as a personality, it becomes increasingly clear that it is Yaakov who emerges as the most dynamic and most human personality in the book. The stories about him cover fully half of Genesis, and reveal a man who is both troubled and triumphant. Most interestingly, he, and not Avraham, gives his name to the people of Israel."
"Torah, Genesis, Iii: Yaakov.6","Distinctive themes of the cycle include physical struggle, deception, and confrontation. These are expressed through the key words of Yaakov’s name (“Heel-Holder” and “Heel-Sneak,” then Yisrael, “God-Fighter”), “deceive” and similar words, and “face.” Also recurring are the terms “love,” “bless,” “firstborn-right,” and “wages/hire” (one word in Hebrew). The cycle is structured partly around etiologies (folk explanations of place-names and personal names) and also around Yaakov’s use of stones in several of the stories."
"Torah, Genesis, Iii: Yaakov.7","Continuing from the Avraham cycle are such earlier themes as wandering, sibling rivalry, the barren wife, wives in conflict, the renaming of the protagonist, God perceived in dreams and visions; and particular geographical locations such as Bet-El, Shekhem, and the Negev (Cassuto 1974)."
"Torah, Genesis, Iii: Yaakov.8","Finally, it should be mentioned that the Yaakov stories are notable in the manner in which they portray the two levels of biblical reality: divine and human. Throughout the stories human beings act according to normal (though often strong) emotions, which God then uses to carry out his master plan. In this cycle one comes to feel the interpretive force of the biblical mind at work, understanding human events in the context of what God wills. It is a fascinating play between the ideas of fate and free will, destiny and choice—a paradox which nevertheless lies at the heart of the biblical conception of God and humankind."

"Torah, Genesis, Iv: Yosef.1",(37–50)
"Torah, Genesis, Iv: Yosef.2","T<small>HE STORIES ABOUT THE LAST</small> P<small>ATRIARCH FORM A COHERENT WHOLE, LEADING SOME</small> to dub it a “novella.” It stands well on its own, although it has been consciously and artfully woven together into both the Yaakov cycle and the entire book."
"Torah, Genesis, Iv: Yosef.3","Initially the tale is one of family emotions, and it is in fact extreme emotions which give it a distinctive flavor. All the major characters are painfully expressive of their feelings, from the doting father to the spoiled son, from the malicious brothers to the lustful wife of Potifar, from the nostalgic adult Yosef to the grief-stricken old Yaakov. It is only through the subconscious medium of dreams, in three sets, that we are made to realize that a higher plan is at work which will supersede the destructive force of these emotions."
"Torah, Genesis, Iv: Yosef.4","For this is a story of how “ill”—with all its connotations of fate, evil, and disaster—is changed to good. Despite the constant threat of death to Yosef, to the Egyptians, and to Binyamin, the hidden, optimistic thrust of the story is “life,” a word that appears in various guises throughout. Even “face,” the key word of the Yaakov cycle which often meant something negative, is here given a kinder meaning, as the resolution to Yaakov’s life."
"Torah, Genesis, Iv: Yosef.5","A major subtheme of the plot is the struggle for power between Re’uven and Yehuda. Its resolution has implications that are as much tribal as personal, for the tribe of Yehuda later became the historical force in ancient Israel as the seat of the monarchy."
"Torah, Genesis, Iv: Yosef.6","Although many details of the narrative confirm Egyptian practices, those practices actually reflect an Egypt considerably later than the period of the Patriarchs (Redford). Of interest also is the prominence of the number five in the story, a detail that is unexplained but that gives some unity to the various sections of text."
"Torah, Genesis, Iv: Yosef.7","In many ways the Yosef material repeats elements in the Yaakov traditions. A long list could be compiled, but let us at least mention here sibling hatred, exile of the hero, foreign names, love and hate, dreams, and deception—even so detailed as to duplicate the use of a goat-kid. But its focusing on a classic rags-to-riches plot, with the addition of a moralistic theme, make the Yosef story a distinctive and always popular tale, accessible in a way that the more difficult stories of the first three parts of Genesis are not."
"Torah, Exodus.1.1","<i>Prologue in Egypt</i> (1): Rather than being presented as a totally separate story, the book of Exodus opens as a continuation of the Genesis saga. This is true both specifically and generally: the first five verses echo and compress the information about the descent of Yaakov’s family into Egypt that was given in Gen. 46:8–27, while “Now these are the names” (v.1) recalls the oft-repeated formula “Now these are the begettings,” which forms the structural background of Genesis. At the same time one might note that the main subject matter of our chapter, life and death (or, threatened continuity), is central to the thematic content of Genesis (see my <i>At the Beginning,</i> “On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure”)."
"Torah, Exodus.1.2","Kikawada and Ackerman (1974) have shown that the opening chapters of Exodus reflect other Genesis material as well. For instance, the five verbs in v.7 mirror the language of creation (Gen. 1:28 and 9:1–2), where a similar vocabulary of fecundity signals the divine desire to “fill the earth.” It is as if Israel’s “becoming many” in Exodus fulfills the plan of history inaugurated at creation, at the same time reminding us of God’s promise to Avraham, to make his descendants as numerous “as the stars in the heavens and [as] the sand that is on the shore of the sea” (Gen. 22:17)."
"Torah, Exodus.1.3","This leads to the predominant issue of Chap. 1: Pharaoh’s paranoid fears about Israel’s growth. What for God was a sign of blessing (cf. the “swarming” of creatures in Gen. 1:20f.) is for Pharaoh a sign of disaster, a feeling of being overwhelmed by what is alien. The birth of the Israelite nation is thus placed in a vivid context, completely physical in its description. And because birth, and not the economic aspects of slavery, is central, the actual description of the oppression of the Hebrews has been reduced to a bare minimum here. Contrary to DeMille’s spectacular and stereotyped portrayal of the Israelites’ sufferings, the Bible limits itself to a few brief verses in the early chapters of the book. The same holds true for parallel depictions of bondage in biblical literature, such as Psalms 78 and 105. It is the experience of being a stranger in Egypt that the Bible has chosen to focus on, rather than on the horrors of slave labor."
"Torah, Exodus.1.4","In Exodus, the Egyptians cannot stand having aliens among them (this theme has already appeared in Genesis regarding their eating habits—see Gen. 43:32); they dread their presence and fear their increase. A natural plan of attack, to stem the human tide, is genocide. Ironically, because of his fear of war Pharaoh concentrates his worries around the males, ignoring the true source of fecundity. And it is the women in these chapters, as many commentators have pointed out (see Exum), who play the major role in beginning the liberation process. The midwives accomplish a successful coverup; Moshe’s mother and sister, and Pharaoh’s daughter, save the future liberator’s life. “If she be a daughter, she may live” (v.16), along with four other occurrences of “live” in vv.17–22, underscore the irony and the certainty of Israelite survival. The use of women—a group that was often powerless in ancient societies—in these stories makes the eventual victory of the Israelites all the more striking from a traditional patriarchal point of view (see Ackerman 1982); the motif returns a number of times in Israelite literature, as with Jael and Judith."
"Torah, Exodus.1.5","Failing in his commissioning of special agents (midwives) to carry out his genocidal plan, Pharaoh finally must enlist “all his people” (v.22), and shift the scene to a cosmic setting, the Nile. The stage is thus set for the birth, endangering, and rescue of Moshe."
"Torah, Exodus.1.6","The historically minded reader may ask: Why would the ruler of a society that is (literally) built on slavery destroy his own workforce? Two answers are possible. First, the story is tied to Chap. 2, the survival of Moshe, and thus must be told to that end (a threat to males). Second, the story does not describe a rational fear, but paranoia—paralleling the situation in Nazi Germany of the 1930s and 1940s, where Jews were blamed for various economic and political catastrophes not of their own making and were eliminated from a society that could have used their resources and manpower."

"Torah, Exodus.1.38","5 <b>issuing:</b> The same Hebrew verb (<i>yatzo</i>’) is later used to describe the Israelites’ “going out” of Egypt (e.g., 12:31, 41). <b>loins:</b> A figurative expression denoting the genitals. <b>seventy:</b> A number expressing perfection or wholeness in the thought of many ancient cultures; see Gen. 46:8–27 for the original passage."
"Torah, Exodus.1.39",6 <b>And Yosef died … :</b> Note the rhythmic lilt of this verse; such devices are often used in biblical style when a key event is portrayed. <b>Yosef:</b> Trad. English “Joseph.”
"Torah, Exodus.1.40","7 <b>Yet:</b> Despite the disappearance of the politically influential generation of Yosef, the Israelites’ success continues (Cassuto). <b>swarmed:</b> This verb is usually applied to animals (see Gen. 1:20) (Greenberg 1969). Here the term is positive, as part of God’s plan; shortly, it will carry a negative connotation for Pharaoh. <b>grew mighty (in number):</b> This reflects the promise of God to Avraham in Gen. 18:18 (to become “a mighty nation”) (Keil and Delitzsch)."
"Torah, Exodus.1.41","8 <b>a new king:</b> His name is not given, even though later biblical books do refer to foreign rulers by name. This is perhaps another example of the biblical text’s playing down history in favor of stressing the story and its lesson. <b>who had not known Yosef:</b> Just as his successor will say “I do not know YHWH” (5:2), and will continue the oppression begun here."
"Torah, Exodus.1.42",9 <b>his people … (this) people:</b> Pharaoh states the case as the conflict between one national entity and another.
"Torah, Exodus.1.43","10 <b>use-our-wits:</b> Others, “We must be prudent,” “Let us deal shrewdly.” <b>it:</b> The shift from plural to singular to refer to a plural object is not unusual in biblical parlance. <b>added:</b> Heb. <i>nosaf</i>, like Yosef (Joseph), whose name is interpreted as “May God add … another son” at his birth in Gen. 30:24. <b>go up away:</b> Heb. unclear."
"Torah, Exodus.1.44","11 <b>afflict:</b> Or “oppress.” <b>Pharaoh:</b> Heb. <i>Par’o.</i> This is an Egyptian title, “(Lord of) the Great House,” and not a proper name. One could justifiably translate, as some do, “<i>the</i> Pharaoh.”"
"Torah, Exodus.1.45","12 <b>so … so:</b> Heb. <i>ken … ken.</i> Ackerman (1974) interprets this as a rhyming retort to Pharaoh’s earlier <i>pen</i> (“<i>lest</i> he become many more”) in 1:10. <b>burst forth:</b> The verb (Heb. <i>parotz</i>) is connected to fertility and wealth in Genesis (e.g., 28:14)."
"Torah, Exodus.1.46","13 <b>crushing-labor:</b> A rare Hebrew word, here translated according to early rabbinic tradition, <i>perekh</i> is used rhetorically three times in Lev. 25 (vv. 43, 46, and 53), where the Israelites are given laws about how to deal with their impoverished countrymen (v.43, “you are not to oppress him with crushing-labor”)."
"Torah, Exodus.1.47","14 <b>in the field:</b> In Egyptian accounts, the phrase indicates hard labor. <b>all their service … :</b> The Hebrew syntax is difficult. Here the phrase is taken as the object of “they embittered.”"
"Torah, Exodus.1.48","15 <b>midwives of the Hebrews:</b> The ambiguity of this phrase raises an ancient question: were they Hebrew or Egyptian? The names seem Semitic (and hence un-Egyptian); then, too, the use of “Hebrew” in the Bible usually occurs when a foreigner is talking about Israelites. Yet the women’s answer in v.19 suggests that they are in fact Egyptians. Abravanel notes that Hebrew women would not be likely to kill Hebrew babies."
"Torah, Exodus.2.1","<i>Moshe’s Birth and Early Life</i> (2:1–22): Picking up from the last phrase of Chap. 1, “let every daughter live,” Chap. 2 opens as a story of three daughters (the word occurs six times here), Moshe’s real and foster mothers, and his sister."
"Torah, Exodus.2.2","It has long been maintained that the story of Moshe’s birth is a classic “birth of the hero” tale, sharing many features with other heroes of antiquity. (See p. 250.) The parallel most often drawn is that of Sargon of Akkad, whose birth story is set in an era before Moshe but was written down later; similar elements include being separated from the real parents through a death threat, and being set adrift on the river. Hallo cites other parallels in Hittite and Egyptian literature, noting at the same time that “none of them includes all of the elements of the Moses birth legend.”"
"Torah, Exodus.2.3","If, as I maintained in the introduction (“On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure”), most of this material has been collected for didactic and not for historical purposes, we are entitled to ask what this story was intended to teach. It cannot simply be written off as an attempt to explain away Moshe’s name and origins. Two elements seem crucial. First, the text as we have it centers around the activity of women—giving birth, hiding, watching and adopting Moshe. The female principle of life-giving triumphs over the male prerogatives of threatening and death-dealing; the Nile, source of all life in Egypt, births another child. Second, the story and its continuation to the end of the chapter set up Moshe as a man of two sides: Hebrew and Egyptian. He is at once archetypal victim (of Pharaoh’s death decree) and archetypal collaborator, growing up, as he apparently does, in Pharaoh’s palace. What are we to make of this two-sided fate and personality? It may well have been intended as a reflex of the people of Israel itself. Often in the Hebrew Bible the hero’s life mirrors that of Israel (see Greenstein 1981), and the case of Moshe is a good example. Moshe develops into a Hebrew—that is, he eventually recovers his full identity. This is accomplished, first, through his empathy with and actions on behalf of “his brothers” (vv.11, 12), then through his exile from Egypt, and finally through the purifying life in the wilderness as a shepherd. Thus Moshe’s personality changes are wrought by means of separations, and the same process will characterize the coming Plague Narrative (with its emphasis on “distinction” between Egypt and Israel) and the entire Israelite legal and ritual system, which stresses holiness and separation."
"Torah, Exodus.2.4","The first section of the chapter (vv.1–10) uses a number of repeating words: “take” appears four times, indicative of divine protection; “child,” seven times (Greenberg 1969); and “see,” which as I have mentioned, will recur meaningfully in Chap. 3. There is also a threefold motif of death threat in the chapter: at birth, on the Nile, and at the hand of the avenging Pharaoh. Isbell notes several items of vocabulary (e.g., “deliver,” “feared,” “amid the reeds”) that return in the victory account at the Sea of Reeds (Chap. 14)."
"Torah, Exodus.2.5","From the other two accounts here (vv.11–14 and 15–22), we learn all we need to know about Moshe’s early personality: he is Hebrew-identifying but Egyptian-looking; concerned with justice, but impetuous and violent in pursuit of that goal. It is also ominous that his first contacts with the Israelites end in rejection, since that will so often be his experience with them later on. The doubly unsatisfactory situation of confused identity and impetuous means must be rectified, and it is exile that accomplishes it. The Midyanite wilderness transforms Moshe into shepherd, foreigner, father, and seer—in short, into a son of the Patriarchs (see also “On the Journey Motif,” above)."
"Torah, Exodus.2.6","Incredibly, the man whose activity is to span four whole books has, it seems, half his life (or, according to the chronology of 7:7, two-thirds of his life!) described in a single chapter. Typical of biblical storytelling, much has been compressed and left out, but enough is told to establish the person who is to come."
"Torah, Exodus.2.7",16 he said:
"Torah, Exodus.2.8","When you help the Hebrew women give birth, see the supporting-stones:"
"Torah, Exodus.2.9","if he be a son, put him to death,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.10","but if she be a daughter, she may live."
"Torah, Exodus.2.11","17 But the midwives held God in awe,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.12","and they did not do as the king of Egypt had spoken to them,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.13",they let the (male) children live.
"Torah, Exodus.2.14",18 The king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them:
"Torah, Exodus.2.15","Why have you done this thing, you have let the children live!"
"Torah, Exodus.2.16",19 The midwives said to Pharaoh:
"Torah, Exodus.2.17","Indeed, not like the Egyptian (women) are the Hebrew (women),"
"Torah, Exodus.2.18","indeed, they are lively:"
"Torah, Exodus.2.19","before the midwife comes to them, they have given birth!"
"Torah, Exodus.2.20",20 God dealt well with the midwives.
"Torah, Exodus.2.21",And the people became many and grew exceedingly mighty (in number).
"Torah, Exodus.2.22","21 It was, since the midwives held God in awe, that he made them households."
"Torah, Exodus.2.23","22 Now Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.2.24","Every son that is born, throw him into the Nile,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.25",but let every daughter live.
"Torah, Exodus.2.26",2:1 A man from the house of Levi went and took (to wife) a daughter of Levi.
"Torah, Exodus.2.27",2 The woman became pregnant and bore a son.
"Torah, Exodus.2.28","When she saw him—that he was goodly, she hid him, for three months."
"Torah, Exodus.2.29","3 And when she was no longer able to hide him,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.30","she took for him a little-ark of papyrus,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.31","she loamed it with loam and with pitch,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.32","placed the child in it,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.33",and placed it in the reeds by the shore of the Nile.
"Torah, Exodus.2.34","4 And his sister stationed herself far off, to know what would be done to him."
"Torah, Exodus.2.35","5 Pharaoh’s daughter went down to bathe at the Nile,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.36",while her girls were walking along the Nile.
"Torah, Exodus.2.37",She saw the little-ark among the reeds
"Torah, Exodus.2.38","and sent her maid, and she fetched it."
"Torah, Exodus.2.39","6 She opened (it) and saw him, the child—"
"Torah, Exodus.2.40","here, a boy weeping!"
"Torah, Exodus.2.41","She pitied him, and she said:"
"Torah, Exodus.2.42",One of the Hebrews’ children is this!
"Torah, Exodus.2.43",7 Now his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter:
"Torah, Exodus.2.44","Shall I go and call a nursing woman from the Hebrews for you,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.45",that she may nurse the child for you?
"Torah, Exodus.2.46",8 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her:
"Torah, Exodus.2.47",Go!
"Torah, Exodus.2.48",The maiden went and called the child’s mother.
"Torah, Exodus.2.49",9 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her:
"Torah, Exodus.2.50","Have this child go with you and nurse him for me,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.51",and I myself will give you your wages.
"Torah, Exodus.2.52",So the woman took the child and she nursed him.
"Torah, Exodus.2.53","10 The child grew, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.54",and he became her son.
"Torah, Exodus.2.55",She called his name: Moshe/He-Who-Pulls-Out;
"Torah, Exodus.2.56",she said: For out of the water <i>meshitihu</i>/I-pulled-him.
"Torah, Exodus.2.57","11 Now it was some years later, Moshe grew up;"
"Torah, Exodus.2.58",he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens.
"Torah, Exodus.2.59","He saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man, (one) of his brothers."
"Torah, Exodus.2.60","12 He turned this-way and that-way, and seeing that there was no man (there),"
"Torah, Exodus.2.61",he struck down the Egyptian
"Torah, Exodus.2.62",and buried him in the sand.
"Torah, Exodus.2.63","13 He went out again on the next day, and here: two Hebrew men scuffling!"
"Torah, Exodus.2.64",He said to the guilty-one:
"Torah, Exodus.2.65",For-what-reason do you strike your fellow?

"Torah, Exodus.2.67",Who made you prince and judge over us?
"Torah, Exodus.2.68",Do you mean to kill me
"Torah, Exodus.2.69",as you killed the Egyptian?
"Torah, Exodus.2.70",Moshe became afraid and said:
"Torah, Exodus.2.71",Surely the matter is known!
"Torah, Exodus.2.72",15 Pharaoh heard of this matter and sought to kill Moshe.
"Torah, Exodus.2.73",But Moshe fled from Pharaoh’s face and settled in the land of Midyan;
"Torah, Exodus.2.74",he sat down by a well.
"Torah, Exodus.2.75",16 Now the priest of Midyan had seven daughters;
"Torah, Exodus.2.76","they came, they drew (water) and they filled the troughs,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.77",to give-drink to their father’s sheep.
"Torah, Exodus.2.78",17 Shepherds came and drove them away.
"Torah, Exodus.2.79","But Moshe rose up, he delivered them and gave-drink to their sheep."
"Torah, Exodus.2.80","18 When they came (home) to Re’uel their father, he said:"
"Torah, Exodus.2.81",Why have you come (home) so quickly today?

"Torah, Exodus.2.83","An Egyptian man rescued us from the hand of the shepherds,"
"Torah, Exodus.2.84",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.2.85","16 <b>supporting-stones:</b> Some suggest that these were stools or other objects on which to support women in labor, while others see them as a reference to the testicles of the newborn males."
"Torah, Exodus.2.86",17 <b>held … in awe:</b> Trad. “feared.” This may be a sound-play on “see” in v.16: <i>va-yire’u</i> (held in awe) resembles <i>va-yir’u</i> (“saw”).
"Torah, Exodus.2.87","19 <b>lively:</b> Another form of the Hebrew would mean “animals,” and so B-R combined the two ideas in rendering the word as “lively-like-animals.”"
"Torah, Exodus.2.88","20–21 <b>And the people … :</b> The order here seems confused. “And the people …” is perhaps out of place, although the thought is not inappropriate for the context."
"Torah, Exodus.2.89","22 <b>all his people:</b> Specialists (the midwives) are not equal to the task of checking the Israelite population explosion, and so the whole Egyptian population must now be enlisted. <b>Nile:</b> Heb. <i>ye’or,</i> Egyptian <i>itrw:,</i> “the great river” (cf. Heb. <i>ha-nahar ha-gadol,</i> with the same meaning, used for the Euphrates in Gen. 15:18 etc.)."
"Torah, Exodus.2.90","2:1 <b>a man … a daughter:</b> Moshe’s parents are anonymous, unlike the usual king and queen of the hero myth found in other cultures. The namelessness of all the secondary characters in this chapter—sister, Pharaoh’s daughter and her maids—helps us to focus on the protagonist and on his name."
"Torah, Exodus.2.91","2 <b>she saw him—that he was goodly:</b> The parallel in Genesis is “God saw the light: that it was good” (Gen. 1:4). <b>goodly:</b> Handsome (so Ibn Ezra, among others), although others interpret the Hebrew <i>tov</i> as “healthy,” given the context. What is important is the Genesis connection just mentioned. <b>three months:</b> Another “perfect” number, which will recur with the Israelites’ three-month trip to Mount Sinai (see 19:1)."
"Torah, Exodus.2.92","3 <b>little-ark:</b> The term used to designate the little basket/boat, <i>teiva,</i> has clearly been chosen to reflect back to Noah’s ark in Genesis. The implication is that just as God saved Noah and thus humanity from destruction by water, so will he now save Moshe and the Israelites from the same. <b>papyrus:</b> A material that floats; it was also used in biblical times for writing, including biblical texts. <b>in the reeds:</b> Another foreshadowing; when Moshe grows up, he will lead the liberated people through the Sea of Reeds. The word <i>suf</i> (reeds) appears to be a loan-word from Egyptian."
"Torah, Exodus.2.93","4 <b>to know:</b> Better English would be “to learn.” This first occurrence of the Hebrew word <i>yado’a</i> foreshadows the later theme of the Egyptians’ and the Israelites’ coming to “know” (or “acknowledge”) God’s power. For the moment, and in the story that follows, the issue is one of revealing information—Moshe’s fate (2:4) and the discovery of his crime (2:14)."
"Torah, Exodus.2.94","5 <b>Pharaoh’s daughter:</b> Her station is important, for it enables Moshe to be saved and to be brought up in the Egyptian palace (useful both for his political future and for literary irony of situation). <b>girls:</b> Maidservants."
"Torah, Exodus.2.95","6 <b>She opened … boy weeping!:</b> The emphatic, halting syntax of the narrative brings out the visual drama of seeing, taking, opening, and identifying. <b>One of the Hebrews’ children:</b> How does she know that? The simplest explanation lies in the situation itself and not in any identifying marks. Who else but a Hebrew, under the threat of losing her baby, would set such a child adrift? <b>is this:</b> Or “must this be.”"
"Torah, Exodus.2.96","8 <b>Go:</b> In biblical Hebrew, a verb repeated from a question is the equivalent of “Yes,” for which there was no other expression."
"Torah, Exodus.2.97","10 <b>grew:</b> His age is not mentioned, but weaning may be inferred (cf. Gen. 21:8) as the appropriate boundary, and hence the child was probably around three (DeVaux 1965). <b>he became her son:</b> A formulaic expression for legal adoption. <b>Moshe/He-Who-Pulls-Out:</b> Trad. English “Moses.” <i>Mss</i> is a well-attested name in ancient Egypt, meaning “son of” (as in Ra’amses—“son of Ra”—in Ex. 1:11). Thus it is quite appropriate that Pharaoh’s daughter names her adopted son in this manner. However, there is an explicit irony here, as Buber (1988) and others have pointed out. The princess, in a Hebrew folk etymology (one based on sound rather than on the scientific derivation of words), thinks that the name Moshe recalls her act of “pulling out” the baby from the Nile. But the verb form in <i>moshe</i> is active, not passive, and thus it is Moshe himself who will one day “pull out” Israel from the life-threatening waters of both slavery and the Sea of Reeds."
"Torah, Exodus.2.98","11 <b>some years later:</b> Heb. <i>yamim,</i> lit. “days,” can mean longer periods of time, and often years. Here the narrative skips over what it considers unimportant, and we are presented with a young man, who already has strong identity and opinions. <b>his brothers:</b> Occurring twice in this verse, this phrase can only mean that Moshe was aware of his background, and concerned with the plight of the Israelites (Heb. <i>r’h b-,</i> “see” with a specific preposition, indicates not only observation but sympathy)."
"Torah, Exodus.2.99","12 <b>no man (there):</b> Although some have interpreted this as “no man around to help,” the expression taken in context would seem to indicate that Moshe was afraid of being seen. This incident reveals Moshe’s concern and early leanings toward being a liberator, but also demonstrates his youthful lack of forethought. In fact, it will take God, not Moshe’s own actions, to set the liberation process in motion. <b>struck down:</b> This is the same verb (Heb. <i>hakkeh)</i> that the narrator used in v.11 to describe the fatal beating received by the Israelite slave."
"Torah, Exodus.2.100","13 <b>Hebrew men scuffling:</b> A rhyme in Hebrew, <i>anashim ’ivriyyim nitzim.</i>"
"Torah, Exodus.2.101","14 <b>Who made you prince … :</b> One hears here echoes of Moshe’s later experiences with his “hard-necked” people, which commence in the book of Exodus (Greenberg 1969). <b>judge:</b> Or “ruler.” I have retained “judge” here in order not to lose the connection with 5:21."
"Torah, Exodus.2.102","15 <b>Moshe fled … and settled:</b> The details about what must have been a psychologically important journey are not spelled out, as the narrative rushes toward its first great climax in Chap. 3. More important than the journey motif is that of exile, brought out tellingly in v.22. <b>settled … sat:</b> Adding the “settle down” of v.21, we hear a threefold use of <i>yashov,</i> perhaps to stress Moshe’s new life."
"Torah, Exodus.2.103","16 <b>priest of Midyan:</b> This title has spawned extensive theorizing about the origins of Mosaic religion (sometimes called the “Kenite Hypothesis” after the Kenites, a tribe of smiths connected to Moshe’s father-in-law and spoken of favorably at a number of points in the Bible). It has been suggested that Moshe learned the rudiments of his religious or legal system from this source. We do not have enough evidence to make a positive judgment on this theory; biographically, it does make sense for Moshe to marry into a holy family of some sort. <b>seven daughters:</b> The requisite “magic” number, as in a good folk tale."
"Torah, Exodus.2.104","19 <b>An Egyptian man:</b> Moshe would have been recognizable as such from his manner of dress and lack of facial hair. In addition, he is not yet fully an Israelite, spiritually speaking."
"Torah, Exodus.3.1","<i>God Takes Notice</i> (2:23–25): Chap. 2 ends on a note that looks forward and backward simultaneously. The fourfold “God” plus verb (vv.24–25) echo the same structure at Creation’s first day (Gen. 1:3–5), and suggest that he puts his concern for the people of Israel on a par with his concern for creation of light (connoting “good” in folklore). In addition, the four verbs used here play a prominent role in the entire Deliverance Narrative, as Isbell has shown."
"Torah, Exodus.3.2","and also he drew, yes, drew for us and watered the sheep!"
"Torah, Exodus.3.3",20 He said to his daughters:

"Torah, Exodus.3.10","and he called his name: Gershom/Sojourner There,"
"Torah, Exodus.3.11",for he said: A sojourner have I become in a foreign land.
"Torah, Exodus.3.12","23 It was, many years later,"
"Torah, Exodus.3.13",the king of Egypt died.
"Torah, Exodus.3.14","The Children of Israel groaned from the servitude,"
"Torah, Exodus.3.15",and they cried out;

"Torah, Exodus.3.21",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.3.22","20 <b>So-where-is-he:</b> This is one word in the Hebrew (<i>ve-ayyo</i>). The whole verse stands in ironic contrast to Moshe’s earlier treatment (v. 14) at the hand of “his brothers” (Childs). There, he was rejected; here, his host cannot welcome him quickly enough. <b>For-what-reason:</b> Similarly this is one Hebrew word (<i>lamma</i>). <b>bread:</b> As often in both the Bible and other cultures, “bread” is here synonymous with “food.”"
"Torah, Exodus.3.23",21 <b>Tzippora:</b> Trad. English “Zipporah.” The name means “bird”; such animal names are still popular among Bedouin.
"Torah, Exodus.3.24","22 <b>Gershom/Sojourner There:</b> Related to the Hebrew <i>ger</i>, “sojourner” or resident alien. The name more accurately reflects the sound of the verb <i>garesh,</i> “drive out” (so Abravanel), which plays its role in the Exodus stories (and in Moshe’s recent experience in the narrative). As my student Nancy Ginsberg once pointed out, this naming of sons to express the feelings about exile has already occurred in a more personally positive context—with Yosef (see Gen. 41:50–52). <b>A sojourner … in a foreign land:</b> The King James Version phrase, “a stranger in a strange land,” is stunning, but the Hebrew uses two different roots (<i>gur</i> and <i>nakhor</i>)."
"Torah, Exodus.3.25","23 <b>the king of Egypt died./ The Children of Israel groaned:</b> The change in regime does not prove beneficial to the suffering slaves, but makes it possible for Moshe to return to Egypt, thus impelling the narrative along and reestablishing the link between Moshe and his people. <b>cried out:</b> The same verb (Heb. <i>tza’ok</i>) is used to describe the “hue and cry” of Sodom and Gomorra (Gen. 18:20; see also the note to 22:22, below)."
"Torah, Exodus.3.26","23–24 <b>groaned … cried out … plea-for-help … moaning:</b> As in 1:7, four phrases describe the Israelites’ actions. Note also the double use of “from the servitude.”"
"Torah, Exodus.3.27","24 <b>Avraham, Yitzhak, Yaakov:</b> Trad. English “Abraham, Isaac, Jacob.”"
"Torah, Exodus.3.28","25 <b>knew:</b> Others, “took notice,” but <i>yado’a</i> needs to be noticed throughout the book as a key word."
"Torah, Exodus.4.1","<i>At the Bush: The Call</i> (3:1–4:17): The great revelation scene in these two chapters, so much a classic in the literature of the West, comes as somewhat of a surprise in the close context of our story. Nothing in Exodus so far has prepared us for such a religious, inward vision on the part of Moshe; and indeed, Genesis itself contains no meeting between God and a human being of such a dramatic character. Adam and Avraham converse with God; Yaakov experiences him, to be sure, in dreams and in the guise of a wrestler; but nowhere thus far does one find a biblical hero encountering God with such intensity and purity of vision."
"Torah, Exodus.4.2","The shepherd, now in the service of his father-in-law, the “priest,” comes upon the “mountain of God,” “behind the wilderness.” The results are those of an unintended or half-intended journey. Moshe, who had fled previously, finds himself at the utmost reaches of the wilderness, almost like Jonah in the bowels of the boat or of the great fish. The sight that Moshe is granted is of unclear nature, but it involves fire, with all its pregnant associations: passion, purity, light, mystery (Greenberg 1969), and here, inextinguishability."
"Torah, Exodus.4.3","God’s initial speech (vv.6–10) contains all the elements basic to the Deliverance Narrative: it identifies him as the ancestral deity, establishes his compassion for the oppressed people, demonstrates his resolve to rescue them, and ends with the commissioning of Moshe to be his emissary. Central here is the verb <i>see,</i> whose threefold occurrence (vv.7 and 9) ties together the threads of the previous parts of Moshe’s story (see above)."
"Torah, Exodus.4.4","The entire scene is the model for the “call” of the biblical prophet, with its emphasis on God’s speaking to the fledgling prophet amid a vision and the motif of refusal; of the call scenes in the Bible, this is the longest and most memorable in its starkness. A man is called by God to return to society and serve as God’s spokesperson—despite any opposition he may encounter and despite his personal shortcomings. Moshe’s reluctance, indeed his almost obsessive need to turn down the commission, is as much indicative of the general nature of prophecy (cf. Elijah and Jeremiah) as it is of Moshe’s own personality. The prophet must be prepared “to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and plant” (Jer. 1:10), and to stand tall against kings if necessary (Jer. 1:13). So it comes as no surprise that the call is met with less than enthusiasm. And this refusal also teaches something about Israel’s political conceptions. With such a response as this, there can be no question of personal ambition or inner lust for power. The prophet does what he does out of compulsion: he is driven by forces that he perceives as external to him."
"Torah, Exodus.4.5","In our text, Moshe refuses the commission five times, and five times God counters. In four of these cases the assurance is given that God will “be-there” with him (3:12, 14; 4:12, 15), and the use of that verb carries in its essence one of the most significant motifs of the Bush Narrative: the interpretation of God’s name."
"Torah, Exodus.4.6","When Moshe asks God for his name in 3:13, he asks for more than a title (Buber and Rosenzweig 1994). In the context of Egyptian magic, knowing the true name of a person or a god meant that one could coerce him, or at the very least understand his true essence. Moshe foresees that the slaves will want to be able to call on this power that has promised to deliver them."
"Torah, Exodus.4.7","God’s answer is one of the most enigmatic and widely debated statements in the Hebrew Bible (the reader will want to consult Childs for a full bibliography). What does <i>ehyeh asher ehyeh</i> mean? One’s suspicions are aroused from the outset, for the answer is alliterative and hence already not easy to pin down; the poetics of the phrase indicate both importance and vagueness or mystery. There is some scholarly consensus that the name may mean “He who causes (things) to be” or perhaps “He who is.” Buber and Rosenzweig, taking an entirely different tack (of which one occasionally finds echoes in the scholarly literature), interpret the verb <i>hayoh</i> as signifying presence, “being-<i>there</i>,” and hence see God’s words as a real answer to the Israelites’ imagined question—an assurance of his presence. The B-R interpretation has been retained here, out of a desire to follow them on at least this significant point of theology, and out of my feeling that it also fits the smaller context. For of the several times that Moshe tries to wriggle out of his mission, God answers him all but once with the same verb, in the same meaning: “I will be-there with you” (note the parallel between Moshe and the people again)."
"Torah, Exodus.4.8","It is, however, also possible that <i>ehyeh asher ehyeh</i> is a deliberately vague phrase, whose purpose is antimagical and an attempt to evade the question (Rosenzweig speaks of this as well), as if to suggest that possession of the true name cannot be used to coerce this God. In this interpretation, it would follow that, just as God is magicless (see v. 20), he is nameless, at least in the conventional sense of religion. On the other hand, the name Y<small>hwh</small>, however it may have been vocalized throughout the history of the text, did function as a name in ancient Israel (and possibly outside of Israel as well). It was used in oaths (e.g., Gen. 22:16, II Sam. 12:5), and later, in the Second Temple period, limited in public pronunciation to the high priest on the Day of Atonement. As happens frequently in the history of religion, if we follow a concept long enough it transforms back to the beginning, often in an opposite meaning, and so when the use of Y<small>hwh</small> is traced through the Middle Ages one finds it turned into a magical name at the hands of Jewish mystics."
"Torah, Exodus.4.9","To return to the Bush Narrative as a whole: these chapters introduce a number of important words that will recur throughout the enire Liberation Narrative. These include “trust,” “hearken to (my) voice,” “staff,” “heavy,” “go out,” “strong,” “send,” and “blood” (see Isbell). It should also be mentioned that several key words occur in multiples of 7 from 2:23 to 4:31 (Cassuto): “see” (7), “send” (7), “go” (14), “mouth” (7), “speak/word” (Heb. <i>dabber/davar;</i> 7). This vocabulary in particular focuses the story around major aspects of prophecy."
"Torah, Exodus.4.10","In the end, what does Moshe have with which to return from the mount of vision? In the DeMille film version his face and personality clearly change; in the biblical text, however, he comes back with a word—the divine promise—and a staff, “with which you shall do the signs” (4:17). He had previously been a man whose lack of tolerance for injustice produced violence; now he is armed with words and a wonder-working object—not a sword or a helmet, but a shepherd’s staff."
"Torah, Exodus.4.11","3:1 Now Moshe was shepherding the flock of Yitro his father-in-law, priest of Midyan."
"Torah, Exodus.4.12",He led the flock behind the wilderness—
"Torah, Exodus.4.13","and he came to the mountain of God, to Horev."
"Torah, Exodus.4.14",2 And Y<small>hwh</small>’s messenger was seen by him
"Torah, Exodus.4.15",in the flame of a fire out of the midst of a bush.
"Torah, Exodus.4.16",He saw:
"Torah, Exodus.4.17","here, the bush is burning with fire,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.18",and the bush is not consumed!
"Torah, Exodus.4.19",3 Moshe said:
"Torah, Exodus.4.20",Now let me turn aside
"Torah, Exodus.4.21",that I may see this great sight—
"Torah, Exodus.4.22",why the bush does not burn up!
"Torah, Exodus.4.23","4 When Y<small>hwh</small> saw that he had turned aside to see,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.24","God called to him out of the midst of the bush,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.25",he said:
"Torah, Exodus.4.26",Moshe! Moshe!
"Torah, Exodus.4.27",He said:
"Torah, Exodus.4.28",Here I am.
"Torah, Exodus.4.29",5 He said:
"Torah, Exodus.4.30","Do not come near to here,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.31","put off your sandal from your foot,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.32",for the place on which you stand—it is holy ground!
"Torah, Exodus.4.33",6 And he said:

"Torah, Exodus.4.35","the God of Avraham,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.36","the God of Yitzhak,"

"Torah, Exodus.4.38","Moshe concealed his face,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.39",for he was afraid to gaze upon God.
"Torah, Exodus.4.40",7 Y<small>hwh</small> said:
"Torah, Exodus.4.41","I have seen, yes, seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.42",their cry have I heard in the face of their slave-drivers;
"Torah, Exodus.4.43","indeed, I have known their sufferings!"
"Torah, Exodus.4.44",8 So I have come down
"Torah, Exodus.4.45","to rescue it from the hand of Egypt,"

"Torah, Exodus.4.52","9 So now,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.53","here, the cry of the Children of Israel has come to me,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.54",and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
"Torah, Exodus.4.55","10 So-now, go,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.56",for I send you to Pharaoh—
"Torah, Exodus.4.57","bring my people, the Children of Israel, out of Egypt!"
"Torah, Exodus.4.58",11 Moshe said to God:
"Torah, Exodus.4.59",Who am I
"Torah, Exodus.4.60","that I should go to Pharaoh,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.61",that I should bring the Children of Israel out of Egypt?
"Torah, Exodus.4.62",12 He said:
"Torah, Exodus.4.63","Indeed, I will be-there with you,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.64",and this is the sign for you that I myself have sent you:
"Torah, Exodus.4.65","when you have brought the people out of Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.66",you will (all) serve God by this mountain.
"Torah, Exodus.4.67",13 Moshe said to God:
"Torah, Exodus.4.68","Here, I will come to the Children of Israel"
"Torah, Exodus.4.69",and I will say to them:
"Torah, Exodus.4.70","The God of your fathers has sent me to you,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.71",and they will say to me: What is his name?—
"Torah, Exodus.4.72",what shall I say to them?
"Torah, Exodus.4.73",14 God said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.4.74",E<small>hyeh</small> A<small>sher</small> E<small>hyeh</small>/I will be-there howsoever I will be-there.
"Torah, Exodus.4.75",And he said:

"Torah, Exodus.4.77",E<small>hyeh</small>/I-W<small>ill</small>-B<small>e</small>-T<small>here</small> sends me to you.
"Torah, Exodus.4.78",15 And God said further to Moshe:

"Torah, Exodus.4.81","the God of your fathers,"

"Torah, Exodus.4.90","the God of Avraham, of Yitzhak, and of Yaakov,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.91",saying:
"Torah, Exodus.4.92","I have taken account, yes, account of you and of what is being done to you in Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.4.93",17 and I have declared:
"Torah, Exodus.4.94","I will bring you up from the affliction of Egypt,"

"Torah, Exodus.4.137",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.4.138","3:1 <b>Now Moshe was shepherding … :</b> The Hebrew syntax indicates the beginning of an entirely new story. <b>shepherding:</b> A symbol of great power in the ancient Near East; witness the enduring image of King David, sprung from shepherding roots, and of course that of Jesus. <b>Yitro:</b> Trad. English “Jethro.” It is not clear why other names (Re’uel, Hovav) are also associated with him. The name, if Semitic, means “excellence.” <b>behind:</b> Others, “to the west side of,” “to the far side of,” or simply “into,” although the word seems to convey a certain mystery. Fairy tales often portray the hero’s going deep into a forest and the like. <b>mountain of God:</b> Sinai is so designated only several times subsequently in the Pentateuch, suggesting perhaps biblical religion’s reluctance to make of it a shrine of permanence. <b>Horev:</b> Another name for Sinai, principally used in Deuteronomy (but also twice more in Exodus, 17:6 and 33:6). A related Hebrew root, <i>harev</i>, means “dry.”"
"Torah, Exodus.4.139","2 <b>Y<small>hwh</small>’s messenger:</b> Traditionally “angel,” but the English word stems from the Greek <i>angelos,</i> which means “messenger.” In Genesis, God appears in somewhat human guise (cf. Chap. 18), and “messenger” indicates an unspecified manifestation of God, open to wide interpretation. <b>in the flame:</b> Others, “as a flame.” <b>bush:</b> Jewish tradition identifies it as a thornbush, but the precise plant remains unknown. The bush, called <i>s’neh</i> in Hebrew, perhaps has the added function here of providing assonance with <i>Sinai</i>. <b>the bush is burning … the bush is not consumed:</b> The use of tense (plus the opening “here”) conveys the immediacy of the vision. <b>not consumed:</b> The symbolism of the imperishable bush is left open for the reader; commentators suggest variously Israel and God himself."
"Torah, Exodus.4.140","3 <b>let me turn aside:</b> Despite Moshe’s apparent retirement from intervening on behalf of his brothers in Egypt, his reaction here seems active, not passive. He does not shirk from seeking out the strange sight."
"Torah, Exodus.4.141","4 <b>Moshe! Moshe!:</b> The name is repeated for emphasis, as in Gen. 22:11 <b>Here I am:</b> The classic response of biblical heroes; see Gen. 22:1, 11; I Sam. 3:4."
"Torah, Exodus.4.142","5 <b>put off your sandal from your foot:</b> A common form of respect in the ancient East, still practiced by Muslims in worship."
"Torah, Exodus.4.143","6 <b>the God of your father:</b> Hearkening back to the personal and family relationships with God in Genesis (see, for instance, Gen. 26:24, 31:42, 32:10). <b>Avraham … :</b> The text stresses the Patriarchs, reminding both Moshe and the reader of the promises made to them in Genesis."
"Torah, Exodus.4.144","7 <b>I have seen … heard … known:</b> Echoing the narrative above, 2:24–25. <b>the affliction of my people:</b> Heb. <i>’oni ’ammi.</i> <b>my people:</b> This fateful designation signals the beginning of the liberation process. The Golden Calf story (Chaps. 32ff.) provides a tragic variation on this phrase."
"Torah, Exodus.4.145","8 <b>I have come down:</b> The phrase indicates God’s intervention in human affairs (as, negatively, in Gen. 11:7). <b>a land flowing with milk and honey:</b> Or with “goats’ milk and date-syrup.” This description of Canaan is repeated many times in the three subsequent books of the Pentateuch, but is not found in Genesis. <b>Canaanite</b> [etc.]: These names are the Bible’s designation for the indigenous peoples of Canaan at the time of the Israelite conquest. Biblical lists contain varying numbers of peoples, from six to ten. <b>Yevusite:</b> The pre-Israelite inhabitants of Jerusalem."
"Torah, Exodus.4.146","12 <b>this is the sign:</b> The thought is not entirely clear. It may signify that liberation signals Israel’s birth as a people, and therefore Moshe’s legitimacy as well. (<b>all</b>): “You” is plural here. <b>by:</b> As opposed to “upon,” since the people will not be allowed to trespass its sacred boundaries (see 19:12)."
"Torah, Exodus.4.147",13 <b>What is his name?:</b> See Commentary below. B-R: “What is behind his name?”
"Torah, Exodus.4.148","14 <b>E<small>hyeh</small> A<small>sher</small> E<small>hyeh</small> …</b>: The syntax is difficult. Others, “I am that I am.”"
"Torah, Exodus.4.149","15 <b>title:</b> Others, “memorial.”"
"Torah, Exodus.4.150",16 <b>elders:</b> They are the holders of political power in such a tribal society. <b>taken account.</b> As per Yosef’s promise in Gen. 50:24.
"Torah, Exodus.4.151","18 <b>pray let us go:</b> Interestingly, the initial request made of Pharaoh is not for emancipation but for permission to observe a religious festival. It eventually becomes clear that Israel cannot be Israel until it is free of Egyptian hegemony. <b>slaughter (offerings):</b> Offer animal sacrifices."
"Torah, Exodus.4.152","21 <b>you shall not go empty-handed:</b> The despoiling of the Egyptians is reminiscent of obtaining booty in war. At the same time, there is probably a legal background to this (Daube 1961): the furnishing of a freed slave with provisions. The follow-up to the despoiling, intended or not, is God’s command that, in Israel’s future observance of religious festivals in the Promised Land, “no one is to be seen in my presence empty-handed” (Ex. 23:15)."
"Torah, Exodus.4.153","22 <b>ask of:</b> Others, “borrow.” <b>strip:</b> Here the verb (<i>natzel</i>) means “strip,” perhaps punning on a different form used in v.8 which means “rescue.”"
"Torah, Exodus.4.154",4:1 <b>spoke up … said:</b> This coupling of verbs is common in Ugaritic and Hebrew to denote a new thought on the speaker’s part (Cassuto 1967).
"Torah, Exodus.4.155",4 <b>send forth:</b> Or “stretch out.”
"Torah, Exodus.4.156","6 <b>bosom:</b> Others, “upper folds of (his) cloak.”"
"Torah, Exodus.5.1","<i>The Journey Back</i> (4:18–31): It is clear that something has been inserted into the normal course of our narrative. What follows v.20 should be v.27; Moshe, ready to go back to Egypt, is met by Aharon in the wilderness, and they subsequently announce their mission to the Children of Israel. However, the editor has prefaced the brothers’ meeting, first with a warning to Moshe that his mission will be strongly resisted by Pharaoh, and a warning that Moshe is to deliver to Pharaoh. Then follows a bizarre episode, which, like the Name passage discussed above, has provoked centuries of comment and attempts to explain it. What are we to make of the circumcision story here, especially the last scene, which is unclear not only in import but in details such as pronouns as well?"
"Torah, Exodus.5.2","Buber (1988) explains it as an event that sometimes occurs in hero stories: the deity appears as “divine demon” and threatens the hero’s life. Perhaps this underlines the dangerous side of contact between the human and the divine. But there seem to be other reasons for the passage’s inclusion at this point in the text. First, it serves as an end bracket to Moshe’s sojourn in Midyan. As mentioned earlier, Moshe flees Egypt under pain of death (2:15); here, on his return, he is in mortal danger once more. Second, our passage seems to be an <i>inclusio</i> or bracketing passage for the entire Plague Narrative (Kosmala and others). This is confirmed by the use of vv.21–23 as an introduction. God, designating Israel his firstborn and alluding to the future killing of Pharaoh’s/Egypt’s firstborn sons, demonstrates his power as life-taker, to be pacified or turned away only by a ceremonial blood-smearing—parallel to the Israelites’ smearing of blood on their doorposts when their own firstborn are threatened by the Tenth Plague (12:12–13)."
"Torah, Exodus.5.3","Two final points should be noted here. First, it is with the act of his son’s circumcision that Moshe finally becomes a true Israelite (that, after all, was the major term of God’s covenant with Abraham in Gen. 17). Similarly, Yehoshua (Joshua), Moshe’s successor, will circumcise the next generation of Israelites in the process of conquering the Promised Land (Josh. 5:2). And second, it is telling, again, that the person who saves Moshe’s life in adulthood is a woman. In a sense, Moshe’s early life is now over, having come full circle."
"Torah, Exodus.5.4",7 Now he said:
"Torah, Exodus.5.5",Return your hand to your bosom!
"Torah, Exodus.5.6","—He returned his hand to his bosom, then he took it out of his bosom,"
"Torah, Exodus.5.7",and here: it had returned (to be) like his (other) flesh.
"Torah, Exodus.5.8","8 So it shall be, if they do not trust you, and do not hearken to the voice of the former sign,"
"Torah, Exodus.5.9",that they will put their trust in the voice of the latter sign.

"Torah, Exodus.5.30","14 Y<small>hwh</small>’s anger flared up against Moshe,"

"Torah, Exodus.5.33","I know that <i>he</i> can speak, yes, speak well,"
"Torah, Exodus.5.34","and here, he is even going out to meet you;"
"Torah, Exodus.5.35","when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart."
"Torah, Exodus.5.36","15 You shall speak to him,"
"Torah, Exodus.5.37",you shall put the words in his mouth!

"Torah, Exodus.5.42","17 And this staff, take in your hand,"
"Torah, Exodus.5.43",with which you shall do the signs.
"Torah, Exodus.5.44",18 Moshe went and returned to Yitro his father-in-law
"Torah, Exodus.5.45",and said to him:
"Torah, Exodus.5.46","Pray let me go and return to my brothers that are in Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.5.47",that I may see whether they are still alive.
"Torah, Exodus.5.48",Yitro said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.5.49",Go in peace!
"Torah, Exodus.5.50",19 Now Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe in Midyan:

"Torah, Exodus.5.72","6 <b>had <i>tzaraat</i>:</b> Trad. “was leprous,” but <i>tzaraat</i> is now understood as a kind of skin disease, not as serious as true leprosy. In the Bible, it was, however, often taken as a sign from God of wrongdoing on the part of the victim."
"Torah, Exodus.5.73","8 <b>voice:</b> Meaning “message,” as in Ugaritic usage. <b>sign:</b> These were often required or used by prophets in the Bible (see the discussion in Deut. 13:2ff.) (Greenberg 1969)."
"Torah, Exodus.5.74","9 <b>blood:</b> Since the Nile was regarded as divine by the Egyptians, not only would such a plague be miraculous and devastating, but it would also be a direct swipe at the Egyptian religion."
"Torah, Exodus.5.75","10 <b>no man of words am I:</b> Yet this is exactly the quality that Moshe’s mission requires! (Greenberg 1969). Similarly, Jeremiah (1:6) seeks to evade the call, although his refusal is based more on inexperience than on lack of eloquence. <b>yesterday … the day-before:</b> A Hebrew idiom for “the past.” <b>heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue:</b> The nature of Moshe’s speech impediment is not clear. Curiously, writes Buber (1988), it is the stammerer whose task it is to bring down God’s word to the human world."

"Torah, Exodus.5.77","14 <b>flared up:</b> Literally, burned, the normal biblical metaphor for anger. <b>Aharon:</b> Trad. English “Aaron.” This is the first mention of the brother whom we later find out was the firstborn. <b>the Levite:</b> Why this designation here? Some theorize that it means “joiner,” while others see it as a tracing of Levite roots as spokespeople in Israel. The phrase could also be translated as “Is not your brother Aharon the Levite?”"
"Torah, Exodus.5.78",15 <b>you shall put … :</b> Moshe is to Aharon as God is to a prophet; the latter is to serve principally as a mouthpiece.

"Torah, Exodus.5.81","19 <b>all the men:</b> Moshe need no longer fear for his life at Pharaoh’s hands, but he will shortly be threatened by God himself (see vv. 24–26)."

Here, as usual, such a motif has been suppressed. It surfaces later in Jewish legend, in full mythical garb. The staff is mentioned in this verse, possibly, to provide a dramatic conclusion to the entire revelation account: Moshe sets out for Egypt armed, as it were, with a token from God. This was the missing piece in his activity in Egypt."

The context is similar as well: the prophets stand frequently against the kings of Israel and Judah, arguing for an end to oppression. <b>my firstborn:</b> The use of this image is a statement of emotional force, not actual primacy of birth or antiquity, as Israel was a comparative latecomer in the ancient Near East."

"Torah, Exodus.5.86","25 <b>his:</b> Whose? Presumably those of Moshe, who is then “released” by God."
"Torah, Exodus.6.1","<i>Before Pharaoh</i> (5:1–6:1): Moshe and Aharon’s initial efforts to free the people—even temporarily for an act of worship—are unsuccessful, as foretold in the previous chapter. But even though God had predicted failure, we are still left with a portrait of clashing human wills: the liberators’, the king’s, and the reluctant people’s. The narrative appears to be a set-up for the second major revelation of God to Moshe (Chap. 6), which, preceded by expressions of doubt on both Moshe’s part and that of the people, harks back to the concerns voiced at the Burning Bush. There is also a forward-looking figure, Pharaoh, who is a prototype for other foreign rulers and enemies in the Bible who challenge God (Greenberg 1969)."
"Torah, Exodus.6.2","Chap. 5 contains the Bible’s most extended description of the conditions of Egyptian bondage. Not surprisingly, the root “serve” occurs seven times in vv.9 to 21 (Greenberg 1969), and sound variations on the Hebrew <i>ra’</i> (“ill/evil”) three times (vv.19–23)."

"Torah, Exodus.6.18",that he had seen their affliction.
"Torah, Exodus.6.19",And they bowed low and did homage.

"Torah, Exodus.6.31",lest he confront us with the pestilence or the sword!
"Torah, Exodus.6.32",4 The king of Egypt said to them:
"Torah, Exodus.6.33","For-what-reason, Moshe and Aharon,"
"Torah, Exodus.6.34",would you let the people loose from their tasks?
"Torah, Exodus.6.35",Go back to your burdens!
"Torah, Exodus.6.36",5 Pharaoh said:
"Torah, Exodus.6.37","Here, too many now are the people of the land,"
"Torah, Exodus.6.38",and you would have them cease from their burdens!
"Torah, Exodus.6.39","6 So that day Pharaoh commanded the slave-drivers of the people and its officers, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.6.40",7 You are no longer to give straw to the people to make the bricks as yesterday and the day-before;

"Torah, Exodus.6.55","12 The people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt,"

"Torah, Exodus.6.57","13 But the slave-drivers pressed them hard, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.6.58","Finish your tasks, each-day’s work-load in its day, as when there was straw!"
"Torah, Exodus.6.59","14 And the officers of the Children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s slave-drivers had set over them, were beaten,"
"Torah, Exodus.6.60",they said (to them):
"Torah, Exodus.6.61","For-what-reason have you not finished baking your allocation as yesterday and the day-before,"
"Torah, Exodus.6.62","so yesterday, so today?"
"Torah, Exodus.6.63","15 The officers of the Children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying:"

"Torah, Exodus.6.66","Here, your servants are being beaten, and the fault is your people’s!"
"Torah, Exodus.6.67",17 But he said:

"Torah, Exodus.6.73",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.6.74","26 <b>released him:</b> Or “relaxed (his hold upon) him.” <b>circumcision-cuttings:</b> Others, “on account of the circumcision,” “because of the circumcision,” “referring to the circumcision.”"
"Torah, Exodus.6.75","31 <b>The people trusted … :</b> For the first time in the Torah, Israel responds to God’s promises in a positive manner, something which will rarely happen again. The vocabulary and attitude form an <i>inclusio</i> (a bracket) with the end of the Liberation Narrative, 14:30–31 (cf. the verbs “trust” and “see”)."
"Torah, Exodus.6.76","5:1 <b>hold-a-festival:</b> Or “observe a pilgrimage-festival.” The Hebrew <i>hag</i> is still echoed in the great pilgrimage of Islam, the hajj, in which worshipers make (sometimes long) journeys to Mecca."
"Torah, Exodus.6.77","2 <b>Who is Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> This attitude recalls an earlier obstacle to the liberation process, “Who am I” of Moshe (3:11). <b>I do not know Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> Colloquially, “I care not a whit for Y<small>hwh</small>!” To Pharaoh’s pointed challenge, the entire narrative that follows is an answer (cf. 14:4, 18)."
"Torah, Exodus.6.78","3 <b>pray let us go:</b> A milder phrase than the earlier “Send free my people!” <b>three days’ journey:</b> Either the magical three again, or a standard biblical way of describing a journey (see Gen. 22:4). <b>lest he confront us:</b> In the ancient world the gods demanded sacrifices at specified times. “Confront” and “sword” also occur in VV.20–21, nicely balancing this section of narrative."
"Torah, Exodus.6.79","4 <b>For-what-reason:</b> Heb. <i>lamma,</i> as distinct from <i>maddu’a</i> (“why,” with similar meaning)."
"Torah, Exodus.6.80","5 <b>too many:</b> Echoing 1:9ff. (Fishbane 1979). <b>the people of the land:</b> This phrase occurs here in its wider usage, i.e., the common folk, as opposed to what is found in Gen. 23:7, where the term indicates the landed nobility."
"Torah, Exodus.6.81","6 <b>slave-drivers:</b> In several Semitic languages <i>nagos</i> denotes “pressing” or “overpowering” (Ullendorff), hence “driving” here."
"Torah, Exodus.6.82","9 <b>so that they pay:</b> Others, “Let them pay” (Greenberg 1969)."
"Torah, Exodus.6.83","10 <b>Thus says Pharaoh:</b> An ironic transformation of the prophetic formula noted in v.1 above, “the language of redemption turned sour” (Greenberg 1969)."

"Torah, Exodus.7.1",<i>The Promise Renewed</i> (6:2–13): Greenberg (1969) and others have noted how this section in many respects recapitulates God’s speeches at the Bush. Once again God assures Moshe that he has “heard” and “recalled” the Israelites and their old covenant; once again he promises to act (“bring out” resounds four times); once again the promise is linked to an interpretation of God’s name; and once again Moshe expresses doubt as to whether he will be believed or listened to (v.12).
"Torah, Exodus.7.2","Why the repetition? Perhaps here, as elsewhere, to double is to emphasize. Also, just as Moshe initially failed as a self-appointed liberator in Chap. 2, only to be sought out by God in the wilderness, he fails as a leader here as well, followed by God’s reassuring speech. There can be no question from whence the liberation comes."
"Torah, Exodus.7.3","19 The officers of the Children of Israel saw that they were in an ill-plight,"
"Torah, Exodus.7.4",having to say: Do not subtract from your bricks each-day’s workload in its day!

"Torah, Exodus.7.8","for having made our smell reek in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants,"
"Torah, Exodus.7.9","giving a sword into their hand, to kill us!"
"Torah, Exodus.7.10",22 Moshe returned to Y<small>hwh</small> and said:
"Torah, Exodus.7.11","My Lord,"
"Torah, Exodus.7.12",for-what-reason have you dealt so ill with this people?
"Torah, Exodus.7.13",For-what-reason have you sent me?
"Torah, Exodus.7.14","23 Since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has dealt only ill with this people,"
"Torah, Exodus.7.15",and rescued—you have not rescued your people!
"Torah, Exodus.7.16",6:1 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.7.17",Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh:
"Torah, Exodus.7.18","for with a strong hand he will send them free,"
"Torah, Exodus.7.19",and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.
"Torah, Exodus.7.20","2 God spoke to Moshe,"
"Torah, Exodus.7.21",he said to him:

"Torah, Exodus.7.23",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.7.24","19–21 <b>saw … see:</b> In these negative usages it is as if the earlier redemptive theme of God’s “seeing” has gone awry. But all is righted below, in 6:1 (“Now you will see …”)."
"Torah, Exodus.7.25","21 <b>having made our smell reek:</b> An expression meaning the causing of hatred or horror. <b>giving a sword into their hand:</b> This scenario often occurs historically with liberators; initial attempts fail or are rejected. Here we have a replay of Moshe’s earlier efforts (note the use of “judge” there as well, in 2:14). The tension in this chapter may be said to revolve around whether God’s sword (v.3) or Pharaoh’s will prevail."
"Torah, Exodus.7.26","22 <b>My Lord:</b> The Hebrew <i>Adonai</i> is used often in the Bible for pleading one’s case, as before a king (see Gen. 18:27, 30, 31, 32; 19:18, and Ex. 4:10)."
"Torah, Exodus.7.27","22–23 <b>this people … this people … your people:</b> Note Moshe’s brilliant use of psychology in dealing with God, similar to what he will do again in 32:11–13."
"Torah, Exodus.7.28",23 <b>to speak in your name:</b> The issue of God’s name will become paramount in the passage following.
"Torah, Exodus.7.29","6:1 <b>out of his land:</b> The phrase is also used in connection with “sending free” in 6:11, 7:2, and 11:10."
"Torah, Exodus.7.30","2 <b>I am Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> I am [name] is an authority formula in the ancient Near East (as in Gen. 41:44, where it refers to an earlier Pharaoh) (Greenberg 1969)."
"Torah, Exodus.8.1","<i>The Genealogy of Moshe and Aharon</i> (6:14–27): At this tension-filled moment in the narrative, in the face of Moshe’s self-doubt and the possible collapse of his mission, there is an unlikely break, at least by Western storytelling standards. Apparently the genealogy has been inserted to buttress Moshe and Aharon’s claim to represent the people before the Egyptian crown, and to stress their Levite ancestry (which solidly establishes them within the priestly class in Israel). Significantly, the genealogy of Yaakov’s sons ends with the third, Levi, and the rest of the list enumerates the Levite clans. More significantly, the ages mentioned are composed of patterned numbers such as 3, 7, 30, and 100. As in Genesis, this betokens a concept of order and meaning in history."
"Torah, Exodus.8.2","Thus legitimated, Moshe and Aharon can return to the task at hand. It would seem, then, that the passage is speaking to the Israelites, both in Egypt and in the audience of later generations."
"Torah, Exodus.8.3","3 I was seen by Avraham, by Yitzhak, and by Yaakov"
"Torah, Exodus.8.4","as God Shaddai,"
"Torah, Exodus.8.5",but (by) my name Y<small>hwh</small> I was not known to them.

"Torah, Exodus.8.79","8 <b>(over) which I lifted my hand … :</b> The promise of the land forms the backbone of the book of Genesis, which ends with it as well (Gen. 50:24)."
"Torah, Exodus.8.80","9 <b>shortness of spirit:</b> Others, “impatience” (so Ramban), “shortness of breath” (so Rashi). Also notable is Walzer’s suggestion of “dispiritedness.” A parallel Ugaritic phrase probably means “wretchedness.”"
"Torah, Exodus.8.81","12 <b>spoke before:</b> Appealed to (Orlinsky). <b>of foreskinned lips:</b> Either Moshe had some physical defect, as legend has it, or he is alluding to his difficulties as a public speaker (cf. 4:10). The use of “foreskinned” may express the biblical idea that things in their natural state require sanctifying, as can be seen with firstborn humans and animals, first-fruits, food, sexuality, etc."
"Torah, Exodus.8.82","14 <b>Fathers’ Houses:</b> Family units, listed according to the name of the ancestor. <b>sons:</b> Heb. <i>banim,</i> translated above as “children,” but here clearly referring to the males."
"Torah, Exodus.8.83","16 <b>seven and thirty and a hundred years:</b> Here, and in vv.18 and 20, the life spans of Moshe’s family members are composed of “perfect” numbers in combinations and multiples, as if to say that heroic biography as well as group history has a preordained meaning."
"Torah, Exodus.8.84",25 <b>Pin’has:</b> Trad. English “Phinehas.” He will play an important role in Num. 25:7 as a zealot for the new faith. The name is Egyptian in origin.
"Torah, Exodus.8.85","26 <b>by their forces:</b> The term has a military ring, and is used frequently in the Bible with that connotation."
"Torah, Exodus.9.1","<i>The Mission Renewed</i> (6:28–7:13): As preparation for the next meeting with Pharaoh, Moshe is once more reminded that the king will not listen to him. Taking a page from his speech at the Bush, God instructs Moshe and Aharon to use the “sign” that had previously served to convince the people: snake magic. Yet despite Aharon’s one-upping the Egyptian magicians in the warm-up for the plagues, Pharaoh remains unconvinced. This episode helps to prepare for what follows, and indeed contains a virtual glossary of Exodus words. Some of these are: “speak,” “send,” “harden,” “heart,” “sign/portent,” “hand,” “bring out,” “know,” “staff,” “hearken,” “midst.”"
"Torah, Exodus.9.2","28 So it was on the day that Y<small>hwh</small> spoke to Moshe in the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.9.3","29 Y<small>hwh</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.9.4",I am Y<small>hwh</small>;
"Torah, Exodus.9.5",speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you.
"Torah, Exodus.9.6",30 Moshe said before Y<small>hwh</small>:
"Torah, Exodus.9.7","If I am of foreskinned lips,"
"Torah, Exodus.9.8",how will Pharaoh hearken to me?
"Torah, Exodus.9.9",7:1 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.9.10","See, I will make you as a god for Pharaoh,"
"Torah, Exodus.9.11",and Aharon your brother will be your prophet.
"Torah, Exodus.9.12","2 You are to speak all that I command you,"
"Torah, Exodus.9.13",And Aharon your brother is to speak to Pharaoh
"Torah, Exodus.9.14",so that he may send free the Children of Israel from his land.
"Torah, Exodus.9.15","3 But I,"
"Torah, Exodus.9.16","I will harden Pharaoh’s heart,"
"Torah, Exodus.9.17",I will make my signs and my portents many in the land of Egypt:
"Torah, Exodus.9.18","4 Pharaoh will not hearken to you,"
"Torah, Exodus.9.19","so I will set my hand against Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.9.20","and I will bring out my forces,"
"Torah, Exodus.9.21","my people, the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Exodus.9.22","from the land of Egypt, with great (acts of) judgment;"
"Torah, Exodus.9.23","5 the Egyptians will know that I am Y<small>hwh</small>,"
"Torah, Exodus.9.24",when I stretch out my hand over Egypt and bring the Children of Israel out from their midst.
"Torah, Exodus.9.25",6 Moshe and Aharon did
"Torah, Exodus.9.26","as Y<small>hwh</small> had commanded them, thus they did."
"Torah, Exodus.9.27","7 Now Moshe was eighty years old, and Aharon was eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh."
"Torah, Exodus.9.28",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.9.29","7:1 <b>as a god:</b> Or oracle, as mentioned in the note to 4:16."
"Torah, Exodus.9.30","5 <b>when I stretch out my hand:</b> In the Plague Narrative, Moshe and Aharon will do the actual stretching out of hands (see 7:19, 8:1, 12; 9:22; 10:12, 21; and the climactic passage in 14:16, 26)."
"Torah, Exodus.9.31","6 <b>Moshe and Aharon did/ as Y<small>hwh</small> had commanded them, thus they did:</b> This construction can be broken up in two ways (with, for instance, the break at “them”), a syntactical usage found fairly frequently in biblical texts (cf. 39:43). The wording recalls the Flood Narrative in Genesis, with the same emphasis: the hero obeys God without question."
"Torah, Exodus.9.32","7 <b>eighty … eighty-three:</b> Another set of “perfect” numbers, this time using forty (and three) as the base. It occurs here due to the biblical practice of mentioning age to “mark … a milestone in life’s journey” (Greenberg 1969)."
"Torah, Exodus.10.1","<i>First Blow</i> (7:14–25): The first plague uses elements and words common to many subsequent plagues; in addition to those just mentioned, it introduces “refuse” and “reek” and “throughout all the land of Egypt.” More important is the choice of site and object for the curse: the Nile (a god in Egypt), water (source of life for the Egyptians but earlier source of death for the Hebrew babies), and blood (sign of life and death). No more effective choice could have been made for this first demonstration of the far-reaching power of the Israelite God."
"Torah, Exodus.10.2","As with the first six plagues, the threat is long and the actual carrying-out brief. Note the relationship, at the end of the episode, between the uncaring Pharaoh and his own people, who have to scratch for water."
"Torah, Exodus.10.3","8 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.10.4","9 When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying: Give, you, a portent,"
"Torah, Exodus.10.5",then say to Aharon:
"Torah, Exodus.10.6",Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh: Let it become a serpent.
"Torah, Exodus.10.7","10 Moshe and Aharon came to Pharaoh,"
"Torah, Exodus.10.8","they did thus, as Y<small>hwh</small> had commanded,"
"Torah, Exodus.10.9","Aharon threw down his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent."
"Torah, Exodus.10.10","11 Pharaoh too called for the wise men and for the sorcerers,"
"Torah, Exodus.10.11","that they too, the magicians of Egypt, should do thus with their occult-arts,"
"Torah, Exodus.10.12","12 they threw down, each-man, his staff, and these became serpents."
"Torah, Exodus.10.13",But Aharon’s staff swallowed up their staffs.
"Torah, Exodus.10.14","13 Yet Pharaoh’s heart remained strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,"
"Torah, Exodus.10.15",as Y<small>hwh</small> had spoken.
"Torah, Exodus.10.16",14 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.10.17",Pharaoh’s heart is heavy-with-stubbornness—he refuses to send the people free.
"Torah, Exodus.10.18","15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning, here, he goes out to the Nile,"
"Torah, Exodus.10.19","station yourself to meet him by the shore of the Nile,"
"Torah, Exodus.10.20","and the staff that changed into a snake, take in your hand,"
"Torah, Exodus.10.21",16 and say to him:
"Torah, Exodus.10.22","Y<small>hwh</small>, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.10.23","Send free my people, that they may serve me in the wilderness!"
"Torah, Exodus.10.24","But here, you have not hearkened thus far."
"Torah, Exodus.10.25",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.10.26","9 <b>Give, you, a portent:</b> That is, “Prove yourselves by working a miracle” (Hyatt). <b>your staff:</b> It is not clear whether the staff is the aforementioned one of Moshe, or part of another tradition, connected to Aharon. <b>serpent:</b> Heb. <i>tanin,</i> a word indicating a reptile, with possible mythological overtones (as in “dragon”)."
"Torah, Exodus.10.27","11 <b>occult arts:</b> Whereas Aharon needs none, since God performs the miracle (Greenberg 1969)."
"Torah, Exodus.10.28",12 <b>swallowed up:</b> Leaving no doubt as to whether optical illusion or sleight of hand is involved.
"Torah, Exodus.10.29","14 <b>heavy-with-stubbomness:</b> In the Plague Narrative, the root <i>kaved,</i> “heavy,” occurs ten times—five times referring to Pharaoh’s heart and five referring to the plagues themselves. The latter are perhaps seen as the direct outcome of the former."
"Torah, Exodus.10.30","15 <b>he goes out to the Nile:</b> Many interpretations have been proposed for this action, which must have had some significance for the biblical narrator. It remains unclear whether Pharaoh is involved in a religious rite or a function of state. More charming is the suggestion by Rashi, the medieval Hebrew commentator, that Pharaoh went secretly to the river in order to relieve himself—so that the Egyptians would not see him as less than a god."
"Torah, Exodus.11.1","<i>Second Blow</i> (7:26–8:11) The second plague is linked to the first by a number of elements: the Nile, the magicians, and of course, Pharaoh’s disregard of the threats after it is all over. It is also a full narrative, containing most of the formal aspects of the plagues within itself (see “The Plague Narrative,” above)."
"Torah, Exodus.11.2","The threat of this plague breaks into poetry in a striking passage (v.28) which uses repeating prepositions. The frogs are literally everywhere. Also, for the first time Pharaoh asks that God be entreated—that is, he finally acknowledges his existence (as against which, see 5:2)."
"Torah, Exodus.11.3",17 Thus says Y<small>hwh</small>:
"Torah, Exodus.11.4",By this shall you know that I am Y<small>hwh</small>:
"Torah, Exodus.11.5","here, I will strike—with the staff that is in my hand—upon the water that is in the Nile,"
"Torah, Exodus.11.6",and it will change into blood.
"Torah, Exodus.11.7","18 The fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will reek,"
"Torah, Exodus.11.8",and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the Nile.
"Torah, Exodus.11.9",19 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.11.10",Say to Aharon:
"Torah, Exodus.11.11",Take your staff
"Torah, Exodus.11.12","and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.11.13","over their tributaries, over their Nile-canals, over their ponds"
"Torah, Exodus.11.14","and over all their bodies of water,"
"Torah, Exodus.11.15",and let them become blood!
"Torah, Exodus.11.16","There will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt—in the wooden-containers, in the stoneware."
"Torah, Exodus.11.17","20 Moshe and Aharon did thus, as Y<small>hwh</small> had commanded them."
"Torah, Exodus.11.18","He raised the staff and struck the water in the Nile, before the eyes of Pharaoh and before the eyes of his servants,"
"Torah, Exodus.11.19",and all the water that was in the Nile changed into blood.
"Torah, Exodus.11.20","21 The fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile reeked,"
"Torah, Exodus.11.21",and the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile;
"Torah, Exodus.11.22",the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Exodus.11.23","22 But the magicians of Egypt did thus with their occult-arts,"
"Torah, Exodus.11.24","and Pharaoh’s heart remained strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,"
"Torah, Exodus.11.25",as Y<small>hwh</small> had spoken.
"Torah, Exodus.11.26","23 So Pharaoh turned and came into his house, neither did he pay any mind to this."
"Torah, Exodus.11.27",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.11.28","17 <b>change:</b> Continuing the theme of transformation found in the scene with the snake. Overall, of course, the change from slavery to liberation and to responsible society is a major theme in Exodus."
"Torah, Exodus.11.29","19 <b>wooden-containers … stoneware:</b> It is unclear what is meant. The context seems to suggest “even in their kitchen utensils,” reflected in the present translation. On the other hand, virtually everywhere in the Bible that “wood and stone” occur as a pair in the singular, they refer to idols; Cassuto speaks of the Egyptians’ bathing their idols and thus sees the passage as another example of Exodus’s denigrating Egyptian religion."
"Torah, Exodus.11.30",20 <b>He raised the staff:</b> “He” refers to Aharon. <b>struck:</b> The first “stroke”—that is the Hebrew term (<i>makka</i>) used for what we know in English as a “plague.”
"Torah, Exodus.11.31","21 <b>throughout all the land of Egypt:</b> One of the refrains used in this section of the book (see “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” p. 241)."
"Torah, Exodus.12.1","<i>Third Blow</i> (8:12–15): With the third plague, the curse becomes more intimate, affecting the bodies of all living creatures in Egypt (cf. the refrain in vv.13–14, “on man and on beast”). The narrative uses the briefest plague formula here, without introduction or warning to Pharaoh. Yet it results in an Egyptian effort to end the siege, as the magicians term the plague “the finger of a god” (v.15)."
"Torah, Exodus.12.2","<i>Fourth Blow</i> (8:16–28): Despite its similarity to the previous plague (insects), number four introduces a new and important element into the tale: the idea that God makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. It also involves protracted bargaining between Moshe and Pharaoh over the issue of allowing the Israelites to worship God."
"Torah, Exodus.12.3","24 But all Egypt had to dig around the Nile to drink water,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.4",for they could not drink from the waters of the Nile.
"Torah, Exodus.12.5","25 Seven days were fulfilled, after Y<small>hwh</small> had struck the Nile."
"Torah, Exodus.12.6",26 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.12.7",Come to Pharaoh and say to him:
"Torah, Exodus.12.8",Thus says Y<small>hwh</small>:
"Torah, Exodus.12.9","Send free my people, that they may serve me!"
"Torah, Exodus.12.10","27 Now if you refuse to send them free,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.11","here, I will smite your entire territory with frogs."
"Torah, Exodus.12.12",28 The Nile will swarm with frogs;
"Torah, Exodus.12.13","they will ascend, they will come"
"Torah, Exodus.12.14","into your house, into your bedroom, upon your couch,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.15","into your servants’ houses, in among your people,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.16",into your ovens and into your dough-pans;
"Torah, Exodus.12.17","29 onto you, onto your people, onto all your servants will the frogs ascend!"
"Torah, Exodus.12.18",8:1 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.12.19",Say to Aharon:
"Torah, Exodus.12.20","Stretch out your hand with your staff, over the tributaries, over the Nile-canals, and over the ponds,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.21",make the frogs ascend upon the land of Egypt!
"Torah, Exodus.12.22","2 Aharon stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.23",the frog-horde ascended
"Torah, Exodus.12.24",and covered the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Exodus.12.25",3 Now the magicians did thus with their occult-arts—
"Torah, Exodus.12.26",they made frogs ascend upon the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Exodus.12.27",4 Pharaoh had Moshe and Aharon called
"Torah, Exodus.12.28",and said:
"Torah, Exodus.12.29","Plead with Y<small>hwh</small>, that he may remove the frogs from me and from my people,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.30","and I will send the people free, that they may slaughter (offerings) to Y<small>hwh</small>!"
"Torah, Exodus.12.31",5 Moshe said to Pharaoh:
"Torah, Exodus.12.32",Be praised over me:
"Torah, Exodus.12.33","For when shall I plead for you, for your servants, for your people,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.34","to cut off the frogs from you and from your houses,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.35",(so that) only in the Nile will they remain?
"Torah, Exodus.12.36",6 He said:
"Torah, Exodus.12.37",For the morrow.
"Torah, Exodus.12.38",He said:
"Torah, Exodus.12.39","According to your words, (then)!"
"Torah, Exodus.12.40",In order that you may know
"Torah, Exodus.12.41",that there is none like Y<small>hwh</small> our God.
"Torah, Exodus.12.42","7 The frogs shall remove from you, from your houses, from your servants, from your people,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.43",—only in the Nile shall they remain.
"Torah, Exodus.12.44","8 Moshe and Aharon went out from Pharaoh,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.45",Moshe cried out to Y<small>hwh</small>
"Torah, Exodus.12.46",on account of the frogs that he had imposed upon Pharaoh.
"Torah, Exodus.12.47",9 And Y<small>hwh</small> did according to Moshe’s words:
"Torah, Exodus.12.48","the frogs died away, from the houses, from the courtyards, and from the fields."
"Torah, Exodus.12.49","10 They piled them up, heaps upon heaps, and the land reeked."
"Torah, Exodus.12.50","11 But when Pharaoh saw that there was breathing-room,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.51","he made his heart heavy-with-stubbornness, and did not hearken to them,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.52",as Y<small>hwh</small> had spoken.
"Torah, Exodus.12.53",12 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.12.54",Say to Aharon:
"Torah, Exodus.12.55","Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the land,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.56",it will become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt!
"Torah, Exodus.12.57","13 They did thus,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.58","Aharon stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the ground,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.59",and gnats were on man and on beast;
"Torah, Exodus.12.60",all the dust of the ground became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Exodus.12.61","14 Now the magicians did thus with their occult-arts, to bring forth the gnats, but they could not,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.62",the gnats were on man and on beast.
"Torah, Exodus.12.63",15 The magicians said to Pharaoh:
"Torah, Exodus.12.64",This is the finger of a god!
"Torah, Exodus.12.65","But Pharaoh’s heart remained strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.66",as Y<small>hwh</small> had spoken.
"Torah, Exodus.12.67",16 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.12.68","Start-early in the morning, station yourself before Pharaoh—here, he goes out to the water,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.69",and say to him:
"Torah, Exodus.12.70",Thus says Y<small>hwh</small>:
"Torah, Exodus.12.71","Send free my people, that they may serve me!"
"Torah, Exodus.12.72","17 Indeed, if you do not send my people free,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.73","here, I will send upon you, upon your servants, upon your people, upon your houses—"
"Torah, Exodus.12.74","insects,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.75","the houses of Egypt will be full of the insects,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.76",as well as the ground upon which they are!
"Torah, Exodus.12.77","18 But I will make distinct, on that day, the region of Goshen, where my people is situated,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.78","so that there will be no insects there,"
"Torah, Exodus.12.79",in order that you may know that I am Y<small>hwh</small> in the land;
"Torah, Exodus.12.80",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.12.81","25 <b>Y<small>hwh</small> had struck the Nile:</b> Even though Aharon did the “striking,” it becomes clear here that the brothers are only agents."
"Torah, Exodus.12.82","27 <b>frogs:</b> A symbol of fertility in Egyptian culture (the goddess Heket), and so the plague might be regarded as an assault on the Egyptian gods again (Cassuto). There may also be an ironic hint here of the “swarming” of the Israelites in 1:7."
"Torah, Exodus.12.83","28 <b>ovens:</b> A place which, because of its dryness, would be most unlikely to harbor them (Childs)."
"Torah, Exodus.12.84",8:2 <b>frog-horde:</b> The Hebrew uses a collective singular here (likewise with “insects” in 8:17ff. and “locusts” in 10:4ff.); all other “frogs” in this plague receive the standard plural.
"Torah, Exodus.12.85","3 <b>the magicians did thus:</b> The theme of Israel’s distinctiveness, so prominent in these stories, is delayed. Here the magicians can do the same tricks as their Hebrew counterparts, although, as noted above, they require the aid of “occult-arts.”"
"Torah, Exodus.12.86","5 <b>Be praised over me:</b> Others, “Have the advantage over me.” The sense is that Pharaoh will be allowed to choose the precise time of the frogs’ removal."
"Torah, Exodus.12.87","6 <b>In order that you may know:</b> The intent of Moshe’s words in v.5 is now revealed: precise timing, even when chosen at will, demonstrates God’s total power."
"Torah, Exodus.12.88",9 <b>from the houses … :</b> The threefold repetition of “from” paints a vivid picture of the end of this plague. The dead frogs recede like water drying up.
"Torah, Exodus.12.89","12 <b>gnats:</b> Other translations vary here. There are many traditions, but it seems clear that some kind of small insect is indicated (Hyatt)."
"Torah, Exodus.12.90","15 <b>the finger of a god:</b> That is, God’s direct intervention in human affairs. The only other occurrence of this expression is in Exodus (31:18) and in the text that retells that story, Deut. 9:10. In the latter cases it refers to the divine writing on the two tablets of Testimony."
"Torah, Exodus.12.91","17 <b>upon you … :</b> Similar to the refrain of 7:28–29, with regard to the frogs; here, “upon” occurs four times in one line. <b>insects:</b> As in the last plague, there are many opinions as to what these were (e.g., gnats, gadflies, mosquitos); Bekhor Shor understands the “mixture” (the literal meaning of the Hebrew term used here, <i>’arov</i>) as one of wild animals."
"Torah, Exodus.12.92","18 <b>region:</b> Lit. “land” (see Gen. 45:10). <b>in the land:</b> That is, as an active force."
"Torah, Exodus.13.1","<i>Fifth Blow</i> (9:1–7): Although this plague spares humans, it is nevertheless described as “heavy” (v.3). The narrative uses a play-on-words as well: the Hebrew for pestilence (<i>dever</i>) echoes that for thing (<i>davar</i>)."
"Torah, Exodus.13.2","<i>Sixth Blow</i> (9:8–12): Just as in the previous “short” plague, number 3, the magicians come to the fore. No longer do they cry to Pharaoh; they cannot even take the stage!"
"Torah, Exodus.13.3","<i>Seventh Blow</i> (9:13–35): Long like its corresponding predecessors (numbers 1 and 4), the seventh plague prefaces its occurrence with an emphatic introduction by God, and its warning gives God-fearing Egyptians a chance to save themselves (vv.19–21), something new. The description of the plague itself is fraught with spectacle, presaging Sinai with its use of thunder and fire. There is also the ominous note, twice in the text (vv.18, 24), that such a plague was unique in Egyptian annals. The plagues, at least for the Egyptians, now transcend the realms of normal, explainable experience, as well as of historical recollection."
"Torah, Exodus.13.4",19 I will put a ransom between my people and your people—
"Torah, Exodus.13.5",on the morrow will this sign occur.
"Torah, Exodus.13.6","20 Y<small>hwh</small> did thus,"

"Torah, Exodus.13.12",22 Moshe said:
"Torah, Exodus.13.13",It would not be wise to do thuswise:

"Torah, Exodus.13.24",25 Moshe said:
"Torah, Exodus.13.25","Here, when I go out from you, I will plead with Y<small>hwh</small>,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.26","and the insects will remove from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, on the morrow,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.27","only: let not Pharaoh continue to trifle (with us),"
"Torah, Exodus.13.28",by not sending the people free to slaughter (offerings) to Y<small>hwh</small>!
"Torah, Exodus.13.29",26 Moshe went out from before Pharaoh and pleaded with Y<small>hwh</small>.
"Torah, Exodus.13.30","27 And Y<small>hwh</small> did according to Moshe’s words,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.31","he removed the insects from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.32",not one remained.
"Torah, Exodus.13.33","28 But Pharaoh made his heart heavy-with-stubbornness this time as well,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.34",and he did not send the people free.
"Torah, Exodus.13.35",9:1 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.13.36",Come to Pharaoh and speak to him:
"Torah, Exodus.13.37","Thus says Y<small>hwh</small>, the God of the Hebrews:"
"Torah, Exodus.13.38","Send free my people, that they may serve me!"
"Torah, Exodus.13.39","2 If you refuse to send (them) free, and continue to hold-on-strongly to them,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.40","3 here, Y<small>hwh</small>’s hand will be on your livestock in the field,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.41","on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the oxen, (and) on the sheep—"
"Torah, Exodus.13.42",an exceedingly heavy pestilence!
"Torah, Exodus.13.43",4 And Y<small>hwh</small> will make-a-distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt:
"Torah, Exodus.13.44",there will not die among all that belong to the Children of Israel a thing!
"Torah, Exodus.13.45","5 Y<small>hwh</small> set an appointed-time, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.13.46","On the morrow, Y<small>hwh</small> will do this thing in the land."
"Torah, Exodus.13.47",6 Y<small>hwh</small> did that thing on the morrow—
"Torah, Exodus.13.48","all the livestock of Egypt died,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.49","but of the livestock of the Children of Israel, there died not one."
"Torah, Exodus.13.50","7 Pharaoh sent to inquire, and here: there had not died of the livestock of the Children of Israel even one."
"Torah, Exodus.13.51","But Pharaoh’s heart remained heavy-with-stubbornness, and he did not send the people free."
"Torah, Exodus.13.52",8 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe and to Aharon:
"Torah, Exodus.13.53",Take yourselves fistfuls of soot from a furnace
"Torah, Exodus.13.54","and let Moshe toss it heavenward before Pharaoh’s eyes,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.55","9 it will become fine-dust on all the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.56","and on man and on beast, it will become boils sprouting into blisters,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.57",throughout all the land of Egypt!
"Torah, Exodus.13.58","10 They took the soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moshe tossed it heavenward,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.59","and it became boil-blisters, sprouting on man and on beast."
"Torah, Exodus.13.60","11 Now the magicians could not stand before Moshe because of the boils,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.61",for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all Egypt.
"Torah, Exodus.13.62","12 But Y<small>hwh</small> made Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.63",as Y<small>hwh</small> had said to Moshe.
"Torah, Exodus.13.64",13 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.13.65","Start-early in the morning, station yourself before Pharaoh and say to him:"
"Torah, Exodus.13.66","Thus says Y<small>hwh</small>, the God of the Hebrews:"
"Torah, Exodus.13.67","Send free my people, that they may serve me!"
"Torah, Exodus.13.68","14 Indeed, this time I will send all my blows upon your heart, and against your servants, and against your people,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.69",so that you may know that there is none like me throughout all the land;
"Torah, Exodus.13.70","15 indeed, by now I could have sent out my hand and struck you and your people with the pestilence,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.71",and you would have vanished from the land;
"Torah, Exodus.13.72","16 however, just on account of this I have allowed you to withstand,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.73",to make you see my power.
"Torah, Exodus.13.74",and in order that they might recount my name throughout all the land.
"Torah, Exodus.13.75","17 (But) still you set yourself up over my people, by not sending them free—"
"Torah, Exodus.13.76","18 here, around this time tomorrow I will cause to rain down an exceedingly heavy hail,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.77",the like of which has never been in Egypt from the days of its founding until now!
"Torah, Exodus.13.78",19 So now:
"Torah, Exodus.13.79",send (word): give refuge to your livestock and to all that is yours in the field;
"Torah, Exodus.13.80",all men and beasts who are found in the field and who have not been gathered into the house—
"Torah, Exodus.13.81","the hail will come down upon them, and they will die!"
"Torah, Exodus.13.82","20 Whoever had awe for the word of Y<small>hwh</small> among Pharaoh’s servants had his servants and his livestock flee into the houses,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.83",21 but whoever did not pay any mind to the word of Y<small>hwh</small> left his servants and his livestock out in the field.
"Torah, Exodus.13.84",22 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.13.85",Stretch out your hand over the heavens:
"Torah, Exodus.13.86","Let there be hail throughout all the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.87","on man and on beast and on all the plants of the field, throughout the land of Egypt!"
"Torah, Exodus.13.88","23 Moshe stretched out his staff over the heavens,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.89","and Y<small>hwh</small> gave forth thunder-sounds and hail, and fire went toward the earth,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.90",and Y<small>hwh</small> caused hail to rain down upon the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Exodus.13.91","24 There was hail and a fire taking-hold-of-itself amidst the hail, exceedingly heavy,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.92",the like of which had never been throughout all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
"Torah, Exodus.13.93","25 The hail struck, throughout all the land of Egypt, all that was in the field, from man to beast;"
"Torah, Exodus.13.94","all the plants of the field the hail struck, and all the trees of the field it broke down;"
"Torah, Exodus.13.95","26 only in the region of Goshen, where the Children of Israel were, was there no hail."
"Torah, Exodus.13.96",27 Pharaoh sent and had Moshe and Aharon called
"Torah, Exodus.13.97",and said to them:
"Torah, Exodus.13.98",This-time I have sinned!
"Torah, Exodus.13.99","Y<small>hwh</small> is the one-in-the-right, I and my people are the ones-in-the-wrong!"

"Torah, Exodus.13.101",For enough is the God-thunder and this hail!
"Torah, Exodus.13.102",Let me send you free—do not continue staying here!
"Torah, Exodus.13.103",29 Moshe said to him:
"Torah, Exodus.13.104","As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to Y<small>hwh</small>,"
"Torah, Exodus.13.105",the thunder will stop and the hail will be no more—
"Torah, Exodus.13.106",in order that you may know that the land belongs to Y<small>hwh</small>.

Here the last two plagues are anticipated (v.15, “the ground became dark”; and v.17, “this death”), and the previous one is echoed (vv.6, 14, with the reference to past history).

"Torah, Exodus.14.61","nothing at all green was left of the trees and of the plants of the field, throughout all the land of Egypt."
"Torah, Exodus.14.62",16 Quickly Pharaoh had Moshe and Aharon called

"Torah, Exodus.15.1","<i>The Final Warning</i> (11:1–10): What seems to be the introduction to the last plague is made up of motifs common to several of the previous ones. It also reintroduces the idea of despoiling the Egyptians, which had been mentioned in Moshe’s original commission (3:21–22)—so we know that redemption is at hand. Artfully, the specification of what “one more blow” is, is delayed until v.5. In addition, there is the motif of Moshe’s greatness/fame among the Egyptians, which would appear to be a suppressed remnant of the story (in the face of the desire to glorify God as the hero). The section ends (vv.9–10) with a summary of the entire Plague Narrative—or at least of what is to be learned from it."
"Torah, Exodus.15.2","22 Moshe stretched out his hand over the heavens,"
"Torah, Exodus.15.3","and there was gloomy darkness throughout all the land of Egypt, for three days,"

"Torah, Exodus.15.8","only your sheep and your oxen shall be kept back,"
"Torah, Exodus.15.9",even your little-ones may go with you!

Despite the finality of the language here, the confrontation between Moshe and Pharaoh continues in 11:4–8 and 12:31–32."
"Torah, Exodus.16.1","<i>The Tenth Blow in Its Context:</i> With Chap. 12 the narrative leaves the realm of story telling and enters that of ritual. What has so far been recounted as a story now takes on the aspect of commemorative ceremony. Instead of proceeding from warning (11:1, 4–8) to plague (12:29–30), the tenth plague account has been embedded in a setting of the lengthy description of a festival, thus shifting the time sense of the narrative. The enactment of the ceremony is important both for the characters in the story and for the participants in the audience of later generations. Likewise, the description of the actual leaving of Egypt is followed, not by a detailing of the route or what happened next, but by a series of regulations concerning who may eat the Passover meal (12:43–51) and by rules concerning the dedication of the firstborn (13:1–16)."
"Torah, Exodus.16.2","By means of such editing, the final text was obviously meant to move the Exodus story, with all its historical aspects, into what historians of religion call “mythical time.” In our text, history becomes present event; the hearer is no longer “in the audience” but actually acts out the story. That immediacy is meant is demonstrated by the threefold occurrence of the phrase “on this/that same day” (12:17, 41, 51), which also serves to unite the various parts of the text around the tenth plague and the exodus."
"Torah, Exodus.16.3","The mixture of law and narrative that we find in Chaps. 12 and 13 sets the stage for the Sinai scenes that will take place later in the book (Chaps. 19ff.), and indeed for the rest of the Pentateuch."
"Torah, Exodus.16.4","<i>The Passover Ritual</i> (12:1–28): The festival depicted in this chapter is, in the opinion of many scholars, a combination of two ancient holy days: a shepherds’ festival, in which each spring a lamb was sacrificed to the deity in gratitude and for protection of the flock, and a celebration of the barley harvest, at which time all leaven/fermentation products were avoided (although see Ginsberg, who theorizes a shepherds’ festival with <i>matza</i>). Each has numerous parallels in other cultures (see Gaster 1949). What has apparently happened here is that the two days have been fused together and imbued with historical meaning. In addition, rites that were originally protective in function have been reinterpreted in the light of the Exodus story. But whatever its origin, Passover as described in our text bespeaks a strong sense of Israelite tribal community and of distinctiveness. And it is distinctiveness, which played such an important role in Israelite religion, that is singled out here, with the striking penalty for transgressing the boundaries of the festival—being “cut off” (probably death). One also notes the repetition of the phrase “a law for the ages” (vv.14, 17, 24). Passover, then, is central both to the Exodus story and to Israelite ideas as a whole (see Sarna 1986 for a detailed discussion)."

"Torah, Exodus.16.111","3 <b>entire community of Israel:</b> This term, “community” (Heb. <i>’eda</i>), is used somewhat interchangeably with a host of others in the Torah to indicate the leadership (often, the elders) of the people (Weinfeld 1972a). <b>tenth:</b> There is a parallel important day in the fall, on the tenth day of the seventh month—Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement (see Lev. 16:29). <b>Fathers’ House:</b> See the note to 6:14."

"Torah, Exodus.18.1","<i>Who May Make Passover</i> (12:43–50): Continuing the immediacy of ritual, the narrative pauses where one would expect it to talk about the Israelites’ route, to specify carefully that partaking of the Passover meal, and indeed being a part of the community in general, requires circumcision on the part of the participant. In essence, it creates the new Israelite nation, on the heels of common participation in a historical event. This small passage has been inserted between two occurrences of the same phrase (“that same day”), an editorial device often used in biblical literature."

"Torah, Exodus.19.1","<i>Passover and the Firstborn</i> (12:51–13:16): To close out the text’s celebration of the exodus event, the editor includes a peroration on the firstborn. This too is a reinterpretation of earlier religious practices. Many ancient cultures selected the firstborn as an object for sacrifice to the gods—whether firstborn of fruit, of animals, or of human beings—the grounds for this being that the firstborn represents the best that nature has to offer (see Gen. 49:3, where Jacob’s firstborn is “beginning of my strength”). The idea of strength is played upon in the reinterpretation of sacrifice: four times, including at the end of the passage, we are told that the firstborn is to be consecrated, “for by strength of hand Y<small>hwh</small> brought you out of Egypt” (vv.3, 9, 14, 16)."
"Torah, Exodus.19.2","The chapter has a few notable characteristics. For one, the eating of <i>matzot</i> has been integrated into the firstborn material; for another, the language is unmistakably reminiscent of Deuteronomy (vv.5 and 11, “it shall be [a refrain here]/when Y<small>hwh</small> brings you to the land of the Canaanite …”; see Deut. 6:10, 7:1, etc.). This has led some scholars to point to a relatively late date for the material, supporting the idea that Israel in its sixth-century <small>b.c.e.</small> exile in Babylonia looked back to recast the past in its own image. At any rate, memory is clearly important here, with two passages stressing the continuity of commemoration through the following generations (vv.8–10 and 14–16)."
"Torah, Exodus.19.3",40 And the settlement of the Children of Israel which they had settled in Egypt was thirty years and four hundred years.

"Torah, Exodus.19.10","a keeping-watch of all the Children of Israel, throughout their generations."
"Torah, Exodus.19.11",43 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe and Aharon:
"Torah, Exodus.19.12",This is the law of the Passover-meal:
"Torah, Exodus.19.13",Any foreign son is not to eat of it.
"Torah, Exodus.19.14","44 But any man’s serf who is acquired by money—if you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it."
"Torah, Exodus.19.15",45 Settler and hired-hand are not to eat of it.
"Torah, Exodus.19.16","46 In one house it is to be eaten,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.17","you are not to bring out of the house any of the flesh, outside."
"Torah, Exodus.19.18",And you are not to break a bone of it.
"Torah, Exodus.19.19",47 The entire community of Israel is to do it.
"Torah, Exodus.19.20","48 Now when a sojourner sojourns with you, and would make the Passover-meal to Y<small>hwh</small>,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.21","every male with him must be circumcised, then he may come-near to make it, and will be (regarded) as a native of the land."
"Torah, Exodus.19.22",But any foreskinned-man is not to eat of it.
"Torah, Exodus.19.23",49 One Instruction shall there be for the native and for the sojourner that sojourns in your midst.
"Torah, Exodus.19.24",50 All the Children of Israel did
"Torah, Exodus.19.25","as Y<small>hwh</small> commanded Moshe and Aharon, thus they did."
"Torah, Exodus.19.26","51 It was on that same day,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.27","(when) Y<small>hwh</small> brought the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their forces,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.28","13:1 Y<small>hwh</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.19.29","2 Hallow to me every firstborn,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.30","breacher of every womb among the Children of Israel, of man or of beast,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.31",it is mine.
"Torah, Exodus.19.32",3 Moshe said to the people:
"Torah, Exodus.19.33","Remember this day,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.34","on which you went out from Egypt, from a house of serfs,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.35",for by strength of hand Y<small>hwh</small> brought you out from here:
"Torah, Exodus.19.36",no fermentation is to be eaten.
"Torah, Exodus.19.37","4 Today you are going out, in the New-Moon of Ripe-Grain."
"Torah, Exodus.19.38","5 And it shall be,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.39","when Y<small>hwh</small> brings you to the land of the Canaanite,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.40","of the Hittite, of the Amorite, of the Hivvite and of the Yevusite,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.41","which he swore to your fathers to give you,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.42","a land flowing with milk and honey,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.43","you are to serve this service, in this New-Moon:"
"Torah, Exodus.19.44","6 For seven days you are to eat <i>matzot,</i>"
"Torah, Exodus.19.45",and on the seventh day (there is): a pilgrimage-festival to Y<small>hwh</small>.
"Torah, Exodus.19.46","7 <i>Matzot</i> are to be eaten for the seven days,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.47","nothing fermented is to be seen with you, no leaven is to be seen with you, throughout all your territory."
"Torah, Exodus.19.48","8 And you are to tell your child on that day, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.19.49","It is because of what Y<small>hwh</small> did for me, when I went out of Egypt."
"Torah, Exodus.19.50","9 It shall be for you for a sign on your hand and for a reminder between your eyes,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.51","in order that Y<small>hwh</small>’s Instruction may be in your mouth,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.52",that by a strong hand did Y<small>hwh</small> bring you out of Egypt.
"Torah, Exodus.19.53",10 You are to keep this law at its appointed-time from year-day to year-day!
"Torah, Exodus.19.54","11 It shall be,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.55","when Y<small>hwh</small> brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.56","and gives it to you,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.57","12 you are to transfer every breacher of a womb to Y<small>hwh</small>, every breacher, offspring of a beast that belongs to you,"
"Torah, Exodus.19.58",the males (are) for Y<small>hwh</small>.
"Torah, Exodus.19.59",13 Every breacher of a donkey you are to redeem with a lamb;
"Torah, Exodus.19.60","if you do not redeem (it), you are to break-its-neck."
"Torah, Exodus.19.61","And every firstborn of men, among your sons, you are to redeem."

"Torah, Exodus.19.63","when your child asks you on the morrow, saying: What does this mean?"
"Torah, Exodus.19.64",You are to say to him:
"Torah, Exodus.19.65","By strength of hand Y<small>hwh</small> brought us out of Egypt, out of a house of serfs."
"Torah, Exodus.19.66",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.19.67","40 <b>thirty years and four hundred years:</b> The numbers are patterned as usual; although this total disagrees with Gen. 15:13, for instance (which reckons it as 400 years), the differences seem to be more over which patterned numbers to use and not historical exactitude."
"Torah, Exodus.19.68","41 <b>Y<small>hwh</small>’s forces:</b> A term with clear military flavor; later in the Bible, Israel becomes the “armed forces of <b>Y<small>hwh</small>”</b> (the same Hebrew term)."
"Torah, Exodus.19.69","42 <b>keeping-watch:</b> Reflecting the play on words in the Hebrew <i>shamor,</i> by including ideas of both “guarding” and “observing.” Cassuto (1967) sees <i>shamor</i> as a shepherd’s term, appropriate here. Note again, in the tense structure, the conflation of narrative and contemporary ritual."
"Torah, Exodus.19.70","43 <b>foreign son:</b> Or “foreigner.” The English here echoes Hebrew usage and the English idea of “native son” (Greenstein, personal communication)."
"Torah, Exodus.19.71","46 <b>outside:</b> Into that area which has the function of being the realm of death in the story. <b>you are not to break a bone:</b> As if to violate its perfection, since the bone was identified as symbolic of the whole (viz., the same Hebrew word used for “bone” and “essence, person”). The biblical idea, found in reference to all animal sacrifices, is that only unblemished (“whole” or “hale”) animals may be used for such purposes. In Gaster’s (1969) view, the prohibition in this verse was originally instituted to ensure a full flock."
"Torah, Exodus.19.72",48 <b>come-near:</b> This verb (Heb. <i>karev</i>) is often used in connection with the priestly cult.
"Torah, Exodus.19.73","49 <b>Instruction:</b> Or “teaching,” “priestly ruling.” The same word later refers to Moshe’s fuller “teaching,” and eventually to the entire Pentateuch."
"Torah, Exodus.19.74",51 <b>that same day:</b> The phrase serves to bridge the two chapters here (Plaut).
"Torah, Exodus.19.75",13:2 <b>Hallow:</b> Make holy. <b>breacher:</b> Opener. This should not be confused with a so-called breech birth.
"Torah, Exodus.19.76","3 <b>Remember:</b> Here and again at 20:8, the Hebrew verbal form is an emphatic one."
"Torah, Exodus.19.77","4 <b>Ripe-Grain:</b> Heb. <i>aviv.</i> The month later took on a Babylonian name (Nisan), as did all the months of the Jewish calendar."
"Torah, Exodus.19.78",9 <b>sign … reminder:</b> This may have been figurative originally; it became taken literally and gave rise to the phylacteries (<i>tefillin</i>) in rabbinic Judaism. Notable in this verse is how the body is pressed into the service of memory (“hand … eyes … mouth”). Rashi draws attention to the parallel idea of the Song of Songs: “Set me as a seal upon your heart … upon your arm” (Song 8:6).
"Torah, Exodus.19.79","10 <b>year-day:</b> Heb. <i>yamim;</i> the rendering follows B-R, which took the expression to denote both “year to year” and specifically the holiday."
"Torah, Exodus.19.80",11–12 <b>It shall be … every breacher:</b> Returning to the subject of v.2.
"Torah, Exodus.19.81","12 <b>to … for Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> That is, for sacrifice to him."
"Torah, Exodus.19.82","13 <b>a donkey:</b> Not one of the “pure” animals fit for sacrifice, and hence its substitution (“redeeming”) by a lamb. <b>break-its-neck:</b> Others, “decapitate.” The intent seems to be that if the animal is not redeemed, one is not allowed to benefit economically from it (Plaut). <b>firstborn of men … redeem:</b> In this case the male child is symbolically transferred to God; child sacrifice was of course abhorrent to the Bible (see Gen. 22). To this day religious Jews “redeem” their firstborn sons with money given to charity, thirty days after birth (<i>Pidyon Ha-Ben</i>)."
"Torah, Exodus.19.83",14 <b>What does this mean?:</b> Lit. “What is this?”
"Torah, Exodus.20.1","<i>The Route and the Escort</i> (13:17–22): The initial exit from Egypt highlights an ominous fact about the Israelites: God is well aware of their weaknesses and leads them by a detour, lest they “see war” and seek to recover the familiar security of being serfs. The section also explains what they are doing out of the way of the logical route to Canaan (the place names are difficult to identify, but the general stress is clear), and sets up the great final victory of the next chapter."
"Torah, Exodus.20.2","Two other elements of weight enter in this brief passage. One concerns Yosef’s bones, which leave Egypt with his descendants. The body of Yosef seems to anchor early Israelite history: its mummification brings the Genesis stories to a close, its journey here links up Israel’s patriarchal past with the radically new deliverance from bondage, and its final interment in the land of Israel formally closes out the conquest of the land under Yehoshua (Joshua) (Josh. 24:32)."
"Torah, Exodus.20.3","Another unifying motif is that of God’s accompanying the journeying Israelites in the form of cloud and fire. This passage is the first of what I have called the “Presence Accounts” described in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above."
"Torah, Exodus.20.4",15 And it was
"Torah, Exodus.20.5","when Pharaoh hardened (his heart) against sending us free,"
"Torah, Exodus.20.6","that Y<small>hwh</small> killed every firstborn throughout the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.20.7",from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beast.
"Torah, Exodus.20.8","Therefore I myself slaughter-offer to Y<small>hwh</small> every breacher of a womb, the males,"
"Torah, Exodus.20.9",and every firstborn among my sons I redeem.
"Torah, Exodus.20.10","16 It shall be for a sign on your hand and for headbands between your eyes,"
"Torah, Exodus.20.11",for by strength of hand Y<small>hwh</small> brought us out of Egypt.
"Torah, Exodus.20.12","17 Now it was, when Pharaoh had sent the people free,"
"Torah, Exodus.20.13","that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, which indeed is nearer,"
"Torah, Exodus.20.14",for God said to himself:
"Torah, Exodus.20.15","Lest the people regret it, when they see war,"
"Torah, Exodus.20.16",and return to Egypt!
"Torah, Exodus.20.17",18 So God had the people swing about by way of the wilderness at the Sea of Reeds.
"Torah, Exodus.20.18",And the Children of Israel went up armed from the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Exodus.20.19","19 Now Moshe had taken Yosef’s bones with him,"
"Torah, Exodus.20.20","for he had made the Children of Israel swear, yes, swear, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.20.21","God will take account, yes, account of you—so bring my bones up from here with you!"
"Torah, Exodus.20.22",20 They moved on from Sukkot and encamped in Etam at the edge of the wilderness.
"Torah, Exodus.20.23",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.20.24","16 <b>headbands:</b> Others, “frontlets.” The meaning is unclear; see the discussions in Plaut and Tigay (1982), from which the present translation is taken."
"Torah, Exodus.20.25","17 <b>lead them … regret:</b> A play on words: Heb. <i>naham … yinnahem.</i> <b>way:</b> Some take this to be a proper noun or name: “The Way/Road of the Land of the Philistines.” <b>land of the Philistines:</b> That is, along the Mediterranean coast."
"Torah, Exodus.20.26","18 <b>Sea of Reeds:</b> Not “Red Sea,” which came from an ancient translation. It has more recently been suggested that the term (Heb. <i>suf</i>) can be read “End [<i>sof</i>] Sea,” that is, the Sea at the End of the World. This mythological designation is attractive, given the cosmically portrayed events of the next chapter, but is not provable. The exact location, in any event, has not been established with certainty. <b>armed:</b> Heb. (<i>hamush</i>) unclear. The present rendering is supported by ancient versions; Plaut raises the possibility of “groups of five/fifty.”"
"Torah, Exodus.20.27","19 <b>he had made the Children of Israel swear:</b> See Gen. 50:25. The bones will be reburied, marking the end of the conquest of Canaan, in Josh. 24:32."
"Torah, Exodus.21.1","<i>At the Sea of Reeds</i> (14): The liberation account ends with two literary masterpieces: the semipoetic story of Israel’s miraculous passage through the Sea of Reeds along with God’s smashing of the Egyptian war machine, and the song of triumph that follows in Chap. 15. Taken together, they form a natural conclusion to what has gone before and a bridge to what follows. Chap. 14 marks the Israelites’ last contact with the Egyptians, and the beginning of their desert journey."
"Torah, Exodus.21.2","As if the actual exodus were not dramatic enough, the narrator or editor has included a battle scene at this point in the text. As before, the principal combatants are God and Pharaoh, and as before, we begin with God’s hardening the monarch’s heart (v.4) to teach him a final lesson (“I will be glorified”). In that vein, some of the plague motifs are repeated, making Chap. 14 a fitting conclusion to the Deliverance account stylistically and thematically (see also Isbell). At the same time the story includes a foreshadowing of Israel’s behavior in the wilderness for the next two years, with a detailed account of their complaints against Moshe (and God’s miraculous response)."
"Torah, Exodus.21.3","God appears in this story in his most warlike garb, and temporarily resembles many of the gods of antiquity (Cross uses the term “the divine warrior,” relating it to Northwest Semitic imagery). This is not unusual for the Bible, and seems appropriate here, given the climactic nature of the events and the general context of the Deliverance Narrative. Otherwise, the Hebrew God was conceived of as the originator of all things, good and evil, and was of course not compartmentalized into limited tasks as were other gods of neighboring cultures."
"Torah, Exodus.21.4","From a formal point of view, the sea narrative is among the most formulaic in the Hebrew Bible. That is, it is built entirely upon several phrases that repeat throughout the text, stressing its major themes. These include: God’s “making Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed” (vv.4, 8, 17); God’s “being glorified” through what he does to the Egyptians (vv.4, 17, 18); Israel’s going “upon dry-land” (vv.16, 22, 29); the waters’ “returning” (vv.26, 27, 28); Israel’s marching “through/into the midst of the sea” (vv.16, 22, 23, 27, 29); Pharaoh’s “chariots and riders” (vv.17, 18, 23, 26, 28); and a description of the standing waters, “the waters a wall for them to their right and to their left” (vv.22, 29); see also the refrain, “before Pi ha-Hirot … before Baal-Tzefon” (v.4) and “by Pi ha-Hirot, before Baal-Tzefon” (v.9). The text is thus much more than a journalistic account of what happened: it is a rhythmic retelling of an experience, strongly conditioned by traditional (probably oral) Israelite forms of storytelling."
"Torah, Exodus.21.5","The ending (vv.29–31) betrays the influence of Deuteronomy. Using language that mirrors the end of the entire Torah (Deut. 34), the text speaks of seeing, fearing, hand, eyes, and the unique-to-Deuteronomy phrase “Moshe his servant” (see Deut. 34:5). Significantly, then, the final narrative of Israel’s relationship to Egypt is cast as a classic ending in general."
"Torah, Exodus.21.6","What exactly happened at the sea? As I indicated in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above, such a point is unanswerable, and may not have a great bearing on the meaning of our text. Scholars have scrambled their brains for decades, trying either to reconstruct precisely what “natural” event this “really” was (e.g., tides, tidal wave), or to identify the exact location of the “Sea of Reeds.” While such matters are important to the historian, the Bible itself concentrates on the theme of the story. The narrator was concerned to demonstrate God’s final victory and to portray Israel’s escape in terms of a birthing (through a path, out of water), and these themes had the most influence both on later biblical tradition and on the generations of inspired Jews and Christians that heeded them."
"Torah, Exodus.21.7","21 Now Y<small>hwh</small> was going before them,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.8","by day in a column of cloud, to lead them the way,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.9","by night in a column of fire, to give light to them,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.10",to (be able to) go by day and by night.
"Torah, Exodus.21.11",22 There would not retire
"Torah, Exodus.21.12",the column of cloud by day
"Torah, Exodus.21.13",or the column of fire by night
"Torah, Exodus.21.14",from before the people!
"Torah, Exodus.21.15","14:1 Y<small>hwh</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.21.16","2 Speak to the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.17","that they may turn back and encamp before Pi ha-Hirot, between Migdol and the sea,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.18","before Baal-Tzefon, opposite it, you are to encamp by the sea."
"Torah, Exodus.21.19",3 Now Pharaoh will say of the Children of Israel:
"Torah, Exodus.21.20",They are confused in the land! The wilderness has closed them in!
"Torah, Exodus.21.21","4 I will make Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, so that he pursues them,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.22","and I will be glorified through Pharaoh and all his army,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.23",so that the Egyptians may know that I am Y<small>hwh</small>.
"Torah, Exodus.21.24",They did thus.
"Torah, Exodus.21.25","5 And when the king of Egypt was told that the people fled,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.26","Pharaoh’s heart and (that of) his servants changed regarding the people, they said:"
"Torah, Exodus.21.27","What is this that we have done, that we have sent free Israel from serving us?"
"Torah, Exodus.21.28","6 He had his chariot harnessed,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.29","his (fighting-) people he took with him,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.30","7 and he took six hundred selected chariots and every (kind of) chariot of Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.31",teams-of-three upon them all.
"Torah, Exodus.21.32","8 Now Y<small>hwh</small> made the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt strong-willed, so that he pursued the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.33",while the Children of Israel were going out with a high hand.
"Torah, Exodus.21.34","9 The Egyptians pursued them and overtook them encamped by the sea,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.35","all of Pharaoh’s chariot-horses, his riders, and his army,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.36","by Pi ha-Hirot, before Baal-Tzefon."
"Torah, Exodus.21.37","10 As Pharaoh drew near, the Children of Israel lifted up their eyes:"
"Torah, Exodus.21.38","Here, Egypt marching after them!"
"Torah, Exodus.21.39",They were exceedingly afraid.
"Torah, Exodus.21.40","And the Children of Israel cried out to Y<small>hwh</small>,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.41",11 they said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.21.42",Is it because there are no graves in Egypt
"Torah, Exodus.21.43",that you have taken us out to die in the wilderness?
"Torah, Exodus.21.44","What is this that you have done to us, bringing us out of Egypt?"
"Torah, Exodus.21.45","12 Is this not the very word that we spoke to you in Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.46","saying: Let us alone, that we may serve Egypt!"
"Torah, Exodus.21.47","Indeed, better for us serving Egypt"
"Torah, Exodus.21.48",than our dying in the wilderness!
"Torah, Exodus.21.49",13 Moshe said to the people:

"Torah, Exodus.21.51",Stand fast and see
"Torah, Exodus.21.52","Y<small>hwh</small>’s deliverance which he will work for you today,"

"Torah, Exodus.21.54","14 Y<small>hwh</small> will make war for you, and you—be still!"
"Torah, Exodus.21.55",15 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.21.56",Why do you cry out to me?
"Torah, Exodus.21.57","Speak to the Children of Israel, and let-them-march-forward!"
"Torah, Exodus.21.58",16 And you—
"Torah, Exodus.21.59","hold your staff high, stretch out your hand over the sea"
"Torah, Exodus.21.60","and split it,"
"Torah, Exodus.21.61",so that the Children of Israel may come through the midst of the sea upon the dry-land.
"Torah, Exodus.21.62","17 But I,"

"Torah, Exodus.21.78","with a fierce east wind all night,"

I did not find a solution in English to the unified use of the one root in Hebrew—a frustrating defeat, given the principles of this translation."

In this construction, the longed-for “Egypt” is repeated five times, and the unknown “wilderness” twice. Note also the stress on Moshe: “you have taken us out … you have done to us.”"

"Torah, Exodus.21.119","21 <b>fierce east wind:</b> Looking back to the “east wind” that rid Egypt of the locusts in 10:13, and forward to God’s “fierce-might” in 15:2, after the triumph at the sea. <b>firm-ground:</b> In the Flood Narrative, another story of deliverance (and death) by water, the same word appears as a sign that all is well.

"Torah, Exodus.22.1","<i>The Song of God as Triumphant King</i> (15:1–21): Moshe’s famous Song at the Sea provides a natural boundary in the book of Exodus. It sets off the Egypt traditions from those of Sinai and the wilderness, and brings to a spectacular close the saga of liberation. This is borne out even in scribal tradition, still observed in the writing of Torah scrolls today, where the Song is written out with different spacing from the preceding and following narrative portions."
"Torah, Exodus.22.2","A poem is necessary at this point in the story, to provide emotional exultation and a needed break before the next phase of Israel’s journey in the book. The Song manages to focus the Israelites’ (the audience’s?) intense feelings in a way that neither the ritual of Chaps. 12–13 nor even the semipoetic description of God’s miraculous intervention in Chap. 14 can do. Only poetry is capable of expressing the full range of the people’s emotions about what has happened. This is similar to the effect of the great poems that occur toward the end of Genesis (Chap. 49, the Blessing of Yaakov) and Deuteronomy (Chaps. 32–33, the Song and Blessing of Moshe)."
"Torah, Exodus.22.3","A major concern of the poet is God’s kingship, with which he ends the poem (a one-liner—“Let Y<small>hwh</small> be king for the ages, eternity!”—contrasting with the doublets and triplets in the body of the poem). This is no accident, nor is it inappropriate; since Chaps. 4 and 5 the story of Exodus has revolved around just who shall be king (God or Pharaoh) and just who shall be served. By the end of Chap. 14 this is no longer an issue. The victorious Y<small>hwh</small> can now be acclaimed as king, while we hear nothing further of Pharaoh. (Has he drowned or merely been written out of the story? Later generations of Jews enjoyed giving him a role in the world to come: he stands at the gate of Hell, admonishing evildoers as they enter; see Ginzberg.)"
"Torah, Exodus.22.4","The attempts to recover what happened at the sea through the poem are doomed to failure, considering that the piece is constructed out of two traditional stories, the victory at the sea and the later conquest of Canaan (vv.1–12, 13–17). Further, it is set in cosmic terms. The words “Oceans” (Heb. <i>tehomot;</i> vv.5, 8) and ‘breath” (<i>ru’ah;</i> v.8) recall the primeval chaos at the beginning of Creation itself (Gen. 1:2). This technique is characteristic of much of ancient/religious literature: a great event is told in a way that reflects the beginnings of the gods and the world (this may include statements about the end of the world as well)."
"Torah, Exodus.22.5","It should be noted that some scholars point out the close resemblance between God’s victory here and scenes in other ancient Near Eastern literatures that portray the triumph of a storm god over a sea god. So however historical the events in Chaps. 14–15 may have been, in their biblical retelling they have been patterned after antecedents in myth."
"Torah, Exodus.22.6","Much has been written concerning the structure of the Song (see, e.g., Cassuto, Cross, and Lichtenstein). I will mention only a few points here. The vocabulary of the poem is extremely concentrated. Major ideas are expressed by clusters of key verbs. Note, for instance, the grouping of “flung,” “hurled,” “plunged,” “shattered,” “smashed,” “consumed”—a veritable lexicon of military victory. A number of verbs describe divine leadership (“led,” “guided,” “brought”), and God’s establishment of the Israelites in Canaan (“planted,” “founded”). The fear of the Canaanites (of Israel and its God) is graphically expanded to “shuddered,” “seized with writhing,” “terrified,” “seized with trembling,” “melted away,” “… dread and anguish,” and “grew dumb.” Finally, there are a number of nouns that express weight (cf. Heb. <i>kaved,</i> previously discussed): “stone,” “dam,” and “lead.”"
"Torah, Exodus.22.7","The overall effect of the poem is of fierce pride at God’s victory, and exultant description of the destruction and discomfort of enemies, whether Egyptian or Canaanite. This general tone parallels many ancient war poems; what is characteristically Israelite about it is God’s choosing and leading a people. Therefore the last verse goes far beyond the celebration of a single military victory. The Song constitutes the founding of a theocratic people."
"Torah, Exodus.22.8","Scholars have long noted the archaic style of the Song, which uses forms characteristic of early biblical Hebrew. Its tone is for this reason even more exalted than is usual in biblical poetry. An imaginative reflection of the effect can be found in Daiches, who paraphrases the Song in the style of early English epic poetry."
"Torah, Exodus.22.9","Two sections have been appended to the end of the poem. First there is the poetically remarkable summary of the narrative in v.19, notable for the fact that it is composed wholly from phrases used in Chap. 14. There follows a women’s repetition/performance of at least part of the Song complete with dance. Some scholars see this as the “original” form of the poem. Of equal interest is the characterization of Miryam as a “prophetess.” But there may be a structural reason for her appearance as well: the enterprise of deliverance from Egypt began with a little girl at the Nile, watching through the reeds to make sure her baby brother would survive; it ends with the same person, now an adult, a “prophetess” celebrating the final victory at the Sea of Reeds."

"Torah, Exodus.22.115","20 <b>Miryam the prophetess:</b> Trad. English “Miriam.” This is the first time in the narrative that she is mentioned by name, and also the first appearance of a “prophetess” in the Hebrew Bible."
"Torah, Exodus.23.1","<i>Grumbling I</i> (15:22–27): The first of the wilderness narratives is linked to what has gone before via the theme of water. Fresh from their rescue from death at the sea, the Israelites look for water in the desert and find the discovery of unpotable water intolerable. The key word, especially for the many later wilderness traditions such as we find in Numbers, is “grumbled” (Heb. <i>lyn</i>), which leads to God’s nurturing of the people. Strangely, the theme of undrinkable water recalls the beginning of the plague sequence in Egypt (7:20–21)."
"Torah, Exodus.23.2","Right away in this first desert episode we are told the purpose of Israel’s journey: God is testing them, to see if they will “hearken” to what he bids them to do. The language is in the style of Deuteronomy. One should also mention the idea of “law and judgment,” indicating another crucial desert theme: Israel’s ability or inability to govern itself."
"Torah, Exodus.23.3",The account ends with an abundance of water in v.27.
"Torah, Exodus.24.1","<i>Grumbling II</i> (16): Moving now halfway (in terms of time) to their Sinai destination, the people encounter a new lack: food. This reintroduces the “testing” motif (V.4), with its built-in answer: God provides quails and <i>mahn</i> (trad. English “manna”). The story is full-blown, and its repeating vocabulary sets forth the issues clearly: “grumble” occurs seven times, and “command/commandments” four times, linked to the idea of testing. Indeed, this long story poses the question central to all the wilderness narratives: “… whether they will walk according to my instruction or not” (v.4)."
"Torah, Exodus.24.2","The manna was important in early Israelite tradition as a witness to God’s nurturing, as attested by the end of the chapter with its ritual prescriptions regarding it (vv.32–34; note the threefold repetition of “safekeeping”). But it also sets up an emphasis on a more permanent institution in Israelite culture: the Sabbath. One notion that this passage may convey is the antiquity and importance of the Sabbath, preceding the laws of Sinai as it does here. Also at issue is whether the Israelites can follow simple rules laid down by God."
"Torah, Exodus.25.1","<i>Grumbling III</i> (17:1–7): With the third wilderness story we return to the water theme. This time the element of “quarreling” with Moshe is added, in addition to the portrayal of Moshe’s eroding patience (v.4). Otherwise it is a variation on the basic theme (notice, for instance, the similarities between 16:3 and 17:3). The ending is ominous, reversing the previously held idea of God’s testing Israel."
"Torah, Exodus.25.2",32 Moshe said:
"Torah, Exodus.25.3",This is the word that Y<small>hwh</small> has commanded:
"Torah, Exodus.25.4","An <i>omer</i> of it for safekeeping throughout your generations,"
"Torah, Exodus.25.5",in order that they may see the bread that I had you eat in the wilderness
"Torah, Exodus.25.6",when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Exodus.25.7",33 Moshe said to Aharon:
"Torah, Exodus.25.8","Take a vat and put an <i>omer</i> of <i>mahn</i> in it,"
"Torah, Exodus.25.9","and put it aside in the presence of Y<small>hwh</small>, in safekeeping throughout your generations."
"Torah, Exodus.25.10","34 As Y<small>hwh</small> had commanded Moshe, Aharon put it aside before the Testimony, in safekeeping."

"Torah, Exodus.25.12","the <i>mahn</i> they ate, until they came to the edge of the land of Canaan."

"Torah, Exodus.25.23","3 The people thirsted for water there,"

"Torah, Exodus.25.27","34 <b>Testimony:</b> The tablets of the covenant mentioned in 25:21 and 31:18; their citing seems out of place here, but it should be borne in mind that the Torah is not always chronological, as was already recognized by medieval commentators."
"Torah, Exodus.25.28",17:2 <b>For-what:</b> Why. Notice how the text equates quarreling with Moshe and testing Y<small>hwh</small>. <b>quarrel:</b> A verb that often denotes a legal case in biblical texts.
"Torah, Exodus.26.1","<i>War with Amalek</i> (17:8–16): In addition to testing/grumbling, conflict with foreigners is a significant wilderness theme (see Num. 20–24). It is perhaps for this reason that it has been included in the pre-Sinai traditions. Its placement here may depend on its use of Moshe’s staff; the previous narrative ended with the use of that object, and such linkage was a known form of composition in ancient literature."
"Torah, Exodus.26.2","The tradition about Israel’s relationship with Amalek, however brief, persists as an important one in the Bible. Saul, Israel’s first king, is commanded by God to wipe out the Amalekites, as punishment for their opposition of Israel in our passage (I Sam. 15), and centuries later, Haman, the evil Persian councillor who proposes to exterminate the Jews of his country, is portrayed as a descendant of the Amalekite king (Esther 3:1)."
"Torah, Exodus.26.3","Our story, however, is no mere military report, but also a tradition about the power of the “staff of God.” In another culture, indeed in later Midrashic literature, such a theme would receive Excalibur-like treatment, but the Bible suppresses the magical side and simply uses it as a tool, expressing God’s continuing deliverance of Israel."

"Torah, Exodus.27.1","<i>The New Society: Yitro’s Visit</i> (18): Israel finally reaches the “mountain of God,” but this, remarkably, is subordinated to the fact that Moshe and the people meet up with Yitro, whom we recall from Chaps. 2–4. The designation “father-in-law” recurs throughout this chapter (thirteen times), perhaps playing up the importance of the relationship in Israelite society. The real concern of the story, however, is Moshe’s early attempt to set up a functioning judicial system in Israel (hence the key word <i>davar,</i> ten times, translated here as “matter” in the sense of “legal matter”). The chapter thus serves as a good prelude to Sinai, which will include far-ranging legal material (despite the fact that some scholars see it as an insertion from a later period—cf. v.16, “God’s laws and his instructions”)."
"Torah, Exodus.27.2","It has been noted (Cohn) that the “trek narratives” in Exodus and Numbers have been laid out evenly, with six “stations” between Egypt and Sinai and another six between Sinai and the land of Israel. Thus here, Israel has come to the midpoint of its journey. In another perspective, Moshe himself has come full circle, returning to both the spot and the man in whose presence the mature adult phase of his life had begun."

"Torah, Exodus.27.26",6 He (had it) said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.27.27","I, your father-in-law Yitro, am coming to you, and your wife and her two sons with her."
"Torah, Exodus.27.28","7 Moshe went out to meet his father-in-law,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.29","he bowed and kissed him, and each-man asked after the other’s welfare;"
"Torah, Exodus.27.30",then they came into the tent.
"Torah, Exodus.27.31",8 Moshe related to his father-in-law
"Torah, Exodus.27.32","all that Y<small>hwh</small> had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt on Israel’s account,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.33","all the hardships that had befallen them on the journey,"

"Torah, Exodus.27.35","9 And Yitro was jubilant because of all the good that Y<small>hwh</small> had done for Israel, that he had rescued him from the land of Egypt."

"Torah, Exodus.27.38","who has rescued you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of Pharaoh,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.39",who has rescued the people from under the hand of Egypt!

"Torah, Exodus.27.41","yes, Y<small>hwh</small> is greater than all gods—"
"Torah, Exodus.27.42","yes, in just that matter in which they were presumptuous against them!"
"Torah, Exodus.27.43","12 Yitro, Moshe’s father-in-law, took an offering-up and slaughter-animals for God,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.44","and Aharon and all the elders of Israel came to eat bread with Moshe’s father-in-law, before the presence of God."
"Torah, Exodus.27.45",13 Now it was on the morrow:
"Torah, Exodus.27.46","Moshe sat to judge the people,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.47",and the people stood before Moshe from daybreak until sunset.
"Torah, Exodus.27.48","14 When Moshe’s father-in-law saw all that he had to do for the people,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.49",he said:
"Torah, Exodus.27.50",What kind of matter is this that you do for the people—
"Torah, Exodus.27.51","why do you sit alone, while the entire people stations itself around you"
"Torah, Exodus.27.52",from daybreak until sunset?
"Torah, Exodus.27.53",15 Moshe said to his father-in-law:
"Torah, Exodus.27.54","When the people comes to me to inquire of God,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.55","16 —when it has some legal-matter, it comes to me—"
"Torah, Exodus.27.56",I judge between a man and his fellow
"Torah, Exodus.27.57",and make known God’s laws and his instructions.
"Torah, Exodus.27.58",17 Then Moshe’s father-in-law said to him:
"Torah, Exodus.27.59","Not good is this matter, as you do it!"
"Torah, Exodus.27.60","18 You will become worn out, yes, worn out, so you, so this people that are with you,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.61","for this matter is too heavy for you,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.62",you cannot do it alone.
"Torah, Exodus.27.63","19 So now, hearken to my voice,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.64","I will advise you, so that God may be-there with you:"
"Torah, Exodus.27.65","Be-there, yourself, for the people in relation to God."
"Torah, Exodus.27.66",You yourself should have the matters come to God;
"Torah, Exodus.27.67","20 You should make clear to them the laws and the instructions,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.68","you should make known to them the way they should go, and the deeds that they should do;"
"Torah, Exodus.27.69","21 but you—you are to have the vision (to select) from all the people men of caliber, holding God in awe,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.70","men of truth, hating gain,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.71",you should set (them) over them
"Torah, Exodus.27.72","as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.73",22 so that they may judge the people at all times.
"Torah, Exodus.27.74",So shall it be:
"Torah, Exodus.27.75","every great matter they shall bring before you,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.76",but every small matter they shall judge by themselves.
"Torah, Exodus.27.77","Make (it) light upon you, and let them bear (it) with you."
"Torah, Exodus.27.78",23 If you do (thus in) this matter
"Torah, Exodus.27.79","when God commands you (further), you will be able to stand,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.80",and also this people will come to its place in peace.
"Torah, Exodus.27.81","24 Moshe hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.82",he did it all as he had said:
"Torah, Exodus.27.83","25 Moshe chose men of caliber from all Israel,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.84","he placed them as heads over the people,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.85","as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens."
"Torah, Exodus.27.86",26 They would judge the people at all times:

"Torah, Exodus.27.88",but every small matter they would judge by themselves.
"Torah, Exodus.27.89","27 Moshe sent his father-in-law off,"
"Torah, Exodus.27.90",and he went home to his land.
"Torah, Exodus.27.91",on that (very) day
"Torah, Exodus.27.92",they came to the Wilderness of Sinai.
"Torah, Exodus.27.93",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.27.94",12 <b>sun came in:</b> Set.
"Torah, Exodus.27.95",13 <b>weakened:</b> Disabled or defeated.
"Torah, Exodus.27.96",14 <b>account:</b> Or “document.” <b>wipe out the memory:</b> The command demonstrates the depth of Israel’s animosity toward Amalek.
"Torah, Exodus.27.97","16 <b>Hand on:</b> Cassuto suggests “monument to,” following the meaning of <i>yad</i> in I Sam. 15:12, II Sam. 18:18, and other instances. <b>throne:</b> Heb. <i>kes,</i> either a corruption of the more standard <i>kisse</i> or, most probably, a scribal error for <i>nes</i>, “banner,” as in v.15."
"Torah, Exodus.27.98","18:3 <b>he:</b> Moshe, in 2:22, above."
"Torah, Exodus.27.99","4 <b>Eliezer:</b> This is the first and only time we hear of this son. <b>he rescued me from Pharaoh’s sword:</b> Here, as sometimes occurs in the biblical text, we learn of earlier events or emotions. Moshe’s emotional makeup while he was in Midyan (Chaps. 2–4) thus becomes a little clearer."
"Torah, Exodus.27.100","5 <b>at the mountain of God:</b> Another important fact has been casually slipped in at this point, again probably from a narrative taking place later. In the next chapter Israel’s arrival at Sinai will be more dramatically heralded."
"Torah, Exodus.27.101","8 <b>Y<small>hwh</small> had rescued them:</b> The verb was used above in relation to Moshe, and is a key repeating word in this chapter. Thus the experience of leader and people unite again, and the narrative of deliverance comes full circle. Moshe had begun his mission at Sinai, as a member of Yitro’s household, and now the latter meets him in Sinai, on the brink of the confirmation of 3:12 (“you will serve God on this mountain”)."
"Torah, Exodus.27.102","9 <b>jubilant:</b> Heb. <i>va-yihd,</i> from <i>hdy,</i> a rare verb."
"Torah, Exodus.27.103","10 <b>who has rescued the people:</b> There is obviously a redundancy in this verse, based perhaps on a scribal error."
"Torah, Exodus.27.104","11 <b>in just that matter:</b> Heb. difficult; others either omit this phrase altogether, or use complex English constructions to reproduce it (e.g., “for he did this to those who treated Israel arrogantly,” “for he has routed the mighty foes of his folk”). <b>they were presumptuous:</b> The Egyptians."
"Torah, Exodus.27.105",12 <b>before presence of God:</b> An expression that usually carries a cultic meaning (Levine 1974).
"Torah, Exodus.27.106","14 <b>all that he had to do:</b> Compare vv.8 and 9, where the great “doing” of God is accomplished with ease. Perhaps a contrast is being drawn between divine and human deeds; Moshe cannot do the “all” that God can."
"Torah, Exodus.27.107","18 <b>heavy:</b> Again the key word that was mentioned earlier (see the note to 14:4); it aids in linking up stories, as it has occurred in 17:12."
"Torah, Exodus.27.108","21 <b>the vision (to select):</b> The verb “see” in Hebrew (<i>ra’oh</i>) also has the connotation of “select” (cf. Gen. 22:8). <b>caliber:</b> A term often used in a military context (see Judg. 11:1, 18:2)."
"Torah, Exodus.27.109","22 <b>at all times:</b> That is, in minor matters—as we would say, “everyday affairs.”"
"Torah, Exodus.27.110",23 <b>stand:</b> Endure.
"Torah, Exodus.27.111","27 <b>sent … off/ … went … to his land:</b> A stock biblical farewell passage (see Num. 24:25, for instance)."
"Torah, Exodus.28.1","<i>The Meeting and the Covenant</i> (19): The account of God’s revelation at Sinai, like the narrative of the tenth plague and exodus, is embedded in a wider setting. After the covenant has been elucidated, the people assent; preparations are made to meet God; and the brief initial meeting is followed by more preparations, including stern warnings against trespassing on the mountain’s sanctity. When one takes Chap. 20 into account, the effect of all this is anything but smooth, from a narrator’s point of view, and I would agree with Greenberg (1969) that this may be deliberate—stemming from a desire either to include every tradition about this key event that was available to the editor(s), or else to suggest that such things are impossible to describe in normal language and logical sequence (Buber [1981], in another context, once referred to the Creation story of Gen. 1 as a “stammering account”). In any event, the entire description of the fateful meeting between God and the Israelites at Sinai is confined to a mere four verses (19:16–19). This stands in blatant contrast to other ancient Near Eastern traditions, which would have treated such an event with epic length and poetic diction (see, for instance, Deut. 32, or Psalm 78). So here, as in the opening chapter of Genesis, all has been stripped down, focusing attention on the covenant rather than on the mysterious nature of God."
"Torah, Exodus.28.2","In that vein, it must be observed that the narrative centers around speaking, words, and sounds, keeping the visual to a minimum (in line with the warning in Deut. 4:12: “The sound of words you heard/a form you did not see/only a voice”). It also abounds in terms connoting warning and boundaries/separateness—the text contains three sets of warnings: vv.10–13, 21–22 (introducing the phrase “burst out,” which refers to God’s potential destructiveness if the boundaries are violated), and 24. This recalls Moshe’s own experience at Sinai earlier (cf. 3:5). And the number 3 gives the story the same touch of meaning provided by the numbers in Genesis; Israel arrives at the mountain three months after the exodus and meets God on the third day after their preparations."
"Torah, Exodus.28.3","As Cassuto points out, the chapter does not begin with “Now it was …” (Heb. <i>va-yehi</i>), a normal marker for continuing a previous narrative. The Sinai material thus presents itself in utter newness. To use the previously cited wedding analogy: this text betokens a new relationship between God and Israel, however well they have known one another previously."
"Torah, Exodus.28.4","Also notable in Chap. 19 is the emphasis on movement: going up (Heb. <i>’aloh</i>) and down (<i>yarod</i>) (see also 24:15–18). This movement serves to bridge the gap, usually great, between heaven and earth; but note that it is Moshe, and not the people, who does the ascending and descending."
"Torah, Exodus.28.5","Structurally, vv.20–25 appear to have been added, to emphasize the warning theme. They also delay the pronouncement of the “Ten Commandments,” creating thereby a more dramatic effect with the appearance of the latter. But it seems clear that considerable editing has taken place."
"Torah, Exodus.29.1","<i>The Ten Words (The Decalogue)</i> (20:1–14): This section, among the most famous and important in all of religious literature, is set in dramatic tone. Its rhetoric could hardly be more striking. In a form relatively rare in ancient Near Eastern legal documents, a god sets forth demands, with no punishments listed. This “apodictic” form seems to indicate that the Ten Words function as a preamble to the actual laws of Chaps. 21–23, by laying forth the major principles on which Israel’s relationship to God is to be based (as is to be expected, the secondary literature on Chap. 20 is enormous; see Childs for a bibliography)."
"Torah, Exodus.29.2","The numbering of the ten differs slightly in the Jewish and Christian traditions, with the main divergences coming in the split of vv.2–3 (or 3–4, as here); see Cassuto. There are also different opinions on the overall structure of the “Commandments.” Jewish tradition separates out those that treat the relationship between God and human beings (vv.2–11, numbers 1–5) and those that involve human society alone (vv.12–14, numbers 6–10), although it should be kept in mind that all offenses in ancient Israel were seen as affronts to God. This division might be borne out by stylistic considerations, for the last five, of course, begin “You are not to …” and numbers 2–4 all use the Hebrew word <i>ki</i> (“for”) to express reasons or results of the initial stipulations (vv.5, 7, 11, with the substitution of “in order that” in verse 12)."
"Torah, Exodus.29.3","Other notable stylistic aspects here include the fact that “you” is always singular, and that numbers 2–4 and 6–10 are all put in the negative."
"Torah, Exodus.29.4","Several other features of the “Decalogue” are unique: the prohibition against worshiping images, which would have had a strange ring in the ancient world; the Sabbath as a holy day on which not even servants, farm animals, or noncitizens are to work, equally unprecedented in its time and place; and, strangest of all, the final prohibition against desiring (another person’s property)."
"Torah, Exodus.29.5","The language and the content of the Decalogue, then, cooperate to create a lofty and challenging ethical code, which both the people of Israel and the Western world in general have struggled with ever since. The reader may wish to consult Buber’s stimulating essays (1982, 1963) “The Words on the Tablets” and “What Are We to Do about the Ten Commandments?”, as well as the essays in Segal."
"Torah, Exodus.29.6","22 even the priests who approach Y<small>hwh</small> must make themselves holy,"
"Torah, Exodus.29.7",lest Y<small>hwh</small> burst out against them.
"Torah, Exodus.29.8",23 But Moshe said to Y<small>hwh</small>:
"Torah, Exodus.29.9","The people are not able to go up to Mount Sinai,"
"Torah, Exodus.29.10","for you yourself warned us, saying: Fix boundaries for the mountain and make it holy!"
"Torah, Exodus.29.11",24 Y<small>hwh</small> said to him:
"Torah, Exodus.29.12","Go, get down,"
"Torah, Exodus.29.13","and then come up, you and Aharon with you,"
"Torah, Exodus.29.14","but the priests and the people must not break through to go up to Y<small>hwh</small>, lest he burst out against them."
"Torah, Exodus.29.15",25 Moshe went down to the people and said to them
"Torah, Exodus.29.16","20:1 God spoke all these words,"
"Torah, Exodus.29.17",saying:
"Torah, Exodus.29.18","2 I am Y<small>hwh</small> your God,"
"Torah, Exodus.29.19",who brought you out
"Torah, Exodus.29.20","from the land of Egypt, from a house of serfs."

"Torah, Exodus.29.25",or any figure

"Torah, Exodus.29.27","5 you are not to bow down to them,"
"Torah, Exodus.29.28","you are not to serve them,"

"Torah, Exodus.29.31","calling-to-account the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, to the third and the fourth (generation)"
"Torah, Exodus.29.32","of those that hate me,"
"Torah, Exodus.29.33",22 <b>lest Y<small>hwh</small> burst out:</b> Lest God slay them with fire or plague. One recalls the demonic character of God portrayed in 4:24ff. The phrase is repeated in v.24 for emphasis.
"Torah, Exodus.29.34","25 <b>and said to them:</b> The Hebrew is ambiguous; did Moshe report God’s previous speech to them, or the following (Decalogue)? I have left this verse without final punctuation to express the unresolved nature of the question."
"Torah, Exodus.29.35",20:4 <b>figure … :</b> A representation of an animal or person.
"Torah, Exodus.29.36","5 <b>zealous:</b> The Hebrew word (<i>kanna</i>) has a cognate meaning in Arabic, “red (with dye),” so an interesting English analogy, expressing facial color changes, would be “livid” (from the Latin “color of lead”)"
"Torah, Exodus.30.1","<i>Aftermath</i> (20:15–23): The verses that follow the Decalogue highlight an important aspect of the Sinai tradition: its occurrence in a public setting. Vv. 15–18 could fit nicely after 19:20a; the Decalogue would then follow 20:18. Yet it seems to have been important for the narrator to stress (v.19) that God spoke to the people as a whole, not merely secretly in a revelation to a visionary or priest. To emphasize this point, the verb <i>ra’oh,</i> “see/perceive,” occurs seven times in vv.15–19. V.19 also serves as a framework for the entire Revelation episode, recalling as it does the language of 19:4. Israel now has two reasons for obeying God: he brought them out of Egyptian bondage and he talked to them “from the heavens” (v.19)."
"Torah, Exodus.30.2","The rest of the chapter functions as an introduction to the general body of the legislation that begins in the next chapter. Like Israel’s other law collections in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, it starts with rules pertaining to worship."
"Torah, Exodus.30.3","<i>On the Laws:</i> The reader should bear in mind again that the section headings used in the Commentary are for reference only. This is especially true for Chaps. 21–24, where the final form of the Hebrew text discourages distinguishing between different types of offenses (see p. 361, “On Biblical Law”)."
"Torah, Exodus.30.4","<i>Laws Regarding Israelite Serfdom</i> (21:1–11): Given the importance of the root “serve” in the book of Exodus, it is fitting that the Covenant Code open with this theme. In vv.1–6 the text considers the case of the native serf, a status rather like that of the indentured servant in early American history. Immediately, the act of releasing such an individual—providing for his “going out”—is stipulated. “For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt” (Lev. 25:42). While the institution of serfdom existed of necessity in ancient Israel, it could not be tolerated as a permanent and fully dehumanizing one (on the other hand, these regulations deal with natives, not with foreigners). Note the use of seven here, as the number of perfection and limit—the servant goes free after seven years, just as the land rests every seven years (23:10–11)."
"Torah, Exodus.30.5","The second case (vv.7–11) deals with a woman whose poverty-stricken father sells her as a servant. Here, too, there is an attempt to soften the conditions and to humanize what appears as essentially a property situation in the ancient world."

"Torah, Exodus.30.39","you are not to desire the wife of your neighbor,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.40","or his servant, or his maid, or his ox, or his donkey,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.41",or anything that is your neighbor’s.
"Torah, Exodus.30.42",15 Now all of the people were seeing
"Torah, Exodus.30.43","the thunder-sounds,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.44","the flashing-torches,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.45","the <i>shofar</i> sound,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.46",and the mountain smoking;
"Torah, Exodus.30.47","when the people saw,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.48",they faltered
"Torah, Exodus.30.49",and stood far off.
"Torah, Exodus.30.50",16 They said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.30.51","You speak with us, and we will hearken,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.52","but let not God speak with us, lest we die!"
"Torah, Exodus.30.53",17 Moshe said to the people:
"Torah, Exodus.30.54",Do not be afraid!
"Torah, Exodus.30.55","For it is to test you that God has come,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.56","to have awe of him be upon you,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.57",so that you do not sin.
"Torah, Exodus.30.58","18 The people stood far off,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.59",and Moshe approached the fog where God was.
"Torah, Exodus.30.60",19 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.30.61",Say thus to the Children of Israel:
"Torah, Exodus.30.62",You yourselves have seen
"Torah, Exodus.30.63",that it was from the heavens that I spoke with you.
"Torah, Exodus.30.64",20 You are not to make beside me
"Torah, Exodus.30.65","gods of silver, gods of gold you are not to make for yourselves!"
"Torah, Exodus.30.66","21 A slaughter-site of soil, you are to make for me,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.67",you are to slaughter upon it
"Torah, Exodus.30.68","your offerings-up, your sacrifices of <i>shalom,</i>"
"Torah, Exodus.30.69",your sheep and your oxen!
"Torah, Exodus.30.70",At every place
"Torah, Exodus.30.71",where I cause my name to be recalled
"Torah, Exodus.30.72",I will come to you
"Torah, Exodus.30.73",and bless you.
"Torah, Exodus.30.74","22 But if a slaughter-site of stones you make for me,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.75","you are not to build it smooth-hewn,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.76","for if you hold-high your iron-tool over it, you will have profaned it."
"Torah, Exodus.30.77","23 And you are not to ascend my slaughter-site by ascending-steps,"
"Torah, Exodus.30.78",that your nakedness not be laid-bare upon it.
"Torah, Exodus.30.79",21:1 Now these are the regulations that you are to set before them:
"Torah, Exodus.30.80",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.30.81",5 <b>the third and the fourth (generation):</b> A long time (Plaut)
"Torah, Exodus.30.82","6 <b>the thousandth:</b> That is, forever (Plaut)."
"Torah, Exodus.30.83","7 <b>take up … for emptiness:</b> Use for a false purpose. The traditional translation, “take in vain,” limits its scope unnecessarily. <b>clear:</b> To acquit or hold innocent."
"Torah, Exodus.30.84","13 <b>You are not to … :</b> Closer to the Hebrew rhythmically would be a sequence like “No murder!/No adultery!” etc., or “Murder not!/Adulter not!” etc. <b>murder:</b> Some interpreters view this as “killing” in general, while others restrict it, as I have done here. <b>adulter:</b> The English has been tailored to fit the Hebrew rhythm of the last five “commandments,” all of which begin with <i>lo</i> (“no”) and a two-syllable command. <b>steal:</b> Ancient Jewish tradition understood this as a reference to kidnapping (see Lauterbach)."
"Torah, Exodus.30.85",14 <b>desire:</b> Trad. “covet.” Another possibility is “yearn for.”
"Torah, Exodus.30.86","15 <b>were seeing:</b> Others, “perceived.” The use of the Hebrew participle again emphasizes immediacy. <b>flashing-torches:</b> Perhaps a poetic description of lightning."
"Torah, Exodus.30.87","18 <b>fog:</b> Heb. <i>’arafel,</i> frequently used in conjunction with <i>anan</i>, “cloud.”"
"Torah, Exodus.30.88","21 <b>of soil:</b> Cf. v. 22. The altar was to be made of natural materials. <b>sacrifices of <i>shalom:</i></b> Others, “peace-offerings”; but see Orlinsky. <b>you:</b> Here, second personal singular, as well as through v. 23."
"Torah, Exodus.30.89","22 <b>profaned:</b> In folklore, iron was said to drive out the soul of the stone—that is, rob it of its essence (Driver 1911)."
"Torah, Exodus.30.90",23 <b>that your nakedness:</b> To make sure that the priests’ genitals not be uncovered during the rites; the Egyptians wore rather short skirts (Plaut). Note again the desexualizing of religion.
"Torah, Exodus.30.91","21:1 <b>regulations:</b> Others, “judicial decisions,” “judgments.” See Daube (1947)."
"Torah, Exodus.31.1","<i>Capital Crimes of Violence</i> (21:12–17): Four situations involving grave crimes are cited in this section, each ending with the pronouncement of the death penalty in rhetorical form (Heb. <i>mot yumat,</i> “He is to be put-to-death, yes, death”): murder, striking one’s parents, kidnapping, and denigrating one’s parents. Our society has in general supported the first and third of these; but the regulations concerning father and mother do not accord with twentieth-century Western practice, and point up well the enormous importance of the parent-child relationship in ancient Israel (already suggested by “Honor your father and your mother” in the Ten Words). That relationship was often used to describe the one between God and Israel, and thus obedience is an important theme in the covenant as a whole."
"Torah, Exodus.31.2","<i>Injuries</i> (21:18–32): The vocabulary of verbs in these verses outlines the subject at hand: “quarrel,” “strike,” “contend,” “harm,” “strike,” “break-off,” “give.” The text treats a number of extenuating circumstances, imposing penalties of varying degrees. The case of an accidentally caused abortion is especially highlighted (vv.22–25), and in a famous verse (23), the lawgiver breaks into rhetoric in order to stress that punishments be scrupulously fair. Also notable is the regulation concerning the goring ox (vv.28–32), where an <i>animal</i> is made to pay the death penalty, since it has destroyed the most sacred thing of all—life itself. Both of the latter cases have received exhaustive treatment in the scholarly literature (see Sarna 1986)."
"Torah, Exodus.31.3","2 When you acquire a Hebrew serf,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.4","he is to serve for six years,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.5","but in the seventh he is to go out at liberty, for nothing."
"Torah, Exodus.31.6","3 If he came by himself, he is to go out by himself;"
"Torah, Exodus.31.7","if he was the spouse of a wife, his wife is to go out with him."
"Torah, Exodus.31.8","4 If his lord gives him a wife, and she bore him sons or daughters,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.9","the wife and those she bore are to remain her lord’s, and he is to go out by himself."
"Torah, Exodus.31.10","5 But if the serf should say, yes, say:"
"Torah, Exodus.31.11","I love my lord, my wife and my children, I will not go out at liberty!,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.12","6 his lord is to have him approach God’s-oracle,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.13",and then he is to have him approach the door or the post;
"Torah, Exodus.31.14","his lord is to pierce his ear with a piercer,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.15",and he is to serve him forever.
"Torah, Exodus.31.16","7 When a man sells his daughter as a handmaid,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.17",she is not to go out as serfs go out.
"Torah, Exodus.31.18","8 If she is displeasing in the eyes of her lord, who designated her for himself,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.19",he is to have her redeemed;
"Torah, Exodus.31.20","to a foreign people he has not the power to sell her,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.21",since he has betrayed her.
"Torah, Exodus.31.22","9 But if it is for his son that he designates her,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.23",according to the just-rights of women he is to deal with her.
"Torah, Exodus.31.24","10 If another he takes for himself,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.25","(then) her board, her clothing, or her oil he is not to diminish."
"Torah, Exodus.31.26","11 If these three (things) he does not do for her,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.27","she is to go out for nothing, with no money."
"Torah, Exodus.31.28","12 He that strikes a man, so that he dies,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.29","is to be put-to-death, yes, death."
"Torah, Exodus.31.30","13 Now should he not have lain in wait (for him), but should God have brought him opportunely into his hand:"
"Torah, Exodus.31.31",I will set aside for you a place where he may flee.
"Torah, Exodus.31.32","14 But when a man schemes against his neighbor, to kill him with cunning,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.33","from my very slaughter-site you are to take him away, to die!"
"Torah, Exodus.31.34","15 And he that strikes his father or his mother,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.35","is to be put-to-death, yes, death."
"Torah, Exodus.31.36","16 And he that steals a man,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.37","whether he sells him or whether he is found in his hand,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.38","is to be put-to-death, yes, death."
"Torah, Exodus.31.39","17 And he that insults his father or his mother,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.40","is to be put-to-death, yes, death."
"Torah, Exodus.31.41","18 When men quarrel, and a man strikes his neighbor with a stone or with (his) fist, yet he does not die, but rather takes to his bed:"
"Torah, Exodus.31.42","19 If he can rise and walk about outside upon his crutch,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.43","he that struck (him) is to go clear,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.44","only: he is to make good for his resting-time, and provide-that-he-be-healed, yes, healed."
"Torah, Exodus.31.45","20 When a man strikes his serf or his handmaid with a rod, so that he dies under his hand,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.46","it is to be avenged, yes, avenged;"
"Torah, Exodus.31.47","21 nonetheless, if for a day or two-days he endures,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.48","it is not to be avenged, for he is his own “money.”"
"Torah, Exodus.31.49","22 When two men scuffle and deal a blow to a pregnant woman, so that her children abort-forth, but (other) harm does not occur,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.50","he is to be fined, yes, fined, as the woman’s spouse imposes for him,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.51",but he is to give it (only) according to assessment.
"Torah, Exodus.31.52","23 But if harm should occur,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.53",then you are to give life in place of life—
"Torah, Exodus.31.54","24 eye in place of eye, tooth in place of tooth, hand in place of"
"Torah, Exodus.31.55","25 hand, foot in place of foot,/burnt-scar in place of burnt-scar, wound in place of wound, bruise in place of bruise."
"Torah, Exodus.31.56","26 When a man strikes the eye of his serf or the eye of his handmaid, and ruins it,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.57",he is to send him free at liberty for (the sake of) his eye;
"Torah, Exodus.31.58","27 if the tooth of his serf or the tooth of his handmaid he breaks off,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.59",he is to send him free at liberty for (the sake of) his tooth.
"Torah, Exodus.31.60","28 When an ox gores a man or a woman, so that one dies,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.61","the ox is to be stoned, yes, stoned, and its flesh is not to be eaten,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.62",and the owner of the ox is to be clear.
"Torah, Exodus.31.63","29 But if the ox was (known as) a gorer from yesterday and the day-before, and it was so designated to its owner,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.64","and he did not guard it,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.65","and it causes the death of a man or of a woman,"
"Torah, Exodus.31.66","the ox is to be stoned, and its owner as well is to be put-to-death."
"Torah, Exodus.31.67",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.31.68","2 <b>you:</b> Singular, to stress the perspective of the buyer. <b>Hebrew:</b> Cassuto suggests that the term here has a wide meaning: a member of a bondman class (Akkadian <i>Hapiru</i>) found all over the ancient Near East. <b>for nothing:</b> Without paying redemption money (Cassuto)."
"Torah, Exodus.31.69","3 <b>by himself:</b> I.e., as an unmarried man."
"Torah, Exodus.31.70","4 <b>and she bore him … :</b> The birth of children changes the situation, and the wife must now remain behind, in bondage, with the children."
"Torah, Exodus.31.71","5 <b>say, yes, say:</b> Or “declare.”"
"Torah, Exodus.31.72","6 <b>God’s-oracle:</b> Others, “God,” “the judges.” <b>door … post:</b> It is not clear whether the sanctuary or the master’s house is meant. <b>pierce his ear:</b> The symbolism of this act is not clear. Gaster (1969) theorizes that it establishes the serf’s permanent bond to his master’s house, through the blood on the doorpost."
"Torah, Exodus.31.73","7 <b>handmaid:</b> In this instance, a free woman is bound over to be a slave. <b>as serfs go out:</b> As we saw above. In Cassuto’s view, now that she has a new status (that of wife), she may not be so easily disposed of."
"Torah, Exodus.31.74","8 <b>he has betrayed her:</b> He has not married her off, as was intended in the sale."
"Torah, Exodus.31.75","10 <b>her board:</b> “Her” refers to the first woman, mentioned in v.8. <b>her oil:</b> So Paul, on the basis of Mesopotamian parallels. Others, “marital-relations.”"
"Torah, Exodus.31.76","11 <b>with no money:</b> Again, without having to pay redemption money."
"Torah, Exodus.31.77",12 <b>put-to-death:</b> Stronger than simply saying “die.”
"Torah, Exodus.31.78","13 <b>opportunely:</b> Accidentally. <b>a place where he may flee:</b> The so-called cities of refuge (see Num. 35:9–34, Deut. 19:1–12)."
"Torah, Exodus.31.79",14 <b>from my very slaughter-site:</b> Even the traditional concept of sanctuary will not aid such a man.
"Torah, Exodus.31.80","15 <b>strikes:</b> Some interpret this as “strikes dead.” But the wording does not warrant this here (cf. 21:12), and such a society would in any case be supportive of this kind of severe penalty in reference to not “honoring” (see 20:12) parents. This is further supported by v.17, below."
"Torah, Exodus.31.81",18 <b>fist:</b> Some ancient versions read “club” or “spade.”
"Torah, Exodus.31.82",19 <b>to make good … healed:</b> But he is not liable for criminal action.
"Torah, Exodus.31.83","20 <b>avenged:</b> The exact punishment is not specified, but it sounds like death."
"Torah, Exodus.31.84","21 <b>it is not … “money”:</b> “He has human rights, but not those of a free man” (Plaut). Alternatively, Cassuto suggests that the master has lost his own money thereby."
"Torah, Exodus.31.85",22 <b>assessment:</b> As agreed by the judges.
"Torah, Exodus.31.86","23 <b>you:</b> Singular. <b>life in place of life:</b> This has historically been taken to indicate a kind of strict Hebrew vengeance, as in the current expression “an eye for an eye.” But the passage (note, by the way, its length) may have been meant as a contrast to the Babylonian system, where the rich could in essence pay to get out of such situations. In Israel this could not be done, and thus we are dealing not with “strict justice” but with strict fairness."
"Torah, Exodus.31.87","28 <b>When an ox gores … :</b> The ox may be taken here as the paradigm of the domestic animal. The secondary literature on this law and its parallels is enormous. <b>its flesh is not to be eaten:</b> Since the ox has not been properly slaughtered for eating or sacrificial purposes, and possibly also because it is connected with the taking of another life (carnivores are forbidden food in the Bible)."
"Torah, Exodus.32.1","<i>Property</i> (21:33–22:14): These regulations cover various damages to property, commonly through negligence. The key word here is “pay” (Heb. <i>shallem,</i> denoting restitution); also repeated are “fellow” and “God’s-oracle.”"
"Torah, Exodus.32.2","<i>Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters</i> (22:15–23:19): A great variety of offenses is covered in this section: rape, oppression, talebearing, unjust sentencing, and bribery, among others. Yet the category is not so neatly drawn; interspersed with these are laws concerning what we would consider religious affairs: sorcery, idolatry, blasphemy, and the sacred calendar. Once again the implication seems to be that all of these areas are of immediate concern to God, regardless of how they are labeled or pigeonholed."
"Torah, Exodus.32.3","Stylistically there is also great variety, as categorical prohibitions (22:18) alternate with pleas (23:5–6) and positive commands (23:10–12). A number of times the justification for the law is given in the text itself (e.g. 22:20, 26; 23:7, 8, 9, 11, 12), with the operative word being “for.” (Such a verse is called a “motive clause,” and is characteristically although not exclusively biblical; see Sonsino.)"
"Torah, Exodus.32.4","Most notable about this section is the full use that it makes of rhetoric. Several key laws are accompanied by an emotional appeal—e.g., “Oh, if you afflict, afflict them … !” (22:22); “for it is his only clothing … in what (else) shall he lie down?” (v.26); “for a Compassionate-One am I” (v.26); and “you yourselves know (well) the feelings of the sojourner” (23:9)."
"Torah, Exodus.32.5","No passage in these chapters, and indeed throughout the entire Torah, can easily surpass vv.21–23 (as I have mentioned above), with their appeal to language and emotions alike. So at the core of the legal concerns here is the protection of the powerless."
"Torah, Exodus.32.6","Toward the end (23:10–19), emphasis shifts to the festivals of Israel, with a special focus on the agricultural setting. As a result the general scholarly consensus is that these laws could not be wilderness regulations, but refer instead to life after the conquest of Canaan. Be that as it may, the fact that this section ends with ritual concerns provides a rounding-out of the entire body of Exodus legislation, which, as I noted above, began with worship as its subject (20:20ff.)."
"Torah, Exodus.32.7","Finally, this ending passage is notable for its numerical layout—two sets of seven (years and days) and one of three (times a year)."
"Torah, Exodus.32.8","30 If a ransom is established for him,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.9","he is to give it as a redemption for his life, all that is imposed for him."
"Torah, Exodus.32.10","31 Whether it is a son it gores or a daughter it gores,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.11",according to this (same) judgment it is to be done to him.
"Torah, Exodus.32.12","32 If (it is) a serf the ox gores, or a handmaid,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.13","silver—thirty <i>shekels</i>—he is to give to his lord, and the ox is to be stoned."
"Torah, Exodus.32.14","33 When a man opens up a pit, or when a man digs a pit, and does not cover it up, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.15","34 the owner of the pit is to pay, the worth-in-silver he is to restore to its owner, and the dead-animal is to remain his."
"Torah, Exodus.32.16","35 When a man’s ox deals-a-blow to his neighbor’s ox, so that it dies,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.17","they are to sell the live ox and split its worth-in-silver, and the dead-animal they are also to split."
"Torah, Exodus.32.18","36 Yet if it was known that it was a goring ox from yesterday and the day-before, and its owner did not guard it,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.19","he is to pay, yes, pay, an ox in place of the ox, and the dead-animal is to remain his."
"Torah, Exodus.32.20","37 (Now) when a man steals an ox or a lamb, and slaughters it or sells it,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.21","five cattle he is to pay in place of the ox, and four sheep in place of the lamb;"
"Torah, Exodus.32.22","22:1 if in (the act of) digging through, the stealer is caught and is struck down, so that he dies,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.23",there is to be on his account no bloodguilt;
"Torah, Exodus.32.24","2 (but) if the sun rose upon him,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.25",bloodguilt there is on his account;
"Torah, Exodus.32.26","he is to pay, yes, pay—if he has nothing, he is to be sold because of his stealing."
"Torah, Exodus.32.27","3 (Now) if what was stolen is found, yes, found in his hand, whether ox, or donkey, or lamb, (still) alive,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.28",twofold he is to pay.
"Torah, Exodus.32.29","4 When a man has a field or a vineyard grazed in,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.30","and sends his grazing-flock free, so that it grazes in another’s field,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.31","the best-part of his field, the best-part of his vineyard he is to pay."
"Torah, Exodus.32.32","5 When fire breaks out and reaches thorn-hedges, and a sheaf-stack or the standing-grain or the (entire) field is consumed,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.33","he is to pay, yes, pay, he that caused the blaze to blaze up."
"Torah, Exodus.32.34","6 When a man gives silver or goods to his fellow for safekeeping, and it is stolen from the man’s house;"
"Torah, Exodus.32.35","if the stealer is caught, he is to pay twofold;"
"Torah, Exodus.32.36","7 if the stealer is not caught, the owner of the house is to come-near God’s-oracle,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.37",(to inquire) if he did not stretch out his hand against his neighbor’s property.
"Torah, Exodus.32.38","8 Regarding every matter of transgression,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.39","regarding oxen, regarding donkeys, regarding sheep, regarding garments, regarding any kind of loss about which one can say: That is it!—"
"Torah, Exodus.32.40",before God’s-oracle is the matter of the two of them to come;
"Torah, Exodus.32.41","whomever God’s-oracle declares guilty, is to pay twofold to his neighbor."
"Torah, Exodus.32.42","9 When a man gives his neighbor a donkey or an ox or a lamb, or any kind of beast, for safekeeping,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.43","and it dies, or is crippled or captured, no one seeing (it happen),"
"Torah, Exodus.32.44","10 the oath of Y<small>hwh</small> is to be between the two of them,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.45",(to inquire) if he did not send out his hand against his neighbor’s property;
"Torah, Exodus.32.46","the owner is to accept it, and he does not have to pay."
"Torah, Exodus.32.47","11 But if it was stolen, yes, stolen away from him,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.48",he is to pay it back to its owner.
"Torah, Exodus.32.49","12 If it was torn, torn-to-pieces,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.50","he is to bring it as evidence; what was torn, he does not have to pay back."
"Torah, Exodus.32.51","13 When a man borrows it from his neighbor, and it is crippled or it dies:"
"Torah, Exodus.32.52","(if) its owner was not with it, he is to pay, yes, pay;"
"Torah, Exodus.32.53","14 if its owner was with it, he does not have to pay."
"Torah, Exodus.32.54","If it was hired, its hiring-price is received."
"Torah, Exodus.32.55","15 When a man seduces a virgin who has not been spoken-for and lies with her,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.56","(for) the marrying-price he is to marry her, as his wife."
"Torah, Exodus.32.57","16 If her father refuses, yes, refuses to give her to him,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.58","silver he is to weigh out, according to the marriage-price of virgins."
"Torah, Exodus.32.59",17 A sorceress you are not to let live!
"Torah, Exodus.32.60",18 Anyone who lies with a beast
"Torah, Exodus.32.61","is to be put-to-death, yes, death!"
"Torah, Exodus.32.62",19 He that slaughters (offerings) to (other) gods is to be devoted-to-destruction.
"Torah, Exodus.32.63",Only to Y<small>hwh</small> alone!
"Torah, Exodus.32.64","20 Now a sojourner you are not to maltreat, you are not to oppress him,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.65",for sojourners were you in the land of Egypt.
"Torah, Exodus.32.66",21 Any widow or orphan you are not to afflict.
"Torah, Exodus.32.67","22 Oh, if you afflict, afflict them … !"
"Torah, Exodus.32.68","For (then) they will cry, cry out to me,"
"Torah, Exodus.32.69","and I will hearken, hearken to their cry,"

"Torah, Exodus.33.1","<i>Epilogue. The Future Conquest</i> (23:20–33): It would not be suitable, given the grave nature of the covenant, to end the legal passages merely with a particular law, and so our narrator appends a long speech, in the style of Deuteronomy, warning the Israelites, first, to follow God’s messenger, and second, not to assimilate with the nations they are about to conquer. The Deuteronomic themes are classic: “taking care,” smashing Canaanite idols, God’s removing disease from the faithful Israelites, and the spelling-out of Israel’s future borders."
"Torah, Exodus.33.2","Also to be remarked are the sevenfold repetition of “before you” as a stylistic unifying device, and the ending theme of serving YHWH as opposed to “their gods.”"

"Torah, Exodus.33.69",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.33.70","8 <b>open-eyed:</b> Here, the equivalent of “wise.”"
"Torah, Exodus.33.71",9 <b>oppress:</b> Recalling the oppression suffered at the hands of the Egyptians in 3:9.
"Torah, Exodus.33.72","12 <b>pause-for-breath:</b> Later (31:17), God himself is portrayed as having needed to rest after his work of creation."

"Torah, Exodus.33.74",14 <b>you:</b> Singular.

"Torah, Exodus.33.76","16 <b>Pilgrimage-Festival of the Cutting:</b> The wheat harvest and that of first-fruits, occurring in the third month, usually in early June (also known as Shavu’ot, “Weeks”). <b>Pilgrimage-Festival of Ingathering:</b> The final (grape) harvest, in the seventh month in late September or early October (also known as Sukkot, “Huts”)."
"Torah, Exodus.33.77","17 <b>be seen before the presence of … Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> A technical expression for one’s appearing at the sanctuary (Plaut). <b>the Lord, Y<small>hwh</small>:</b> Some see this title as a polemic against the Canaanite Baal, whose name means “master” or “lord.”"
"Torah, Exodus.33.78","18 <b>with anything fermented:</b> Excluding bread and honey (cf. Lev. 2:11) from the offering, possibly since these were included by the Canaanites (Cassuto), or because the sacrifice was to be kept as “natural” as possible."
"Torah, Exodus.33.79","19 <b>You are not to boil … :</b> This law occurs three times in the Torah, and so must have been of particular importance. Despite this, interpreters disagree as to its origins and meaning. Some see it as directly opposing a Canaanite practice; others, as parallel to the law in Deuteronomy (22:6–7) against taking the mother bird along with her young. It also keeps the separation between milk (life-giving) and death; it was thus understood in Jewish mystical tradition of the Middle Ages. The phrase is also cited by Talmudic sages as a basis for the separation of milk and meat in postbiblical Jewish dietary laws (<i>kashrut</i>)."
"Torah, Exodus.33.80","20 <b>a messenger:</b> As sometimes occurs with this word, it is not entirely clear what the distinction is between God and messenger. Here, however, the context seems to require a separate being, whether an angel or Moshe himself."
"Torah, Exodus.33.81",21 <b>my name is with him:</b> Or “in him”; “my authority rests with him” (Clements).

"Torah, Exodus.33.84","24 <b>standing-stones:</b> Possibly, phallic representations of Canaanite gods."
"Torah, Exodus.33.85","26 <b>no miscarrier:</b> No distinction is made here between human and animal, and presumably both would share in the blessing."
"Torah, Exodus.33.86","27 <b>terror … panic:</b> Heb. <i>’emati … hammati.</i> <b>panic:</b> As in 14:24, above, describing God’s routing of the Egyptians. <b>give all your enemies to you by the neck:</b> I.e., they will be routed by you, their backs turned."
"Torah, Exodus.34.1","<i>Sealing the Covenant</i> (24:1–11): To close out the account of covenant-making which began back in Chap. 19, the text recounts a formalized ceremony which has many points of contact with what was generally done throughout the ancient Near East when a covenant was “cut.” Twice Moshe reads God’s words to the people, and twice (vv.3, 7) they give their assent. This is no imposing of laws by a dictator, but a freely accepted, “signed, sealed, and delivered” agreement cemented by blood, the signifier of life itself."
"Torah, Exodus.34.2","As representatives of the people, Moshe, Aharon, Aharon’s sons, and seventy elders ascend Mount Sinai, and, most remarkably, “see” God in some sort of vision—without, as one might expect, their being destroyed. They also eat and drink, as was customary in the sealing of the agreement (and often done in business to this day; see Gen. 31:44–54)."
"Torah, Exodus.34.3",28 I will send Despair on before you

"Torah, Exodus.34.8","30 Little by little will I drive them out from before you,"
"Torah, Exodus.34.9",until you have borne-fruit and possessed the land.
"Torah, Exodus.34.10",31 And I will make your territory
"Torah, Exodus.34.11","from the Sea of Reeds to the Sea of the Philistines,"
"Torah, Exodus.34.12",from the Wilderness to the River.
"Torah, Exodus.34.13","For I give into your hand the settled-folk of the land, that you may drive them out from before you."

"Torah, Exodus.34.17","indeed, that would be a snare to you."
"Torah, Exodus.34.18",24:1 Now to Moshe he said:

"Torah, Exodus.34.20","you and Aharon, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,"

"Torah, Exodus.34.23","but they, they are not to approach,"
"Torah, Exodus.34.24",and as for the people—they (too) are not to go up with him.
"Torah, Exodus.34.25",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.34.26","28 <b>Despair:</b> Others, “hornet”; the Hebrew implies both."
"Torah, Exodus.34.27","29 <b>I will not drive them out … in one year:</b> This is the situation at the beginning of the book of Judges (after the Conquest); apparently Yehoshua did not finish the job, and so various (later) biblical texts attempt to explain the reason for this."
"Torah, Exodus.34.28","31 <b>Sea of the Philistines:</b> The Mediterranean. <b>Wilderness:</b> The southland or Negev. <b>the River:</b> The Euphrates, in the north. <b>drive them out:</b> Heb. <i>gerashtemo</i> is an archaic form (such as we find in 15:17–<i>tevi’emo ve-titta’emo</i>), used perhaps for reasons of rhythm."
"Torah, Exodus.34.29","32 <b>cut … any covenant:</b> A common Semitic idiom for concluding a treaty (see Gen. 15), perhaps stemming from a ritual. The parties would pass between the halves of sacrificed animals, perhaps implying that such would be the penalty for any party that would break the agreement."
"Torah, Exodus.34.30",24:1 <b>Nadav and Avihu:</b> Aharon’s first two sons. <b>seventy:</b> The “perfect” number with which the book of Exodus began.
"Torah, Exodus.35.1","<i>Moshe Ascends Alone</i> (24:12–18): Finally, Moshe leaves the people, in order to receive the laws in permanent (stone) form. He “goes up” the mountain four times (or, most likely, is on his way up). In order to give his absence the weight it needs—so that the people will grow restless, setting up the situation that produces the Golden Calf in Chap. 32–the text will now turn to a completely different matter for fully seven chapters."
"Torah, Exodus.35.2","The ending of this section anticipates the ending of the book of Exodus, with its mention of God’s “glory,” “dwelling,” “fire,” and “day/night.”"
"Torah, Exodus.35.3",3 So Moshe came
"Torah, Exodus.35.4",and recounted to the people all the words of Y<small>hwh</small> and all the regulations.
"Torah, Exodus.35.5","And all the people answered in one voice, and said:"
"Torah, Exodus.35.6","All the words that Y<small>hwh</small> has spoken, we will do."
"Torah, Exodus.35.7",4 And Moshe wrote down all the words of Y<small>hwh</small>.
"Torah, Exodus.35.8","He started-early in the morning,"
"Torah, Exodus.35.9",building a slaughter-site beneath the mountain
"Torah, Exodus.35.10",and twelve standing-stones for the twelve tribes of Israel.
"Torah, Exodus.35.11","5 Then he sent the (serving-) lads of the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Exodus.35.12","that they should offer-up offerings-up, slaughter slaughter-offerings of <i>shalom</i> for Y<small>hwh</small>—bulls."
"Torah, Exodus.35.13","6 Moshe took half of the blood and put it in basins,"
"Torah, Exodus.35.14",and half of the blood he tossed against the slaughter-site.
"Torah, Exodus.35.15",7 Then he took the account of the covenant
"Torah, Exodus.35.16",and read it in the ears of the people.
"Torah, Exodus.35.17",They said:
"Torah, Exodus.35.18","All that Y<small>hwh</small> has spoken, we will do and we will hearken!"
"Torah, Exodus.35.19","8 Moshe took the blood, he tossed it on the people"

"Torah, Exodus.35.22",that Y<small>hwh</small> has cut with you
"Torah, Exodus.35.23",by means of all these words.
"Torah, Exodus.35.24",9 Then went up
"Torah, Exodus.35.25","Moshe and Aharon, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel."
"Torah, Exodus.35.26",10 And they saw
"Torah, Exodus.35.27",the God of Israel: beneath his feet
"Torah, Exodus.35.28","(something) like work of sapphire tiles,"
"Torah, Exodus.35.29",(something) like the substance of the heavens in purity.
"Torah, Exodus.35.30","11 Yet against the Pillars of the Children of Israel, he did not send forth his hand—"
"Torah, Exodus.35.31",they beheld Godhood
"Torah, Exodus.35.32",and ate and drank.
"Torah, Exodus.35.33",12 Y<small>hwh</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.35.34",Go up to me on the mountain
"Torah, Exodus.35.35","and remain there,"
"Torah, Exodus.35.36",that I may give you tablets of stone:
"Torah, Exodus.35.37",the Instruction and the Command
"Torah, Exodus.35.38","that I have written down, to instruct them."
"Torah, Exodus.35.39","13 Moshe arose, and Yehoshua his attendant,"
"Torah, Exodus.35.40",and Moshe went up to the mountain of God.
"Torah, Exodus.35.41",14 Now to the elders he said:
"Torah, Exodus.35.42","Stay here for us, until we return to you;"
"Torah, Exodus.35.43","here, Aharon and Hur are with you—"
"Torah, Exodus.35.44",whoever has a legal-matter is to approach them.
"Torah, Exodus.35.45","15 So Moshe went up the mountain,"
"Torah, Exodus.35.46",and the cloud covered the mountain;
"Torah, Exodus.35.47",16 the Glory of Y<small>hwh</small> took up dwelling on Mount Sinai.
"Torah, Exodus.35.48","The cloud covered it for six days,"
"Torah, Exodus.35.49",and he called to Moshe on the seventh day from amidst the cloud.
"Torah, Exodus.35.50",17 And the sight of the Glory of Y<small>hwh</small>
"Torah, Exodus.35.51",(was) like a consuming fire

"Torah, Exodus.35.59","4 <b>standing-stones:</b> As distinct from the phallic stones mentioned in 23:24, these functioned as boundary markers and memorials."
"Torah, Exodus.35.60",5 <b>lads:</b> Or “youths”; the Hebrew term (<i>na’ar</i>) is analogous to “apprentice.”
"Torah, Exodus.35.61",7 <b>and we will hearken:</b> This is an addition to the “we will do” of 19:8. In Deuteronomy “hearken” is often found connoting “obey.”
"Torah, Exodus.35.62","10 <b>work of sapphire tiles:</b> Others, “pavement.” Childs notes parallel Ugaritic texts to this description. <b>purity:</b> In Ugaritic, this word has an association of clarity or brightness, especially as regards precious stones (see “pure gold” in the Tabernacle account: 24:11, 17, 24, 31, 39, below)."

"Torah, Exodus.35.66","18 <b>forty:</b> Another meaningful number, reminiscent of the Flood. It is echoed in Elijah’s later experience on the same summit (I Kings 19:8)."
"Torah, Exodus.36.1","<i>The Coffer</i> (25:10–16): The coffer or ark was a cult object of major importance in premonarchic and early monarchic Israel. In our text it contains the “Testimony” (i.e., the tablets with the Ten Words); in Josh. 3:14–15 it precedes the people into the Promised Land; in I Sam. 4:11–5:12 it is captured in battle but mysteriously wreaks havoc among the enemy (hence its cinematic offspring <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>). Finally, David’s transporting of it to Jerusalem (II Sam. 6) marks the formal establishment of that city as a holy one and as the capital of Israel."
"Torah, Exodus.36.2","In Exodus the coffer literally plays a central role. It stands in the innermost recesses of the Tabernacle, at the sacred center. Considering what the coffer contained—tablets with God’s words on them rather than statues of gods—it addresses the primacy of divine word over divine representation in ancient Israelite thought."
"Torah, Exodus.37.1","<i>The Purgation-Cover</i> (25:17–22): <i>Kapporet</i> here could indicate simply “cover,” yet its function goes beyond mere protection. The name of this central part of the above-cited central cult object may be a play on words. The Hebrew verb <i>kapper,</i> which occurs again later in these texts (see 29:33–37), often means “purge” or “purify”; earlier translators rendered it as “expiate” or even “propitiate,” and the <i>kapporet</i> as “mercy-seat” or “propitiatory.” The <i>kapporet</i> was apparently the holiest spot in the Israelite cult system, and it was there that God was said to speak his will to the people. This idea represents a remarkable shrinking and intimatizing process: the God who spoke to the assembled people, amid thunder, fire, and trembling earth at Sinai, now communicates with them from an area roughly the size of a small desk or table. In addition, there is a shift from a one-time event (Sinai) to the permanent fact of a sanctuary—a development which will later be repeated in Solomon’s Temple."

"Torah, Exodus.37.23",11 <b>a rim of gold all around:</b> Heb. <i>zer zahav saviv.</i>
"Torah, Exodus.37.24","16 <b>Testimony:</b> B-R, seeking to connect <i>’edut</i> (“Testimony”) with the sound of <i>mo’ed</i> (“appointment”), translate these two terms as “representation” and “presence.” The tablets bear the name “Testimony” because they “testify” or bear witness to God’s relationship with the Israelites. It should also be noted that Akkadian <i>’adu,</i> cognate with our <i>’edut,</i> means “treaty,” somewhat like the Hebrew <i>berit</i> (“covenant”), which is often found parallel to <i>’edut</i> in the Bible (DeVaux 1965)."
"Torah, Exodus.37.25","17 <b>purgation-cover:</b> Heb. <i>kapporet.</i> There are two long-held traditions of translating this word: “expiation” or “mercy-seat” and plain “cover.” I have kept both ideas in the present rendering. The <i>kapporet</i> was used for the purpose of obtaining forgiveness from God (see Lev. 16:13–15), and also served symbolically as God’s “footstool” to the throne represented by the coffer. Such symbolism is in line with ancient Near Eastern practice, as is the keeping of the covenant documents within the footstool."
"Torah, Exodus.37.26","18 <b>winged-sphinxes:</b> Others, “cherubim,” which, however, is too reminiscent of chubby-cheeked baby angels in Western art. In Mesopotamian temples, these mythical figures in sculpture served as guardians; so too at the end of the Garden of Eden story in Gen. 3:24. See Albright."
"Torah, Exodus.38.1","<i>The Table</i> (25:23–30): The table and its implements, like some of the other features of the Tabernacle, are holdovers from a more blatantly pagan model, where the gods were seen to be in need of nourishment. By thus using conventions of worship common throughout the ancient Near East, Israel expressed its desire to serve God, even while it was aware that he was not the sort of deity who requires food and drink. It might also be mentioned that another common object found in ancient sanctuaries, a bed, has intentionally been omitted from our structure."

"Torah, Exodus.38.32","19 <b>here … there:</b> Or “on one side … on the other side”; at either end. <b>from:</b> Or “out of”; others, “of one piece with.” This one-piece construction is a frequent feature of the objects associated with the Tabernacle."
"Torah, Exodus.38.33","20 <b>toward the purgation-cover:</b> Facing downward, as if to avoid the direct presence of God."
"Torah, Exodus.38.34","22 <b>appoint-meeting:</b> The Hebrew verb refers to fixing a time, and is not the same as the earlier “meeting” (5:3). Exodus speaks of the “Tent of Appointment” from Chap. 27 on; it is unclear as to whether the Tabernacle itself or a separate structure is meant. <b>from above the purgation-cover,/from between the sphinxes:</b> So this was seen as the precise spot of God’s presence in the Tabernacle."
"Torah, Exodus.38.35",27 <b>as holders for the poles:</b> Heb. <i>le-vatim le-vaddim. Batim</i> are literally “housings.”
"Torah, Exodus.39.1","<i>The Lampstand</i> (25:31–40): Despite the wealth of detail lavished on this striking symbol, its exact construction, like that of the Dwelling in general, remains unclear. The vocabulary used for its constituent parts comes from the realm of plants: shaft, stems, blossoms, almond shapes, etc. Indeed, the major latent symbol behind the lampstand is the tree—which appears in many forms and in almost all religions (Meyers). The tree as a symbol is to be found throughout human culture, in such diverse settings as Native American stories and Norse myths; in the ancient Near East it specifically connoted permanence, growth, and majesty—in other words, a reflection of the divine. If one adds to this range of meanings the function of the lampstand—illumination (which often implies not only the giving of physical light but also, as the English phrase has it, enlightenment)—the lampstand will be seen to emerge as an object with considerable evocative power. All these meanings may not have been immediately obvious and conscious to the ancient pilgrim or worshiper, but they periodically surfaced; the lampstand was ancient Judaism’s symbol of preference (judging from synagogue ruins) and not the “Star of David,” which, as Gershom Scholem has shown, was a medieval mystical addition."
"Torah, Exodus.39.2","The importance of the lampstand in our text is indicated by v.40, where the motif of God’s revealing the structure of a sacred object on the mountain is resumed. Its significance is also attested by its major material of construction: pure gold."

"Torah, Exodus.40.2","<i>The Framework</i> (26:15–30): The rigid part of the Tabernacle structure, while described in some detail, leaves room for many questions about specifics (e.g., how exactly did the boards fit together? was there one corner board or two? is the text perhaps describing planks or frames?).

"Torah, Exodus.41.86","27:2 <b>horns:</b> Many altars have been dug up in the area, both Israelite and non-Israelite in origin, fitting this description. The origin and purpose of the “horns” is not clear. We do know that when an Israelite wanted to be granted asylum, for instance, he could grasp the horns of the altar (see I Kings 1:50ff)."
"Torah, Exodus.41.87","3 <b>scrapers … bowls … flesh-hooks … pans:</b> As in 25:29, above, the exact identification of these objects is not known."
"Torah, Exodus.41.88",4 <b>lattice … netting:</b> To let air through and facilitate burning (Cassuto).
"Torah, Exodus.41.89","7 <b>poles:</b> In contrast to those of the coffer, these were apparently removable. The altar was of lesser sanctity than the coffer, and it was not deemed as crucial that no human hand touch it."
"Torah, Exodus.41.90","8 <b>Hollow:</b> And thus easily transportable, to be filled with dirt every time it was set up."
"Torah, Exodus.41.91",9 <b>twisted byssus:</b> Heb. <i>shesh moshzar</i>.
"Torah, Exodus.41.92","10 <b>binders:</b> Others, “rods.”"
"Torah, Exodus.41.93",14 <b>shoulder-piece:</b> That is the literal Hebrew; “side” would be acceptable idiomatically.
"Torah, Exodus.42.1","<i>The Oil</i> (27:20–21): The transition from structure to human institution (the priesthood) is accomplished by both the opening formula here, “Now you …,” and by the oil itself, which is here used for light but which will soon be spoken of (Chap. 29) as a major agent in the anointing of the priests."
"Torah, Exodus.42.2","<i>The Priestly Garments</i> (28:1–5): As in the opening section on the Tabernacle itself (25:1–9), we are now given a listing of what is to come, the clothing in which the priests will perform their sacred functions. The purpose of the objects is mentioned again, this time at both the beginning and the end of the section."
"Torah, Exodus.42.3","In virtually all traditional religions such garments are of great importance, often signaling the status of the wearer as representative of the community (hence Aharon’s breastpiece in this chapter). An additional function, stressed in our account, is that the garments somehow reflect God himself, through the use of certain colors and/or materials. That the term “glory” is used to indicate their function—a key term in the book, and always applied to God, never to Moshe, for instance—signals what is at stake."
"Torah, Exodus.42.4","<i>The Efod</i> (28:6–12, 13–14): This garment, which here seems to be a kind of apron worn only by the high priest, is mentioned elsewhere in the Bible in connection with worship (e.g., Judg. 8:27), but with unclear meaning. Even here, the exact nature of the <i>efod</i> is not entirely certain; but what is cited is its function as the setting for the stones that symbolize the twelve tribes of Israel in God’s presence. This is followed by a description of chains, whose use is mentioned immediately thereafter."
"Torah, Exodus.42.5","<i>The Breastpiece</i> (28:15–30): The central garment in this section is the breastpiece, which seems to be some sort of woven pouch or bag. On the outside it displays precious stones, each one engraved with the name of an Israelite tribe; inside, it holds the oracular objects known as <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tummin</i> (see the note to v.30, below). In this passage, which is cast in poetic form, the narrator appears to be drawing our attention to the specific function of the garments. Vv.29 and 30 repeat the phrase “over his/Aharon’s heart” (three times), “in the presence of Y<small>hwh</small>” (three times), and “regularly” (twice) to make clear their importance: Aharon represents the people whenever he officiates in the sanctuary, and bears the emblem of this office upon his very heart."

"Torah, Exodus.43.2","<i>The Head-Plate</i> (28:36–38): Foremost among the symbols on Aharon’s garments is what he bears on his brow: a band with the words “Holiness for Y<small>hwh</small>.” It serves as a symbol of his efforts to obtain forgiveness on behalf of the Israelite people, one of his primary functions as priest.

B-R, following Luther, translate the terms as <i>Lichtende und Schlichtende</i> (“lights and perfections”), a possible literal but unclear translation. It is also worth noting that <i>Urim</i> begins with the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and <i>Tummim</i> the last, giving rise to the possibility that the names themselves are symbolic."

"Torah, Exodus.43.86","41 <b>give-mandate:</b> Lit. “fill the hand.” The term indicates induction into office; possibly something was put into the inductee’s hand symbolizing their new status. <i>Mandatus</i> in Roman law is similar, and hence the present translation.

"Torah, Exodus.44.1","<i>The Investiture Ceremony</i> (29:1–46): Although the text still has a number of Tabernacle items to discuss, viz., the incense and its altar, other objects, and the commissioning of the artisans for the construction work, it naturally moves from describing the priestly garb to the ritual through which the priests are installed in their sacred office. First, sacrificial animals and bread are brought and prepared; then the priests are systematically clothed in their sacred vestments. After the first animal is slaughtered, its blood is dashed against the altar and the innards are burned as an offering; then the second ram is slain, and its blood is placed on the priests’ extremities, to purify them. Blood is sprinkled on the priests’ garments; then they hold up the fat-parts and breast of the ram, and follow by offering it up. Then the priests eat the cooked flesh of a special ram, the remains of which are to be burnt. Finally, the altar is purified."
"Torah, Exodus.44.2","After the regular sacrifice is specified (vv.38–41), the section ends with a powerful meditation on the purpose of the Tabernacle: “hallow” occurs three times, and “dwell” twice. In a word: by “meeting” with the Children of Israel at the Tent, God’s glory makes tent, altar, priests, and most important, the people of Israel, holy. Indeed, the root <i>kaddesh</i>, “holy,” occurs numerous times in the chapter, presaging its multiple use in the next book, Leviticus."

"Torah, Exodus.46.2","<i>The Anointing Oil</i> (30:22–33): “Holy” is once again heard as a key word, both in the sense of making something sacred and in the sense of being reserved for special use only. Oil was used in many ancient cultures for positive purposes; elsewhere in the Bible, of course, it played its role in the anointing of kings and prophets, as well as the courteous treatment of guests and after bathing. Oil, then, carried with it connotations of brightness (see Ps. 104:15) and life itself."

"Torah, Exodus.46.4","The offering-up of incense was a feature common to worship all over the ancient Near East. At least two reasons have been advanced for its use: purification, and a fragrance pleasing to the deity. It is also curious how our text speaks of God’s being with the Israelites as a column of cloud and of fire; the incense smoke might also then be reminiscent of this divine manifestation."

"Torah, Exodus.47.2","A second prelude draws the initial Tabernacle section to a close.

"Torah, Exodus.47.51","6 <b>Oholiav:</b> Trad. English “Oholiab”; the name means “Tent of Father/God,” rather appropriate here."
"Torah, Exodus.47.52","10 <b>officiating:</b> The Hebrew (<i>serad</i>) is not entirely clear, but may be related to <i>sharet</i>, “attending” (in the sanctuary)."
"Torah, Exodus.47.53","13 <b>However:</b> In contrast to all the previous activity, the Israelites are not to forget about the Sabbath, the “ceasing” from work (so too Rashi). <i>Akh</i> may also be taken as a positive term, “above all.”"
"Torah, Exodus.47.54","17 <b>paused-for-breath:</b> A rather daring anthropomorphism which, by describing God’s resting, encourages humans and animals to do the same (see 23:12)."
"Torah, Exodus.47.55","18 <b>He gave:</b> God gave. <b>the finger of God:</b> Just as in Egypt (8:15), God intervenes in human affairs here as well."
"Torah, Exodus.48.1","<i>The Sin of the Molten Calf</i> (32:1–6): We have spent twelve chapters—a major portion of the book of Exodus—dwelling on the heights of Sinai; we have witnessed revelation, law-giving, the command to build a shelter for the presence of God, and the establishment of a priestly cult. But now, as Moshe prepares to descend from the mountain, we are reminded of the other side of the coin: the real world of human frailty. This has occurred before, at the very same site: in Chaps. 19 and 20 we observed a fearfulness on the part of the people toward getting too close to the divine, as a power too awesome to deal with. Now the fear goes the other way, and, with the disappearance of Moshe, the intermediary, turns to despair. The very thing that had been warned against in the Decalogue (and hence, the first of the terms of the covenant)—the making of a “carved-image/or any figure/that is … on the earth beneath” (20:4), and bowing down to it (20:5)—takes place here, requested by the people in their hour of need. It is abetted by, of all people, their divine spokesman and priest, Aharon."
"Torah, Exodus.48.2","Some scholars have sought to soften the sin of the calf by claiming that the Israelites did not view it as an idol but rather merely as a representation of the divine. This does not seem to be borne out by the text, either in the Decalogue or later in the Jeroboam incident, which is often equated with the most heinous crimes (see I Kings 16:26)."
"Torah, Exodus.48.3","<i>Response: God’s Anger</i> (32:7–14): Now that the people have committed what amounts to a capital crime, the issue at stake is what the punishment shall be. After informing the unsuspecting Moshe of what has taken place down below, with the words “<i>your</i> people [italics mine] … has wrought ruin” (v.7), God indicates his intent to destroy Israel, and to found a new nation beginning with Moshe. However, early Jewish tradition already sensed that something deeper might be happening here. The phrase “let me be” (Heb. <i>hanniha li</i>), it has been observed, suggests that God actually wishes Moshe to argue with him, and this is supported by his acquiescence in record time (v.14). Indeed, the text never says “God’s anger flared up,” reserving that key verb for Moshe (v.19). What we learn from this section is not only God’s forgiving nature but something significant about Moshe: faced with a dictator’s dream—the cloning of an entire nation from himself—he opts for staunchly defending the very people who have already caused him grief through their rebelling, and who will continually do so in the ensuing wanderings. And he does not even eschew blackmail to attain his goal. His argument in v.12, that the Egyptians will jeer at this God who liberated a people only to kill them in the wilderness, rings truer in a pagan context than in the Bible. But the next verse reveals Moshe’s vision: he knows that his task is to continue the foundation established by the Patriarchs and to assure the continuity that has been imperiled so many times before."
"Torah, Exodus.48.4","32:1 Now when the people saw that Moshe was shamefully-late in coming down from the mountain,"
"Torah, Exodus.48.5",the people assembled against Aharon
"Torah, Exodus.48.6",and said to him:
"Torah, Exodus.48.7","Arise, make us a god who will go before us,"
"Torah, Exodus.48.8","for this Moshe, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.48.9",we do not know what has become of him!

"Torah, Exodus.48.12",and bring (them) to me.
"Torah, Exodus.48.13","3 All the people broke off the gold rings that were in their ears,"

"Torah, Exodus.48.16","fashioned it with a graving-tool,"

"Torah, Exodus.48.27",the people sat down to eat and drink
"Torah, Exodus.48.28",and proceeded to revel.
"Torah, Exodus.48.29",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.48.30","32:1 <b>saw:</b> Ironically, after all the “seeing” of revelation in Chaps. 19–24, what now impresses the people most is Moshe’s absence, leading to a need to make a god that can be “seen.” <b>was shamefully-late:</b> Others, “delayed,” but the Hebrew verb (<i>boshesh</i>) carries the connotation of “causing-shame/embarrassment.” <b>a god:</b> Others, “gods”; but there is one calf and one god that it represents. <b>go before us:</b> As in 23:23 the meaning is to lead, especially in battle."
"Torah, Exodus.48.31",2 <b>Break off:</b> Or simply “remove.”
"Torah, Exodus.48.32","4 <b>fashioned it with a graving-tool:</b> Others, “cast it in a mold” or even “tied it in a bag” (see Plaut). <b>calf:</b> Or young bull, symbol of fertility in Canaan. <b>This is your God…:</b> Cf. 20:2 above, “I am Y<small>HWH</small> your God, who brought you out….”"
"Torah, Exodus.48.33",5 <b>called out:</b> Or “proclaimed.”
"Torah, Exodus.48.34","6 <b>proceeded:</b> Or the Hebrew <i>kum</i> can be understood as “arose,” as opposed to “sat down” in the phrase to follow. <b>revel:</b> There seems to be a sexual connotation here (as in Gen. 26:8; 39:14, 17) which would support the use of the calf as the divine symbol."
"Torah, Exodus.49.1","<i>Response: Moshe’s Anger</i> (32:15–29): In a sense, the text backtracks chronologically here, to focus solely on Moshe. The first four verses are prefatory but important. Possibly to set the drama of the scene to follow, Moshe is described as carrying the “tablets of the Testimony,” which are dubbed the work of God. Yet another point is being made: the work of God is contrasted with the imperfect work of human beings, the law with its hope versus the idol with its underlying despair."
"Torah, Exodus.49.2","Sounds of revelry, implied as being worse than sounds of war, reach Moshe, and upon his descent into the Israelite camp he loses control. But smashing the tablets has implications beyond the emotional: it is a legal voiding of the covenant (as in the English “breaking an agreement”). Moshe deals with all concerned in swift succession: the calf is destroyed, Aharon is confronted, and the people are brutally purged."
"Torah, Exodus.49.3","It is possible that there are historical considerations behind this section. Some see the portrayal of Aharon, who certainly comes across as weak, as part of a strain in the political thinking of a later period. According to this view, the later decline of Aharon’s priestly line is reflected in his behavior here. Others see the “mandating” of the Levites (v.29) as a reflection of a later power struggle among the priestly classes in Israel. Childs finds Aharon’s role in the story to be a literary one: he is a foil for Moshe. Aharon is willing to capitulate to the people, seeing them (perhaps realistically) as “set-on-evil” (v.22). Moshe holds fast to his dream of a “kingdom of priests” (19:6) and thus demands of himself a type of leadership that cannot compromise. The Calf story, then, focuses not only on the great crime of idolatry but also on the nature of Moshe as leader. It is the resumption of the biblical portrait of Moshe, which will return again with greatest force throughout the book of Numbers."

"Torah, Exodus.49.41","I will give to your seed,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.42",that they may inherit (it) for the ages!
"Torah, Exodus.49.43",14 And Y<small>HWH</small> let himself be sorry concerning the evil
"Torah, Exodus.49.44",that he had spoken of doing to his people.
"Torah, Exodus.49.45","15 Now Moshe faced about to come down from the mountain,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.46","the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.47","tablets written on both their sides,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.48","on this-one, on that-one they were written;"
"Torah, Exodus.49.49","16 and the tablets were God’s making,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.50","and the writing was God’s writing,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.51",engraved upon the tablets.
"Torah, Exodus.49.52","17 Now when Yehoshua heard the sound of the people as it shouted, he said to Moshe:"
"Torah, Exodus.49.53",The sound of war is in the camp!
"Torah, Exodus.49.54",18 But he said:
"Torah, Exodus.49.55","Not the sound of the song of prevailing,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.56","not the sound of the song of failing,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.57",sound of choral-song is what I hear!
"Torah, Exodus.49.58","19 And it was,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.59",when he neared the camp
"Torah, Exodus.49.60","and saw the calf and the dancing,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.61","Moshe’s anger flared up,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.62",he threw the tablets from his hands
"Torah, Exodus.49.63",and smashed them beneath the mountain.
"Torah, Exodus.49.64","20 He took the calf that they had made,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.65","burned it with fire,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.66","ground it up until it was thin-powder,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.67",strewed it on the surface of the water
"Torah, Exodus.49.68",and made the Children of Israel drink it.
"Torah, Exodus.49.69",21 Then Moshe said to Aharon:
"Torah, Exodus.49.70",What did this people do to you
"Torah, Exodus.49.71",that you have brought upon it (such) a great sin!
"Torah, Exodus.49.72",22 Aharon said:
"Torah, Exodus.49.73",Let not my lord’s anger flare up!
"Torah, Exodus.49.74","You yourself know this people, how set-on-evil it is."
"Torah, Exodus.49.75","23 They said to me: Make us a god who will go before us,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.76","for this Moshe, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.77",we do not know what has become of him!
"Torah, Exodus.49.78",24 So I said to them: Who has gold?
"Torah, Exodus.49.79","They broke it off and gave it to me,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.80","I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."
"Torah, Exodus.49.81","25 Now when Moshe saw the people: that it had gotten-loose,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.82","for Aharon had let-it-loose for whispering among their foes,"
"Torah, Exodus.49.83",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.49.84",7 <b>your people:</b> God not so subtly renounces his kingship of Israel. <b>wrought ruin:</b> The verb <i>shahet</i> is often used to describe moral decay (see Gen. 6:11–12).
"Torah, Exodus.49.85","8 <b>turn aside from the way:</b> In the Bible, as in many religious systems, the correct mode of behavior is often called “the way” or “path.” Here it is probably elliptical for “the way of God.” Postbiblical Judaism calls its system of laws <i>Halakhah</i>, from the Hebrew <i>halokh</i>, “to go / walk.”"
"Torah, Exodus.49.86","9 <b>hard-necked:</b> Others, “stiff-necked.” The usage of “hard” ironically recalls the earlier hard-hearted character, Pharaoh."
"Torah, Exodus.49.87",11 <b>soothed:</b> Lit. “softened.”
"Torah, Exodus.49.88","12 <b>be sorry:</b> Others, “repent” or “change your mind.” <b>the evil:</b> Destruction. The biblical use of “evil” (<i>ra’</i>) corresponds more closely to our idea of “ill” as in “ill-fortune”; it includes not only immorality but also disasters that befall people."
"Torah, Exodus.49.89","13 <b>Recall:</b> This particular form of the verb <i>zakhor</i> (with the preposition <i>le</i>-) means “to remember to one’s credit” (Childs). <b>I will make…:</b> Recalling the promise to Avraham and Yitzhak in Gen. 15:5 and 22:17, also 26:4."
"Torah, Exodus.49.90",16 <b>God’s making … God’s writing:</b> In contrast to the “making” of the Calf.
"Torah, Exodus.49.91","17 <b>as it shouted:</b> Heb. <i>be-re’o</i>, possibly a pun on <i>ve-ra</i> (“set-on-evil”) in v.22."
"Torah, Exodus.49.92","18 <b>song:</b> Heb. <i>’anot</i>, as distinct from <i>shira</i> in 15:1. <b>prevailing … failing:</b> Heb. <i>gevura … halusha</i>, meaning “victory” and “defeat.” <b>choral-song:</b> Or “antiphonal (alternating) song.” The Hebrew is <i>’annot</i> as opposed to <i>’anot</i>. But some interpreters view it as identical to the two previous uses, and find something missing here (as in “the sound of ——— is what I hear”)."
"Torah, Exodus.49.93",19 <b>the calf and the dancing:</b> Apparently both angered Moshe. <b>beneath the mountain:</b> The very same place where the covenant was concluded! (Cassuto).
"Torah, Exodus.49.94","20 <b>burned … ground … strewed … made … drink:</b> The first three of these verbs also occur together in a Canaanite (Ugaritic) text, describing the goddess Anat’s destruction of the god Mot; our text perhaps plays off that literature (Childs). At any rate, Moshe’s action is the equivalent of making the Israelites “eat their words.” As has long been noted, this echoes the treatment of the suspected adulteress in Num. 5:11–31; the connection appears intentional, in light of the constant “marriage” imagery used of God and Israel in the Bible (Sarna 1986 discusses the parallels at length)."
"Torah, Exodus.49.95",24 <b>out came this calf:</b> Aharon’s reply sounds like that of a child who has been caught in the act.
"Torah, Exodus.49.96","25 <b>gotten-loose:</b> The same verb (<i>paro’a</i>) was used in 5:4, where Pharaoh complained about the Israelites. <b>for whispering:</b> A derisive kind of whispering."
"Torah, Exodus.50.1","<i>After the Purge</i> (32:30–33:6): Although blood has been spilled to punish the guilty, Moshe must still expiate Israel’s sin. In this vein, he offers to be erased from God’s “record” if the people are not forgiven. Then commences God’s reply, couched in terms of who will lead the people to the Promised Land. He will not do it himself, as previously (see the glorious image of 13:21–22), but through the agency of a “messenger.” He will fulfill his promise to the Patriarchs, but not himself among his “hard-necked” people. Their “sin” (the word occurs eight times in vv.30–34) has destroyed that possibility."
"Torah, Exodus.50.2","An interesting chord is struck at the end. Israel must strip themselves of their ornaments, the spoils of battle, as it were, from the Egyptians. Those ornaments had been used to build the Calf. The final note is ominous: God is yet to decide “what to do with you,” reminiscent perhaps of another scene with identical wording—2:4, where Moshe’s sister had followed the little-ark downstream, “to know what would be done to him.” In both cases, the people of Israel stand on the brink of disaster, saved only by divine intervention."
"Torah, Exodus.50.3","<i>Moshe at the Tent</i> (33:7–11): This brief digression seems to function as support for Moshe’s role, so important in the book as a whole and in this story in particular. Only one who is accustomed to speaking to God face to face can effect forgiveness for Israel’s crime."
"Torah, Exodus.50.4",26 Moshe took-up-a-stand at the gate of the camp
"Torah, Exodus.50.5",and said:
"Torah, Exodus.50.6",Whoever is for Y<small>HWH</small>—to me!
"Torah, Exodus.50.7",And there gathered to him all the Sons of Levi.
"Torah, Exodus.50.8",27 He said to them:
"Torah, Exodus.50.9","Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:"
"Torah, Exodus.50.10","Put every-man his sword on his thigh,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.11","proceed and go back-and-forth from gate to gate in the camp,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.12",and kill
"Torah, Exodus.50.13","every-man his brother, every-man his neighbor, every-man his relative!"
"Torah, Exodus.50.14",28 The Sons of Levi did according to Moshe’s words.
"Torah, Exodus.50.15",And there fell of the people on that day some three thousand men.
"Torah, Exodus.50.16",29 Moshe said:
"Torah, Exodus.50.17","Be-mandated to Y<small>HWH</small> today,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.18","even though it be every-man at the cost of his son, at the cost of his brother,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.19",to bestow blessing upon you today.
"Torah, Exodus.50.20","30 It was on the morrow,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.21",Moshe said to the people:
"Torah, Exodus.50.22","You, you have sinned a great sin!"
"Torah, Exodus.50.23","So now, I will go up to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.24",perhaps I may be able to purge away your sin.
"Torah, Exodus.50.25",31 Moshe returned to Y<small>HWH</small> and said:
"Torah, Exodus.50.26","Ah now,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.27","this people has sinned a great sin,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.28",they have made themselves gods of gold!
"Torah, Exodus.50.29","32 So now,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.30",if you would only bear their sin—!
"Torah, Exodus.50.31","But if not,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.32",pray blot me out of the record that you have written!
"Torah, Exodus.50.33",33 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.50.34","Whoever sins against me,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.35",I blot him (alone) out of my record.
"Torah, Exodus.50.36","34 So-now,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.37","go,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.38",lead the people to where I have spoken to you.
"Torah, Exodus.50.39","Here, my messenger will go before you,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.40","but on the day of my calling-to-account,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.41",I will call-them-to-account for their sin!
"Torah, Exodus.50.42",35 And Y<small>HWH</small> plagued the people
"Torah, Exodus.50.43",because they made the calf that Aharon made.
"Torah, Exodus.50.44",33:1 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.50.45","Go, up from here,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.46","you and the people that you brought up from the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.47","to the land of which I swore to Avraham, to Yitzhak and to Yaakov, saying:"
"Torah, Exodus.50.48",I will give it to your seed.
"Torah, Exodus.50.49",2 I will send a messenger before you
"Torah, Exodus.50.50","and will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite, the Hivvite and the Yevusite—,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.51",3 to a land flowing with milk and honey.
"Torah, Exodus.50.52","But: I will not go up in your midst,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.53","for a hard-necked people are you,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.54",lest I destroy you on the way!
"Torah, Exodus.50.55",4 When the people heard this evil word
"Torah, Exodus.50.56","they mourned,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.57",no man put on his ornaments (again).
"Torah, Exodus.50.58",5 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.50.59",Say to the Children of Israel:
"Torah, Exodus.50.60",You are a hard-necked people—
"Torah, Exodus.50.61","if for one moment I were to go up in your midst,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.62",I would destroy you!
"Torah, Exodus.50.63","So now, take down your ornaments from yourselves,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.64",that I may know what I am to do with you.
"Torah, Exodus.50.65",6 So the Children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Sinai on.
"Torah, Exodus.50.66",7 Now Moshe would take the Tent
"Torah, Exodus.50.67","and pitch it for himself outside the camp, going-far from the camp."
"Torah, Exodus.50.68",He called it the Tent of Appointment.
"Torah, Exodus.50.69","And it was,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.70",whoever besought Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Exodus.50.71",would go out to the Tent of Appointment that was outside the camp.
"Torah, Exodus.50.72",8 And it was:
"Torah, Exodus.50.73","whenever Moshe would go out to the Tent,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.74","all the people would rise,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.75","they would station themselves, each-man, at the entrance to his tent,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.76",and would gaze after Moshe
"Torah, Exodus.50.77",until he had come into the Tent.
"Torah, Exodus.50.78",9 And it was:
"Torah, Exodus.50.79","whenever Moshe would come into the Tent,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.80",the column of cloud would come down
"Torah, Exodus.50.81","and stand at the entrance to the Tent,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.82",and he would speak with Moshe.
"Torah, Exodus.50.83",10 And all the people would see
"Torah, Exodus.50.84",the column of cloud
"Torah, Exodus.50.85","standing at the entrance to the Tent,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.86","and all the people would rise,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.87","they would bow down,"
"Torah, Exodus.50.88",each-man at the entrance to his tent.
"Torah, Exodus.50.89",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.50.90",27 <b>every-man…:</b> The repetition stresses the horror of the situation.
"Torah, Exodus.50.91","28 <b>three thousand:</b> Another stereotyped number (e.g., Samson kills 3,000 Philistines in Judg. 16:27)."
"Torah, Exodus.50.92","32 <b>blot … out:</b> Erase, as in writing. <b>record:</b> Heb. <i>sefer</i>, earlier (17:14) rendered as “account.”"
"Torah, Exodus.50.93","34 <b>my messenger will go before you:</b> Apparently restoring the state of affairs promised in 23:20ff. <b>calling-to-account:</b> In Gen. 50:24, <i>pakod</i> meant “taking account of,” that is, remembering the Israelites in their Egyptian bondage."
"Torah, Exodus.50.94","35 <b>they made … Aharon made:</b> Heb. ambiguous; possibly a scribal error. Or the ambiguity may serve to shift the blame from the perpetrator to the act itself (Greenstein, personal communication)."
"Torah, Exodus.50.95",33:1 <b>the people that you brought up:</b> The use of “you” (Moshe) suggests that God still has not fully reaccepted them.
"Torah, Exodus.50.96","3 <b>I will not:</b> Myself, in person, as it were."
"Torah, Exodus.50.97","6 <b>stripped themselves:</b> This feels analogous to having one’s battle ribbons stripped off, or having one’s spoils taken away."
"Torah, Exodus.50.98","7 <b>outside the camp:</b> Already in early Jewish tradition it was pointed out that this phrase often has negative connotations (that is, one was sent outside the camp because of ritual impurity), and it has been suggested that our passage shows Moshe separating himself from the sinning people. On the other hand, it is usually the carrier/causer of impurity who goes outside!"
"Torah, Exodus.50.99",9 <b>he:</b> God.
"Torah, Exodus.51.1","<i>Moshe’s Plea and God’s Answer</i> (33:12–34:3): Continuing the dialogue with God from 32:34f., Moshe now pleads that what is necessary is nothing less than the personal assurance that God will lead the people. Six times the verb “know” echoes, along with repetitions of “pray” and “favor”—and so the issue at hand is intimacy and the bonded relationship of covenant. Significantly, also, Moshe refers to Israel three times as “your people,” trying to force God to acknowledge them as his own once more. Answering Moshe’s request for intimacy, God agrees to let him get close, but with limits, and we are reminded of Sinai once more (see the boundary-setting in 19:12–13, 21ff.). The earlier revelation scene is about to be replayed, in altered form—most notably, without the people themselves present."
"Torah, Exodus.51.2","<i>God Reveals Himself</i> (34:4–9): This passage is another one of the climaxes of the book, of which I spoke in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above. In contrast to the scenes given in other ancient literatures, where, for instance, the texts speak of a physical brightness too great to bear, or of epic descriptions of the gods, our passage is remarkably brief and devoid of physical description. All that is ventured here is a statement of God’s essence, or, more precisely, of his essence for human beings: merciful but just. This image, which had such a great influence on the development of Christianity and Islam as well as Judaism, is of the highest importance in the understanding of the biblical God; it is almost as if the text is saying “This is all that can be known, intimately, of this God, and this is all one needs to know.” There is no shape, no natural manifestation (in contrast to the thunder and lightning approach at Sinai—but one should bear in mind what has just happened with the Calf): only words, which describe God’s relationship to human beings."
"Torah, Exodus.51.3","Moshe hastens, at the climactic moment, to plead on behalf of the people. Most curious is the fact that God does not seem to agree to “go in their midst,” nor does he ever give in and reinstate Israel with the term “my people” (see v.10). Nevertheless, it appears that the rift between deity and people has been satisfactorily repaired, given what comes next."
"Torah, Exodus.51.4",11 And Y<small>HWH</small> would speak to Moshe
"Torah, Exodus.51.5","face to face,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.6",as a man speaks to his neighbor.
"Torah, Exodus.51.7","Now when he would return to the camp,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.8","his attendant, the lad Yehoshua,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.9",would not depart from within the Tent.
"Torah, Exodus.51.10",12 Moshe said to Y<small>HWH</small>:
"Torah, Exodus.51.11","See,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.12","you,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.13",you say to me:
"Torah, Exodus.51.14",Bring this people up!
"Torah, Exodus.51.15","But you,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.16",you have not let us know
"Torah, Exodus.51.17",whom you will send with me!
"Torah, Exodus.51.18","And you,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.19",you said:
"Torah, Exodus.51.20","I have known you by name,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.21",and you have found favor in my eyes!
"Torah, Exodus.51.22",13 So-now—
"Torah, Exodus.51.23","if I have, pray, found favor in your eyes,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.24","pray let me know your ways,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.25","that I may (truly) know you,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.26",in order that I may find favor in your eyes:
"Torah, Exodus.51.27","See,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.28",this nation is indeed your people!
"Torah, Exodus.51.29",14 He said:
"Torah, Exodus.51.30","If my presence were to go (with you), would I cause you to rest-easy?"
"Torah, Exodus.51.31",15 He said to him:
"Torah, Exodus.51.32","If your presence does not go,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.33",do not bring us up from here!
"Torah, Exodus.51.34","16 For wherein, after all, is it to be known"
"Torah, Exodus.51.35","that I have found favor in your eyes,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.36",I and your people?
"Torah, Exodus.51.37","Is it not (precisely) in that you go with us,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.38","and that we are distinct,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.39","I and your people,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.40",from every people that is on the face of the soil?
"Torah, Exodus.51.41",17 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.51.42","Also this word that you have spoken, I will do,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.43","for you have found favor in my eyes,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.44",and I have known you by name.
"Torah, Exodus.51.45",18 Then he said:
"Torah, Exodus.51.46",Pray let me see your Glory!
"Torah, Exodus.51.47",19 He said:
"Torah, Exodus.51.48",I myself will cause all my Goodliness to pass
"Torah, Exodus.51.49","in front of your face,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.50",I will call out the name of Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Exodus.51.51",before your face:
"Torah, Exodus.51.52","that I show-favor to whom I show-favor,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.53",that I show-mercy to whom I show-mercy.
"Torah, Exodus.51.54",20 But he said:
"Torah, Exodus.51.55","You cannot see my face,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.56",for no human can see me and live!
"Torah, Exodus.51.57",21 Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"Torah, Exodus.51.58",Here is a place
"Torah, Exodus.51.59",next to me;
"Torah, Exodus.51.60","station yourself on the rock,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.61",22 and it shall be:
"Torah, Exodus.51.62","when my Glory passes by,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.63",I will place you in the cleft of the rock
"Torah, Exodus.51.64",and screen you with my hand
"Torah, Exodus.51.65",until I have passed by.
"Torah, Exodus.51.66",23 Then I will remove my hand;
"Torah, Exodus.51.67","you shall see my back,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.68",but my face shall not be seen.
"Torah, Exodus.51.69",34:1 Then Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.51.70",Carve yourself two tablets of stone
"Torah, Exodus.51.71","like the first-ones,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.72",and I will write on the tablets the words
"Torah, Exodus.51.73",that were on the first tablets
"Torah, Exodus.51.74",which you smashed.
"Torah, Exodus.51.75",2 And be ready by the morning:
"Torah, Exodus.51.76","go up in the morning to Mount Sinai,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.77","station yourself for me there, on top of the mountain."
"Torah, Exodus.51.78","3 No man is to go up with you,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.79","neither is any man to be seen on all the mountain,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.80",neither are sheep or oxen to graze in front of this mountain.
"Torah, Exodus.51.81",4 So he carved two tablets of stone like the first-ones.
"Torah, Exodus.51.82",Moshe (started) early in the morning
"Torah, Exodus.51.83","and went up to Mount Sinai,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.84","as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.85",and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone.
"Torah, Exodus.51.86","5 Y<small>HWH</small> came down in the cloud,"
"Torah, Exodus.51.87",he stationed himself beside him there
"Torah, Exodus.51.88",and called out the name of Y<small>HWH</small>.

Cf. v.20, below. <b>Yehoshua,/would not depart:</b> Once again, he appears in a fragmentary way, but importantly, as Moshe’s attendant (and so he will be not only a military leader, as in 17:9ff., but also a spiritual one)."

Once the actual legislative content of the passage begins in v.17, one notes the continuation of the stylistic pattern which began with v.10: Deuteronomic language. The laws bespeak an agricultural society, not a nomadic one, and suggest that the warning against blending with Canaanite society may be from the perspective of a later period—an Israel long settled in the land. Although some scholars see Egypt as the origin of the Calf symbol, it also has a well-known existence in Canaanite mythology, as a symbol of Baal, god of fertility. Therefore the connection between our text and that of Kings may be close indeed, and the Calf story may have had a very contemporary ring to later audiences."
"Torah, Exodus.52.2","As is typical of the Calf narrative, our passage concludes, not only with wider issues—the formal writing-down of the covenant—but also with Moshe: that he neither ate nor drank during the encounter with God. We see the story both from its inception and its end concerned with the man whose task it must be to bring the divine word to the Israelite people."

"Torah, Exodus.53.1","<i>Moshe Radiant</i> (34:29–35): As if to underscore the point just made, and like the Tent section in Chap. 33, the Calf account ends with a focus on Moshe’s leadership. Gone is any reference to the molten image; the central concern is the effect of God’s communication upon Moshe. Indeed, “speak” occurs seven times here, and the formula “the skin of Moshe’s face was radiating” three times. Putting this section at the end of the narrative leaves the reader with the sense that Moshe’s prayer for God’s closeness in Chap. 33 has at last been answered, and that his very body now bears the sign of divine favor (note the use of the rich symbol of light). Communication between God and Moshe, with Israel witnessing and therefore involved again (in contrast to its removal from this activity at the beginning of Chap. 32), may now proceed again without interruption, and it will now be possible and appropriate to resume construction of the structure whose purpose it is to embody God’s presence in the world of human beings."
"Torah, Exodus.53.2",27 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.53.3","Write you down these words,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.4",for in accordance with these words
"Torah, Exodus.53.5","I cut with you a covenant, and with Israel."
"Torah, Exodus.53.6",28 Now he was there beside Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Exodus.53.7",for forty days and forty nights;
"Torah, Exodus.53.8",bread he did not eat
"Torah, Exodus.53.9","and water he did not drink,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.10","but he wrote down on the tablets the words of the covenant,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.11",the Ten Words.
"Torah, Exodus.53.12",29 Now it was
"Torah, Exodus.53.13",when Moshe came down from Mount Sinai
"Torah, Exodus.53.14","with the two tablets of Testimony in Moshe’s hand,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.15",when he came down from the mountain
"Torah, Exodus.53.16","—(now) Moshe did not know that the skin of his face was radiating because of his having-spoken with him,—"
"Torah, Exodus.53.17",30 Aharon and all the Children of Israel saw Moshe:
"Torah, Exodus.53.18","and here, the skin of his face was radiating!"
"Torah, Exodus.53.19",So they were afraid to approach him.
"Torah, Exodus.53.20","31 Moshe called to them,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.21","and then Aharon and all those exalted in the community came back to him,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.22",and Moshe spoke to them.
"Torah, Exodus.53.23","32 Afterward all the Children of Israel approached,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.24",and he commanded them
"Torah, Exodus.53.25",all that Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.
"Torah, Exodus.53.26","33 Now when Moshe had finished speaking with them,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.27",he put a veil upon his face.
"Torah, Exodus.53.28","34 And whenever Moshe would come before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, to speak with him,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.29","he would remove the veil, until he had gone out;"
"Torah, Exodus.53.30","and whenever he would come out and speak to the children of Israel that which he had been commanded,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.31","35 the Children of Israel would see Moshe’s face,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.32",that the skin of Moshe’s face was radiating;
"Torah, Exodus.53.33","but then Moshe would put back the veil on his face,"
"Torah, Exodus.53.34",until he came in to speak with him.
"Torah, Exodus.53.35",_____________
"Torah, Exodus.53.36","28 <b>Ten Words:</b> These are known in the Bible as such, not as the “Ten Commandments.”"
"Torah, Exodus.53.37","29 <b>radiating:</b> Or “radiant.” As is well known, Michelangelo created his famous horned statue of Moses (in the Roman church of San Pietro in Vincoli) on the basis of the Latin translation of the Bible, the Vulgate, which rendered the Hebrew <i>karan</i> as “horned.” There have now been found other ancient Near Eastern texts that support this reading, although the present context and comparative religion seem also to throw weight to “radiating.”"
"Torah, Exodus.54.1","<i>The Sabbath Restated</i> (35:1–3): Bracketing the Calf Narrative, we return to the regulations concerning the Sabbath, which receive here a different explanation from what was given in 31:12–17. There the stress was on the symbolic nature of the Sabbath day, but in the present context no reason for observance is given. Cassuto understands this as a clarification of the rules of “making” as the Dwelling is about to be constructed."
"Torah, Exodus.54.2","<i>The Contribution Restated</i> (35:4–19): The theme returns to that of the opening of the Tabernacle account in Chap. 25, with a list of what was to be brought for the “work of the Dwelling.”"
"Torah, Exodus.54.3","<i>Preparations for the Construction</i> (35:20–36:7): The account of what the Israelites brought as contributions for the work, and the description of those who were to carry it out, is long and repetitive. This factor, with the addition of a refrainlike pattern of key words (e.g., “mind,” “willing,” “service,” “work,” “wise,” “design,” “brought”), strongly portrays the people’s enthusiasm for and participation in the sacred task. Note also the fourteenfold occurrence of “every/all/entire” (Heb. <i>kol</i>) in vv.20–29. Vv.3–7 push the narrative to a crescendo, with the people actually bringing much more than is needed (and may also be a contrast to their briefly stated surrendering of jewels in the Calf episode, 32:3)."
"Torah, Exodus.54.4",35:1 Moshe assembled the entire community of the Children of Israel
"Torah, Exodus.54.5",and said to them:

"Torah, Exodus.54.39",and the fragrant smoking-incense;
"Torah, Exodus.54.40",and the entrance screen for the entrance of the Dwelling;
"Torah, Exodus.54.41","16 the site for offering-up and the bronze lattice that (belongs) to it, its poles and all its implements;"

"Torah, Exodus.61.1","<i>The Completion of the Parts: Bringing Them to Moshe</i> (39:32–43): The listing of all the elements of the Dwelling fittingly closes the account of their construction, with a certain grandeur, and, because of the pace, even a certain excitement. The key term “service (of construction)” occurs three times."
"Torah, Exodus.61.2","More significant is what has long been noted: the literal parallels between our section and the initial creation story in Genesis (see, for instance, Leibowitz and Sarna 1986). The phrases “Thus was finished …” (v.32), “And Moshe saw all the work: and here, they had made it” (v.43), and “Then Moshe blessed them” (v.43), echo “Thus were finished …” (Gen. 2:1), “Now God saw all that he had made,/and here: it was exceedingly good” (Gen. 1:31), and “God gave the seventh day his blessing” (Gen. 2:3). At the end of the passage describing the erection of the Tabernacle, there is an additional parallel: “So Moshe finished the work” (40:33); cf. Gen. 2:2: “God had finished … his work.” The close parallels suggest what we find in the case of many cultures: human building, especially (but not exclusively) of sanctuaries, is to be viewed as an act of imitating God. The Israelites, at the close of the book chronicling their founding as a people, link up with God’s scheme in creating the world. The Dwelling is therefore a reflection of the perfection of the world and the divine hand that oversees it. Yet neither the people nor Moshe pronounces the Genesis words “it was (exceedingly) good” over the sanctuary; that would be human <i>hubris</i>."
"Torah, Exodus.61.3","<i>Final Instructions: Setting Up</i> (40:1–16): Most prominent in God’s commands to erect the Tabernacle are two related verbs: “hallow” and “anoint,” each of which occurs in one form or another eight times here. So the major theme here is not the actual building, but dedication for a purpose. Included in this section, as it was in Part IV, is the appointment of Aharon and his sons to “be-priests.”"
"Torah, Exodus.61.4","The completion of the sanctuary takes place, appropriately, on the first day of what was the month of the exodus a year earlier; it is also ten months after the people reached Sinai. The dedication thus combines the ideas of sacred space and sacred time."
"Torah, Exodus.61.5","<i>The Implementation</i> (40:17–33): Meaningfully, the formula “as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe” ends each of the seven paragraphs that describe the erection of the Dwelling."

"Torah, Exodus.62.1","<i>The End: God’s Glory</i> (40:34–38): The book ends, not with a paean to the completed structure or its builders, but with a description of how its purpose was fulfilled. Central is the “cloud,” basically synonymous with God’s “Glory,” which now dwells among the people of Israel. At the end of the book of Exodus, which began with a people in servitude to an earthly god-king, we find a people that has completed one aspect of service to a divine king, ready to set forth on their journey to a Promised Land in the company of the king’s inextinguishable presence."

"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.0",(1-40)
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.1","T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> E<small>XODUS IS</small> I<small>SRAEL’S SECOND BOOK OF ORIGINS</small>. G<small>ENESIS HAD CONCERNED</small> itself with the beginnings of the world, of human beings and their institutions, and of the people of Israel as a tribal family. Exodus continues this thrust as it recounts the origin of the people on a religious and political level (here inseparable as concepts). A number of biblical ideas receive their fullest early treatment in this book: God’s acting directly in history; making himself “known” to both Israelites and foreigners; covenant as a reciprocal agreement between God and humans; law as an expression of total worldview; and the use of sacred structure (Tabernacle or “Dwelling”) as a vehicle for and expression of perceived truths about the world. In addition, several biblical institutions make their first appearance in Exodus: Passover, Sabbath, rudimentary leadership/government, and cult/priesthood. All this is presented in a general narrative framework, raising the question as to whether what we have here is story or history. Is Exodus a fanciful reconstruction of what happened to Moshe (Moses) and his generation, riddled with anachronisms? Or is it a faithful and reliable handing-down of eyewitness data which only the cynical or irreligious would doubt?"
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.2","For the first position there are several supports. We possess virtually no extra-biblical references to the events recorded in our book, either in Egypt or elsewhere. Then, too, there seem to be inconsistencies of time within the story (Chaps. 16 and 18 appear to presuppose laws which were given later), and patterns within the telling of the tale that are too symmetrical (the Plagues) or too stereotyped (the constant use of stylized language) to be simple reporting of fact. Finally, Exodus is lacking in the citation of personal and geographical names, especially as compared to the books that precede and follow (Genesis and Numbers)."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.3","For the second position, that of Exodus as a reliable historical record, there exist no methods of proof other than evaluation of literary form—that is, accepting that oral literature is able to preserve facts without later coloration. But even if it could be shown that Exodus is oral literature—an evaluation which is too sweeping, given the present form of the book—modern scholarship has come to cast doubt on the absolute historical reliability of oral tradition (see Vansina)."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.4","Despite these observations, there is still something unsettling about writing Exodus off as a work of fiction, however pious that fiction may have been. For the rest of the Hebrew Bible abounds in emotional references to the experience of the exodus. At every stage of biblical literature, that experience is invoked for the purpose of directing behavior (see especially Judg. 2, I Sam. 8, II Sam. 7, II Kings 17, Neh. 9, and Ps. 78; and most of Deuteronomy is rhetorically grounded in it). The entire structure and emotional force of biblical law rest upon such exhortations as “A sojourner you are not to oppress:/you yourselves know (well) the feelings of the sojourner,/for sojourners were you in the land of Egypt” (Ex. 23:9) and such situations as that of the Hebrew serf (Ex. 21:2ff.). Apparently the experience of the exodus period was crucial in forming the group consciousness of the Israelites, and ever since it has provided a model from which both later Judaism and Christianity were to draw frequently and profoundly."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.5","A hypothetical analogy, based on American history, may help to shed light on the historicity of Exodus. Imagine a book based on the following outline: first, a section on the American Revolution, with some biographical material on a few of the Founding Fathers, focusing mostly on the outbreak of the war and key battles; second, a description of the Constitutional Convention, including some of the more important speeches and discussions; third, the text of the Constitution itself; and finally, L’Enfant’s original blueprints for the building of the new capital, Washington, D.C., interspersed with accounts of the first few presidents’ inaugural addresses. What would be the underlying message of such a book? We are certainly dealing here with more than a straight journalistic description of the events, more than a legalistic discussion of constitutional law, and more than a technical presentation for architects. Such a book would actually be presenting the ideals of America’s self-image: a nation founded on the willingness to fight for particular rights against Old World tyranny, established under democratic laws based on reason and providing governmental checks and balances, and whose ideals would be embodied in the construction of a brand-new, centrally located capital city that used classically grounded forms of architecture to express grace and reason as the basis for the new society."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.6","Now this portrayal is very simplistic, but it gets its point across (and I would be willing to wager that, somewhere in this country, there exists a school textbook written along these lines). In a similar manner, although with much more weight given to God’s role in the process, the book of Exodus unfolds. The dramatic story of Israel’s deliverance from bondage, coupled with Moshe’s own early development, is only the first part of the book, and accounts for less than half of it. It is followed by several stories of desert wanderings, and then by a presentation of the covenant made between God and Israel at Sinai, against a stunning natural backdrop. The second half of the book enumerates a series of laws which constitute the covenant, and the details of construction of a portable sanctuary designed both to symbolize and actually to accommodate God’s presence among the Israelites (with the interruption of a major rebellion). So, like our theoretical American model, Exodus conveys far more than information about events. It is, rather, the narration of a worldview, a laying out of different types of texts bearing the <i>meaning</i> of Israel’s historical experience."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.7","I stress the word “experience” because that is what is at stake here. Human memory is always selective. We remember what we wish to remember, giving weight to particular emotions, sometimes over and above the facts (or, as the poet Maya Angelou puts it autobiographically, “The facts sometimes obscure the truth”). The same thing appears to be true of group memory. What a people remembers of substance is not nearly as important as how they process their experience."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.8","In our Exodus text one can perceive a characteristically Israelite process at work. The book emerges as a mix of historical recollection, mythical processing, and didactic retelling, what Buber and others have called a “saga.” What is preserved in the book of Exodus, therefore, is a Teaching (Heb. <i>Tora</i>) based on a set of experiences, which became history for ancient Israel. Hence, to understand better the workings of the book, we need to turn to its themes and its structure. This will be more fruitful than trying to find the exact location of the Sea of Reeds or Mount Sinai, or the “Lost Ark,” or Moshe’s burial site— of whose location “no man has knowledge until this day” (Deut. 34:6). These have all receded into archeological oblivion. What has survived of ancient Israel is its approach to history and to life, and its literature. In that sense, the book of Exodus is an attempt to distill history and to learn from it, using echoes from the past to shape the present and the future."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.9","When we turn to a closer consideration of the structure of Exodus, we must proceed on the assumption that a work of art stems from both artful and unconscious design. Therefore, any structuring of such a book can only be hypothetical and must not limit itself to ironclad categories."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.10","With that said, a number of potential divisions of our book present themselves. The first emerges from a close look at the subject matter of the text. Strikingly, Exodus appears to be arranged in groups of a few chapters each (bearing in mind that the chapter divisions are historically late), resulting in the following scheme:"
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.11","1. Prologue in Egypt (Chap. 1)<br>2. Moshe’s Early Life and Call (Chaps. 2–4)<br>3. Moshe’s Mission in Egypt (5:1–7:13)<br>4. The First Nine Plagues (7:14–10:29)<br>5. The Tenth Plague and the Exodus (Chaps. 11–13)<br>6. In the Wilderness I: The Deliverance at the Sea (14:1–15:21)<br>7. In the Wilderness II: Early Experiences (15:22–18:27)<br>8. Covenant at Sinai (Chaps. 19–20)<br>9. The Terms (Laws) and Conclusion of the Covenant (Chaps. 21–24)<br>10. Details of the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25–27)<br>11. Details of the Cult (Chaps. 28–31)<br>12. Rebellion and Reconciliation (Chaps. 32–34)<br>13. The Building of the Tabernacle, Priestly Vestments (Chaps. 35–39)<br>14. Conclusion (Chap. 40)"
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.12",Such a measured shifting of focus helps to maintain the flow of the text and our interest in it.
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.13","A glance through this list will also lead to the positing of larger structures. The traditions collected in Exodus fall naturally into both geographical and thematic divisions. The first part of the book takes place in Egypt (1:1–15:21), the second in the wilderness (15:22–40:38); this could alternatively be viewed as the events preceding Mount Sinai (Chaps. 1–17/18) and those that take place there (Chaps. 18/19–40). One could also combine the geographical and thematic aspects, resulting in the structure (1) Israel in Egypt (1:1–15:21), (2) Israel in the Wilderness (15:22–24:18), and (3) Tabernacle and Calf (Chaps. 25–40)."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.14","My own preference for structuring Exodus also combines these aspects, as follows:"
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.15",I. The Deliverance Narrative (1:1–15:21)
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.16",II. In the Wilderness (15:22–18:27)
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.17",III. Covenant and Law (Chaps. 19–24)
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.18",IV. The Blueprints for the Tabernacle and Its Service (Chaps. 25–31)
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.19",V. Infidelity and Reconciliation (Chaps. 32–34)
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.20",VI. The Building of the Tabernacle (Chaps. 35–40)
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.21","These divisions exhibit a great deal of overlapping. In Part I, Israel’s life in Egypt (Chap. 1) paves the way for Moshe’s early years (Chaps. 2–4), then the account of his mission before Pharaoh and the Plagues (Chaps. 5–13), and the final victory (Chaps. 14–15); Part II is anticipated by some of what happens after the exodus itself (Chap. 14), and leads to Sinai (Chap. 19); the covenant and laws of Part III naturally lead to other prescriptions, this time the building instructions for the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25–31); planning the sacred structure in Part IV is followed by the making of a forbidden construction, the Golden Calf (Chaps. 32–33); and the reconciliation between God and Israel (Chap. 34) restores Israel’s capacity to return to the actual building of the Tabernacle, and to complete it (Chaps. 35–40). So despite the presence of what must have been several very diverse traditions behind the final text of Exodus, it has been skillfully woven together to form a coherent whole. In addition to the above structures, it can be said that the book of Exodus rests on several textual backbones, inner structures and recurring themes and motifs that help to create a unified work. These may be listed by category:"
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.22","1. There are various climaxes which serve to highlight the action—the Encounter at the Bush (Chaps. 3–4), the Tenth Plague and Exodus (12:29–42), the Deliverance at the Sea (14–15:21), the Revelation at Sinai (Chaps. 19–20), the Calf Episode (Chap. 32), and Completion of the Tabernacle (Chap. 40). Anchoring these dramatic scenes, at the center of the book, is the Sinai Revelation. The Binding of Yitzhak (Isaac) in Chapter 22 of Genesis serves much the same focusing function."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.23","2. There exist three strategically placed accounts of God’s Presence accompanying the Israelites (13:21–22, 24:15–18, 40:34–38) which share a common vocabulary. Key words in these passages are “day/night,” “cloud,” “fire,” “dwell,” “Glory,” “cover,” “go up,” and “in the eyes of the Children of Israel/before the people” (it should be noted that not every passage uses all of these terms). These words chart God’s movement: first, following the Exodus; second, following the concluding of the covenant; and third, following the erection of the Tabernacle, at the end of the book. A variation of these Presence accounts occurs in Numbers 9:15–23, where it rounds out the picture—for it is at this point that the Israelites finally depart from Sinai (having spent about a year there), on their journey toward the Promised Land."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.24",3. Several leading words recur throughout the book and give it a sense of unity:
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.25","<i>serve</i>— The Israelites pass from “servitude” to Pharaoh into the “service” of God; laws are given that warn against “serving” other gods, that specify how a “serf” is to be treated, and that detail the “service” (i.e., construction and dismantling) of a sanctuary where God is to be properly “served.”"
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.26","<i>Glory</i>—Liberated from Pharaoh’s “stubbornness” (Heb. <i>koved lev</i>), the Israelites experience God’s “Glory” (Heb. <i>kavod</i>) at the Sea of Reeds, and encounter it again at Sinai (Chap. 24) and when the Tabernacle is completed (Chap. 40). When Israel falters in Chapter 32, Moses begs to see God’s “Glory” as a sign of reassurance. This is one of the central issues of the book, receiving its clearest formulation in Chap. 17:7—“Is Y<small>HWH</small> in our midst, or not?” Without the accompanying Presence, the Israelites can survive neither in Egypt nor in the wilderness. That the book ends with the “Glory” taking up residence in the Tabernacle is a sign that all is well in this regard."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.27",<i>know</i>—The Plagues and the liberation take place so that Egyptian and Israelite alike will acknowledge God as the true ruler (who “knows” the slaves’ sufferings). The book as a whole portrays a God who is “known” by his compassion toward the oppressed.
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.28",<i>see</i>—God “sees” and rescues the people early in the book (Chap. 3); they “see” his deliverance at the sea (Chap. 14) and the awesome display at Sinai (Chaps. 19-20); the Tabernacle blueprint is given to Moshe to “see” (Chaps 25ff.).
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.29","4. Aside from theme words, there are also several thematic threads that run through the book. These may be listed as well:"
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.30","<i>distinction</i>—The Israelites learn what it is to be separated out, first for oppression and later for God’s service. This process occurs during the Plagues and throughout the legal sections, which are often based on the making of distinctions (the Hebrew word for “holy,” <i>kadosh,</i> may originally have had this connotation). In general, Exodus is a book that abounds in polarities and distinctions: between God and Pharaoh, life and death, slavery and freedom, Egyptianness and Israeliteness, city and wilderness, visible gods/magic and an invisible God who is not conjurable, doubt and trust."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.31","<i>construction</i>—The Israelites are enslaved as builders of Egyptian cities; they go on to build a society, a calf-god, and a Tabernacle."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.32","<i>rebellion</i>—From the beginning, God and Moshe are often unheeded, as the Israelites seek to maintain or return to their status as dependent slaves in Egypt (Chaps. 2, 5, 14, 15–17, 32)."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.33","<i>Sabbath</i>—As a newly freed people, Israel is to adapt to a rhythm of work and sacred cessation, which celebrates both creation and freedom. The Sabbath is at issue immediately after liberation (Chap. 16) and is commanded three times (Chaps. 20, 31, 35); and the account of the Tabernacle’s completion echoes the vocabulary of God’s completed creation in Genesis 2, a passage which serves as one justification for observing the Sabbath (see Ex. 20:11)."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.34","<i>origins</i>—We are told of the beginnings of the new covenant (distinct from that concluded with Abraham), the law system, the cult/priesthood, and the sacred calendar, but with the significant omission of the monarchy."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.35","<i>covenant</i>—God establishes a relationship with the people of Israel: if they will obey him and observe his laws, he will protect them and treat them as his “firstborn son.” This form of covenant is different from the ones in Genesis, and plays a significant role in subsequent books of the Bible."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.36","<i>God in History</i>—The God of Exodus actively intervenes to rescue a people, defeating their oppressors in battle; he leads them through the wilderness, meets them, and makes a covenant with them."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.37","5. The above themes are specifically Israelite themes. There are, however, motifs in Exodus that have a more universal ring. One could term these anthropological, since they employ standard aspects of human experience to convey the overall messages of the book."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.38","<i>Fire</i> is used frequently and in varied contexts (at the Burning Bush and later back at Mount Sinai, in the desert trek, in the Tabernacle service, and at the Calf incident), usually to make a statement about God. In contrast to conventional fire gods (e.g., the Norse trickster Loki), the God of Exodus is most often associated with the more positive aspects of fire: constancy, purity, and transformation. The fire at Sinai does not destroy Moshe and the people, but rather turns them into something new. At the same time it should not be forgotten that fire is used regularly to connote anger in the Bible, especially God’s, and especially in the later wilderness narratives."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.39","<i>Water</i> appears throughout Exodus, not as a backdrop but as an active medium which most often signifies life and death simultaneously. The Nile, into which the enslaved Hebrews’ babies are thrown, gently bears the infant Moshe to safety: the Nile, the giver of life in Egypt, is changed into blood, itself a major signifier of life in the Bible but useless here because it is undrinkable; the Sea of Reeds acts as a passageway of birth for the Israelites but as a graveyard for their Egyptian pursuers. The availability of water becomes a central issue in the wilderness, as an instrument for survival and for the testing of the Israelites’ faith. Finally, water creates the ritual purity necessary for the people at Sinai and their priests in the Tabernacle to approach God."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.40","<i>Desert/Wilderness</i> is the scene of the crucial second part of the book. Only in the desert, away from the massive influence of age-old Egyptian culture, can the new Israelite society be forged. Moshe, like many other real-life and fictional heroes, demonstrates this in his own early life. The desert acts as a purifying agent for him, changing the Egyptian prince into a member of his own true people. Similarly, the Israelites begin the process of transformation from bondage to self-rule, a process which is taught in the harsh reality of desert life and which will take an entire generation to complete."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.41","In point of fact, all these media—fire, water, and desert—suggest change as a major concern of the book of Exodus. Our text chronicles the start of Israel’s journey as a nation, a transformative journey which takes vastly changed circumstances, a whole generation in time, and indeed several books of recounting to complete. Exodus is very concerned with topography—not for the purposes of historical recollection (as Genesis was, apparently) but as an account of an inner journey. Thus the people travel to the boundary between Egypt and the desert, through the sea, to the great fiery mountain; and we know that they cannot but be on their way to a final goal. That goal, the Promised Land, will not be realized in Exodus, because in this book we stand only at the beginning of the journey. Change does not occur quickly, and the true molding of a people, like that of an individual, requires formative experiences over time. In Exodus, then, the People of Israel begins in adolescence, as it were. It has survived infancy in Genesis, a period marked by constant threats of physical extinction, and must now begin the tortuous process of learning to cope with adulthood—that is to say, people-hood—in a hostile world."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.42","That process will take us past the present text. Exodus stands at the beginning of a trilogy in the middle of the Torah. It takes us from slavery up to Sinai, inaugurating the law-giving process. Leviticus will concentrate almost exclusively on laws (of “holiness”), never budging geographically, while Numbers will see the conclusion of the Sinai experience and the traveling toward (and actually reaching) the land of Israel. Exodus is thus of great importance in the overall five-book pattern, introducing key elements of the wilderness books: law, institutions, rebellion, and—Moshe himself. It serves as a bridge between the great narratives of Genesis and the priestly code of Leviticus and the wanderings of Numbers (Green­berg 1972 notes how the opening of Exodus points back, to Gen. 46; and the closing points forward, to Num. 9). It in fact contains elements of all three books."
"Torah, Exodus, On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure.43","Exodus is the basis not only of what follows in the Torah, but also sets the stage for the rest of the Hebrew Bible. What Israel understood of its God, and what that God expects of them, are set forth most directly and unforgettably in the memories enshrined in the book of Exodus."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.1",(1–15:21)
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.2","T<small>HE FIRST PART OF THE BOOK OF</small> E<small>XODUS IS PRESENTED AS A CONTINUATION OF THE</small> Genesis narratives, by abbreviating the genealogy of the immigrant Yaakov from Gen. 46:8–25. We find here the same centrality of God, the same kind of sparse but powerful biographical sketch of the human hero, and a narrative style similar to that of the previous book."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.3","And yet Exodus introduces a new and decisive element into the Hebrew Bible, which becomes paradigmatic for future generations of biblical writers. The book speaks of a God who acts directly in history, blow by blow—a God who promises, liberates, guides, and gives laws to a people. This is, to be sure, an outgrowth of a God who brings the Flood and disperses the Babel generation, but it is also a decisive step forward from a God who works his will in the background, through intrafamily conflicts (which comprise most of Genesis). This deity frees his people, not by subterfuge, but by directly taking on Egypt and its gods. Pharaoh and the Nile, both of which were considered divine in Egypt, are in the end forced to yield to superior power. Surely it is no accident that the ending of Part I—the Song of Moshe at the Sea—hails Y<small>HWH</small> as Israel’s true king, a king whose acts of “leading,” “redeeming,” and “planting” his people are exultingly affirmed in the body of the Song."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.4","Part I receives its structural coherence in a number of ways. For one, it encompasses a straight chronological narrative, moving from Israel’s enslavement to its liberation and triumph over its oppressors. The ending, Chapter 15, is rhetorically and stylistically fitting (see Gaster 1969), celebrating as it does the mighty deeds of God. For another, Part I carefully paces its climaxes, building up from the Burning Bush to various stages of Plagues, to the Tenth Plague/exodus and finally the great scene at the sea. There are also a number of key words that help to tie together various sections of the narratives: “know,” “serve,” and “see.” All of these go through interesting changes in meaning, through which one can trace the movement of central ideas (see the Commentary)."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.5","In the area of vocabulary, David Daube (1963) has made the interesting observation that the Deliverance Narrative uses a number of verbs that occur regularly in biblical law regarding the formal release of a slave: “send free” (Heb. <i>shale’ah’</i>), “drive out” (<i>garesh</i>), and “go out” (<i>yatzo</i>’). In addition, the motif of the Israelites’ “stripping” the Egyptians (3:22, 12:36) links up with the regulation of release in Deut. 15:13. “… you are not to send him free empty-handed.” Daube sees our text as bearing the stamp of Israelite social custom: Pharaoh is made to flout “established social regulations.”"
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.6","Finally, several scholars (Kikawada, Ackerman 1974, Fishbane 1979, and Isbell) have pointed out that the vocabulary of the first few chapters of the book foreshadows the whole of Part I. This use of sound and idea helps to create unity in these narratives (despite their possibly diverse origins), and is also of importance in viewing the biographical material in the first four chapters."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.7",<b>T<small>HE</small> E<small>ARLY</small> L<small>IFE OF</small> M<small>OSHE AND</small> R<small>ELIGIOUS</small> B<small>IOGRAPHY</small></b>
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.8","Dominating the early chapters of Exodus, more than the description of bondage itself, is the figure of the reluctant liberator, Moshe. The portrayal of his beginnings contrasts strongly with the classic hero stories of the ancient world."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.9","This is not immediately apparent. Moshe’s birth narrative parallels that of King Sargon of Akkad; his flight from Egypt and return as leader are reminiscent of Jephthah and David in the Bible, and of the Syrian king Idrimi (as recounted in Akkadian texts) as well. In addition, half a century ago Lord Raglan attempted to demonstrate common elements in hero biographies by compiling a list of up to thirty key motifs. Those relevant to Moshe include: the father a relative of the mother, an attempt made to kill him at birth, his escape through the action of others, being raised by foster parents, little information about his childhood, his traveling to his “future kingdom” upon reaching adulthood, promulgating laws, losing favor with the deity, dying on the top of a hill, not being succeeded by his children, and a hazy death/burial. Moshe therefore shares with Oedipus, Hercules, Siegfried, and Robin Hood, among others, a host of common elements; his point total according to Raglan’s scheme puts him toward the top of the list as an archetypal traditional hero. It must be concluded that, far from being a factual account, his biography is composed largely of literary constructs."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.10","When one looks closer at the biblical portrayal of Moshe, however, the purpose and particularly Israelite thrust of these constructs becomes clear. Almost every key element in Moshe’s early life—e.g., rescue from death by royal decree, rescue from death by water, flight into the desert, meeting with God on the sacred mountain—foreshadows Israel’s experience in the book of Exodus. The key theme of the distinction between Israel and Egypt, so central to the Plague Narrative and to Israelite religion as a whole, is brought out beautifully in the depiction of Moshe’s development from Egyptian prince to would-be liberator to shepherd in the wilderness, the latter an ancestral calling (cf. Nohrnberg, who also discusses Yosef as developing in exactly the opposite direction—from Israelite shepherd boy to Egyptian viceroy, complete with Egyptian appearance, wife, and name). What is important in these early chapters of Exodus, then, is not the customary focus on the young hero’s deeds (e.g., Hercules strangling serpents in the cradle) or his fatal flaw (although there is a hint of this too!), but on what he shares with his people, or, more precisely, how he prefigures them."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.11","Another aspect of these stories removes them from the usual realm of heroic biography. Elsewhere in the Bible, individual hero types are at least partially overshadowed by the true central “character”: God. This appears to be true in Exodus as well. Moshe develops only so far; he recedes as a full-blown personality during the Plague Narrative, to emerge sporadically in later encounters with the people (e.g., Chaps. 16 and 32–33; the portrait expands in the narratives of the book of Numbers). No wonder that later Jewish legend (and further, Christian and Muslim stories as well) found it necessary to fill in the tantalizing hints left by the biblical biographer, with sometimes fantastic tales. But in the Exodus text, it is God who holds sway. In this context, one is reminded that Israelite thinking had room neither for worship of human heroes nor interest in the biography of God (i.e., divine birth and marriage) on the model of surrounding cultures. The biblical portrayal of both God and Moshe has been reduced in our book to only such facts as will illuminate the relationship between Israel and its God. Thus we learn from the Moshe of Exodus much about the people themselves, and about prophecy (cf. Chaps. 3-4); from the God of Exodus, how he acts in history and what he demands of the people. More than that is not easily forthcoming from our text (interestingly, the Passover Haggadah picked up on the Bible’s direction and all but omitted Moshe’s name in the celebration of the holiday)."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.12","As we have suggested, later Jewish legend—some of which may actually be of great antiquity—sought to fill in various aspects of Moshe’s life that are missing from the Exodus text. A perusal of Ginzberg will uncover rich legendary material, dealing with Moshe’s childhood, family identity, experience in Midyan and elsewhere as a hero. While this material does not always illuminate the biblical story, it does demonstrate how folk belief includes a need for heroes in the classic Raglan mold; the Midrashic portrait of Moshe corresponds nicely to what we find in other cultures."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.13","Turning to stylistic characteristics of these early chapters, we may note that a good deal of repetition occurs, as if further to highlight the themes. Baby Moshe is saved from death twice; three times he attempts acts of opposing oppression; twice (Chaps. 2 and 5) he fails in his attempts to help his enslaved brothers; and twice (Chaps. 3 and 6) God reassures him with long speeches that center around the Divine Name. This kind of continuity is artfully literary, but it is also an echo of real life, where people often live out certain themes in patterns."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.14","Finally there is the matter of recurring words. Most important is the telling use of “see,” from the loving gaze of Moshe’s mother (2:2), through to the auspicious glance of Pharaoh’s daughter (2:6), then to Moshe’s sympathetic observing of his brothers’ plight (2:11); all this seems to be linked to the episode at the Burning Bush, where God “is seen” by the future leader (3:2), and where the climax of this whole development takes place: God affirms that he has “seen, yes, seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt…. and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them” (3:7, 9). Thus Moshe’s biography leads to, and is an outgrowth of, the people’s own situation."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.15","In sum, Moshe’s early biography leads us to ponder the “growing up” process through which the people of Israel must pass on their way out of Egypt. The narratives that deal with his leadership of the people in the wilderness period, from Ex. <i>16</i> on, will help to round out our picture of him as a real personality, with the tragedies and triumphs that are a part of human life but magnified in the case of great individuals."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.16",<b>O<small>N THE</small> J<small>OURNEY</small> M<small>OTIF</small></b>
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.17","World literature is dominated by stories involving a journey. More often than not, these tales are framed as quests for holy or magical objects (e.g., the Holy Grail), or for eternal youth/immortality (Gilgamesh). The classic pattern, as Joseph Campbell has described it, calls for the hero to make a kind of round trip, crossing dangerous thresholds (monsters, giants, unfriendly supernatural beings) both on the way toward the goal and on the way home. Either at the middle or at the end of the journey stands the goal, which often entails meeting with the divine and/or obtaining a magical or life-giving object (e.g., the Golden Fleece)."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.18","Such stories mirror our own longings for accomplishment and acceptance, as well as our universal desire to overcome the ultimate enemy, Death. In the hero’s triumphs, we triumph; his vanquishing of death cathartically becomes our own."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.19","This mythic substructure has penetrated the biblical tales, but it has been toned down for human protagonists, to suppress the idea of the mortal hero in favor of the divine one. Thus all the Patriarchs except Yitzhak (Isaac) go on fateful long journeys (his is reserved for the three-day trip to Moriah in Gen. 22), yet there is none of the color and adventure that we find, for example, in Greek mythology. Outside of Yaakov’s encounter with the mysterious wrestler in Gen. 32, there is little in Genesis to suggest hero tales on the classic mold. In Exodus, too, Moshe makes a significant journey—to Midyan—one might say, within himself, to find his true identity and calling, but it is highly muted, containing virtually no details. The round trip contains two thresholds of death, with Moshe first threatened by Pharaoh’s justice (2:15) and, on the way back to Egypt, by God himself (4:24–26). The initial goal is attained at the “mountain of God” “behind the wilderness,” where, meeting with divinity amid fire, he is finally able to integrate his own past, present, and future (as he will return to this mountain with the entire people in Chaps. 19ff). At the Burning Bush, the Egyptian prince, the Israelite shepherd, and the Hebrew liberator coalesce, investing Moshe with unique qualifications for his task."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.20","But it is to a larger journey framework that we must look to understand the “hero” content of Exodus, and with it, that of the Torah as a whole. The major journey undertaken is, of course, that of the people of Israel, from slavery to Promised Land. It is also a journey from death to life, from servitude to god-king to the service of God as king; along the way, death serves to purify an entire generation. And yet even this most obvious of journey stories differs markedly from those of gods and heroes so familiar in Western culture. The people of Israel function as a collective antihero, an example of precisely how not to behave. They play no active role whatsoever in their own liberation, use neither brawn nor wits to survive in the wilderness, constantly grumble about wanting to return to Egypt, and at both Sinai and the threshold of the Promised Land (in the book of Numbers), their chief form of behavior is first fear and later rebellion."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.21","Moshe’s own journeys parallel those of the entire people later on. Like them, he flees from Pharaoh into the wilderness, meets God at flaming Sinai, and has trouble accepting his task but must in the end. Here is where Moshe shines as the true leader: he epitomizes his people’s experience and focuses and forges it into something new."

"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.23","The heart of the Exodus story sets out the confrontation between the visible god-king, Pharaoh, who embodies the monumental culture of Egypt, and the invisible God of Israel who fights for his ragtag people. The drama is conveyed by means of alternating conversations/confrontations and events. The narrator has built his account, bracketed by the early approach of Moshe and Aharon (Aaron) to Pharaoh, which fails (Chap. 5), and the extended construct of the Tenth Plague (11—13); in between fall the schematically arranged first nine plagues."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.24","Three overall stages characterize this latter section. The first is indicated by the oft-repeated demand, “Send free my people, that they may serve me!”; the second is the “hardening” of Pharaoh’s heart; and the third, the unleashing of each plague. Further, it can be shown that the plagues are presented via a variety of structures and substructures (see Greenberg 1969 and the chart in Sarna 1986). Some commentators divide them into five thematic groups of two apiece—1 and 2, the Nile; 3 and 4, insects; 5 and 6, disease; 7 and 8, airborne disaster; and 9 and 10, darkness/death (Plaut). Also fruitful is the following threefold division: 1, 4, and 7, God’s command to confront Pharaoh in the morning; 2,5, and 8, God says, “Come to Pharaoh”; 3, 6, and 9, no warning is given to Pharaoh. Yet another grouping of themes is possible (Bar Efrat): 1–3, God vs. the magicians of Egypt; 4–6, stress on the distinction between Israel and Egypt; 7–9, the most powerful plagues."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.25","This utilization of order, symbolized by “perfect” numbers such as 3 and 10, finds a parallel in the creation story of Genesis 1 (where the key number, of course, is 7, 3 + 3 + 1, whereas here we have 3 + 3 + 3 + 1). Both texts display a desire to depict God as one who endows nature and history with meaning. The poetic tradition about the plagues, as represented, for instance, by Psalm 78, was content to describe the plagues in brief, within the setting of a single poem. The narrator of the Pentateuchal traditions, however, has a different point to make, and structured exposition is the best way to do it."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.26","There is another structural tendency that one may observe in the Plague Narrative. Repeating words and motifs comprise over twenty shared and discrete elements in the story. Since the vast majority of these occur by the end of the fourth plague, this leaves the narrator free to develop plagues 7 and 8 with particular intensity, using a full palette of descriptions, with the addition of the theme that these were the worst of their kind ever to take place in Egypt. It will be useful here to list a few of the key words and phrases, and motifs, that can be found in the Plague Narrative:"
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.27","<i>Words/phrases:</i> Go to Pharaoh; send … free; know; throughout the land of Egypt; plead; distinguish; tomorrow; man and beast; not one remained; heavy [i.e., severe] as Y<small>HWH</small> had said."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.28",<i>Motifs:</i> Moshe’s staff; Aharon as agent; magicians; death.
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.29","It is important to note here that the structuring of the plagues is not a perfectly balanced one. The narrative varies between exact repetition of elements and phrases and nonrepetition (Licht). By thus using sounds and ideas in variation, the narrator is able to weave a tale whose message constantly reinforces itself, and which holds the audience’s attention without getting tedious."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.30","I have deliberately omitted the question of Pharaoh’s heart above, as a separate issue. A host of expressions is used in the text to describe Pharaoh’s stubbornness: “harden” (Heb. <i>hiksha</i>), “make heavy-with-stubbornness” (<i>hakhbed</i>), and “strengthen” (<i>hehezik/hazzek</i>), with the resultant “refused” and “did not hearken.” This motif is the only one that occurs in all nine plagues, and therefore stands at the very heart of our narrative. When one notes the pattern within—that Pharaoh does the hardening at the beginning, God at the end—the intent begins to become clear. The Plague Narrative is a recounting of God’s power, and Pharaoh’s stubbornness, which starts out as a matter of will, eventually becomes impossible to revoke. The model is psychologically compelling: Pharaoh becomes trapped by his own refusal to accept the obvious (in biblical parlance, to “know”). Despite the prophetic idea that human beings can be forgiven, we find here another one—that evil leads to more evil, and can become petrified and unmovable."
"Torah, Exodus, I: the Deliverance Narrative.31","A final note about the backdrop of these stories. Cecil B. DeMille did it differently, and in the difference lies the gap between Western culture and biblical culture. In the movie <i>The Ten Commandments</i> (a strange title, given the actual content of the film!), DeMille’s own 1956 remake of his earlier silent film, great stress is put on the physical, visual trappings of Pharoah’s court. Apparently no expense was spared to bring in costumes, sets, and extras, and the result causes the audience to focus on the splendor of Egyptian culture, despite the fact that it is peopled by the villains of the story. In contrast, the Bible says practically nothing about the visual backdrop of the Plague Narrative. Just as Genesis made reference to the mighty culture of Babylonia by parodying it (for instance, in the Babel story of Chap. 11), Exodus strips down Egyptian culture by making it disappear, and by ridiculing its gods. The book saves descriptive minutiae for the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25ff.), preferring to stress the positive and simply to omit what it found as negative. This profoundly “anticultural” stance (see the intriguing analysis by Schneidau) was characteristic of Israel’s worldview and was a mystery to the Greeks and Romans who centuries later conquered the land; it was to stand the people of Israel in good stead in their wanderings through the centuries."
"Torah, Exodus, Ii: in the Wilderness.1",(15:22–18:27)
"Torah, Exodus, Ii: in the Wilderness.2","T<small>he wilderness narratives in the</small> T<small>orah must have been extraordinarily im</small>portant to the narrator/editor, as evidenced by their placement at this point in Exodus. Why did he/they see fit to insert here material which, chronologically at least, would fit better at a later point—for instance, in the book of Numbers (which reports essentially the same sort of incidents)?"
"Torah, Exodus, Ii: in the Wilderness.3","The answer comes from several quarters. The wilderness stories embody a key process for the Torah story: Israel’s passage from enslaved childhood to troubled adolescence, with a hopeful glance toward adulthood (the Promised Land). This process starts immediately after liberation; indeed, it is its direct result. Further, the three “desert themes” prominent in Chapters 15–18–“grumbling” against God and Moshe, hostile neighbors, and early self-government—are appropriate to include before the meeting at Sinai, in that they demonstrate dramatically the people’s need for reassurance, protection, group solidarity, and institutions (whereby they can live harmoniously). These narratives, therefore, lay out Israel’s precarious position and create the hope for a cure. It is only later on in the Torah, in the book of Numbers, that we will discover that the growing-up process in the wilderness could not be accomplished in a single generation."
"Torah, Exodus, Ii: in the Wilderness.4","The portrait of a people (or of an individual, as is often the case in religious literature) undergoing transformation in a place outside of normal geographic/cultural boundaries is a well-known phenomenon in traditional stories. Anthropologist Victor Turner speaks of the “liminal” experience, where the protagonist or initiant is separated spiritually and geographically from his origins in order to be changed into something new (see Fredman and Cohn). This is paralleled by the process of pilgrimage in the world of ritual, as can still be observed among many communities of the world to this day. The desert is the site of liminality par excellence: it is a harsh place that contains none of the succoring elements of human civilization, yet at the same time it leads the wanderer into truer communication with nature and the divine, metacultural forces of the universe. It is a place of betwixt and between, which mirrors the experiencer’s psychological state. In the case of Israel, later biblical sources speak of the wilderness period with striking force, either as an example of the people’s long-standing and deeply ingrained rebelliousness (e.g., Psalm 95), or fondly, as a kind of honeymoon period between God and Israel (e.g., Jer. 2:2). In both cases what is evoked is only a stage on the way, and not the final goal (see Talmon)."
"Torah, Exodus, Ii: in the Wilderness.5","Transformation always involves both life and death, and so it is not surprising that a characteristic theme of the stories before us is lack of food and/or water. The opening episodes of the section (15:22–17:7) comprise three scenes of “grumbling” about the difficulties of survival (with the structure: water-food-water), with a unique biblical twist: God and the people “testing” each other. And so the transformation depends very much on God’s action on the people’s behalf (twice he has to “instruct” them—the very verb from which the term “Torah” is derived). The suspension of the life process, or at least its imperiling, is notable also in the fact that, in contrast to the fertility of the Israelites in Egypt, “the trek narrative does not relate a single birth” (Cohn). This is especially striking given the strong birth image of Israel at the Sea of Reeds, which is still in the reader’s mind as the section opens."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.1",(19—24)
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.2","T<small>he narrative has returned to its source.</small> A<small>t</small> S<small>inai it had been foretold that</small> when Pharaoh “sends you free, you will serve God on this mountain,” and it is at Sinai that Moshe and the people now arrive. The fateful public meeting between the deity and the amassed human community will betoken the formal change of masters: the people, no longer enslaved by the Egyptian crown, now swear fealty to their divine Lord, who imposes rules of conduct upon them in return for his protection and their well-being."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.3","The settings for these events of covenant-making and law-giving are appropriately impressive. The mountain naturally functions as a bridge between heaven and earth (with only Moshe allowed to ascend!), but it is additionally accompanied on this occasion by the powerful manifestations of smoke, fire, cloud, thunder, lightning, and trumpet blasts. To try and pin down exactly to what natural phenomena the story alludes, be they volcano, earthquake, or the like, is somewhat beside the point; what speaks through the text is the voice of an overwhelming experience. Indeed, as Greenberg (1972) points out, the account in Chapter 19 may have been deliberately left ambiguous and contradictory, showing that the editor wished to include all the received traditions about the event."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.4","At the same time, it should be noted that the Sinai revelation resembles the appearance of the storm-god Baal in Canaanite texts, especially in the combining of thunder/lightning and earthquake. Psalm 18:8 portrays a similar scene. So as varied as the phenomena accompanying God’s appearance here are, they conform to a known literary pattern (Greenstein 1984c)."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.5","As mentioned previously, Sinai stands geographically at the center of the Israelite wanderings. As the textual center of the book of Exodus as well, it anchors the people of Israel on their journey toward the fulfillment of their destiny. But that function is purely a mythic one. Sinai never became an important biblical cult site, and the only later story to take place there, that of Elijah in I Kings 19, clearly stems from the desire to draw a parallel between Elijah and Moshe. The Hebrews apparently could not conceive of God’s abiding place’s being located outside the land of Israel. On the other hand, it was necessary to demonstrate that Israel’s laws and institutions arose, not out of normal settled political and economic circumstances, but rather as the direct gift and stipulation of God himself (see Cohn), and hence the choice of a site wholly removed from the great culture centers of the ancient Near East: the monolithic culture of Egypt, the ancestral heritage of Mesopotamia, and the fertility-based society the people were to encounter in Canaan. Sinai, the originating point of Israel as a self-defined community, had to start everything anew, on a stage in which all other considerations had been stripped away."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.6","Early in the history of biblical exegesis (the Midrash) it was noted that the events on Sinai resemble the conclusion of a marriage ceremony. Such an idea may even have been in the minds of the transmitters of the Exodus traditions. Indeed, the entire book is remarkably reminiscent of a pattern of rescue—courting—wedding with stipulations—home planning—infidelity—reconciliation—and final “moving in” (these stages fit into the general Part divisions I have used throughout the book). Lest this appear to be too Western a model, let it be noted that such analogies occur in the writings of the prophets, where the relationship between God and Israel is likened to that between husband and wife. This constitutes Israel’s version of what Joseph Campbell has termed “sacred marriage” in hero stories—not, as classically, the hero’s successful wooing of a goddess or semidivine creature, but an intimate relationship established between God and his people. As such, it is unique in the ancient world."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.7",<b>O<small>n</small> C<small>ovenant</small></b>
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.8","Marriage may be one imaginative model for the Sinai experience, but it was covenant that the writers wished to stress above all in these chapters. Here we observe a fascinating phenomenon that occurs again and again in biblical religion: an institution well known in the secular world is given a religious emphasis in the Bible. For covenant (others, “pact”) was a widespread form of political bonding in the ancient Near East. Kings and vassals, from Anatolia to Assyria, regularly aligned themselves in treaties involving either freewill granting of privileges or an agreement of mutual obligations between parties. A number of texts laying out the stipulations and ceremonies particular to covenant-making in the ancient Near East have been recovered, and study of them is helpful for an understanding of what we have in Ex. 19–24. Three things are clear. First, the stylistic pattern in our chapters resembles what is found in Hittite treaty texts (Mendenhall 1954); second, the Exodus passages use narrative to express these events, not merely a list of conditions; third, and most important, no other ancient society, so far as we know, conceived of the possibility that a <i>god</i> could “cut a covenant” with a people. This last fact leads to the observation that, for Israel, the true king was not earthly but divine—despite the later establishment of a monarchy (Weinfeld 1972b). Hence the narrator’s concentration on these chapters, especially considering the dramatic nature of what had gone before (Chaps. 1–15)."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.9","The covenant found in Exodus and subsequently in the Torah differs substantively from the two described in Genesis. Noah (Gen. 9) and all living creatures had been promised no further universal destruction, with the stipulation that human beings were not to eat meat with blood or commit willful murder. Avraham, too (Gen. 15, 17), was the recipient of a covenant: God would give him land and descendants, and Avraham was to attend to the circumcision of all his males (yet this is more sign than stipulation). What these early events have in common is the aspect of bestowal—God acts and promises, and human beings are the passive recipients. Exodus introduces the notes of mutuality and conditionality. Both parties are now to have a stake in the agreement, and it can be broken by either (as in Chap. 32; contrast this with the promise to Noah in Gen. 8:21–22, “I will never doom the soil again … never shall [natural processes] cease,” and Gen. 9:11, “Never again shall there be Deluge….”). From the Creator God we have moved to the God of History, who enters into a fateful relationship with the people of Israel (for more on this, see Sarna 1986)."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.10",<b>O<small>n</small> B<small>iblical</small> L<small>aw</small></b>
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.11","A century of modern Bible scholarship has led to far-reaching changes in the perceptions of biblical law. Initial archeological findings, which often included legal documents, had led comparativists to see in the biblical material a pale reflection of its Mesopotamian antecedents. The Code of Hammurabi, for instance, was deemed the source of some of the Exodus material. These early judgments have given way to a view that places more emphasis on what is distinctive about the biblical laws."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.12","For our purposes here, several brief points should be made, drawn from recent research; the reader may find them explored at greater depth in the essays by Greenberg (1970), Greenstein (1984), Paul, and Sarna (1986), and the work of Sonsino. Expressions of law in the ancient Near East, especially in documents from Mesopotamia, reveal a strong economic underpinning, tied to class structure. They also have at times a personal or political function. Hammurabi, for instance, presents his code with the express purpose that the gods and men may see what a just king he is. The laws are listed by category, with religion occupying its own sphere. Finally, the king acts as the enforcer of the laws, having received them from a god—who is nevertheless not their ultimate source. Law exists in the Mesopotamian texts as an abstract value, designed for the smooth functioning of society."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.13","By way of contrast, Hebrew law, as typified by our chapters, displays very different concepts and concerns. Class is hardly alluded to, reflecting a totally different kind of society economically but also expressing an ideal that began in the Genesis creation story with the common ancestor of the human race. The laws are presented as the terms of the covenant (our section is often termed the “Book of the Covenant”), and the motivation behind them is portrayed as historical/psychological (“… for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). Strikingly, the biblical regulations, not only here but in the other major collections as well (in Leviticus and Deuteronomy), blur the distinctions between religious and secular, and treat all law as a matter directly related to God. He is perceived as the source of laws; they are the expression of his will; and breaking them is a direct affront to and act of rebellion against him (contrast, for example, the modern American view)."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.14","The key concept behind much of biblical law seems to be that of Ex. 19:6, to make of the people of Israel “a holy nation.” This expression, which appears nowhere else in the Bible, combines a secular notion (the Hebrew <i>goy</i>, meaning a political body, a state) with a sacral one: this people is to transform all of its life into service of God. There is, therefore, no subject in the code before us—slavery, social relations, torts, cult, or diet—that is not of immediate concern to the biblical God. The first part of 19:6, “a kingdom of priests” (Buber: “a king’s-retinue of priests”), would seem to suggest that despite the clear existence of a priestly group in ancient Israel, the ideal approached a more democratic form of religious expression."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.15","This leads us to posit a final question: Are the materials in Ex. 21–24 (and other texts in the Torah that enumerate laws) to be taken as actual regulations or cases, or as something else, rather more didactic? We have little evidence for the former view, and in fact other ancient Near Eastern legal documents such as the Hammurabi Code seem to point in the other (didactic) direction. Given the nature of Torah literature, where narrative has a teaching function rather than a purely historical one, it seems plausible that the legal texts as well were intended to elucidate principles of Israelite belief—to present, as it were, a worldview. The other possibility, more in keeping with the history of law, is Daube’s (1947) view that “many ancient codes regulate only matters as to which the law is dubious or in need of reform or both.” In other words, law in day-to-day Israel was regulated by established precedents, and certainly not by Ex. 21–23, in the main. But in this case, too, our text would be instructive of the biblical mentality. For a fuller treatment of biblical law and its context in the ancient Near East, see Sarna (1986)."
"Torah, Exodus, Iii: the Meeting and Covenant At Sinai.16","Any attempt to describe this section structurally is bound to run into a roadblock; perhaps precisely because of the Bible’s desire <i>not</i> to distinguish between various categories of life, we do not have a watertight structure. Suffice it to say that, overall, most sections in these chapters begin with the general proposition “When …” (Heb. <i>ki</i>), and break down the issue under discussion into subsections beginning with “If …” (Heb. <i>’im</i>), a pattern found commonly in other legal systems as well. Beyond this, and the observation that there are some general categories and logical connections (for which, see the Commentary), one striking stylistic device in the Hebrew should be pointed out. From 21:5 through 23:24 a double verb form appears (the infinitive absolute followed by the imperfect) fully twenty-seven times. The effect of this device, which is rhetorically emphatic, is to give a sense of coherence to what are otherwise quite diverse laws."

"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.1",(25–31)
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.2","D<small>espite the importance of all that has preceded, the section of</small> E<small>xodus we</small> now encounter occupies a significant amount of text, and therefore commands our attention, in the overall scheme of the book. It may seem puzzling to modern readers that a book that purports to be about a people’s origins should choose to fill a third of its pages with a detailed description of a sanctuary, down to the last piece of tapestry and the last ritual vessel. Yet it is an indication of the “Tabernacle’s” centrality in Israel’s idea system that the story of its construction dominates the last half of Exodus."
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.3","Several factors may help to explain. First, the system of animal and grain sacrifices, or cult, was as important in ancient Israel as it was elsewhere in antiquity, as the chief means of formally expressing religious feeling. Indeed, the Bible traces this institution back to the beginning of human history, to Cain and Abel (Gen. 4:3–4). The cult’s centrality survived the railings of the Prophets and the destruction of Solomon’s Temple, and was still strong enough in late antiquity to provoke a severe crisis when its chief site, the Second Temple, fell to the Romans in the year 70 <small>c.e.</small> The latter event was a crux upon which the creation of classical Judaism took place, and the process was a painful one. So the opinion that many moderns have, that animal sacrifice was a barbaric custom, is quite beside the point as far as ancient Israel was concerned."
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.4","Second, there is the great theme of the book of Exodus, “Is Y<small>hwh</small> in our midst or not?” (17:7), to which our account gives a resounding positive answer. The book of Exodus traces not only the journey of the people of Israel from Egypt to Sinai, but also the journey of God to rescue the people and to dwell (“tabernacle”) among them (Greenberg 1972). A detailed presentation of God’s “residence,” as it were, is meant to convey the assurance that the people are led by God himself. This further supports the biblical image of the divine king, who dwells among his subjects and “goes before” them."
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.5","Third, the Israelites shared with their neighbors the idea that a victorious God, following his triumph, was to be honored by his enthronement in a human-built structure (see Hallo). Thus the last half of Exodus, far from trailing off into obscure priestly details, fits a well-known mold in its contemporary environment."
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.6","A final explanation of the prominence of the Tabernacle sections may be found in their intimate connection with the idea of the Sabbath. The “blueprint” chapters, 25–31, end with an extended passage on observing the Sabbath; the construction chapters, 35–40, begin with a brief passage on the prohibition of work on the holy day. These structural aspects suggest (as the ancient rabbis also saw) that cessation from work here means precisely from the tasks of construction, and that once a week human beings must step back from their own creating to acknowledge the true “work” of creation. Chapters 25–40, including the Golden Calf narrative, bring out these ideas through their use of refrainlike phrases, especially the repetition of one key word: “make” (Heb. <i>’asoh</i>). The entire section is an object lesson in what the Bible deems it proper for human beings to make, and is a vehicle of contrast between God’s creation and human attempts to reach the divine. Israel is engaged in the making of the Tabernacle (notice how “build,” which would make more sense, is not used); when the time comes for the work to be put aside temporarily, they are to “make” the Sabbath. To these observations may be added the long-observed fact that the vocabulary of the Tabernacle’s completion (“finished,” “work,” “blessed”) recalls the completion of Creation in Gen. 2:1–4. Thus we are taught that Israel, through its religious life as typified by Sabbath and cult, becomes a partner in the process of Creation, either by imitating the divine act or by celebrating it."
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.7","Other peoples, to be sure, recall the beginning of the world in ritual and story, so it is important to make an anthropological observation. The purpose of all sanctuaries is to build a bridge to the divine, to link up with the forces that transcend human beings. It is perceived that certain places are particularly appropriate for this (folklore terms such places “the navel of the earth”), and, by extension, sanctuaries firmly anchor that inherent holiness. What the Tabernacle account initially accomplishes, most notably in its closing chapter (40), is to transfer a topographic “bridge” to a human-made and portable one. With the completion of this Dwelling, we find God resident neither on Sinai nor in the later Jerusalem, but rather accompanying the people “upon all their marches” (40:38). The sacred center here thus moves; it is a portable anchor that establishes stability wherever it goes. The vitality that surrounded this idea is still to be seen in the successors of the Hebrew Bible, classical Judaism and Christianity, for whom, respectively, Torah and Cross provide a center that is at once movable and stabilizing."
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.8","But the sacred center, for biblical religion, finds equal expression in <i>time.</i> While the Dwelling account seems obsessed with matters of space, its setting among the Sabbath passages stresses more the concept of time. Such an aspect already begins to make itself felt in 24:16, where Moshe, on Sinai to receive the laws, waits for six days while the “cloud” covers the mountain, and is able to ascend only on the seventh day, at God’s summons. We are thus left, paradoxically, with a structure (Dwelling) which at first glance uses many well-known art forms and religious motifs common to the ancient Near East, but which is a total departure from them via its connection with the Sabbath—an institution with no known equivalent in the ancient world. The Dwelling account presents us with a people for whom sacred time takes precedence over sacred space (for more on these themes, see Sarna 1986)."
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.9","There have been many attempts, textually and artistically, to reconstruct the Tabernacle on the basis of our text here, the rationale being that surely so much detail as we find here will serve as the guidelines for an actual structure. Rabbinic and medieval Jewish commentators, as well as modern scholars, have expended considerable energy to that end. But in fact none of the reconstructions has succeeded, for, as with narrative, the text is as much message as description. The text’s main concern, it seems, is for the Dwelling to reflect holiness, in its choice of measurements and materials (see Haran 1985). The layout of the Dwelling expresses aesthetic ideas of perfection, through various symmetrical proportions (see Appendix); the materials are graded such that the closer one gets to God (in the “Holiest Holy-Shrine”), the more precious the metal. In addition, both the colors used and the types of workmanship employed are similarly graded. In a general way, the intent of the narrator seems to have been close to the intent of the great cathedral builders of the Middle Ages: to reflect divine perfection and order in the perfection and order of a sacred structure."
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.10","The Dwelling, as described in Exodus, resembles other ancient Near Eastern sanctuaries in many particulars (for which, see the Commentary below), as well as strongly reflecting aspects of the later Temple of Solomon (I Kings 6–7). Some scholars have also likened it to a Bedouin tent (Heb. <i>shakhen</i> seems to be an archaic verb for “to tent”), appropriate to desert conditions. It is perhaps all three, a coalescing of Israel’s ideas of the cult from a variety of historical and religious settings. That the Dwelling was viewed as historical is clear from biblical tradition itself (see II Sam. 7:6, for instance). But one should keep in mind that it is also a paradigmatic model, that helps to round out the overall scheme of Exodus. The book traces the progress of the people of Israel from servitude (to Pharaoh) to service (of God), and uses the human activity of building to do so. Thus, as Exodus opens, the Israelites are forcibly made to build royal storage cities; as the book ends, the people complete a structure through which they may serve the divine king."
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.11","Finally, there is the sequence of description in these chapters: the text begins with the blueprint for the holiest object, the “coffer” (ark), and proceeds through the structure in descending order of holiness. After the building instructions themselves are given, a number of related matters are treated, chief among them the attire of the priests and the ceremony consecrating the priests. The establishment of the cult, like that of the system of justice, is thus viewed as the command of God rather than the result of the need or request of human beings (contrast this with the “requested” monarchy in I Sam. 8)."
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.12","<i>The “Contribution”</i> (25:1–9): In the first seven verses of this opening section dealing with the Dwelling, the Israelites’ contribution toward the structure is described in detail; but only in v.8 is the purpose of this activity made clear. Despite the concreteness of the description, however, the actual blueprints, as it were, are shown to Moshe by God, and are not recorded in the text. Architects in the creative sense are superfluous here."
"Torah, Exodus, Iv: the Instructions For the Dwelling and the Cult.13","Moderns want to know where the Israelites procured such materials as gold and silver in quantity (see Chap. 38), or how they acquired the skills necessary for the fine artisanry involved (e.g., weaving, dyeing, manufacture of incense, and the setting of jewels). These questions, while logical in a historical setting, do not take the Bible on its own terms. The text appears to present the awed report of the Dwelling and its construction without leaving room for totally practical issues (just as Gen. 4 deals with Cain and his descendants without being concerned with the origins of Cain’s wife)."
"Torah, Exodus, V: the Covenant Broken and Restored.1",(32–34)
"Torah, Exodus, V: the Covenant Broken and Restored.2","W<small>ITHOUT THE STORY THAT FOLLOWS</small>, <small>THE BOOK OF</small> E<small>XODUS WOULD BE INCOMPLETE OR</small> at least hopelessly idealistic and idealized. Thanks to the inclusion of the Golden Calf episode, we recognize the people of Israel so familiar from the bulk of the wilderness narrative—stubborn, untrusting, and utterly unable to comprehend what has just occurred at Sinai (note the parallel between this section and 15:22ff.: after witnessing the awesome displays of God, the people fall prey to typical human anxieties about their own survival). We are also given a classic biblical description of God in this story—that he is demanding but also compassionate."
"Torah, Exodus, V: the Covenant Broken and Restored.3","There is no doubt that the narrative wishes to portray the breaking of the recently made covenant, and also to focus once again on the anxiety about God’s presence that pervades the whole book. Some see it as a political polemic, given that a similar story is found in I Kings 12:28ff., about Jeroboam’s split from the Solomonic monarchy; according to this theory, the Exodus account is a projection backward of the sin of the Northern Kingdom. Jeroboam, leading a secessionist movement, intended to set up a sanctuary to rival Jerusalem. At the same time, the Exodus story does appear first, and thereby helps to explain why Jeroboam’s deed was considered so terrible by later generations."
"Torah, Exodus, V: the Covenant Broken and Restored.4","But surely the Golden Calf story plays such an important role in the present book of Exodus as to sidestep the question of which version came first. It puts into sharp relief the nature of the people, its leader, and its God, and provides some insights into the complex relationships between these parties; it focuses particular aspects of the Tabernacle idea (see above); and it makes clear the difficulties of the emerging faith community."
"Torah, Exodus, V: the Covenant Broken and Restored.5","The story also contributes some welcome dramatic scenes at this point. It is as if the reader has awakened from a dream: major characters, including God himself, reemerge as real personalities, while secondary characters (Aharon and Yehoshua) are fleshed out. Everywhere there are fierce emotions: doubt, anger, panic, pleading for mercy, courage, fear. And, indeed, the entire enterprise of Exodus hangs in the balance, as God wishes only to destroy the faithless people (a rough parallel exists in Gen. 22, where all that has previously been promised to Avraham is threatened). Only after the stark emotions just mentioned have been cathartically absorbed, and the covenant restored, can there be a return to the task at hand—the building of an abode for the divine amid the very human community of Israel. As to the stylistic aspects of the story, we should note the repeated use of the verbs “see” and “know,” among others. Their transformation at different points of the story signals a return to these earlier Exodus themes, this time with a new urgency and a new enterprise at stake: the continuity of the fledgling people."

"Torah, Exodus, Vi: the Building of the Dwelling.1",(35–40)
"Torah, Exodus, Vi: the Building of the Dwelling.2","A<small>S IF NOTHING HAD GONE AWRY</small>, <small>THE NARRATIVE NOW RETURNS TO DESCRIBE HOW THE</small> Dwelling was built. This time, as was noted by the sages of the Talmud, the order follows the natural logic of construction (i.e., dwelling, tapestries, covering, boards, sockets, bars, etc., and then the ritual objects), rather than the earlier one of sanctity (i.e., coffer, purgation-cover, table, lampstand, etc., and then the structure itself). The most notable omission is the carrying out of priestly ordination; that is reserved for Lev. 8, perhaps so as not to interfere with the narrative momentum of the construction process, or else to focus more on the Dwelling itself and its divine resident. The only major interruption in this part is 38:21–31, which fits in with one of the important themes of these chapters: the extent of the Israelites’ contribution to the sanctuary."
"Torah, Exodus, Vi: the Building of the Dwelling.3","As there is no need to repeat what was said about each part of the Tabernacle in the commentary to Chaps. 25–31, the commentary here will be limited to brief remarks on the differences between the two long Tabernacle sections (Parts IV and VI); here Cassuto has provided most of the necessary material."

"Torah, Exodus, Appendix.2","According to the measurements given in Chaps. 25–30, the proportions are as follows:"
"Torah, Exodus, Appendix.3","Perfect Squares (1:1) are the Outer Court, the Inner Court, the Holiest Holy-Shrine, the Slaughter-site, and the Site for Incense."
"Torah, Exodus, Appendix.4","Perfect Rectangles (2:1) are the whole structure, the Holy-Shrine, and the Table."
"Torah, Exodus, Appendix.5","The relationship of the whole structure to each court is 2:1, as is that of the Holy-Shrine to the Holiest Holy-Shrine."
"Torah, Exodus, Appendix.6","The relationship of the entrances (Entrance, Screen, and Curtain) is 2:1:1."
"Torah, Exodus, Appendix.7","The Coffer and the Slaughter-site appear to stand at the exact centers of their respective squares. They share proportions different from those above: their length/width/height ratios are 5:3:3 (Coffer) and 5:5:3 (Slaughter-site). The departure from the standard 2:1 ratio may be an attempt to draw attention to these two holy objects, which functioned as the spiritual as well as geographical centers of the Israelite encampment in the wilderness."
"Torah, Exodus, To Aid the Reader of Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy.1","I<small>N THE</small> P<small>REFACE</small>, <small>I POINTED OUT THAT MUCH HAS CHANGED IN BIBLICAL SCHOLARSHIP</small> since the inception of Buber and Rosenzweig’s work. Nowhere is this as true as in reference to the last three books of the Torah. In the case of Leviticus, although the Israelite cult was of intense interest to nineteenth-century Protestant scholars such as Wellhausen, and Jewish scholars such as David Hoffmann, there has been a flowering of new work on this book in the last few decades. The opening up of ancient Near Eastern material on sacrifice and ritual, made possible by the scholarship of philologists, archaeologists, and comparativists in this century, and recent insights of anthropology, now bring to Leviticus a new level of comprehension and appreciation."
"Torah, Exodus, To Aid the Reader of Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy.2","Most outstanding in this regard is the work of Milgrom and Levine, who have also greatly advanced the understanding of the book of Numbers. The contributions of these scholars properly constitute in each case a lifework, and one cannot study Leviticus or Numbers without a close reading of what they have done. If as translator I have accepted only a percentage of what they have suggested, that is due to the constraints imposed by my method, and also to the unenviable task of deciding between them in areas where they disagree. Any reader serious about studying the Torah must consult their work. In line with these developments, I should note that I have relied less on B-R in translating the last three books than I did with the first two."
"Torah, Exodus, To Aid the Reader of Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy.3","A similar situation obtains in the case of Deuteronomy, with the many years of research done by Weinfeld. But the work of the three scholars mentioned here should not exclude the many fine commentaries that have appeared since the turn of the century, whether in such series as the International Critical Commentary or in individual volumes or studies of Israelite cult and law, by Jews and Christians alike. Then, too, the reader may turn to the <i>Anchor Bible Dictionary</i>, or the shorter <i>Harper’s Bible Dictionary</i>, for instance, for an in-depth look at many issues. Finally, I would like to single out the helpful introductions by Hallo in the Plaut commentary; these are now reprinted with additional material in Hallo 1991."
"Torah, Exodus, To Aid the Reader of Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy.4","I have therefore approached the last three books of the Torah with some trepidation and caution, knowing that to present them for the general reader in translation, and through brief notes and commentary, is an undertaking full of potential pitfalls. But these books, no less than the more famous and accessible first two, constitute the “instruction” or “teaching” found in the Five Books of Moses, and are well worth the effort required to experience them. The reader is directed to the works mentioned in “Suggestions for Further Reading” for the opportunity to digest the great wealth of material now available."
"Torah, Exodus, To Aid the Reader of Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy.5","For the sake of simplification, in the Commentary and Notes to these books, citations from the major commentaries of Levine, Milgrom, Weinfeld, and now Tigay (appearing variously in <i>The Anchor Bible</i> and <i>The New JPS Commentary</i>) are not followed by their publication dates; these appear in the “Suggestions” section just mentioned. The same holds for the Leviticus commentaries of Bamberger (in Plaut) and Wenham."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.1","<i>Varied Sacrificial Offerings I</i> (1): The first chapter begins with a description of the <i>ola</i>, the “offering-up,” which appears throughout the Bible as a standard sacrifice, frequently preceding others. It is characterized by being totally burned on the altar, and functions essentially to bring human beings to the attention of God and to win his acceptance. So the offering-up does not deal with sin, as later sacrifices do (Wenham)."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.2","This opening chapter of the book sets the standard pattern for the first seven chapters concerned with sacrifices. It lays out general rules about the preparation and presentation of the offerings; from 7:38 on and throughout the rest of the Torah, specific applications and how they work will be explained (Anderson). Enumerated are the kind of animal to be sacrificed (in order of value, and hence indicating that rich and poor alike have access to the system); the personal participation of the worshiper; and the tasks of the priests. Many of the phrases recur throughout the opening chapters of the book, but the main refrain is the concluding “fire-offering of soothing savor for Y<small>HWH</small>.” Three kinds of animals appear here; they are, again, all domesticated."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.3","<i>Varied Sacrificial Offerings II</i> (2): The <i>minha</i>, understood earlier in the Bible as simply “tribute” or “gift” (cf. Gen. 4:3 and 32:14), comes in the priestly texts to indicate specifically an offering of grain. Using a three-part structure of grain cooked in an oven/griddle/pan, paralleling Chap, 1’s cattle/sheep/birds, the description of the <i>minha</i> focuses on the type of grain offered, what is added to it, the strictures against fermenting, and the “covenant of salt.” The chapter ends with the usual refrain, “a fire-offering for Y<small>HWH</small>.”"

"Torah, Leviticus.1.60",_____________
"Torah, Leviticus.1.61","1:1 <b>And he called … Y<small>HWH</small> spoke:</b> The unusual syntax here links the opening of Leviticus with the revelation at Mount Sinai in Ex. 24:16, the only other passage in the Torah where God “called to Moshe” (in these exact words). Indeed, as Milgrom points out, from the end of Ex. 40 to Num. 9, the Torah contains the bulk of its laws given at Sinai after Ex. 20–23. Leviticus thus verbally returns to the revelation of law."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.62","2 <b>Anyone:</b> Including both men and women. As these texts unfold, I will be using “he,” as the Hebrew does, but both Hebrew and English should be understood as including both sexes in these contexts. <b>near-offering:</b> For this and the rendering of other technical terms, cf. “On Translating Leviticus,” above."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.63","3 <b>offering-up:</b> Or “ascent-offering.” Others, “holocaust,” to show that this sacrifice is to be wholly consumed by fire. <b>wholly-sound:</b> Perfect, unblemished—that is, fit for sacrifice. The adjective is used of humans as well (cf. Gen. 6:9, referring to Noah, and 17:1, referring to Avraham), in the sense of “wholehearted, perfect, full of integrity.” <b>before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> A refrain in these texts, usually indicating a location at the sanctuary."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.64","4 <b>lean his hand:</b> The meaning of this act has puzzled commentators. It may symbolize ownership, a statement of the reason for the sacrifice, or perhaps identification with the animal (as a substitute for the life of the worshiper). <b>to effect-ransom:</b> Heb. root <i>k-p-r</i> (again, see “On Translating Leviticus”). The aspect of “ransoming” mentioned here does not recur with the other sacrifices; some have postulated an original nonpriestly venue for this type of offering."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.65","5 <b>He is to slay … (for sacrifice):</b> Technically, slitting the animal’s throat. This is apparently done by the worshiper himself. As in similar cases, I have left the text ambiguous here regarding the principal actor. <b>dash the blood:</b> For Milgrom, this action prevents murder being imputed to the sacrificer—he has returned the “life” (namely, the blood) to God."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.66",6 <b>flay:</b> Or “strip the skin.” The hide (which goes to the priests) is the only part of the offering-up not burned.
"Torah, Leviticus.1.67","7 <b>Sons of Aharon:</b> The priests, not only Aaron’s own sons but those from the tribe of Levi, who were seen as descending from him."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.68","9 <b>fire-offering:</b> B-R render Heb. <i>ishe</i> with “fire-present”; some scholars link the word with Ugaritic <i>itht</i>, “gift.” Wenham notes the parallel with “food” in a number of passages. <b>soothing savor:</b> Or “scent of assent” (L. Rosenwald). It first appears in Gen. 8:21, where Noah offers sacrifices after the Flood, and the pleasing smell leads God to vow never again to annihilate the earth. So the function of the sacrifice in this chapter, at least, is to gain God’s favor and compassion."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.69","15 <b>its blood is to be drained out:</b> Not dashed against the altar; a bird does not contain much blood, compared to a grazing animal."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.70","16 <b>crissum:</b> The anal area (Milgrom); others, “crop,” the throat pocket where food stays during digestion."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.71","2:1 <b>flour:</b> As opposed to “meal,” this was made from the hard kernels of the wheat that remain after the removal of bran. Others, “choice flour,” “fine meal,” “semolina.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.1.72","2 <b>frankincense:</b> Perhaps an indicator of the festive nature of this sacrifice. <b>reminder-portion:</b> Others “token portion.” It apparently functions to remind God of the whole offering, most of which is eaten by the priests."
"Torah, Leviticus.1.73","3 <b>holiest holy-portion:</b> The phrase <i>kodesh kodashim</i> recurs in connection with the cult, indicating, variously, the inner sanctum of the Tabernacle (“Dwelling”), objects, and sacrifices. The food here is to be eaten by the priests in a holy area."
"Torah, Leviticus.2.1","<i>Varied Sacrificial Offerings III</i> (3): The purpose of the so-called <i>shalom</i> sacrifice has been debated. Levine, for one, sees it as a “sacred gift of greeting,” intended to address God in the fellowship of other laypeople and priests at a sacred meal. This communal, lay aspect of the sacrifice is significant. Some scholars have understood animal sacrifice to be essentially humanity’s way of bonding with the gods (as well as with dead ancestors), and would thus see in the present form, with its emphasis on the meat, an example of this idea."
"Torah, Leviticus.2.2","Unlike the obligatory sacrifices, the shalom sacrifice accepts a variety of animals, and the rules regarding them are not as stringent. Some theorize that originally all meat-eating in ancient Israel was of this type."

"Torah, Leviticus.2.63",4 <b><i>matza</i>/unleavened:</b> This is typical of Israelite practice; grain connected to the cult is not to be susceptible to rotting—because its imperfection would denigrate divine worship. Cf. v.11 below.
"Torah, Leviticus.2.64",5 <b>griddle:</b> Resulting in a crisp wafer-type food.
"Torah, Leviticus.2.65",7 <b>pan:</b> A frying pan; the result was a breadlike product.
"Torah, Leviticus.2.66","11 <b>date-honey:</b> Heb. <i>devash</i> may well have this meaning generally, even including the oft-used phrase “a land flowing with milk and honey.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.2.67","13 <b>with salt:</b> In a number of Middle Eastern cultures, continuing down to the present day, salt is used in the sealing of an agreement, hence the term “salt of the covenant” (others, “binding agreement”). Wen-ham points out that salt was considered indestructible in the ancient world, hence its use as a symbol of permanence here. Or it may simply be that the expensive and tasty nature of salt is the crucial factor here."
"Torah, Leviticus.2.68","14 <b>firstfruits:</b> Not literally “fruit,” but figuratively, the first-processed (= best) of the grain."
"Torah, Leviticus.2.69","3:1 <b>slaughter-offering of <i>shalom:</i></b> Or “slaughter-meal of <i>shalom</i>.” Earlier translations use “peace offering,” which is now felt less likely to be accurate than the widely accepted “sacred gift of greeting” (<i>shalom</i> connotes well-being, wholeness, and also greeting). <b>whether male or whether female:</b> Interestingly, female animals, usually excluded from sacrifice because of their reproductive value, are included here."
"Torah, Leviticus.2.70","3 <b>the fat</b> etc.: Perhaps symbolizing the choicest part of the animal, it denotes here the removable fat around internal organs. The kidneys may be stressed here because of the belief that they were, in humans, the seat of the emotions (Wenham)."
"Torah, Leviticus.2.71",4 <b>extension on the liver:</b> A protrusion at the lower part.
"Torah, Leviticus.2.72","9 <b>the whole thick tail:</b> This kind of sheep has a long, thick, bushy tail. It was highly valued, and hence appropriately offered to God."
"Torah, Leviticus.2.73","11 <b>food:</b> Heb. <i>lehem</i>, which in narrower contexts means simply “bread.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.3.1","<i>Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings I</i> (4): The first of these, the <i>hattat</i>, is the subject of voluminous recent debate among scholars. Formerly translated as “sin-offering,” it is now (thanks to Milgrom) understood more accurately as a purification offering in a variety of settings. The <i>hattat</i> decontaminates the sanctuary, and apparently individuals as well, and so is extraordinarily important in Israelite cultic thinking and practice. B-R rendered it (as have others) as a “de-sin offering,” which, while inelegant, preserves the biblical connection between sin (moral pollution) and ritual pollution. Again the sacrifice involves a multiple structure, dealing with the different components of the community: priests, community as a whole, leaders, and individuals. The High Priest’s ritual is more elaborate than those that follow, as befits the representative of the community. Once his ritual is complete, we encounter for the other parties the refrain “and he/they shall be granted-pardon.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.3.2","Central to the <i>hattat</i>-offering is the use of its blood as a detergent to absorb and purify the pollution that has accrued in the sanctuary. As a prime signifier of life, it will have this function a number of times in the Torah."

"Torah, Leviticus.3.10","15 the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, that is on the tendons,"
"Torah, Leviticus.3.11",and the extension on the liver—along with the kidneys he is to remove it.

"Torah, Leviticus.3.110",_____________
"Torah, Leviticus.3.111",16 <b>all the fat is for Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> This phrase extends beyond the usual ending pattern in these chapters of “a fire-offering for Y<small>HWH</small>”; the change is a rhetorical device meant to emphasize a point.
"Torah, Leviticus.3.112",17 <b>throughout all your settlements:</b> And thus beyond the holy places! (Levine)
"Torah, Leviticus.3.113","4:2 <b>sins:</b> Heb. <i>teheta’</i>; more properly, it means “fails” (B-R) or “misses” (as with an arrow). The word connotes giving offense to or wronging God (or another person). <b>in error:</b> That is, unintentionally."
"Torah, Leviticus.3.114","3 <b>Anointed Priest:</b> The High Priest. <b>bringing-guilt:</b> Or “blame.” He is responsible not only for his own actions, but his misdeeds potentially pollute the whole community, for whom he is the representative. <b><i>hattat:</i></b> Cf. “On Translating Leviticus,” above. It should be pronounced “hah<i>taht</i>.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.3.115","6 <b>in front of the curtain:</b> Separating the Holy Area from the “Holiest Holy-Shrine”; thus, sprinkling the blood near the curtain was as close as one could normally get to God (Milgrom)."
"Torah, Leviticus.3.116","7 <b>horns of the site:</b> The purpose of these four corner “horns,” found in archaeological remains all over ancient Israel, is unknown. Milgrom theorizes that daubing blood on them symbolically purified the whole altar, by means of the extremities symbolizing the whole."
"Torah, Leviticus.3.117",8 <b>set … aside:</b> Lit. “lift off.”
"Torah, Leviticus.3.118","11–12 <b>As for the skin</b> etc.: The High Priest cannot eat from his own <i>hattat</i>-offering in the same way that he eats from others’, as that would be in a sense profiting from his wrongdoing."
"Torah, Leviticus.3.119","13 <b>the entire community:</b> Here <i>eda</i> indicates the whole people, not just the leaders (as often elsewhere in the Torah) (Milgrom). The passage reinforces the idea of group responsibility, a concept well illustrated in Deut. 21:1–9, where a town must atone for an unsolved murder committed within its borders. <b>they do:</b> The community. <b>incur-guilt:</b> Whether or not they are cognizant of what they have done wrong (Levine)."
"Torah, Leviticus.3.120","20 <b>effect-purgation:</b> Or “effect-ransom.” <b>granted-pardon:</b> The verb is not used of humans in the Bible; so perhaps the idea is not forgiveness in the usual sense of “forgive and forget”—there is reconciliation, but punishment still occurs (Milgrom)."
"Torah, Leviticus.3.121",22 <b>leader:</b> Of a tribe (Wenham).
"Torah, Leviticus.3.122","27 <b>the people of the land:</b> JPS “populace.” In early biblical texts, this term usually denotes nobility, the “landed people.” In postbiblical Judaism, <i>am haaretz</i> came to indicate the “common folk,” often with the connotation of “the unlearned.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.4.1","<i>Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings II</i> (5): The last sacrifice described in these opening chapters is the <i>asham</i>, variously translated as “guilt-offering” and (more recently) “reparation-offering.” Its use varies, but can involve financial restitution for wrongdoing. There is disagreement about whether the verb means “to feel guilt” (Milgrom) or “to realize guilt”; in any event, the sacrifice deals with the realm of blame/liability, especially in cases of unintentional wrongdoing. Notable in this chapter are several refrains: “and the priest is to effect-purgation for him from his sin,” “it is a <i>hattat</i>-offering” (which returns here), and “he shall be granted-pardon.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.4.2","35 All of its fat he is to remove, as he removed the fat of the sheep from the slaughter-offering of <i>shalom</i>,"

"Torah, Leviticus.5.1","<i>Instructions on Disposing of Sacrifices I</i> (6): What happened to the sacrifices after their being offered belongs to the category of what Hallo calls “consumption”—that is, a complex system of either nonuse (burning), “payment” for the priests (eating), or permission for the worshiper to eat. Here again we encounter a threefold structure corresponding to groups of three sacrifices. This time, however, the order adopted depends on the frequency of the sacrifice, from daily to voluntary (Wenham). The chapter also introduces the important word <i>tora</i> (conventionally spelled <i>Torah</i>), “instruction,” which will recur at key points throughout the first half of Leviticus. It apparently originally meant “[priestly] rules/instructions,” but later came to connote portions of Moses’ teachings (especially Deuteronomy) and eventually the Five Books of Moses as a whole."

"Torah, Leviticus.6.111","18 <b>reckoned to him:</b> That is, “credited” to him. Since the sacrifice has not been disposed of properly, its efficacy is void (Bamberger). <b>Tainted-meat:</b> Or “desecrated meat” (Wright, cited by Milgrom).

"Torah, Leviticus.7.1","<i>Installing the Priests</i> (8): This chapter and the next, which might easily have followed the instructions for it in Ex. 29, has instead been placed here, perhaps as the logical conclusion to material about offering sacrifices. (Placing it at the end of Exodus might also have detracted from the impressive scene with which that book ends. For a discussion of the complex relationship between the Exodus and Leviticus texts, see Milgrom.) We now shift from a prescriptive mode to a descriptive, narrative one, which will prepare us for the brief but disastrous story of Aharon’s sons in Chap. 10."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.2","A refrain here is various forms of “as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe,” also a key phrase in the Exodus texts. In addition, one hears the constant use of the verb “make-holy,” appropriate in this context. Finally, one might point to the balance between Moshe’s sequence of action in Chap. 8 and Aharon’s parallel actions in Chap. 9."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.3","There is much in this chapter that is rhythmic. The description of Aharon’s being clothed in the holy vestments in vv.7–9 has the ring of ritual to it, as conveyed through its steady alternation of verb and garment."

"Torah, Leviticus.7.24",as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.25","10 Then Moshe took the oil for anointing and anointed the dwelling and all that was in it,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.26",making-them-holy.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.27","11 He sprinkled some of it on the slaughter-site, seven times,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.28","anointing the slaughter-site, all its vessels, the basin and its pedestal,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.29",to make-them-holy.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.30","12 He poured some of the oil for anointing on the head of Aharon, anointing him,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.31",to make-him-holy.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.32","13 Then Moshe brought-near the sons of Aharon,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.33","he clothed them in coats,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.34","he girded them with sash(es),"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.35","and wound them caps,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.36",as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.37","14 He brought forward the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.38","and Aharon and his sons leaned their hands upon the head of the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.39",15 and he slew (it).
"Torah, Leviticus.7.40",Moshe took the blood
"Torah, Leviticus.7.41","and put it on the horns of the slaughter-site, all around, with his finger, (thus) decontaminating the slaughter-site;"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.42",and the blood he poured out at the foundation of the slaughter-site.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.43","So he made-it-holy, for effecting-purgation upon it."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.44","16 Then he took all the fat that is about the innards,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.45","the extension of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.46",and Moshe turned (them) into smoke on the slaughter-site.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.47","17 The (rest of the) bull, its skin, its flesh and its dung,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.48","he burned in fire, outside the camp,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.49",as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.50",18 Then he brought-near the ram for the offering-up;
"Torah, Leviticus.7.51","Aharon and his sons leaned their hands upon the head of the ram,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.52",19 and he slew (it).
"Torah, Leviticus.7.53","Moshe dashed the blood against the slaughter-site, all around."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.54","20 Then the ram he sectioned into its sections,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.55","and Moshe turned into smoke the head, the sections and the suet."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.56","21 Now the innards and the shins he washed in water,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.57",and Moshe turned the entire ram into smoke upon the slaughter-site.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.58","It (was) an offering-up, for a soothing savor,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.59","it (was) a fire-offering for Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.60",as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.61","22 Then he brought-near the second ram, the ram for giving-mandate."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.62",Aharon and his sons leaned their hands on the head of the ram.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.63",23 and he slew (it).
"Torah, Leviticus.7.64","Moshe took some of its blood and put it on the ridge of the right ear of Aharon, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the thumb-toe of his right foot."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.65","24 Then he brought-near the sons of Aharon,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.66","and Moshe put some of the blood on the ridge of their right ear, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the thumb-toe of their right foot;"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.67","then Moshe dashed the blood on the slaughter-site, all around."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.68","25 He took the fat—the broad-tail and all the fat that is about the innards,"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.69","the extension of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh;"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.70",26 and from the basket of <i>matzot</i> that was before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Leviticus.7.71","he took one cake of <i>matza</i> and one cake of oil bread, and one wafer"
"Torah, Leviticus.7.72",and put (them) on the fat-parts and on the right thigh.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.73",_____________
"Torah, Leviticus.7.74","8:2 <b>the garments:</b> For Aharon and his sons, enumerated in some detail in Ex. 28."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.75","3 <b>at the entrance to the Tent:</b> Not necessarily <i>at</i> the entrance, but opposite it (Levine)."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.76",7 <b><i>efod</i>-vest:</b> A kind of embroidered apron on the High Priest’s garment. To it was attached the breastpiece.
"Torah, Leviticus.7.77","8 <b>the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Tummim:</i></b> Objects of unknown form contained in the breastpiece; they might mean “lights and perfections” or, alternatively, “A to Z,” but were in any event used in various parts of the Bible for the prediction of the future. The <i>efod</i> too is difficult to reconstruct from the Bible’s description. Levine sees it as a holdover from paganism, where statues of the gods were clothed in special garments (cf. Judg. 8:27 and 18:18, which refer to the worship of Gideon’s <i>efod</i>)."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.78","10 <b>the dwelling:</b> With a lowercase <i>d</i> in English, this indicates, not the Tabernacle itself, but the holy area, which contained the altars, the lampstand, and the table."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.79",14 <b>the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering:</b> Offered first here because the sanctuary must be purified before anything else can happen; and Moshe officiates since as yet there are no consecrated priests (Wenham).
"Torah, Leviticus.7.80","15 <b>decontaminating:</b> Or “removing-sin-from.” The two ideas are virtually identical here, creating an unsolvable translator’s problem."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.81","22 <b>giving-mandate:</b> Lit. “filling the hand,” i.e., installing the priests. Cf. note to Ex. 28:41."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.82","23 <b>ridge of the right ear … thumb … thumb-toe:</b> Probably, this use of the extremities symbolically includes the whole person, and it was the whole person that needed to be purified."
"Torah, Leviticus.7.83","24 <b>brought-near:</b> Playing on the frequent use of this verb, which usually means “sacrifice,” but here connotes “consecrate” or “initiate.” <b>dashed:</b> Parallel to the dashing of blood that signifies the making of a covenant in Ex. 24:6–8 (Levine)."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.1","<i>Installation Continued: The System in Operation</i> (9): Until now, the description of sacrifices has been largely from the viewpoint of the worshiper. Now the perspective changes to narrative, and is from the viewpoint of the priests—with the recognition at the same time that it is a public ceremony. Again, as Milgrom has noted, there is no verbal component to the ceremony (although some have argued that it is inconceivable that sacrifices could have been offered in silence). The sacrifice of the <i>hattat</i>-offering, along with other types of offerings, once again suggests the importance of a purified, perfect system in the worship of God."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.2","The refrain in vv.4 and 6 concerns God’s “being-seen” by the Israelites; what is in fact seen is his “Glory” or “aura,” reminiscent of Mount Sinai and the completion of the Dwelling in the book of Exodus. The ending of the chapter also recalls the ending of Exodus, with the leaders blessing the people and fire proceeding from God."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.3","27 He placed all (of them) on the palms of Aharon and on the palms of his sons,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.4","and they elevated them as an elevation-offering, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.5",28 Then Moshe took them from their palms
"Torah, Leviticus.8.6","and turned them into smoke on the slaughter-site, along with the offering-up."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.7","They are mandate-offerings, for a soothing savor,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.8",it is a fire-offering for Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.9","29 Moshe took the breast and elevated it as an elevation-offering, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.10","from the ram of mandating—for Moshe it was a portion,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.11",as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.12",30 Now Moshe took some of the oil for anointing and some of the blood that was upon the slaughter-site
"Torah, Leviticus.8.13","and sprinkled (it) on Aharon, on his garments, on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him;"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.14","(thus) he made-holy Aharon, his garments, his sons and the garments of his sons with him."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.15",31 Moshe said to Aharon and to his sons:
"Torah, Leviticus.8.16","Boil the flesh at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.17","there you are to eat it, along with the bread that is in the basket of mandating,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.18","as I have commanded, saying: Aharon and his sons are to eat it!"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.19","32 What is left of the flesh and of the bread, in fire you are to burn (it)."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.20","33 Now from the entrance to the Tent of Appointment you are not to go out, for seven days,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.21",until the time of fulfilling the days of full-mandating.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.22",For seven days (it takes) to fill your hands (in mandating).
"Torah, Leviticus.8.23","34 As has been done this day, Y<small>HWH</small> commanded to be done, to effect-purgation for you."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.24","35 At the entrance to the Tent of Appointment you are to stay, day and night, for seven days;"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.25","you are to keep the charge of Y<small>HWH</small>, so that you do not die,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.26",for thus I have been commanded.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.27",36 And Aharon and his sons did all the things that Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded by the hand of Moshe.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.28","9:1 Now it was on the eighth day,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.29","(that) Moshe called Aharon and his sons and the elders of Israel,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.30",2 and he said to Aharon:
"Torah, Leviticus.8.31","Take yourself a calf, a young of the herd, as a <i>hattat</i>-offerings, and a ram as an offering-up, wholly-sound,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.32","and bring-them-near, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.33","3 And to the Children of Israel you are to speak, saying:"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.34",Take a hairy-one of goats as a <i>hattat</i>-offering
"Torah, Leviticus.8.35","and a calf and a lamb, year-old ones, wholly-sound, as an offering-up,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.36","4 and an ox and a ram as a <i>shalom</i>-offering,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.37","to slaughter before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.38",and a grain-gift mixed with oil;
"Torah, Leviticus.8.39","for today, Y<small>HWH</small> will make-himself-seen by you!"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.40","5 So they took what Moshe had commanded, to the front of the Tent of Appointment,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.41","and there came-near the entire community, standing before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.42",6 And Moshe said:
"Torah, Leviticus.8.43","This is the word that Y<small>HWH</small> has commanded (that) you do,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.44",that the Glory of Y<small>HWH</small> may be seen by you!
"Torah, Leviticus.8.45",7 And Moshe said to Aharon:
"Torah, Leviticus.8.46","Come-near to the slaughter-site and sacrifice your <i>hattat</i>-offering and your offering-up,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.47","effecting-atonement on behalf of yourself and on behalf of the people,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.48","and sacrifice the near-offering of the people, effecting-atonement on their behalf,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.49",as Y<small>HWH</small> has commanded.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.50",8 So Aharon came-near to the slaughter-site
"Torah, Leviticus.8.51",and slew the calf for the <i>hattat</i>-offering that was his.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.52","9 Then the sons of Aharon brought-near the blood to him,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.53",he dipped his finger in the blood and placed (it) on the horns of the slaughter-site.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.54",The (remaining) blood he poured out at the foundation of the slaughter-site.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.55","10 Now the fat and the kidneys and the extension from the liver, from the <i>hattat</i>-offering,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.56","he turned into smoke on the slaughter-site,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.57",as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe;
"Torah, Leviticus.8.58","11 the flesh and the skin he burned in fire, outside the camp."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.59","12 Then he slew the offering-up,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.60","and the sons of Aharon handed the blood to him, and he dashed it against the slaughter-site, all around."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.61","13 The offering-up they handed to him in its sections, as well as the head,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.62",and he turned (them) into smoke upon the slaughter-site.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.63","14 He washed the innards and the shins,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.64","and turned (them) into smoke, along with the offering-up, upon the slaughter-site."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.65",15 Then he brought-near the near-offering of the people.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.66","He took the hairy-goat for the <i>hattat</i>-offering that was the people’s,"
"Torah, Leviticus.8.67","he slew it, and he sacrificed-the-<i>hattat</i>-offering, like the first-one."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.68","16 Then he brought-near the offering-up, sacrificing it according to regulation."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.69",_____________
"Torah, Leviticus.8.70","33 <b>the entrance:</b> Once again meaning the courtyard area in front of the “dwelling.” <b>for seven days:</b> A common period of sanctification in biblical Israel, found in reference to childbirth, holiday periods, etc. Seven was of course a number that pointed to perfection in the ancient world; it is emphasized in the sacred calendar outlined in Chap. 23 below."
"Torah, Leviticus.8.71",35 <b>so that you do not die:</b> The penalty for not taking extreme care with the priestly rules around the sanctuary. Cf. Chap. 10 below for a narrative example.
"Torah, Leviticus.8.72","9:4 <b>make-himself-seen by:</b> Others, “appear to.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.1","<i>Systems Failure</i> (10): As so often in the Torah, a brief narrative breaks in at this point, apparently to illustrate the dangers associated with the priests’ tasks that we have just celebrated in the previous chapter. Just as the sin of the Golden Calf followed scenes of revelation at Sinai, so here too we are taken from the pomp of the priests’ installation and set face to face with human failure. Alternatively, the story could be explained as a lead-in to the laws on priestly behavior in vv.9–11, just as the Golden Calf story precedes a remade covenant in Ex. 34."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.2","What exactly was Nadav and Avihu’s capital crime? Commentators over the ages have argued back and forth. Some see it as accidental: Nadav and Avihu somehow misconstrued what they were supposed to do—but divine service can brook no errors on the part of the people’s representatives. Other interpreters, taking their clue from v.9, feel that Nadav and Avihu were drunk and so not in full control of their ritual duties. Milgrom’s suggestion, that the story serves to warn the Israelite audience to stay away from offering their own incense (which often was connected to idolatry), makes historical sense; but the context of the tale here, after what has gone before, makes the specific crime less important than the idea that the priests must in general “get it right.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.3","The chapter has a three-part structure: crime/punishment/mourning; laws on drunkenness of priests and the proper disposal of the sacrifices; and a confrontation between Moshe and Aharon over ritual procedure, which is resolved, not by death but by reasoned discussion."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.4","17 Then he brought-near the grain-gift, filling his palm with some of it;"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.5",and he turned it into smoke upon the slaughter-site—aside from the morning offering-up.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.6",18 Then he slew the ox and the ram of the slaughter-offering of <i>shalom</i> that was the people’s;
"Torah, Leviticus.9.7","the sons of Aharon handed the blood to him,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.8","and he dashed it against the slaughter-site, all around,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.9",19 along with the fat-parts of the ox and of the ram:
"Torah, Leviticus.9.10","the broad-tail and what covers the kidneys, and the extension of the liver."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.11",20 They put the fat-parts over the breasts
"Torah, Leviticus.9.12",and he turned the fat-parts into smoke on the slaughter-site;
"Torah, Leviticus.9.13","21 the breasts and the right thigh, Aharon elevated as an elevation-offering, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.14",as he had commanded Moshe.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.15","22 And Aharon lifted his hands toward the people, and he blessed them,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.16","then he came-down from sacrificing the <i>hattat</i>-offering, the offering-up and the <i>shalom</i>-offering."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.17",23 Now Moshe and Aharon had entered the Tent of Appointment;
"Torah, Leviticus.9.18","when they came out, they blessed the people,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.19",and the Glory of Y<small>HWH</small> was seen by the entire people.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.20",24 And fire went out from the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Leviticus.9.21","and consumed, upon the slaughter-site, the offering-up and the fat-parts;"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.22","when all the people saw, they shouted and flung themselves on their faces."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.23","10:1 Now Aharon’s sons, Nadav and Avihu, took each-man his pan,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.24","and, placing fire in them, put smoking-incense on it,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.25","and brought-near, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, outside fire,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.26",such as he had not commanded them.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.27",2 And fire went out from the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Leviticus.9.28","and consumed them, so that they died, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.29",3 Moshe said to Aharon:
"Torah, Leviticus.9.30","It is what Y<small>HWH</small> spoke (about), saying:"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.31","Through those permitted-near to me, I will be-proven-holy,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.32","before all the people, I will be-accorded-honor!"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.33",Aharon was silent.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.34","4 Moshe called Mishael and Eltzafan, the sons of Uzziel uncle of Aharon,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.35",and said to them:
"Torah, Leviticus.9.36","Come-near, carry your brothers from in front of the Holy-Shrine to beyond the camp."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.37","5 They came-near and carried them, by their tunics, beyond the camp,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.38",as Moshe had spoken.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.39",6 And Moshe said to Aharon and to Elazar and Itamar his sons:
"Torah, Leviticus.9.40","Your heads, do not bare,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.41","your garments, you are not to tear,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.42",so that you do not die
"Torah, Leviticus.9.43",and he be furious with the entire community!
"Torah, Leviticus.9.44","Your brothers, the entire House of Israel, are to weep over the burning that Y<small>HWH</small> caused-to-burn."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.45","7 And from the entrance to the Tent of Appointment, do not go out, lest you die,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.46",for the oil of anointing of Y<small>HWH</small> (is) upon you!
"Torah, Leviticus.9.47",They did according to the word of Moshe.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.48","8 Now Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Aharon, saying:"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.49","9 Wine and intoxicant, do not drink, you and your sons with you,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.50","when you enter the Tent of Appointment,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.51",so that you do not die—
"Torah, Leviticus.9.52","a law for the ages, throughout your generations:"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.53","10 and so that there be-separation between the holy and the profane, between the <i>tamei</i> and the pure,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.54",11 and so that (you) might instruct the Children of Israel in all the laws that Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to them through the hand of Moshe.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.55","12 Moshe spoke to Aharon and to Elazar and to Itamar, his sons that were left:"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.56",Take the grain-gift that is left of the fire-offerings of Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Leviticus.9.57","and eat it unleavened next to the slaughter-site,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.58",for it is a holiest holy-portion.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.59","13 You are to eat it in a holy place,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.60","for it is for your allotment and your sons’ allotment, from the fire-offerings of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.61",for thus have I been commanded.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.62","14 But the breast of the elevation-offering and the thigh of the contribution, you may eat in (any) pure place, you and your sons and your daughters with you,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.63","for as your allotment and your children’s allotment they have been given (you), from the slaughter-offerings of <i>shalom</i> of the Children of Israel."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.64","15 The thigh of the contribution and the breast of the elevation-offering, along with the gifts of the fat-parts, they are to bring to elevate as an elevation-offering before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.65","it is to be for you and for your sons with you as an allotment for the ages,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.66",as Y<small>HWH</small> has commanded.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.67","16 Now about the hairy-goat of <i>hattat</i> Moshe inquired, yes, inquired, and here: it had (already) been burned!"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.68","And he became furious at Elazar and Itamar, the sons of Aharon that were left, saying:"

"Torah, Leviticus.9.70","For it is a holiest holy-portion,"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.71","and he has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the community, to effect-purgation for them, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.72","18 Here, its blood was not brought into the Holy-Shrine, inside;"

Ex. 30:9, about the prohibition of offering incorrect or unauthorized incense. <b>such as he had not commanded them:</b> Priestly institutions and practices in all cultures are essentially conservative, not innovative (Bamberger). The phrase itself is a pointed countering of the refrain constantly sounded in Chaps. 8 and 9, “as Y<small>HWH</small> commanded Moshe” (Wenham)."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.84","2 <b>fire went out:</b> An ironic echo of the positive divine fire that came down and completed the sanctifying of the sanctuary/priesthood, just two verses previously."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.85","3 <b>Through those permitted-near:</b> The priests. God seems to be saying that he is only so holy/honored as the behavior of the priests permits. Therefore the death of Aharon’s sons is a way of demonstrating that God’s holiness is established through correct performance of his commands, and the penalty for its abuse is death (cf. in this connection Num. 20, where Moshe is promised punishment by death outside the promised land for not having “proven God holy” in the performance of his duties)."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.86","6 <b>do not bare:</b> Lit. “do not let-loose (your hair).” The loosening of the hair and the tearing of the garments were common ways of expressing mourning in ancient Israel. The priests are forbidden to mourn here as part of the general prohibition against their coming in contact with the dead (since death is seen in priestly texts as the major source of <i>tum’a</i>). <b>he be furious:</b> God. The verb is often used in connection with plagues (Levine). <b>are to weep:</b> Or, “may weep,” that is, you may grieve over the punishment, but not over the deaths of Nadav and Avihu."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.87",7 <b>do not go out:</b> Remain in your priestly function.
"Torah, Leviticus.9.88",8 <b>Now Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Aharon:</b> This reassurance is the only time in Leviticus that God speaks directly to Aharon alone (Wenham).
"Torah, Leviticus.9.89","9 <b>Wine and intoxicant, do not drink:</b> Does this suggest that such was Nadav and Avihu’s crime? Or is it merely one on a list of prohibitions designed to guard against improper functioning of the priests in general?"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.90",10 <b>so that there be separation:</b> As the following chapters provide (Ibn Ezra).
"Torah, Leviticus.9.91",12 <b>and eat it:</b> Even though you are in mourning (Rashi).
"Torah, Leviticus.9.92","14 <b>children’s:</b> The Hebrew can be read as “sons’,” but surely both sons and daughters are meant here, as earlier in the verse (and several versions add “daughters”)."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.93",15 <b>allotment:</b> Heb. <i>hok</i> can be understood either this way or as “law” (this is true of many similar passages in Leviticus).
"Torah, Leviticus.9.94","16 <b>Moshe inquired … became furious:</b> Fishbane (1988) points out that Aharon’s failure to eat of the sacrifices is in line with Lev.9:15, but against the earlier and perhaps more authoritative law in 6:17–23. The text resolves the contradiction, and deals with the new situation of death as a factor, via divine oracle here."
"Torah, Leviticus.9.95","17 <b>bear the iniquity:</b> Eating the remains of the <i>hattat</i> is one of the two ways in which the sanctuary is purified (the other is the sprinkling of the blood) (Milgrom, Levine). <b>effect-purgation:</b> or “effect-atonement.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.9.96",18 <b>its blood was not brought:</b> “As is done in the case of most solemn offerings” (Bamberger).
"Torah, Leviticus.9.97","19 <b>such (things) as these:</b> The death of his two sons. Given that event, Aharon is justifiably cautious about the correct performance of his priestly duties."
"Torah, Leviticus.10.1","<i>The Dietary Rules</i> (11): After ten chapters devoted mainly to cultic rules, we move from the priestly altar to everyone’s table—a fine example of the dual concerns of Leviticus (later Judaism was in fact to dub the table an “altar in miniature,” taking literally the injunction in Exodus for Israel to become a “kingdom of priests”). The chapter, as mentioned in “On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure,” functions as a bridge between the first two parts of the book. As Hallo notes, it rounds out the question of consuming food, a major issue in sacrifices; it also introduces the motif of pollution in a systematic way (there were references to it in regard to sacrifices, but not in as full a manner). The use of “Instruction” in v.46 echoes the summaries of sacrifices in Chap. 7, while “you are to separate” in v.47 links the chapter with the previous one. Looking forward, “Instruction” is also used in the pollution chapters that follow, and the fivefold repetition of “hallow/holy” in vv.44–45 even points us toward the major section on Holiness in the third part of the book."
"Torah, Leviticus.10.2","It should be noted that, from vv.24–40, eating is not the issue, but rather coming into contact with the carcass of a <i>tamei</i> animal. The two areas are joined with the introduction of “swarming” creatures in vv.41–44, and the whole chapter concludes with a call to “separation.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.10.3","Refrains are many, giving the chapter a more poetic structure than one would expect from such a list: “it is <i>tamei</i> for you,” “it is a detestable-thing for you,” “it is an abominable-thing,” “according to its kind,” “<i>tamei</i> until sunset.” The overwhelmingly negative character of the refrains serves to drum in caution and promote avoidance."
"Torah, Leviticus.10.4","Many of the animals on the lists of Lev. 11 are familiar, but it must be stressed that, as with plant and place-names in the Bible, a number of the precise identifications have been lost to us, and educated guesses are in order."

"Torah, Leviticus.10.81",5 <b>hyrax:</b> A brown rodentlike mammal with short ears which is actually not part of the rodent family (also called the coney or rock-rabbit).

Milgrom, in defining the difference between “detestable” and “polluted” (<i>tamei</i>) creatures, finds that the former, unlike the latter, do not convey impurity, perhaps because they live in the water, which usually serves as a purifying agent."
"Torah, Leviticus.10.84","21 <b>on all fours:</b> What is meant here is unclear, since insects with wings always have six legs (Bamberger). Perhaps it connotes “the opposite of upright” (Douglas 1993a)."

"Torah, Leviticus.11.1","<i>Pollution from Childbirth</i> (12): This chapter, which is in chiastic relation to Chap. 15, designates a new mother as <i>tamei</i>, most likely due to her intimate contact with the life/death boundary during childbirth. Her separation from and reintegration into the community echo similar customs in many societies (see Bamberger); as often happens with life-cycle events, ritual here reflects what is happening psychologically. The doubling of the separation period when it is a girl that is born is best explained by the concept that a girl potentially doubles the “life-leak” that has taken place (Greenstein 1984a), since she will one day be a childbearing woman who will herself confront the life-death continuum."
"Torah, Leviticus.11.2","While men obviously do not contract ritual pollution through childbirth, the concept of pollution from bodily discharges applies to them as well, as in the case of an involuntary emission of semen (cf. Chap. 15)."

"Torah, Leviticus.11.4","Like other sections of Leviticus, this chapter and the next show signs of editing (for instance, the material in 13:47–59). Nevertheless, there is a clear structural pattern characterized by variations of “when … if … if” (Wenham)."
"Torah, Leviticus.11.5","The chapter’s character as “instruction manual” is brought out, according to Fishbane (1974), by its chiastic structure.

"Torah, Leviticus.12.1","<i>Purification from</i> Tzaraat (14): In 13:44–45 we were informed about the diseased person’s isolation from the camp. We now turn to the ceremony attending his purification and, from v.33 on, that of a house. In a complex ritual that foreshadows the great Purgation ceremony of Chap. 16 (with some connections to the ritual of purging the impurity of death in Num. 19), <i>tzaraat</i> is removed from its dangerous position in the camp. Many aspects seem to be archaic and even tinged with magic; in Milgrom’s view, these characteristics survive only symbolically, and ancient Israel has rid itself of dependence on magic—in his words, it has “eviscerated” demonism."
"Torah, Leviticus.12.2","The substances used for purification—cedar, scarlet, hyssop—seem to connote life (and hence remove the death symbolism of <i>tzaraat</i>): they all bear the red color of blood, which itself was the great biblical indicator of life (cf. 17:11 below). Notable is the adjective “living,” applied to both the birds and the water utilized in the ceremony."
"Torah, Leviticus.12.3","The purification ritual itself, interestingly, parallels the consecration of the priests in Chap. 8. This is particularly evident in the fourfold dabbing of blood on the right extremities of the diseased person (cf. 8:23, 24 for the corresponding action). In Chap. 8, movement took place from the everyday sphere into that of the holy; here, the person with <i>tzaraat</i> moves from isolation to eventual reintegration into society (i.e., the camp)."

"Torah, Leviticus.12.130",_____________
"Torah, Leviticus.12.131","14:2 <b>Instruction:</b> Here as elsewhere, the meaning of this key structural term in Leviticus is not far from “ritual.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.12.132","4 <b>live:</b> One bird will be killed, the other set free. <b>scarlet of the worm:</b> As in Ex. 25:4, obtained from crushing a small insect. <b>hyssop:</b> A bush known for its use in ceremonies as a kind of brush (cf. Ex. 12:22, where it is used to smear the blood on the Israelites’ doorposts in Egypt)."
"Torah, Leviticus.12.133","5 <b>slay:</b> Unlike the ritual killing of birds in 1:15, which is accomplished by the pinching of the creature’s neck. Hence this is not technically a sacrifice (Sifra, quoted by Bamberger)."
"Torah, Leviticus.12.134","6 <b>living water:</b> I.e., running water, also required for purification in v.50 and in the next chapter."
"Torah, Leviticus.12.135","7 <b>send-out:</b> The liberation of the live bird, into the open field (the countryside), sounds like a scapegoat ritual, whereby sins or noxious influences are driven into uninhabited space and hence disposed of."
"Torah, Leviticus.12.136","9 <b>shaves</b> … <b>his head, his beard:</b> Normally forbidden, but permitted here for purposes of purification (Levine)."
"Torah, Leviticus.12.137","10 <b>On the eighth day:</b> Paralleling circumcision, another ritual of integration into the community (Calvin, quoted by Wenham). <b><i>log:</i></b> A liquid measure, perhaps equivalent to a pint. Its equivalent is found in Ugaritic texts (Cohen)."
"Torah, Leviticus.12.138","17 <b>oil:</b> The oil serves to cover and protect the blood, so that the latter may do its purifying work (Greenstein 1984a); likewise in v.28."
"Torah, Leviticus.12.139","34 <b>Canaan:</b> As in Chap. 25, the law here reflects the later period of settlement and not the one of wandering in the wilderness."
"Torah, Leviticus.13.1","<i>Polluting Discharges</i> (15): This chapter concerns genital discharges—both those that arise from disease and those that are normal but involuntary. As Levine notes, sexual purity was crucial for approaching the Israelite sanctuary, as opposed to ancient Near Eastern rituals in general, where sexuality was frequently part and parcel of the worship of the gods."
"Torah, Leviticus.13.2","Such pollution was considered much more contagious than that we have encountered previously, which is not surprising, given the area in which it falls. Wenham has noted the chiastic structure here, with male and female interchanging with short-term and long-term events. The core (vv.16–24)—the normal flows of seminal emissions for men and menstrual discharge from women—contrasts with discharges resulting from disease (vv.2–12, 25–27). The former merely pollute until sunset (except for the case of a couple having intercourse during the wife’s period), and thus demonstrate the modesty and restraint in matters of divine worship more than pointing to some kind of stigma per se."

"Torah, Leviticus.13.89",48 <b>healed:</b> The language is figurative; it is as if the mold/mildew were a disease.
"Torah, Leviticus.13.90",15:2 <b>a-flow from his “flesh”:</b> A discharge from his genitals.
"Torah, Leviticus.13.91","4 <b>place-of-lying:</b> Either a bed, or, more likely, some padding on the floor."
"Torah, Leviticus.13.92",7 <b>flesh:</b> Here the meaning of the word probably reverts to any part of the body.
"Torah, Leviticus.13.93","11 <b>rinsed his hands:</b> That is, the polluted person. The nineteenth-century commentator S. D. Luzzatto understands “hands” as euphemistic for genitals—so the whole body needed to be immersed."
"Torah, Leviticus.13.94","14 <b>before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> This formula, which occurs frequently in priestly texts, is omitted in v.29 below; biblical women are not allowed the same cultic access to the divine as men (Wegner 1988)."
"Torah, Leviticus.13.95",18 <b>emission:</b> Lit. “laying” or “layer.”
"Torah, Leviticus.13.96",19 <b>(state of) being-apart:</b> Cf. note to 12:2.
"Torah, Leviticus.13.97","31 <b>have … avoid:</b> A form of the verb rendered “consecrate” in Num. 6. <b>that they not die:</b> Death would result, not from the pollution itself, but from carrying it into the sacred areas, and thus polluting them."
"Torah, Leviticus.14.1","<i>The Day of Purgation/Atonement</i> (16): This chapter forms the climax of the section that began in Chap. 11. It is, along with Num. 19, the purification ritual par excellence, and has received much attention throughout the ages. As modern commentators have pointed out, two things are happening here: first, the sanctuary is being purged of the ritual pollution that has accumulated from both priests and laypeople; and second, the accumulated sins of the community are receiving atonement. It is not surprising, therefore, that the chapter is built on different uses of the verb <i>kipper</i>, which can denote covering, purging, atonement (expiation), or ransom; here the two meanings “purging” and “atoning” seem to fit the double context best. Probably the “purging” part is the earlier one, as many ancient Near Eastern cults utilized purification ceremonies for their sanctuaries."
"Torah, Leviticus.14.2","Appropriately, the ritual includes two processes, outlined by Levine: riddance, which involves transferring sin to a living creature and driving it outside the community into the uninhabited wilderness, and purification, which utilizes the blood of a sacrifice (rather like the <i>hattat</i> encountered previously in the book). Both rituals are conducted largely by Aharon, who as High Priest acts on behalf of the entire community."
"Torah, Leviticus.14.3","Later Judaism was fascinated by these rites; a detailed account of how they were to be conducted in postbiblical times has survived in the Mishnah (ed. c. 200), and a narrative version is still verbally reenacted by traditional Jews once a year on the Day of Atonement."
"Torah, Leviticus.14.4","The chapter opens with direct mention of the deaths of Nadav and Avihu (Chap. 10). This serves at least two purposes: first, it creates a bracket into which the Leviticus texts on pollution occur; and second, it reminds the audience of the pressing need to purify the sanctuary, whose very first recorded defilement came about as a result of the illegitimate act of Aharon’s sons."
"Torah, Leviticus.14.5",16:1 Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe
"Torah, Leviticus.14.6","after the death of the two sons of Aharon,"
"Torah, Leviticus.14.7",when they came-near before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> and died;
"Torah, Leviticus.14.8",2 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Leviticus.14.9","Speak to Aharon your brother,"
"Torah, Leviticus.14.10","(so) that he (does) not enter, at (just) any time, the Holy-Shrine, inside the curtain, facing the Purgation-Cover that is on top of the Coffer,"
"Torah, Leviticus.14.11",that he (does) not die;
"Torah, Leviticus.14.12","for in a cloud I make-myself seen, over the Purgation-Cover."
"Torah, Leviticus.14.13",3 In this (manner) is Aharon to enter the Holy-Shrine:
"Torah, Leviticus.14.14","with a bull, a young-one of the herd, for a <i>hattat</i>-offering, and a ram for an offering-up."
"Torah, Leviticus.14.15","4 In a holy tunic of linen he is to dress,"
"Torah, Leviticus.14.16","linen breeches are to be upon his (naked) body,"
"Torah, Leviticus.14.17","with a sash of linen he is to gird himself,"
"Torah, Leviticus.14.18",with a turban of linen he is to turban himself;
"Torah, Leviticus.14.19",they are garments for the Holy-Shrine.
"Torah, Leviticus.14.20","When he has washed his body in water, he may dress in them."
"Torah, Leviticus.14.21","5 From the community of the Children of Israel he is to take two hairy goats for a <i>hattat</i>-offering, and one ram for an offering-up."
"Torah, Leviticus.14.22","6 And Aharon is to bring-near the bull for the <i>hattat</i>-offering that is his,"
"Torah, Leviticus.14.23",so that he may effect-atonement on behalf of himself and on behalf of his household.
"Torah, Leviticus.14.24","7 He is to take the two hairy (goats) and is to stand them before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Leviticus.14.25",at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.

"Torah, Leviticus.14.31","to effect-atonement upon it,"
"Torah, Leviticus.14.32",to send it away to Azazel into the wilderness.
"Torah, Leviticus.14.33","11 Then Aharon is to bring-near the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering that is his,"

Proposals include <i>ez azal,</i> meaning “a goat that escapes” (hence English “scapegoat”), and another reading signifying “a fierce region.” Many recent commentators, however, agree in seeing Azazel as the name of a wilderness demon, and hence the rite is taken as a vestige of an old pagan practice. Appropriately, in modern Hebrew <i>lekh la-azazel</i> is the equivalent of English “go to hell” or “get lost.” Regardless of the precise meaning of Azazel, that is, in fact, what the community wants to happen to its sins."

"Torah, Leviticus.15.1","<i>On the Shedding of Animal Blood</i> (17): This chapter appears to be either an appendix to the first two parts of the book (sacrifices and purity) or a transition between them and the chapters on “holiness.” It must be said, however, that it does not use the standard wording of the holiness chapters. The text deals with the Israelites’ slaughtering of animals for food outside the sanctuary (“Dwelling”), insisting instead that such killing take place “at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.” In contrast, Deut. 12:20ff. permits the slaughtering of animals for meat without bringing them to the sanctuary—provided that their blood is poured out (since the consumption of blood is universally prohibited in the Torah). Scholars disagree about which practice came first; some (e.g., Wenham) argue for a wilderness setting here, while others see the chapter as reflecting the antipagan feelings of postexilic Israel (Bamberger; cf. v.7). Whatever the provenance, our chapter is clear about the extraordinary power of blood in Israelite thinking. As the life, which belongs to God, it must be returned to him, either actually, at the altar, or symbolically, on the ground (Greenstein 1984a). Here it is seen as effecting ransom; the life of the sacrificial animal substitutes for that of the sacrificer (cf. “On Sacrifice,” above). The upshot is that the taking of animal life is done with extreme awareness and care."
"Torah, Leviticus.15.2","The chapter is built at least partially on repeating sound patterns. A threefold refrain is “that man is to be cut off from his kinspeople,” stressing the seriousness of the prohibition. Four times we hear “any-man, any-man” (Heb. <i>ish ish</i>), reinforcing the unusually broad scope of the command indicated by the beginning of the chapter (“to Aharon and to his sons and to all the Children of Israel”). Finally, in v.10 through 15, the word <i>nefesh</i> occurs nine times, with the alternating meanings of “person” and “life” (the pattern is 1–3–1–3–1 in these meanings)."

"Torah, Leviticus.15.41","for the life of all flesh—it is its blood,"

"Torah, Leviticus.15.53","29 <b>seventh New-Moon:</b> Today, Yom Kippur occurs in the first month of the Jewish calendar, in the fall; an earlier calendar viewed the spring as the beginning of the year (cf.

"Torah, Leviticus.15.57","4 <b>bloodguilt:</b> Such slaughtering seems to be equated with the murder of a human being. <b>cut off from amid his kinspeople:</b> Schwartz (1987) understands this as premature death (dying before one’s normally allotted time); Frymer-Kensky (1983) as dying without heirs. Greenstein, on the other hand, shows that it indicates execution, not by human beings, but by some kind of divine agency—perhaps as punishment “for transgressions that escape human detection” (personal communication)."
"Torah, Leviticus.15.58","7 <b>goat-demons:</b> Heb. <i>se’irim,</i> a common word for “hairy (goats),” but here with a clearly pagan ring."
"Torah, Leviticus.15.59",8 <b>an offering-up or a slaughter-offering:</b> Probably a merism indicating “any sacrifice” (Schwartz 1987).
"Torah, Leviticus.15.60",10 <b>eats any blood:</b> The prohibition against eating blood was unique to Israel in the ancient Near East (Bamberger). It has survived throughout the ages among Jews; those who keep the kosher laws still drain blood out of meat before cooking it (cf. v.13).
"Torah, Leviticus.15.61",11 <b>it effects-ransom:</b> Or perhaps “effects-atonement” for taking a life. We have already seen that blood “effects-purgation” for holy objects that have been ritually contaminated (cf. Chap. 16).
"Torah, Leviticus.15.62",14 <b>its blood is its life:</b> Heb. difficult.
"Torah, Leviticus.16.1","<i>Pollution from Forbidden Unions</i> (18): Now begin, thematically and stylistically, the chapters on holiness. Like much of this final section of the book, Chap. 18 is distinguished by its powerful use of rhetoric (cf. vv.3–5, similar in tone to much of Deuteronomy). Separation returns as a major theme, this time stressing the divide between Israel and the nations around (vv.3 and 27–30). The emphasis on sexuality mirrors that on food in Chap. 11; the two often reflect each other in culture, both in practice and in imagery Thus the wording here (“it is insidiousness,” “it is perversion”) parallels the rhetoric of Chap. 11 (“it is abomination,” “it is a detestable-thing”). Structurally, just as the laws on pollution began with categories of and distinctions between animals for the purpose of eating, so the holiness laws begin with categories of and distinctions between partners for the purposes of sexual relations (Eilberg-Schwartz, Goodman). The confusing of boundaries again becomes a grave matter."
"Torah, Leviticus.16.2","In Schwartz’s (1987) view, the list of forbidden women goes through a sequence from close relatives, to indirect ones, to women related to each other, and finally to other cases of “abomination.” In general, the list deals with women whose sexuality and reproductivity are controlled by males (Wegner 1992)—in other words, it reflects a highly patriarchal society."
"Torah, Leviticus.16.3","An odd omission of sexual prohibitions is the one between a man and his daughter; perhaps it was universally understood as the primary one, and hence did not require mentioning."
"Torah, Leviticus.16.4","Refrains in the chapter, which create its backbone, include “I am Y<small>HWH</small> your God” and the constant “the nakedness of X you are not to expose.” Late in the chapter, the words “abomination” and “<i>tum’a</i>” frequently recur."

"Torah, Leviticus.16.75","18:4 <b>do:</b> Elsewhere (especially in Deuteronomy) I translate Heb. ‘-<i>s-h</i> as “observe“; here, I have retained “do” as a theme word in v. 3–5."
"Torah, Leviticus.16.76","6 <b>kin:</b> Heb. <i>she’er, “</i>flesh, meat,” synonymous with <i>basar,</i> which, however, does not bear the additional meaning of “kin.” Note again the connection between food and sexuality. <b>exposing their “nakedness”:</b> To have sexual contact with them; “nakedness” is probably a euphemism for “genitals.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.16.77","7 <b>The nakedness of your father, and the nakedness of your mother:</b> Perhaps better understood as “the nakedness (reserved for) your father, the nakedness of your mother” (Levine). See Ehrlich’s earlier comments on Deut. 23:1."
"Torah, Leviticus.16.78",11 <b>the daughter of your father’s wife etc.:</b> It is not entirely clear what is meant by this case.
"Torah, Leviticus.16.79",14 <b>your father’s brother:</b> His “nakedness” is exposed by your sleeping with his wife.
"Torah, Leviticus.16.80","17 <b>insidiousness:</b> Heb. <i>zimma,</i> from a verb meaning “to scheme“; the word is sometimes translated as “wickedness, lewdness.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.16.81","18 <b>And a woman</b> etc.: As in the story of Leah and Rahel, Yaakov’s wives (Gen. 29–31)."
"Torah, Leviticus.16.82","19 <b>during her <i>tum’a</i> of being-apart:</b> Here, unlike in 15:24, the man is not merely ritually polluted until sunset, but sleeping with the woman during her period is regarded as a grave offense that cannot be expiated. This section of Leviticus evidently considers such an act on a par with bestiality and adultery; perhaps it too falls under the category of “forbidden mixtures” (in this case, semen and menstrual blood) that are mentioned in 19:19, or else the mixture is another instance of the life-death boundary being violated (Greenstein 1984a)."
"Torah, Leviticus.16.83","21 <b>… the Molekh:</b> While there is disagreement on the meaning here, it can be shown that this probably does refer to child sacrifice to a deity (Levine). A crucial question is why it intrudes on the list of sexual prohibitions. The answer may lie in the observation that to the Israelite mind, paganism (of which Molekh-worship was likely seen as the most egregious kind) was synonymous with sexual immorality."
"Torah, Leviticus.16.84","22 <b>With a male:</b> The condemnation of homosexuality here may reflect, once again, the issues of separation and categorization which are so prominent in the world-view of Leviticus."
"Torah, Leviticus.16.85","23 <b>perversion:</b> Or “confusion, mingling” (Frymer-Kensky 1983), adding to the strong vocabulary of condemnation in this chapter."
"Torah, Leviticus.16.86","25 <b>vomited out:</b> Once again, a food metaphor!"
"Torah, Leviticus.17.1","<i>General Regulations on Holiness I</i> (19): As the key chapter of this part of Leviticus, Chap. 19 is wide-ranging and rhetorically powerful. It extends holiness to virtually all areas of life—family, calendar, cult, business, civil and criminal law, social relations, and sexuality. Most (but not all) of the laws deal with what we would term ethics, that is, relations between people (Wenham notes the alternation of the terms “fellow [citizen],” “kinsman,” and “neighbor”). As such, they have become an exemplar and a cornerstone, at least in idealized form, in Western thinking about these issues."
"Torah, Leviticus.17.2","Structurally speaking, the chapter is not systematic. As Schwartz (1987)has noted, this is probably intentional, reflecting the desire to avoid categorization or compartmentalization of life before God. He lays out the structure of the core part of the chapter, vv.3–32, as discrete subsections, each ending with “I am Y<small>HWH</small> [your God],” with vv.33–36 as two appendices, and a summary in v.37."
"Torah, Leviticus.17.3","The opening (v.2) is crucial, even though the word-root “holy” does not recur in the chapter (it does, however, reverberate within the next four chapters). The style is predominantly apodictic—“You are not to …,” as was Chap. 18, and concentrates mostly on the negating of certain kinds of behavior. At the same time, the chapter makes a moving positive plea for proper treatment of the elderly, the poor, and, in general, one’s “neighbor” (which is extended to the foreigner [“sojourner”] in vv.33–34)."
"Torah, Leviticus.17.4","19:1 Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"

"Torah, Leviticus.17.104",_____________
"Torah, Leviticus.17.105","19:4 <b>no-gods:</b> Heb. <i>elilim,</i> a popular play on <i>el/elohim</i> (“God, gods”) and <i>al, “</i>nothing.” Greenstein (personal communication) suggests “little-gods” as another possibility."
"Torah, Leviticus.17.106",10 <b>afflicted:</b> Or “wretched.” <b>leave:</b> In the sense of “relinquish.”
"Torah, Leviticus.17.107",13 <b>commit-robbery:</b> Possibly an evaluation or explanation of the previous line.
"Torah, Leviticus.17.108","15 <b>equity:</b> Heb. <i>tzedek,</i> often translated “righteousness,” but here, as often, it has the meaning of even-handedness in judgment."
"Torah, Leviticus.17.109","17 <b>rebuke:</b> The emotions are to come into the open, not to lie festering. <b>that you not bear sin:</b> Because you did not alert him to the consequences of his behavior."
"Torah, Leviticus.17.110","18 <b>be-loving to your neighbor:</b> The meaning of this phrase, and the concept, have been widely debated throughout the ages. The translation follows B-R, which emphasizes the personhood of one’s neighbor—and of the sojourner in v.34."
"Torah, Leviticus.17.111","19 <b>two-kinds:</b> That is, a mixture. The prohibition regarding the field entails avoiding mixing different crops on a single field. Mixtures in the Bible seem to be reserved for the divine sphere alone. <b><i>shaatnez:</i></b> Of uncertain origin, this word probably means “of mixed-stuff“; it breaks the rhythm of the law, and so was probably a later addition meant to explain “two-kinds” in reference to clothing (Fishbane 1988)."
"Torah, Leviticus.17.112",20 <b>destined … redeemed:</b> Cf. Ex. 21:7–11 (Levine). This does not qualify as biblical adultery.
"Torah, Leviticus.17.113","23 <b>(like) a foreskin:</b> Because it is incomplete or “unfit,” in the biblical view. Here culture is to overcome nature."
"Torah, Leviticus.18.1","<i>General Regulations on Holiness II</i> (20): We move now into laws dealing with some of the more serious offenses against God in the biblical view: idolatry (including worship of the “Molekh” and consulting spirits), insulting parents, adultery, and sexual crimes. These are distinguished from the previous chapter by the inclusion of punishments; their seriousness is indicated by their capital nature. The reiteration of sexual laws forms a bracket with Chap. 18, thus highlighting the central position and rhetoric of 19. Another bracket, this time within the chapter, involves the chiasm of necromancy and the exhortation to be holy (vv.6–7 and 26–27). Finally, while the motifs of the Israelites avoiding pagan practices, and the land “vomiting out” its wrongdoers, return from Chap. 18, there is a further throwback (vv.24–26): to Chap. 11, where “separation” from the nations was a major issue in terms of diet."

"Torah, Leviticus.19.1","<i>Regulations Concerning Holiness: Priests I</i> (21): This chapter, and the one that follows, relate holiness to the suitability of priests to serve in the sanctuary. The laws are in the main negative ones, that is, they outline ways in which a priest may be disqualified. The first part of the chapter concentrates on how contact with death disqualifies a priest; in Levine’s view, this avoidance of the dead reflects the Bible’s abhorrence of pagan cults centered around death. The laws concerning soundness of body and sexuality confirm earlier passages on holiness as wholeness."

"Torah, Leviticus.21.1","<i>Holy Days</i> (23): Having dealt with holiness in such areas as worship, family life, ethics, priestly qualifications and behavior, and sacrificial animals and objects, the text now turns to holiness in time: the sacred calendar. While all ancient societies marked sacred time, in Judaism as it evolved out of the Bible the calendar took on particular significance, especially in the situation of exile. The centrality of time in Judaism has been articulately portrayed by Heschel; here we will limit discussion to the fullest of the biblical sacred calendars (others occur in Ex. 23 and 34, and Deut. 16), the one set forth in the present chapter."
"Torah, Leviticus.21.2","The scheme is characteristically Levitical—it focuses on order and perfection, expressing these qualities by the use of the number 7, which was used thus in a number of ancient Near Eastern cultures. A partial list in this regard would include: 7 days from sabbath to sabbath; 7 days of two major festivals, spring and fall; 7 weeks between the two pilgrimage festivals in the spring; and all the holy days falling within the first 7 months of the year, with a major cluster occurring in the seventh month. To this could be added material from other passages in the Torah: 7 years to every sabbatical year (Ex. 23:10–11, Lev. 25:2–7, Deut. 15:1–3); and 7-times-7 years (plus one) till each Jubilee year (Lev. 25:8–17). One could go further (cf. the discussion and lists in Jenson), but the thrust should be clear: time, as well as space and behavior, is to be ordered in a way that again reflects divine perfection. One might also mention the continuation of this kind of thinking in both later Judaism and Christianity, which looked upon history itself in a schematic way."
"Torah, Leviticus.21.3","As laid out in Leviticus, the sacred days of the seventh month follow a conventional ancient pattern described by Gaster (1961): the dying of the old year (“mortification” and “purgation,” as expressed in Rosh Ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur), followed by the birth of the new year (“invigoration” and “jubilation,” as expressed in Sukkot). The biblical calendar, then, evolved along dual tracks—lunar-solar (lunar months of 29 or 30 days, with an extra month added in late winter, 7 times every 19 years); and spring/fall new year (Passover falls in the “first month,” but the full new year pattern, as we have mentioned, is played out in the fall)."
"Torah, Leviticus.21.4","A final indication of a late provenance for Chap. 23’s calendar lies in the long treatment (vv.9–22, a third of the chapter) of Shavuot, the “Feast of Weeks.” The emphasis seems to be on land here, suggesting a resettlement motif that would be particularly appropriate after the exile in Babylonia."
"Torah, Leviticus.21.5","Theme words in the chapter include: “appointed-times,” “proclamation of holiness,” “throughout all your settlements,” “a fire-offering to YHWH,” and “anykind of servile work you are not to do.” V39–43, on the practice of and rationale behind Sukkot, seem to be another addition to the text, as they disrupt its natural flow."

"Torah, Leviticus.21.127","23 <b>You may sacrifice:</b> The exception to the rule here concerns a voluntary offering; a defective animal would of course not be acceptable in the case of a <i>hattat,</i> for example (Wenham). The rabbis understood that this animal was not even placed on the altar, but merely sold, with the proceeds going to the sanctuary (Sifra, quoted in Bamberger)."
"Torah, Leviticus.21.128","25 <b>ruin:</b> Others, “mutilation” (Levine)."
"Torah, Leviticus.21.129","23:2 <b>appointed-times:</b> Festivals. <b>proclamations of holiness:</b> Heb. <i>mikra’ei kodesh;</i> an alternative rendering is “holy convocations,” that is, sacred gatherings."
"Torah, Leviticus.21.130","3 <b>you are not to do:</b> I have translated this as “make” (work) in Ex. 31ff., to underscore a major theme of the book; here, such awkwardness may be avoided."
"Torah, Leviticus.21.131","5 <b>between the setting-times:</b> Between the time that the sun is below the horizon, no longer visible, and total darkness. An idiomatic rendition would be “at twilight.”"

"Torah, Leviticus.21.133","10 <b>and you harvest its harvest:</b> The wheat harvest, in the late spring."
"Torah, Leviticus.21.134","11 <b>the morrow of the Sabbath:</b> The precise meaning of this phrase was the subject of lengthy debate among the ancient rabbis. Traditionally in Judaism, seven weeks are counted until this Festival of Weeks (Shavuot), beginning on the day after the start of Passover. Another old interpretation understands the phrase to mean the Sunday after Passover. Fishbane (1988) proposes that an older meaning of <i>shab-bat,</i> namely “full moon,” may be operative here, and that it solves the problems inherent in this passage."
"Torah, Leviticus.21.135","13 <b>poured-offering:</b> Conventionally called a “libation,” this involved the pouring out of wine on the altar, and was common in ancient religions."

"Torah, Leviticus.21.138","27 <b>Mark:</b> Following JPS. selves: Heb. <i>nefesh,</i> variously rendered “soul,” “emotions,” and even “gullet” (Milgrom). The <i>nefesh</i> was one’s personhood, one’s essence."
"Torah, Leviticus.22.1","<i>Miscellany</i> (24): Two issues, unrelated to what has gone before, are treated here: certain ritual objects in the Dwelling (oil/lamps and “showbread”), and the story of a man who insulted God and therefore had to be executed (along with further rules about capital crimes). The function of this chapter is not clear; perhaps it serves as a breather between the important sections on sacred days (23) and land tenure (25). It is also possible (as Levine notes) that chapters such as this one and Num. 15 serve as a repository for various cultic laws that needed a location. There are two other places in the Torah where a brief passage on the lights in the sanctuary may originally have served to separate sections: the end of Ex. 27 and the beginning of Num. 8. If so, that function no longer is as major as it once might have been."
"Torah, Leviticus.22.2","The first two parts (2–4 and 5–9) are linked by their common vocabulary: “take,” “arrange,” “regularly,” and “before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>” (Wenham). The second section (vv. 10–23) is united by its chiastic structure (cf. Wenham here as well). It has points of contact with material in the Exodus laws, but here with the characteristic addition (v.22) of “I, Y<small>HWH</small>, am your God.”"
"Torah, Leviticus.22.3","24:1 Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"

"Torah, Leviticus.22.25","and they scuffled in the camp,"
"Torah, Leviticus.22.26",the son of the Israelite-woman and a (fully) Israelite man.
"Torah, Leviticus.22.27","11 Now the son of the Israelite woman reviled the Name, and insulted (it),"

"Torah, Leviticus.22.42","when he reviles the Name, he is to be put-to-death!"
"Torah, Leviticus.22.43","17 Now a man—when he strikes-down any human life,"
"Torah, Leviticus.22.44","he is to be put-to-death, yes, death!"
"Torah, Leviticus.22.45","18 One who strikes the life of an animal is to pay for it, life in place of life."

"Torah, Leviticus.22.73","14 <b>the entire community:</b> Not only the witnesses (Greenstein, personal communication)."
"Torah, Leviticus.23.1","<i>Regulations Concerning Land and Slavery</i> (25): A final area of holiness that Leviticus discusses is that of ownership. The rules set forth in this chapter are based on the assumption that land, a most precious commodity in the ancient (and modern) Near East, and human beings, equally precious in the Bible, are not in fact the property of other human beings. The phrases “the land is not to be sold inharness, / for the land is mine” (v.23) and “For my servants are they … they are not to be sold as the sale of serfs” (v.42) express the main corollary: God is the sole owner of land and people. The chapter, then, sets out regulations that make perpetual human ownership of these impossible. In the case of land, not only is the soil to rest every seven years, but every fifty years (7 × 7 + 1), the land is to be “released” back to its original owner (who “redeems” it). Similarly, indentured servants—those who are forced into working for someone because of debts—are redeemable, if not by kin then by the occurrence of the Jubilee year."
"Torah, Leviticus.23.2","Several things about the chapter suggest a late date to Levine. Redemption focuses on the individual rather than on the clan; “at Mount Sinai” might indicate an editorial hand; and the passages here, unlike their counterparts in Ex. 21 and Deut. 15, concentrate less on eradicating poverty than on ensuring that property stays in the family over generations. Indeed, some of the conditions presupposed by the chapter suggest the situation portrayed in Neh. 5, after the Babylonian Exile."
"Torah, Leviticus.23.3","25:1 Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe at Mount Sinai, saying:"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.4","2 Speak to the Children of Israel, and say to them:"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.5","When you enter the land that I am giving you,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.6","the land is to cease, a Sabbath-ceasing to Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Leviticus.23.7","3 For six years you are to sow your field,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.8","for six years you are to prune your vineyard,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.9","then you are to gather in its produce,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.10",4 but in the seventh year
"Torah, Leviticus.23.11","there shall be a Sabbath of Sabbath-ceasing for the land,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.12",a Sabbath to Y<small>HWH</small>:
"Torah, Leviticus.23.13","your field you are not to sow,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.14","your vineyard you are not to prune,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.15","5 the aftergrowth of your harvest you are not to harvest,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.16",the grapes of your consecrated-vines you are not to amass;
"Torah, Leviticus.23.17",a Sabbath of Sabbath-ceasing shall there be for the land!

"Torah, Leviticus.23.21",7 and for your domestic-animal and the wild-beast that (are) in your land
"Torah, Leviticus.23.22","shall be all its produce, to eat."
"Torah, Leviticus.23.23",8 And you are to number yourselves seven Sabbath-cycles of years
"Torah, Leviticus.23.24","—seven years, seven times—"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.25",so the time of the seven Sabbath-cycles of years will be for you (a total of) nine and forty years.

"Torah, Leviticus.23.27","in the seventh New-Moon, on the tenth after the New-Moon, on the Day of Atonement,"

"Torah, Leviticus.23.29","10 You are to hallow the year, the fiftieth year,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.30",proclaiming freedom throughout the land and to all its inhabitants;

"Torah, Leviticus.23.48","according to the few years (left), you may charge-him-little for his purchase,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.49",since a (certain) number of harvests is what he is selling to you.
"Torah, Leviticus.23.50","17 So you are not to maltreat any-man his fellow,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.51","rather, you are to hold your God in awe,"

"Torah, Leviticus.23.57","and that you may eat to being-satisfied,"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.58",and be settled in security upon it.
"Torah, Leviticus.23.59",20 Now if you should say (to yourselves):
"Torah, Leviticus.23.60",What are we to eat in the seventh year?
"Torah, Leviticus.23.61","—(for) here, we may not sow, we may not gather our produce!"
"Torah, Leviticus.23.62",21 Then I will dispatch my blessing for you during the sixth year

"Torah, Leviticus.24.1","<i>Conclusion: Blessings and Curses</i> (26:3–45): The initial ending of Leviticus (Chap. 27 was added later) follows a pattern common to treaties in the ancient Near East: it provides blessings for remaining loyal to God (the suzerain) and curses for spurning him. A similar pattern, with greater rhetoric and emotional force, occurs in Deut. 28–30, with briefer examples in Ex. 23:25ff. and Josh. 24:20. The blessings center around peace and its attendant benefit, agricultural abundance; the curses detail, in increasing force, the calamities brought on by war: famine, defeat, and ultimately exile. That the curses take up much more room than the blessings is not surprising, given the didactic nature of the chapter; this is also characteristic of ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaty literature, where the major emphasis is placed on what will happen if the pact is violated. Later Jewish tradition dealt with the devastating tone and content of the curses by prescribing that, when read publicly as part of the weekly Torah cycle, they be chanted in an undertone."
"Torah, Leviticus.24.2","The structure of the chapter gives strong indication that there has been considerable editorial work here, and that may explain some of the difficulties in the later parts of the chapter. The confusion may well reflect the passage of time during and after the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587 <small>B.C.E.</small>, and thus an evolving response to the catastrophe. The pattern (suggested by H. L. Ginsberg, who is quoted by Levine) moves from doom to hope, and then to an explanation of why restoration has been delayed. In any event, it should be noted (as Levine does) that the curses are not all doom; they do, at various points, leave the door open for Israel’s “turning,” a point much emphasized by the Prophets."
"Torah, Leviticus.24.3","Lev. 26 is the first great monotheistic response to catastrophe, built on the idea that human beings have the capacity to influence their own fate by obeying or disobeying God. In Judaism, which was to experience numerous such catastrophes over the course of its history, literary response became an important mode of coping. Christianity took its own characteristic path in answering some of the same issues on a personal level."

"Torah, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus.1","T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> L<small>EVITICUS</small>, <small>ALONG WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE</small> T<small>ORAH THAT DEAL WITH</small> cultic and legal matters, presents particular problems for a translator who chooses to work in the Buber-Rosenzweig mode. There are a number of technical terms which, in addition to their constant repetition in the text, inviting overemphasis on strangeness, are difficult to render accurately into English. For their part, Buber and Rosenzweig translated what they understood as the meaning of these terms, even if it meant creating new words in German that made little sense to someone not familiar with the Hebrew concepts. Some examples are found below."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus.2","My initial inclination was to leave the names of sacrifices, etc., in Hebrew transcription, but I have come to feel that this places an undue burden on the English reader. With some reservations I have therefore opted for a mix of transcription and translation."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus.3","Buber saw the names of several sacrifices as suggesting movement between the human and the divine. Thus the names of the two most common sacrifices, <i>korban</i> and <i>ola</i>, were rendered “Nearbringing” and “Highbringing” in B-R. I have utilized “near-offering” and “offering-up”; in the case of the former, the intent of the text may simply have been to indicate what the worshiper “brings-near” to the altar, although the effect was certainly understood to bring humans closer to God. A third type of sacrifice, the <i>minha</i>, which B-R rendered as “leading-gift,” always indicates a “grain-gift” in cultic texts. My German predecessors would undoubtedly not have approved of my less radical approach to these terms; I have, however, followed them in retaining “bringing-near” as a verb, denoting variously “to bring,” “to sacrifice,” and “to officiate” (in the sanctuary), which I have indicated in the Notes."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus.4","As for <i>hattat</i> and <i>asham</i>, these two key sacrifices have a number of meanings in the text. I have chosen to retain them in transcription, providing occasional translations on location or explanations in the notes."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus.5","A most important term in the priestly material is the adjective <i>tamei</i> (along with its noun, <i>tum’a</i>). The word refers to a ritual state, the existence of which was understood in ancient Israel as a grave danger to the “purity” of the sanctuary. It is not, however, “uncleanness” in the physical sense, but a state akin perhaps to radioactivity: in this case, it drives away the divine presence from Israel (cf. Greenstein 1984a for another analogy). B-R used “stained/tainted” in their translation; most recent scholars use “polluted” and “pollution” to describe the phenomenon. I have accepted the latter in my discussions below but have chosen to stay with Hebrew transcription in the text itself, allowing for a wider and less overtly negative form of the term. Were I in a flippant mood brought on by political correctness, I might suggest “ritually challenged” for <i>tamei</i>."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus.6","One more problem in translating Leviticus is worthy of mention. A Buber-Rosenzweig type of rendition is fairly adaptable for narrative and even poetry; but in legal and cultic passages, such as we find in abundance in Leviticus, it imposes huge constraints on the translator. Recent English translations such as JPS and the New Revised Standard Version have conveyed the basic meaning of these passages in reasonably clear language. I, on the other hand, have not found it possible to avoid awkward English in this material. I hope nevertheless that, despite the difficulties involved for the reader, the rhetoric and structure—and sometimes the obscurity—of the Hebrew, which left the text open to later disagreement and interpretation, will still be visible and instructive."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Translating Leviticus.7","A final note on translation practices. Buber and Rosenzweig did not always hold to the principle of one Hebrew root, one corresponding German root, if this was unimportant or simply an impossibility. I have similarly on occasion deviated from full consistency in translating certain words. So, for instance, I found that the many different uses of Heb. <i>shamor</i>—“guard,” “keep,” “take-care”—simply could not be standardized in translation. In the main, when I have found it possible to connect passages via their standardized language in the Hebrew, I have done so in English."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.0",(1-27)
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.1","F<small>OR MOST LAY READERS</small>, <small>THE THIRD OF THE</small> F<small>IVE BOOKS OF</small> M<small>OSES PRESENTS FORMIDA</small>ble obstacles. Many people find it difficult to relate to the description of ritual slaughter of animals and the disposal of their blood and flesh in the opening section of the book, or to the detailed prescriptions regarding bodily functions, skin disease, and mold in Chapters 12–15. Others experience Leviticus as obscure: Why exactly do Aaron’s sons die in Chapter 10? How can one explain the ritual of the scapegoat in Chapter 16? A frequently encountered reaction to the book is the desire to get on to the book of Numbers—which at least has some intriguing narratives such as Moses’ sin and punishment, the faint-heartedness of the spies, and Balaam’s reversed prophecies."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.2","Yet Leviticus, as it has been placed in the Torah, signals that something of singular importance is at work. The book, after all, occurs at the center of the overall five-book structure. Unlike the other four, it is set entirely around Mount Sinai, and so it forms, geographically as well as structurally, the heart of the Torah document. In addition, the priestly interests so clearly presented in Leviticus appear throughout the Torah: as genealogical lists (Genesis, Exodus, Numbers), descriptions of rituals (Exodus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), and details about the building of the desert “Dwelling” of God (Exodus). Indeed, the opening chapter of it all, Gen. 1 (the Creation story), has strong links in both its themes and terminology with the priestly law."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.3","Leviticus in fact presents a significant strain, conventionally termed the “priestly” view, in biblical thought. Anthropologically considered, it sheds important light on the outlook of some of those who compiled and read the Hebrew Bible. And the process did not stop there. Many of the categories found in Leviticus were continued and expanded by later Judaism: regulations concerning sexuality and diet, concepts of separation and holiness, and how to deal with one’s fellow human beings in a variety of economic and social settings. These found expression in different but still recognizable form simultaneously in the development of Christianity."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.4","In late antiquity Leviticus was known as <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, the Priestly Instruction (or simultaneously understood, as Levine suggests, as the Instruction of the Priests). Given both the concerns of the priestly writers and the wording they use to express those concerns, I see Leviticus as the Book of Separations, the book in which are set forth distinctions between a whole range of aspects of ancient Israelite experience and practice: holy and profane; ritual purity and pollution; permitted and forbidden in sexuality and diet; Israelites and others; and priests, Levites, and common folk among the Israelites. This near-obsession with drawing lines (or, as Douglas has presented it, concentric circles) may in some sense reflect the position of Israel in the ancient Near East as a small, beleaguered newcomer in a region of hoary empires, situated on land that was constantly invaded by both great powers and local foes. It may also be an echo of the larger Bronze Age and Iron Age process of change from the former, well-nigh universal worship of the Mother Goddess, to the later patriarchal societies with which the Western world still deals through its three monotheistic religions and their cultural outgrowths."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.5","Overarching the theme of separations or distinctions, through much of the book, is the polarity of order/disorder, represented best in Leviticus by the problem of life and death. As many scholars have noted, regulations regarding sacrifice here connect up with symbolically offering up human life—through the substitution of an animal—to the deity; blood is avoided at all costs, due to its connoting life. Animals that may be used for food (as well as for sacrifice) are in the main those which do not consume other living creatures. Pollutants which endanger the purity of the sanctuary (“Dwelling”) include bodily emissions which the Israelites connected with death (e.g., menstrual blood and “wasted” semen). Finally, the complex system of purification from some kind of skin disease may well originate in the similarity between disease and death. In sum, then, it is no surprise that, two books later, the Deuteronomic Moses implores the people to “choose life” rather than the “death” engendered by improper behavior by both priests and commoners."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.6","Interestingly, the strong urge to make order (ritual laws) out of disorder (the chaotic processes of human life, from killing animals for food to sexual relations) is reflected in other aspects of the Torah—most notably in the narrative portrayal of the descent lines from father Abraham. Here, the discontinuity represented by sibling rivalries and other threats to survival is countered by God’s establishing a kind of continuity through the choosing of younger brothers. In this case, the strong hand of ritual control is replaced by the somewhat hazardous element of surprise and close calls. But it does manage to provide for family continuity and, ultimately, the survival of the people. Whether this points to early or later experiences historically is the subject of ongoing and unresolved debate among biblical scholars. A widely accepted possibility is that the Torah as we have it was edited by priestly editors living in or shortly after the Babylonian Exile (6th–5th centuries <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>.), and that those editors took earlier material (which itself was already multilayered) and adapted it into an overall scheme expressing promise, disobedience, destruction, and survival/hope (cf. Fox 1993)."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.7","In point of fact, Leviticus is best viewed as only a part, albeit the major one as a bloc, of a major thrust of the Torah. According to most biblical scholars, the “priestly” worldview, and the texts that may be attributed to it, makes its appearance with the very chapter with which the entire Torah begins, Gen. 1. Here distinctions and ordering are at the very heart of the text. God, immediately after his first creation-by-word (light), “separates” between light and darkness, then goes on to perform the same operation between heavenly waters (the storehouses of rain) and earthly ones. His remaining acts of creation involve putting heavenly bodies, vegetation, and animal life in order—each “according to its kind,” on specific days of creation. Animals are distinguished from plants through their receiving vocal divine blessing; humans from animals through the addition to the blessing of the phrase “have dominion over” the rest of living things. At the same time, humans are told that they may eat only what grows from the ground, implying that to do otherwise would be a violation of the order of things. Crowning the whole account is the poem (Gen. 2:1–4a) about God’s “finishing” of the “work” of creation, symbolized by his “hallowing” (making holy or separate-for-God) the seventh day. In Gen. 1, then, we are presented with a brief but complete vision of the cosmos as ordered in space, time, and life-forms, under the aegis of a metasexual, nonviolent, and benevolent deity."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.8","As Genesis unfolds under priestly influence, humans are presented with basic rules and warned of the consequences if those rules are broken. The paradisical situation of Adam and Eve (no labor, vegetarianism, no danger from animals, and sexual innocence) is disrupted by human disobedience, resulting in banishment from Eden—a shattering of the previous wholeness and order. Cain’s murder of his brother leads to the same punishment: uprootedness and hard labor. The mixing of divine and human beings in Gen. 6:1–2 results in a clear distinction being established by God, that humans will henceforth be limited in age. Finally, the account of the universal flood in Chapters 6–9 presents a picture that uses a number of Leviticus motifs. The earth is to be destroyed because human wrongdoing has “ruined” it (or, in Levitical language, “polluted” it). Animal life is rescued by means of taking pairs of animals aboard the ark—with Leviticus’s distinctions of “pure” and impure dutifully mentioned. Noah’s three sons, who also come onto the ark, later become the forefathers of three great divisions of humanity, as laid out in detail in the genealogical lists of Chapters 10–11. Finally, the new beginning of the cosmos, with Noah as a second Adam (cf. the latter’s blessing in 1:28 with that of the former in 9:1–2), is accompanied by both animal sacrifices and dietary restrictions (the introduction of meat is new, accompanied by the caveat—as in Lev. 17—that blood is not to be consumed)."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.9","A major part of the priestly scheme emerges with the detailed instructions concerning the construction of the Tabernacle (God’s place of “Dwelling” on earth) and the priestly vestments that are to be worn there, in Ex. 25–31 (with much of this material repeated in narrative form in Chapters 35–40). The details make sense as part of a larger picture, in which the closer one gets to the “Holiest Holy-Shrine” where God takes up dwelling, the more central the measurements of space and the more precious the materials used. This concentric sense of order is reflected also in the layout of the wilderness camp of the Israelites in Num. 2. Thus the Tabernacle functions as a minicosmos, a visible and ritual representation of the creation itself. Through the layout of curtains within and tribal encampments without, space is ordered; through the festivals (enumerated in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, with some mention in Exodus as well), time is ordered. And, thanks to the provisions laid out in Leviticus, through priest/lay hierarchy, dietary rules, and sacrificial regulations, life-forms are ordered. The result is an almost utopian scheme. It is a world in which everything and everyone are to take their place under the perfect worship of a perfect God, banishing or avoiding death, defect, and disorder. In the priestly view, the world is to be an echo of the divine order that is portrayed in the Creation story."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.10","Viewed in the perspective of priestly concerns (only part of which we have just outlined), Leviticus is largely concerned with the potential disruption of this utopia. If Genesis chronicles threats to the fulfillment of God’s promises to Abraham, if Numbers recounts threats to his descendants’ survival on their march through the wilderness, then Leviticus concentrates on threats to Israel’s life with God. It presents a whole system of rules designed, first, to provide for purification and reconciliation with God through the sacrificial cult; second, to protect sanctuary, priests, land, and people from estrangement from God (via “pollution” of various kinds); and, finally, to establish a code of behavior that will ensure the perpetual enjoyment of God’s blessings on the land promised to Israel’s ancestors. From this it can readily be seen how Leviticus, far from being of interest to specialists and historians only, is in fact a crucial part of the Torah—perhaps its most crucial part, in that it supplies the ideological center of gravity for the whole. Once Leviticus is added to the narratives, poems, laws, and lists that comprise the rest of the Torah, a picture emerges that is more than literature and more than history. The five books become the multilayered and multifaceted monument that has been studied, puzzled over, and built upon for over two millennia."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.11","In sum, the world of the priestly strain in the Torah is a realm of desired order and perfection, a realm in which wholeness is to reign, in which anomaly and undesired mixture are not permitted, and in which boundaries are zealously guarded. The human body becomes symbolic of the cosmos: its life/death boundary is marked, and troublesome flows from it are carefully regulated. The land of Israel becomes symbolic of the cosmos: too much evildoing pollutes it, to the point where it can do naught else but “vomit out” its settlers (as it vomited out the previous ones). The animal kingdom, from which humans are allowed to take life under carefully prescribed circumstances, becomes symbolic of cosmic values, through heightening awareness of predator and victim, and careful avoidance of blood, the symbol of life. Indeed, in the system of Leviticus, it is no wonder that death is the major pollutant, and that blood of acceptable animal sacrifice is the agent through which human beings find atonement for minor pollutants."

"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.32",Appendix: 27 Assessments for the Priests
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.33",Other commentators have of course seen it differently. Most follow the traditional scholarly approach of starting the “Holiness Code” with Chapter 17; Levine rightly parallels it to the beginnings of other law collections in the Torah (Ex. 20:19–23 and Deut. 12; the ending here in Chapter 26 also parallels the endings in the other two codes). Hallo understands the structure as 1–11: Rites of Consumption; 12–16: Rites of Purification; and 17–26: Holiness.
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.34","Overshadowing the clear three-part structure, however one wants to divide it up, is the complex issue of two apparent documents or schools of thought. Biblical scholarship terms these P (“Priestly”) and H (“Holiness”), and roughly attributes the first part of the book (through Chap. 16) to P, with the rest to H. There has been detailed, ongoing debate about the approaches and dating of these sources. As of this writing, it is generally accepted that H is later than P, but there seem to be numerous interpolations of one source into the other, and it is difficult to place them historically with certainty. Here, as elsewhere in biblical literature, we have a layering effect rather than a clear-cut delineation of “authors.” As usual, that appears to have been intentional."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.35","A word should be said about the relationship between law and narrative in the Torah. As Damrosch has noted, the legal and cultic texts in the five books might be seen by modern readers as intrusive. On the surface, they certainly seem to interrupt a good story. Genesis is largely unencumbered by nonaction (except for the genealogical lists—attributed to P!), but the gripping account of the redemption from Egypt in Exodus, and the drama of revelation on and apostasy beneath Mount Sinai, give way to the sober architectural details of the Tabernacle’s construction. Similarly, the narratives of the book of Numbers, which are among the most striking in the literature, are set off against a background of censuses, laws about suspected adultery and the taking of vows, Levitical duties in the Dwelling, and an enumeration of sacrificial gifts brought by the tribes, among other things."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.36","The bulk of material in Leviticus, and its placement in the Torah, make it clear that the five books that we have convey their point precisely through the medium of narrative <i>plus</i> cult/law. In the Israelite worldview, these two rather distinct forms, which intermingle past, present, and future (Damrosch), fruitfully enrich and explain one another. It is as if a history of the American Revolution contained all of the debates on and drafts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, as well as accounts of battles and biographies of key personalities. That such an approach parallels neither Homeric epic nor ritual texts in their purity of form is exactly the point: we have here a new genre of great complexity and richness, in which narratives exemplify laws and laws follow narratives. The result is truly a torah, a “teaching” or “instruction.”"
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.37","Finally, we might mention the issue of priests and laypeople. Scholars have often seen Leviticus as originating as a manual for priests. What is most fascinating, and perhaps most important (for later history), about this book is the way in which it takes priestly rules and transmutes at least some of them for use in the general populace of ancient Israel. This can be seen most dramatically in the dietary laws, which in other cultures often serve exclusively for priests, and in the area of sexual taboos, which do likewise. In postbiblical Judaism this shift becomes particularly evident: the Jew’s dinner table is termed a “sanctuary in miniature” (complete with loaves of bread and the use of salt—two elements found in the ancient sacrificial cult); dietary laws are expanded for the general population to provide for separation of milk and meat; and separation of husband and wife during menstruation, among traditional Jews, leaves the context of Sanctuary pollution and finds a home in the context of a philosophy of marriage. Many other examples could be brought of the widening of priestly laws to an entire people. Perhaps most dramatic—and most significant—is the eventual shift of the learning and interpretation of sacred texts away from the priests, who in most cultures served as the guardians of the text (and often the culture’s only literate body; cf. medieval Christian Europe). In Judaism of late antiquity, this monopoly was decisively broken; first the scribe and then the rabbi (“master”) took over, with learning extended at last to all those who might make the effort to acquire it. The great exception, at least in antiquity, was women—who, it will be noted, were also excluded from priestly functions in the Bible."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.38","Three relatively recent developments make it possible to approach Leviticus as a significant, powerful, and interesting biblical text. The first is the explosion of both full-length and shorter studies of the book and its concerns that have appeared in recent years. The work of Milgrom (1991), Levine (1989), Wenham (1979), Eilberg-Schwartz (1990), and Bamberger (1981), to cite just a few of the English-language studies on aspects of Leviticus, now makes it possible to have a serious entry into the book based largely on advances in understanding the cultures of the ancient Near East. It also, admittedly, puts the translator and commentator in a bind: is it possible to add anything new, or will it suffice simply to summarize? My approach in this volume has been largely the latter, along with suggesting to the reader some fruitful directions for further study."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.39","The second development helpful for approaching Leviticus, which also informs many of the studies just mentioned, is the using of anthropological insights to understand concepts and rituals found in the book. Such an approach places Leviticus in a broader human context, indicating what it does and does not share with other cultural and religious systems. For Leviticus is concerned with the same issues that plague all human societies: how to deal with the boundaries of life and death, how to comprehend and approach the transcendent in life, how to understand one’s (or one’s nation’s) place in the cosmic order, how to make for a just society. Viewed in this light, the book is a “Small Code” (cf. Northrop Frye’s designation of the Bible as “the Great Code”). That is, Leviticus need not remain a total mystery to us, to be unraveled only through detailed analysis and even change (Judaism) or substitution (Christianity), but can be understood on its own terms, if approached with care and in the spirit of seeking the larger picture in the details."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure.40","Finally, we should mention the aesthetic dimension. Like the other books of the Torah, Leviticus uses its own rhetoric to convey its message. Far from employing flat “priestly” style (whatever that may be), it uses formulas, refrains, and other rhythmical forms to impress its teaching (Heb. <i>tora</i>) upon its hearers. This aspect of the book has been the subject of recent study (cf. Paran), but was already echoed in the Buber-Rosenzweig translation. It is my hope that the present volume will contribute to an appreciation of the style of Leviticus."
"Torah, Leviticus, I: the Cult and the Priesthood.1",(1–10)
"Torah, Leviticus, I: the Cult and the Priesthood.2","T<small>HE SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK OF</small> E<small>XODUS CONCERNED ITSELF WITH SETTING UP THE</small> sacrificial cult of Israel. It therefore set forth the prescriptions for and construction of a sanctuary and the priestly garments, and laid out a ceremony for the investiture of priests. But the description of how sacrifices were to be offered, and for what purpose, is not part of the book, which as edited seems more interested in contrasting the building of a sanctuary with building cities for the Pharaohs, as part of its portrayal of the victory of the biblical God over the gods of Egypt. Although at the end of the book the “Dwelling” is completed, we do not get to see the various sacral rites performed there."
"Torah, Leviticus, I: the Cult and the Priesthood.3","Leviticus also delays the ordination of the priests, until Chapter 8, preferring instead to begin with a kind of manual on the offering and disposal of sacrifices. It then moves us from the details of sacrifice into the narrative of the sanctuary’s dedication and opening rites, providing a natural bridge for Part II, in which ritual pollution and purity, the province of priests, is dealt with."
"Torah, Leviticus, I: the Cult and the Priesthood.4","The function of the sacrificial cult in ancient Israel will be discussed in “On Animal Sacrifice” below. In general it should be noted that the existence of a class or profession whose job it is to mediate between the divine and human realms is widespread in most older cultures, and the Israelite priesthood, whatever its origins and development, was but one of many such groups in the ancient Near East. It existed, to use the language of Exodus, to “serve” God, maintaining his holiness through ritual and helping to maintain the order of sacred culture which was supposed to mirror God’s ordering of the cosmos. Accordingly, as we will learn later in Leviticus, priests were to be set apart from the general population in a number of areas. There were strict rules about whom they could and could not marry, and they were barred from coming into any contact with the dead, for instance. Their functions extended beyond sacrifice; they could provide oracular advice in times of need, and taught the people “instructions” (Heb. <i>torot</i>) regarding various ritual matters."
"Torah, Leviticus, I: the Cult and the Priesthood.5","As part of an overall scheme, there was a conscious parallel between priests as part of a select circle and sacrificial animals—as well as the people of Israel. That is, all three stood at the center of concentric circles dedicated to God; and as one moved out (toward Levite and commoner, animals permitted for eating and those forbidden, and neighbors and foreigners), one got further and further away from the divine. The hierarchy regarding the cult thus reinforced the theme of separation which we have noted above."
"Torah, Leviticus, I: the Cult and the Priesthood.6","In the view of Milgrom, Israel’s cult was distinguished from those of its neighbors by its purposefully ignoring the complex web of rituals regarding demons. The sanctuary was to be purged of ritual pollution, not only by semimagical means (the sprinkling of sacrificial blood) but also and primarily by the confession of wrongdoing and the sincere desire to repent. Then, too, the sanctuary, while in most respects resembling shrines elsewhere in the ancient Near East, omitted certain crucial items, most notably statuary representing the gods and a bed for them to rest on. Finally, certain religious rituals were forbidden, such as mutilation of the priests’ bodies. In all these cases, Israel introduced something new into the area of worship."
"Torah, Leviticus, I: the Cult and the Priesthood.7","For many decades there has been major and heated debate by scholars in favor of one or the other scheme for following the history of the priesthood and the cult. There are those who view these institutions as stretching back to Israel’s earliest history, while others see strong evidence of a late, possibly even exilic, reworking of the priestly material. Similar arguments dot the landscape of literary criticism of the Torah, in which scholars have tried to divine at what point priestly editors might have put their distinctive stamp on the literature. From Wellhausen in the nineteenth century to Knohl, Milgrom, and Levine in the late twentieth, there has been no lack of theorizing on these issues—and no definitive answers. For the moment we are left to read Leviticus as it is placed in the Torah, with an awareness that a variety of historical and ideological influences are imbedded, if not hidden, in our text."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Animal Sacrifice.1","A<small>LTHOUGH IT APPEARS EARLIER IN THE</small> T<small>ORAH</small>, <small>ANIMAL SACRIFICE RECEIVES ITS FULL</small>est treatment in Leviticus. Besides the opening seven chapters, which are devoted to a relatively brief description of how sacrifices are to be offered and disposed of, many other chapters in the book talk about sacrificial rituals: the installation of the priests (8–9), rules about disposing of the <i>hattat</i> sacrifice (10), purification offerings brought in the event of such “polluting” states as childbirth and skin diseases (12–15), and finally the “scapegoat” ceremony of Chapter 16. They appear in most of the later chapters as well."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Animal Sacrifice.2","What function did sacrifice, particularly of animals, play in the religion of ancient Israel? How could a God who proscribed the murder of human beings (Ex. 20:13, 21:12) countenance the taking of animal life for ritual purposes? To answer these questions, we must turn briefly to some of the commonly proposed theories surrounding sacrifice."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Animal Sacrifice.3","The idea of offering up living creatures to the gods is one of hoary antiquity. Walter Burkert, on the basis of the study of Greek religion, suggests that sacrifice is a means of dealing with guilt over the taking of life. That is, the switch from gathering to hunting society, made possible by technology (the invention of tools), while it raised human accomplishment and consciousness to a new level, also brought with it the acute sense of having violated something essential in the cosmic order. Such guilt is not mitigated by the fact that early people hunted for food and not for pleasure. The way of dealing with the guilt, giving life back to the gods, is in a true sense restoration; life is given back for life taken, so that it may ultimately be renewed (contrast this to the profoundly unecological use of living and inorganic resources over the past “civilized” centuries). And it must be done via ritual. In Burkert’s view, ritual deals with human anxiety by “raising the ante”—by means of increasing anxiety, it is controlled. So guilt over life-taking is assuaged by making a ritual out of the killing, and the shared experience of trauma helps to create solidarity within the group. Despite the subsequent rise of agriculture, says Burkert, the hunting ritual played out in sacrifice could not be done away with, so ingrained had it become, and the rationale behind sacrifices was therefore transformed. Now domesticated animals could be used, giving greater control over the process."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Animal Sacrifice.4","In another approach, De Vaux (1965) postulates three motives for sacrifice. In the first model, that of “gift,” the worshiper brings something of value to the deity. The animal is killed, setting it apart for sacred use; it is burned, turning it into an invisible substance which can rise to the gods. The gift may be for thanksgiving or, more likely, may be to assuage the demonic powers that many societies (especially Mesopotamia, Abraham’s homeland) felt controlled everyday life. Giving establishes reciprocal movement; altruism has no place here (Burkert). One is reminded of the elaborate giving ceremonies among many peoples on occasions such as weddings; giving establishes relationship and maintains the social order."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Animal Sacrifice.5","In addition to gifts, another mode of sacrifice involves communion, as nineteenth-century scholars such as Robertson Smith observed. Here the model of the meal is crucial: humans and gods share a great repast, thereby cementing kinship as surely as the closing of business deals is celebrated by drinks and dinner. Passover, both in the Bible and subsequently (even when the sacrifice per se was no longer involved), may serve as a striking example of the effectiveness of such a paradigm."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Animal Sacrifice.6","A final type or function of sacrifice is atonement or expiation. Here a sin, communal or individual, is purged away by the act of sacrifice; the gods receive life as a substitute for the sinner’s own, which is symbolized by the victim’s blood. The fact that the animals permitted in the Bible for sacrifice are pastoral and hence frequently used metaphorically for the Israelites themselves, is significant in this regard. This approach is further illustrated in the Bible by the end of the Flood story, where God accepts Noah’s sacrifice, implying that he accepts animal life (which now, simultaneous with properly offered sacrifice, is permissible for food) in place of that of humans (Eilberg-Schwartz). It should be noted that, in the Bible, sacrifice for the sake of atonement is almost always in reference to unintentional sins, whereas deliberate wrongdoing may not be atoned for through this system."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Animal Sacrifice.7","Which of these rationales is truly at work in Levitical sacrifice? Actually, at various times one can find all of them—the texts present a variety of motives and occasions for sacrifice in biblical Israel, from thanksgiving to purification and reparation. But in general one may say of Israelite sacrifice, as one may say of much of the ritual in Leviticus, that it is designed primarily to maintain or repair the relationship between God and Israel. Such an understanding helps to explain the unity of the book, as we will see in our discussion of pollution: sacrifice was a crucial element in keeping the covenant, and hence God’s beneficent presence among the Israelites, intact."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Animal Sacrifice.8","The fact that this reconciliation, as it were, takes place against a background of slaughter should not be as upsetting to moderns as it is usually felt to be. In ironic contrast to our mechanized and mass-produced society, where the killing of animals for food takes place at a remove from our consciousness and from our direct participation, the sacrificial system in fact involved worshiper and priest alike, and the symbolic value of the operation, whatever it may have been in specific cases, lay in its directness, in its consciousness of the taking of life. Some would even maintain that in societies where the practice and rationale for sacrifice has broken down, there is inevitably an increase in intrahuman violence (Girard)."
"Torah, Leviticus, On Animal Sacrifice.9","<img src=""images/Art_P7.jpg"" alt=""art""/>"
"Torah, Leviticus, On Animal Sacrifice.10",<b><i>Lev. 3:5</i> And the Sons of Aharon are to turn it (all) into smoke upon the slaughter-site … a fire-offering of soothing savor for Y<small>HWH</small>.</b>
"Torah, Leviticus, Ii: Ritual Pollution and Purification.1",(11–17)
"Torah, Leviticus, Ii: Ritual Pollution and Purification.2","A<small>S</small> I <small>HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTED</small>, L<small>EVITICUS IS LARGELY ABOUT HOW TO KEEP</small> G<small>OD</small>’<small>S</small> earthly realm, and hence his relationship with the people of Israel, viable and “pure” (cf. Greenstein 1985a). Once the book of Exodus ends, with the erection of the Tabernacle—a symbolic reflection of the cosmos in which God “takes up dwelling” among the Israelites—we are left with a structure that must be carefully guarded and its ritual purity maintained. To this end, Leviticus now turns to the issue of pollutants, largely of the body, that arise from what we might call territorial problems: the border of what goes into the body, expressed through animals permitted and forbidden for food; the border between life and death, as expressed through sexual functions and discharges; and the border of outer surfaces, as expressed through skin disease (<i>tzaraat</i>), mildew on clothing, and mold on houses. The system of avoidance and purification that is presented in Chapters 11–15 ensures that the “Holy-Area” will either not become polluted or, should that prove to be unavoidable, will be properly decontaminated, for such contamination has the potential of leading to God’s withdrawal from dwelling “in the midst” of the people of Israel."
"Torah, Leviticus, Ii: Ritual Pollution and Purification.3","The pollutants discussed in these chapters do not by and large carry with them punishments per se; that is, they are not regarded as violations of the moral order (although <i>tzaraat</i> in biblical stories often did carry the implication that the victim had in fact done something to deserve his or her condition). Nor do they pose an actual danger to the person—unless he or she comes in contact with holy objects, people, or space. Then it becomes clear that biblical pollution was considered contagious; hence the need for rituals. What was generally required was that the polluted person observe a period of separation from the sanctuary (or, in more extreme cases, from the camp), to be reintegrated after either time alone or with the addition of laundering their clothes and/or washing themselves. In the latter cases, water was seen as acting as a purifying agent, not as cleanser in the detergent sense (and so the word “unclean,” so often used in translating Heb. <i>tamei</i>, is misleading). As before, these processes applied to priests (cf. Chap. 22) and to laypeople alike (Chaps. 12–15). The major pollutant, death, was seen as so virulent that it received treatment in a separate setting, Num. 19."
"Torah, Leviticus, Ii: Ritual Pollution and Purification.4","A different category of pollution existed alongside the one we have just mentioned. It included human wrongdoing, which we might call immoral or unjust actions (e.g., incest, oppression of the poor), and also transgression of boundaries (e.g., between holy and profane, or breaching the fairly rigid system of classification in nature among animals, textiles, etc.). These types of pollution, then, involved behavior which can be seen to be disruptive or worse to the established social order. As a rule they could not be atoned for through sacrifice or other ritual forms, but lead to exile or death. They are dealt with mainly in the final section of Leviticus, Chapters 18–26."
"Torah, Leviticus, Ii: Ritual Pollution and Purification.5","For a full discussion of the issue of pollution in biblical Israel, see Frymer-Kensky (1983) and Greenstein (1984a)."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Dietary Rules.1","T<small>HE SUBJECT OF COUNTLESS INTERPRETATIONS OVER THE AGES</small>, <small>THE SYSTEM OF DI</small>etary laws laid down in Lev. 11 is best understood in the broader context of both the structure of the book and of the Levitical worldview. For the former, see the commentary to Chapter 11; for the latter, the following may be helpful."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Dietary Rules.2","It has long been recognized that seeing the dietary laws as resulting from consciousness of hygiene is a deeply inadequate way of understanding them. Nor can some of the later explanations adduced by Jewish tradition, however noble (for instance, that adhering to such a system teaches self-discipline), provide a satisfactory explanation for the rules in the context of Leviticus. What is more to the point is that the priestly worldview stressed boundaries and order. A hierarchy reigns in virtually every aspect of Israelite life as conceived in the Torah: people, land, animals, eligibility for the priesthood, the Tabernacle, and the calendar. There is a complex system of “graded holiness” (Jenson) informing Israelite life, with two basic messages: (1) God is to be approached in stages, and (2) the world is set up in a tight, ordered structure which reflects the distinctions between God and humans, Israel and the other peoples."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Dietary Rules.3","It is especially the latter that is at work in the dietary laws. The animals are discussed in categories that are reminiscent of the (priestly) creation story of Genesis 1; note the refrain in both passages of (each animal) “according to its kind.” Lev. 11 makes distinctions, and scholars have sought to understand them according to a number of possible criteria: ease/clarity of classification (anomalies, especially as regards locomotion, tend to be prohibited), whether or not the animal is carnivorous (those that are, are prohibited), and the wild or domestic status of the animal (the former are frequently prohibited). The message that emerges from the scheme is multifaceted. It would appear to hold that:"
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Dietary Rules.4","1. Human activity is to reflect the inherent orderliness of creation, a kind of imitation of God (namely, as he kept things clear at the beginning, you should do the same with what enters your body)."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Dietary Rules.5","2. The ideal state, already portrayed in the Garden of Eden story, is vegetarianism—where no animal life need be taken by humans (this despite God’s command to Adam to “dominate [the earth]” in Gen. 1:28)."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Dietary Rules.6","3. Animals permitted for consumption, among them those fit for sacrifice, are by and large those which are familiar to the Israelites in daily life through domestication. They tend to be animals often used by the Bible to symbolize humans. Eilberg-Schwartz calls this phenomenon “Israel in the mirror of nature,” and gives numerous examples extending throughout Israelite culture. He concludes that “the dietary restrictions carve up the animal world along the same lines as Israelite thought … [they] specify what kinds of animals are ‘food for thought.’”"
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Dietary Rules.7","It should be mentioned that Mary Douglas, who pioneered an anthropological approach to these laws three decades ago, has recently given them another go (1993b). In earlier studies, Douglas (1966) saw the system in Lev. 11 as we have indicated above—as a “cognitive ordering of the universe”; she also spoke of it as symbolizing the protection of boundaries in Israelite society. Her latest understanding focuses on the animals as reflective of the idea that (Israelite) culture is aimed at demonstrating God’s righteousness/justice in all areas of life, through laws regarding the body. Thus, priests, sacrificial animals, and food animals may not have any “blemish” (below, “defect”) in them; and animals prohibited for eating are either the perpetrators or victims of predation (symbolizing the human perpetrators or victims of injustice)."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Dietary Rules.8","A final point relates to a major theme in Leviticus and indeed in many of the priestly texts of the Torah: separateness. We have seen how a major function in God’s creation of the world—with which the Bible opens!—is “separating” aspects of the natural world. A parallel verb was used in the plague narratives of Exodus, “making a distinction” (between Israelites and Egyptians). With the dietary regulations, “separating” returns. Given these thematics, one can say that Chapter 11 is a linchpin of priestly thinking. Like sexual relations, the other area of intimacy in human affairs, eating in the Bible goes far beyond the confines of one’s home and comes to symbolize an entire approach to life."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Ritual Pollution of the Body.1","O<small>F SPECIAL CONCERN TO THE COMPILERS OF LEVITICUS WAS RITUAL POLLUTION ARIS</small>ing from certain physical conditions. To many people, this section is even less interesting than the opening chapters of the book, and seems impossibly bogged down in primitive conceptions of disease and hygiene. But despite the fact that they undoubtedly reflect some ancient conceptions in these areas, these conditions and the role of the priest in making rulings on them have less to do with hygiene and medicine than they do with maintaining the borders between life and death, and symbolically affirming life."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Ritual Pollution of the Body.2","It seems that the polluting discharges are primarily sexual in nature, and this is probably not accidental. The biblical priests, in their extreme concern with both procreation/genealogy (especially of men, since the priesthood was male-hereditary) and purity (in approaching the sanctuary), were presented with a major problem. God, who was to be served in purity, was also the One in whose image human beings were made (Gen. 1:26), yet as a being beyond sexuality, who had neither relationships with other deities nor even a body. He left it ambiguous as to just how humans were to work out their sexual relations. The answer to the dilemma is at least partly solved by the Torah’s regulations regarding pollution and purity, incest and marriage. It is here that the issue of control is most significant. Eilberg-Schwartz points out that control and boundaries apply not only to Israel and the nations, but also and especially to male and female. As a male hierarchy, the priests viewed women, with their closer connections to the life process (and maybe also to previous forms of paganism in the form of goddess worship), as potentially dangerous, or at least problematic, to their system of purity. The seeming “disorder” of women’s discharges (perhaps representing “nature”) threatened the imposition of order (“culture”) that is so central to priestly thinking. But as a group concerned with the perpetuation of both the priestly class and the people of Israel, the priestly class could not do without women altogether, and the inescapable conclusion was strict regulation (cf. also Wegner 1992). Such regulation—labeling certain states or acts “polluting”—had the added benefit of controlling private morality in a way that could not be done otherwise (Douglas 1966)."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Ritual Pollution of the Body.3","It is important to note that in classical Judaism after the year 70 (the date of the destruction of the Second Temple), the “purity” laws, while still assiduously studied, by and large ceased to operate except within the sphere of marriage. Thus, to this day, religious Jewish couples temporarily separate sexually during the wife’s period, but this by itself does not legally affect her participation in traditional ritual. The disease here termed <i>tzaraat</i>, translated for millennia as “leprosy,” is now recognized to be something different, perhaps several forms of skin disease involving scaling or flaking. These have nowhere near the frightening and fatal implications of classic leprosy (Hansen’s Disease). Leviticus nevertheless treats <i>tzaraat</i> at great length and in close detail. Here, perhaps more than anywhere else in the book, it is clear that at least parts of Leviticus were originally intended as manuals for priestly “instruction” (note, by the way, the sevenfold occurrence of the term in the pollution chapters, 11–15). It has been theorized that <i>tzaraat</i> is of such concern here because it was felt to resemble death/decay in a clear, outward fashion, and hence fits into these chapters, which deal so much with boundaries."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Ritual Pollution of the Body.4","An unexpected addition, from a contemporary point of view, to the <i>tzaraat</i> of the body is that which appears on textiles and on house walls (a fungus or mold or “dry rot”). The fact that the same word is used to apply to all these situations indicates that a wide concept is being applied here: how visible imperfection damages the utopia of the sacred society."
"Torah, Leviticus, On the Ritual Pollution of the Body.5","Finally, the role of the priest in these chapters should be noted. He does not function to remove demons or perform magical rites, but rather to examine the one suspected of having the disease (note the repetition of “look” in the chapter). He is more teacher and guardian of purity than healer or intermediary."

I<small>T</small> accomplishes this, not by introducing something entirely new into biblical thinking, but by broadening the base of God’s words to Moshe in Leviticus. In this book we have already encountered the “Holy-Shrine,” “holy-things,” “holy donations,” and the like; we have seen that Israel is to be “separate” from the nations around it in a variety of life areas. But now we move toward expansion of what was called for at the first moments at Sinai: for Israel to be a “[kingdom of priests and a] holy nation” (Ex. 19:6)."
"Torah, Leviticus, Iii: Holiness.3","While the exact structure and setting of the Holiness Code, as these chapters were designated a century ago, are subject to scholarly debate, its thrust seems clear enough. Beginning with sexual relations, Israel is to be “holy,” “separate” from other nations. Holiness here has a connotation of wholeness and perfection; Wright (1992) has defined it as “that which is consistent with God and his character.”"
"Torah, Leviticus, Iii: Holiness.4","<i>Imitatio dei</i>, the human urge to be godlike, is an ancient, undoubtedly prehistoric one. We long to be linked with the primal powers of existence, whose rush we feel at heightened moments of <i>perception</i>, but whose perfection is always out of reach in the flesh and blood world of human beings. The Torah, in contrast, presents the longing for perfection and wholeness as properly expressed through a discipline of <i>behavior</i> in all areas of life, personal and communal. The central lines “Holy are you to be, / for holy am I, YHWH your God” (19:2) are followed by line after line calling for holiness in worship, agriculture, interpersonal relations, business, the treatment of the disabled and the elderly, court procedure, and sexuality, to list some of the areas covered."
"Torah, Leviticus, Iii: Holiness.5","Many communities of the “elect,” from Qumran at the Dead Sea to medieval monasteries, and many individuals, from biblical Nazirites (Num. 6) to Sufi mystics and St. Francis, have sought to create lives suffused with holiness; one could easily maintain that many of the mainstream forms and ideas in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have remained wedded to this approach. They all owe a debt, one way or the other, to Lev. 18–26, especially in the communal sphere. Rarely has the drive toward holiness found as full expression in a vision of “real life” society, grounded in the everyday world of people and institutions, as it does in the texts to be found in the following chapters."
"Torah, Leviticus, Iii: Holiness.6","For many decades, debate has raged within the scholarly community as to the date and setting of H, the putative stratum of literature to which these chapters belong. As of this writing there is still not full agreement on (a) whether H was indeed a separate document or school, and (b) whether its origin and influence can be easily traced (cf., for instance, Knohl, and Milgrom 1993). These disagreements, however, should not and must not detract from the importance of what we have in these chapters: a significant statement of the ethical code of ancient Israel which continues to speak to contemporary problems."

"Torah, Numbers.1.1","<i>The Mustering of Israel</i> (1): For the opening of the book about the Israelites’ wanderings in the wilderness, the editor has chosen a logical point of departure: a tally of males prepared for war, listed by tribe. It is in fact a double list—first, the names of the tribal representatives who are to assist Moshe, and second, the count itself. The chapter is the epitome of orderliness, proceeding from the date of the census to who is to be counted, on to the counters and the census itself, and finally a treatment of the special case of the Levites (who, as noncombatants, are not mustered). It utilizes a number of repeating phrases, especially in the central census section. In this sense, the opening chapters of the book are a fitting companion to Leviticus—which likewise opens with God speaking from the Tent of Appointment, still in the Wilderness of Sinai."
"Torah, Numbers.1.2","The large numbers that appear here have been a major source of debate in modern as well as earlier interpretation. After all, extrapolating from 600,000 adult males (excluding the elderly), one certainly winds up with a population in the millions—a theoretically possible but extremely unlikely scenario. Some alternatives are: (a) to understand Hebrew <i>elef</i> as not “thousand,” but rather as “unit” or “division,” which would especially make sense in a military setting; and (b) to regard the numbers as simply exaggerated. One might also, following Olson, see the statistics here as an attempt to impress the audience with the size of Israel, and/or to demonstrate how God has blessed them (as in the promises to Avraham in Genesis and the account in Ex. 1). There may, finally, be a “numbers game” occurring here, that is, some kind of symbolism of figures that eludes us (cf. Sarna 1986)."

By the end of Numbers, the text reaches year forty—yet this will occur over a relatively short stretch of text. Thus, typically, the time frame of the Torah operates."
"Torah, Numbers.1.138","2 <b>Take up the head-count:</b> Others, “Take a census,” “calculate the total.” Although “count” is a theme word in this chapter, the Hebrew for “head-count” here is simply “head,” and is not meant to reflect use of the Hebrew verb <i>pakod.</i> <b>community:</b> Alternatively, “assembly.” The term <i>eda</i> can mean either the ruling council or the entire people (with a focus on the males, in both cases). <b>clans … Fathers’ Houses:</b> Units of social organization in ancient Israel. <b>per capita:</b> The English/Latin expression for “by the head”; Heb. “by their skulls.”"
"Torah, Numbers.1.139",3 <b>going out to the armed-forces:</b> The force of this expression seems to be “eligible for military service” <b>count them (for battle):</b> Or “muster” or “array“; more than mere counting is meant.

"Torah, Numbers.1.142","24 <b>Gad:</b> Why does Gad break into the genealogical list at this point? He is not Jacob’s third son. Milgrom points out that the order of this list depends on the physical arrangement of the tribes around the Tabernacle (cf. Chap. 2), not birth order."
"Torah, Numbers.1.143","46 <b>603,550:</b> The round number 600,000 is the biblically agreed-upon total of military-age adult Israelite males that left Egypt. Cassuto (1967) sees it as an indicator of the centrality of a numbering system based on sixty, as was common in Mesopotamia; others (Greenstein and Marcus 1976) cite the importance of five in Assyrian texts, and thus 600,000 would derive from 5 × 10,000 × 12."

"Torah, Numbers.2.1","<i>The Layout of the Camp</i> (2): Chap. 2 lays out a schematic diagram of the Israelite camp prepared for the desert march.

"Torah, Numbers.2.62","51 <b>comes-near … put-to-death:</b> This is the first mention of a central problem in priestly texts: getting too close to the sphere of the holy (Milgrom terms it “encroachment”). Cf. 2:2 below, with the Israelites camping around the Dwelling “at a distance,” and the story of Korah (Chaps. 16f.), where it is a central issue."
"Torah, Numbers.2.63","52 <b>banner-contingent:</b> The word <i>degel</i> originally signifies “banner,” but comes to mean also the military grouping that stands under it."
"Torah, Numbers.2.64","53 <b>keep the charge:</b> Or “discharge the charge.” Levine understands <i>shamor mishmeret</i> as doing the general maintenance duties of the sanctuary. Milgrom, on the other hand, argues strongly for the narrower meaning in Numbers of strictly “guarding the guard duty,” citing ancient Near Eastern parallels for temple guardians."
"Torah, Numbers.2.65",54 <b>… thus they did:</b> A standard way of reporting the carrying out of God’s command in priestly texts.
"Torah, Numbers.2.66","2:9 <b>to march:</b> The Hebrew <i>naso’a</i> means literally “to pull up stakes” (i.e., tent pegs) and hence “to move on“; but the moving in Numbers frequently has a military nuance."
"Torah, Numbers.2.67",10 <b>southward:</b> Lit. “on the right hand.”
"Torah, Numbers.3.1","<i>Levites I</i> (3): Already introduced in 1:47–53, the issue of the Levites’ status and their tasks is an important subtheme in Numbers, and makes its central appearance in Chaps. 3 and 4. The present chapter opens with the genealogy of Moshe and Aharon (similarly, Chap. 6 of Exodus, which is a prologue to the Plague cycle, contains a genealogy of the two leaders)."
"Torah, Numbers.3.2","Notable is the concept that the Levites symbolically replace all the firstborn sons among the Israelites. In a more manageable way, then, the entire community participates in the sacred task of ministering in the sanctuary."
"Torah, Numbers.3.3","Theme words in the chapter, not surprisingly, are “charge,” “count/accountable,” and “serve/serving-tasks.” Milgrom has also noted the sevenfold “by order of Y<small>HWH</small>” that permeates this chapter and the next."
"Torah, Numbers.3.4",3:1 Now these are the begettings of Aharon and Moshe at the time Y<small>HWH</small> spoke with Moshe on Mount Sinai:
"Torah, Numbers.3.5","2 These are the names of the sons of Aharon: the firstborn—Nadav,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.6","and Avihu,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.7",El’azar and Itamar;
"Torah, Numbers.3.8","3 these are the names of the sons of Aharon, the anointed priests,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.9",whom he had mandated to act-as-priests.
"Torah, Numbers.3.10","4 Now Nadav and Avihu died before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.11",when they brought-near outside fire before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Numbers.3.12",in the Wilderness of Sinai;
"Torah, Numbers.3.13","sons they did not have,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.14",so El’azar and Itamar were made-priest in the living-presence of Aharon their father.
"Torah, Numbers.3.15","5 Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.3.16","6 Bring-near the tribe of Levi,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.17","and have-it-stand (regularly) in the presence of Aharon the priest,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.18",that they may attend upon him.
"Torah, Numbers.3.19","7 They are to keep his charge and the charge of the entire community,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.20","in front of the Tent of Appointment,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.21",to serve the serving-tasks of the Dwelling.
"Torah, Numbers.3.22",8 They are to be-in-charge of the implements of the Tent of Appointment
"Torah, Numbers.3.23","and the charge of the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.24",to serve the serving-tasks of the Dwelling.
"Torah, Numbers.3.25","9 You are to give-over the Levites to Aharon and to his sons,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.26","formally-given, given-over are they to him, from among the Children of Israel."
"Torah, Numbers.3.27","10 And Aharon and his sons, you are to make-accountable,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.28",that they may keep-the-charge of their priesthood;
"Torah, Numbers.3.29",the outsider who comes-near is to be put-to-death!
"Torah, Numbers.3.30","11 Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.3.31","12 As for me, I hereby take the Levites from the midst of the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.32","in place of every firstborn, breacher of womb from the Children of Israel;"
"Torah, Numbers.3.33","they shall be mine, the Levites."
"Torah, Numbers.3.34",13 For mine is every firstborn;
"Torah, Numbers.3.35","at the time that I struck-down every firstborn in the land of Egypt,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.36","I hallowed to me every firstborn in Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.37",from man to beast.
"Torah, Numbers.3.38",Mine shall they be—
"Torah, Numbers.3.39",I am Y<small>HWH</small>!
"Torah, Numbers.3.40","14 Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe in the Wilderness of Sinai, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.3.41","15 Count the Sons of Levi, by their Fathers’ House, by their clans,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.42","every male from the age of a month and upward, you are to count them."
"Torah, Numbers.3.43","16 So Moshe counted them by order of Y<small>HWH</small>, as he was commanded."
"Torah, Numbers.3.44",17 Now these were the Sons of Levi according to their names:
"Torah, Numbers.3.45","Gershon, Kehat and Merari."
"Torah, Numbers.3.46","18 And these the names of the sons of Gershon, by their clans:"
"Torah, Numbers.3.47",Livni and Shim’i.

"Torah, Numbers.3.50","20 And the sons of Merari, by their clans:"
"Torah, Numbers.3.51",Mahli and Mushi.
"Torah, Numbers.3.52","These are they, the Levite clans, by their Fathers’ House."
"Torah, Numbers.3.53","21 For Gershon, the Livnite clan and the Shim’ite clan,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.54","these are they, the Gershonite clans:"
"Torah, Numbers.3.55","22 those counted of them, according to the number of every male from the age of a month and upward,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.56",those counted of them: seven thousand and five hundred.
"Torah, Numbers.3.57","23 The Gershonite clans—behind the Dwelling they are to camp, seaward."

"Torah, Numbers.3.59",25 The charge of the Sons of Gershon at the Tent of Appointment (was)
"Torah, Numbers.3.60","the Dwelling and the Tent,"

"Torah, Numbers.3.62","26 the hangings of the courtyard,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.63",the screen of the entrance to the courtyard which is about the Dwelling
"Torah, Numbers.3.64","and about the slaughter-site, all around,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.65",and its cords—including all their serving tasks.
"Torah, Numbers.3.66","27 To Kehat, the Amramite clan, the Yitzharite clan, the Hevronite clan, and the Uzzi’elite clan,"

"Torah, Numbers.3.71","29 The clans of the Sons of Kehat are to encamp along the flank of the Dwelling, southward."

"Torah, Numbers.3.73","31 Their charge: the coffer, the table, the lampstand and the slaughter-sites,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.74","and the implements of holiness that are used in conjunction with them,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.75",and the screen—and all their serving-tasks.
"Torah, Numbers.3.76","32 Now the leader of the Levite leaders: El’azar son of Aharon the priest,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.77",accountable for the keepers of the charge of the holy-things.
"Torah, Numbers.3.78","33 To Merari—the Mahlite clan and the Mushite clan,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.79","these (are they), the Merarite clans."

"Torah, Numbers.3.83","On the flank of the Dwelling they are to camp, northward."
"Torah, Numbers.3.84",36 Accountable for the (following) charge (are) the Sons of Merari:
"Torah, Numbers.3.85","the boards of the Dwelling and its bars,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.86","its columns, its sockets, and all its implements,"

"Torah, Numbers.3.88","37 the columns of the courtyard, all around, and their bases,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.89",their posts and their cords.
"Torah, Numbers.3.90","38 Now those encamping in front of the Dwelling, eastward, in front of the Tent of Appointment, toward-unrise,"

"Torah, Numbers.3.92","keepers of the charge of the Holy-Area,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.93",for the charge of the Children of Israel;
"Torah, Numbers.3.94",the outsider who comes-near is to be put-to-death!
"Torah, Numbers.3.95","39 All those counted of the Levites, whom Moshe and Aharon counted by order of Y<small>HWH</small>, by their clans,"

"Torah, Numbers.3.97",two and twenty thousand.
"Torah, Numbers.3.98",40 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:

"Torah, Numbers.3.100","from the age of a month and upward,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.101",take-up the enumeration of their names.

"Torah, Numbers.3.106",in place of every firstborn animal among the Children of Israel.
"Torah, Numbers.3.107","42 Moshe made an accounting, as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.108",of every firstborn among the Children of Israel.
"Torah, Numbers.3.109","43 And it was, every firstborn male by the number of names,"
"Torah, Numbers.3.110","from the age of a month and upward, by their count:"
"Torah, Numbers.3.111","two and twenty thousand, three and seventy and two hundred."
"Torah, Numbers.3.112","44 And Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.3.130",_____________
"Torah, Numbers.3.131","3:1 <b>these are the begettings:</b> The same formula with which begin a number of genealogical lists in Genesis. Outside of the royal (Davidic) genealogy that appears in Ruth 4:18, the phrase occurs only here beyond Genesis—as if to suggest that Moshe and Aharon are continuers of the Patriarchal traditions. For a detailed discussion of the issue, cf. Olson."
"Torah, Numbers.3.132",3 <b>anointed priests:</b> This designation occurs only here in the Torah. <b>mandated:</b> Inducted into office; cf. note to Ex. 28:41.
"Torah, Numbers.3.133","4 <b>Nadav and Avihu died: Cf.</b> Lev. 10. <b>in the living-presence:</b> That is, in the lifetime (of their father); cf. Gen. 11:28 for another example."
"Torah, Numbers.3.134","6 <b>Bring-near:</b> Meaning “qualify” in this context (Milgrom). <b>have-it-stand:</b> Denoting official status. <b>attend upon:</b> Or “assist,” “minister to,” “serve.”"
"Torah, Numbers.3.135",8 <b>serving-tasks:</b> Heb. <i>’avoda</i> denotes physical labor in these texts (Milgrom).
"Torah, Numbers.3.136","9 <b>formally-given, given-over:</b> Commissioned."
"Torah, Numbers.3.137",12 <b>breacher:</b> Or “loosener.”
"Torah, Numbers.3.138",13 <b>at the time:</b> Heb. “on the day” frequently has this connotation. <b>I hallowed … every firstborn:</b> Cf. Ex. 13.
"Torah, Numbers.3.139","16 <b>by order of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Or “direct order”; lit. “at the mouth of Y<small>HWH</small>,” frequently indicating an oracle."
"Torah, Numbers.3.140",16–17 <b>commanded. / Now these were:</b> An ancient version reads “commanded Y<small>HWH</small>. / These (are).”
"Torah, Numbers.3.141","26 <b>serving-tasks:</b> Heb. <i>’avoda</i> here specifically includes packing, carrying, and setting up."
"Torah, Numbers.3.142","28 <b>six hundred:</b> The probable reading is “three hundred,” with Hebrew <i>shalosh</i> having been mis-copied as <i>shesh;</i> this squares with the Septuagint reading and gives the correct total in v.39."
"Torah, Numbers.3.143","31 <b>coffer:</b> Trad. “Ark [of the Covenant].” “Ark” in English derives from Latin <i>arcus,</i> meaning a chest or box, as does the Hebrew <i>aron.</i>"
"Torah, Numbers.3.144","39 <b>Moshe and Aharon:</b> The traditional Hebrew text has dots placed above Aharon’s name here, perhaps the equivalent of an asterisk. This denotes some scribal concerns about the text—maybe the inconsistency with 3:14–15, where only Moshe is commanded to count the Levites."
"Torah, Numbers.3.145",41 <b>animals:</b> Milgrom has “cattle.”
"Torah, Numbers.4.1","<i>Levites II</i> (4): Here the tasks of the Levites are presented in great detail and listed according to clan. The jobs involve the guarding, dismantling, and transport of the “sancta” (holy objects). We are subsequently given a census of the Levites from ages 30 to 50, which fits here better than in Chap. 1. This age of service implies, perhaps, the physical strain associated with Levite tasks."
"Torah, Numbers.4.2","4:1 Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.4.47","accountable for all the Dwelling and all that is in it,"
"Torah, Numbers.4.48",whether the holy-things or its implements.
"Torah, Numbers.4.49","17 Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.4.76",You are to make them accountable for discharging all their carrying-chores.

"Torah, Numbers.4.108","by their clans, by their Fathers’ House,"
"Torah, Numbers.4.109","43 from the age of thirty years and upward until the age of fifty years,"
"Torah, Numbers.4.110","Here, as in several other cases in the book of Numbers, texts that one might have expected to find in Leviticus seem to have been deferred. The reasons are not difficult to fathom. Leviticus as it has been edited deals with three broad areas: the sacrificial cult, ritual pollution and purification, and holiness in communal and priestly behavior. Chaps. 5 and 6 of Numbers do not easily fit into these categories, although some connections can be found. These chapters are also long, detailed cases, and it is possible that they might have deflected the central thrust of Leviticus."
"Torah, Numbers.4.111","Having said this, Chap. 5 opens, appropriately, with concern for the purity of the sacred camp that has just been described in Chap. 2. It continues with an innovation (vv.5–10): some sins that were intentional can now apparently be expiated via confession and an <i>asham</i>-offering (cf. Lev. 5)—unlike the situation that obtains in Lev. 4–5, where it is only sins committed “in error” that are forgivable by means of the sacrificial system (with the addition of confession and restitution). This little section has been placed here perhaps because of its verbal link with the next, larger section—which addresses the issue of “breaking faith” (vv.6 and 12)."
"Torah, Numbers.4.112","Beginning with v.11, we encounter a strange ceremony such as is found nowhere else in the Torah. Its odd aspects are not surprising, though, given the gravity of the accusation. Adultery in ancient Israel was a capital crime, while in the rest of the ancient Near East (Mesopotamia, for instance) it could sometimes be expiated through payment to the wronged husband. And significantly, it is the husband who is in total control here, and the mere “breath of suspicion” (a possible rendering of the text’s “rush of jealousy” in v.14) on his part results in a grave psychological ordeal for his wife. This is consistent with the male control over the sexuality of wives (and daughters) often observed in biblical texts (cf. Wegner 1988); there was of course no such procedure in regard to husbands. The last verse is telling; it presumes guilt on the part of the wife."
"Torah, Numbers.4.113","Frymer-Kensky (1984) sees the chapter as a manual for priests, and as a ritual that addresses “a crisis in the legal system”—for the crime is not provable by human agency (Milgrom points out that the word for “adultery” does not appear at all). She views the structure of the central parts of the ritual as revolving around pairs of verbs: the priest is to have the woman “stand before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>” (vv.16–18); “swear” (vv.19, 21); and “drink” (vv.24, 27). The combination of drink, oath-taking, and declaration of innocence is found elsewhere in the ancient Near East (Fishbane 1974)."
"Torah, Numbers.4.114","Fishbane (1980) notes how the chapter ends with two summaries (vv.29 and 30) relating back to the descriptions in vv.12–14. The phrase found at the end of the chapter, “This is the Instruction,” often concludes ritual sections in the Torah (cf. Lev. 11–15), and indeed is found in 6:21 below; it may indicate the former existence of these laws in separate scrolls."

"Torah, Numbers.5.82","Three prohibitions characterize the Nazirite: no drinking anything made from grapes (note the Bible’s early sense that cultivation of the vine is problematic—the story of Noah’s drunkenness in Gen. 9:20ff.); no shaving the hair (hair was understood by the ancients as possessing almost magical characteristics); and no contact with the dead (including relatives; death was considered the major poilutant in Israelite thinking). Given that the Nazirite’s vow has a finite period, Milgrom theorizes that our chapter represents a priestly attempt to control ascetic urges."
"Torah, Numbers.5.83","The ritual (vv.12ff.) that ends the Nazirite’s “state of consecration” involves a variety of sacrifices, most notably a <i>hattat</i>-offering (cf. Lev. 4). This purification offering suggested to later interpreters that the Nazirite vow was to be viewed in at least a somewhat negative light. Certainly by Rabbinic times, formative Judaism came to look askance at undue asceticism; on the other hand, religious vows and abstentions were to survive and even flourish in medieval and later Judaism, Christianity, and Islam."
"Torah, Numbers.5.84","In light of the fact that a Nazirite could be either a man or a woman, the translation of this chapter uses “one” regularly instead of the text’s “he”—which in any event indicates both genders in this chapter."

"Torah, Numbers.5.103","5:2 <b><i>tzaraat:</i></b> Pronounced “tzah-<i>rah</i>-aht.” Apparently a category of skin disease, which rendered a person temporarily “polluted.” Such a person was a danger to the sanctuary (too much pollution would drive God away, as it were), and had to withdraw from the camp boundaries for a time, like the others mentioned in this chapter (cf. Lev. 13–14 for details). <b>flow:</b> Such as semen or menstrual blood. <b>by a (dead) person:</b> Physical contact with a corpse."
"Torah, Numbers.5.104","6 <b>breaking-faith:</b> So JPS. In Lev. 5:15ff. the term refers to sacrilege against holy objects in the sanctuary. Here it encompasses wrongdoing against persons, which is seen as rebellion against God. Cf. also v.12 below."

"Torah, Numbers.5.110","18 <b>Water of Bitterness Bringing the Bane:</b> Hebrew difficult. Nevertheless, it is clear (and significant) that the formula is alliterative and thus has a ritual, almost magical ring: <i>mei ha-marim ha-me’arrarim.</i> Another possible rendering, after an interpretation of Frymer-Kensky (1984) and others, is “Waters of Instruction, of Spell-Induction.”"
"Torah, Numbers.5.111","21 <b>oath curse:</b> or “threat,” the part of the oath threatening punishment. <b>thigh fall … belly flood:</b> While the precise biological process is not clear (the suggestions vary from miscarriage to a prolapsed uterus), sterility is one possible meaning. “Thigh” in the Bible is often a euphemism for genitals (e.g., Gen. 24:2). It is also possible that the woman is pregnant and that the intention is to abort the fetus, since if the husband’s suspicions of adultery are founded, the child will be illegitimate and hence a threat to the purity of Israel (Levine)."
"Torah, Numbers.5.112","22 <b>Amen!:</b> Lit. “established,” “firm” (i.e., true)."

"Torah, Numbers.6.1","<i>The Nazirite</i> (6:1–21): A “consecrated” or “separate” person, traditionally transcribed as “Nazirite” after the Hebrew <i>nazir</i>, was one who took upon himself or herself a special vow, exceeding the normal demands of the religious life. The urge to such behavior appears throughout the ages in many religious traditions, and doubtless reflects a deep-seated human desire. The motivation may stem from a joyous or tragic event, or simply from the need to serve God in what is felt to be a fuller way."
"Torah, Numbers.6.2","<i>The Priestly Blessing</i> (6:22–27) with which the chapter ends is striking and sufficiently beloved by Jews to have survived to this day in the synagogue liturgy. But why is it here? Perhaps the blessing of the people is yet another example of a priestly function that has not been preserved in Leviticus, since it relates neither to sacrifice nor to purification (although it should be pointed out that Moshe and Aharon give an unquoted blessing to the people in Lev. 9:23)."
"Torah, Numbers.6.3","The blessing itself makes wonderful use of ancient Hebrew rhythm, with a threefold structure of progressively longer lines that is reminiscent of a magical formula. The varied verbs give comfort and reassurance, as does the last word of the blessing: <i>shalom</i> (“well-being”). The benevolent “lifting” of God’s face is a known image in the ancient Near East (cf. the references in Fishbane 1988). Its devastating opposite, the “hiding” of his face, is found in the Psalms, and also in Deut. 31."
"Torah, Numbers.6.4","That this section was popular already in biblical times is indicated by its occurrence in a two-part version in Ps. 67:2, as well as its appearance, in various forms, on ancient Israelite amulets."

"Torah, Numbers.7.1",<i>The Gifts to the Sanctuary</i> (7): Chaps. 7–9 constitute a threefold conclusion to the Tabernacle texts that began in Ex. 25. The contribution of each chapter will be explained in sequence.
"Torah, Numbers.7.2","The longest chapter in the Torah in number of verses, and another one of the many lists in the book, Chap. 7 parallels what Levine calls “temple accounts” in the ancient Near East. These are inventory lists that were frequently written in columns. At the same time, it is a ritual text that focuses on description and not prescription, which is more usual. The chapter ends in v.89 with the first of our Tabernacle endings: a description of precisely where God would communicate with Moshe within the “Holiest Holy-Shrine.” The implication is that with the dedication of the structure, its purpose can now be fulfilled."
"Torah, Numbers.7.3","The length of the chapter reinforces the importance and grandeur of the ceremony, and makes of the “Dwelling” an institution in which all participate, not only priests and Levites (Levine)."
"Torah, Numbers.7.4","7:1 Now it was, at the time that Moshe finished setting up the Dwelling,"
"Torah, Numbers.7.5","he anointed it and hallowed it, with all its implements,"

"Torah, Numbers.7.13","When they had brought-them-near to the Dwelling,"
"Torah, Numbers.7.14","4 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.7.16","that they may serve for the service-of-transport of the Tent of Appointment,"
"Torah, Numbers.7.17","and give them to the Levites, each-man according to his serving-tasks."
"Torah, Numbers.7.18",6 Moshe took the wagons and the cattle
"Torah, Numbers.7.19",and gave them to the Levites.
"Torah, Numbers.7.20","7 Two wagons and four cattle he gave to the Sons of Gershon, according to their serving-orders,"

"Torah, Numbers.7.28","And when the leaders brought-near their near-offering before the slaughter-site,"
"Torah, Numbers.7.29",11 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:

"Torah, Numbers.8.1","<i>Purifying the Levites</i> (8): A parallel to Lev. 8–9, where the dedication of the priests is the last act before the cult goes into operation, this chapter concludes the Levitical portions of Part I of Numbers—a distinctive contribution, as we have noted. Many scholars see the Levitical sections as reflections of later power struggles within the Israelite priesthood. In Levine’s view, this evolution (perhaps from family-based guilds into a full-fledged tribe) is an indication of a relatively late provenance for our text here."
"Torah, Numbers.8.2","Milgrom rightly makes the distinction between the “purification” of the Levites and the higher-level “hallowing” (i.e., sanctification) of the priests. It is also interesting to note the cultic rites used here: the offering of a <i>hattat</i> (the standard purificatory sacrifice), and mention of the Levites themselves being considered an “elevation-offering” (v.11)."

Also possible in this context is “present … presentation-offering.” Trad, “wave-offering,” which, as Milgrom shows, is probably incorrect.

"Torah, Numbers.9.1","<i>The Second Passover; Cloud and Dwelling</i> (9): It has been noted by Milgrom that, a number of times in the Bible, ceremonies dedicating a House of God are followed by the observance of one of the three pilgrimage festivals: Passover, Shavuot (Weeks), and Sukkot (Huts). Under Solomon, Hezekiah, Josiah, and Ezra/Nehemiah, respectively, we find a major celebration of Sukkot, Passover, Passover, and Sukkot. This linking of sacred space with sacred time is only natural. The account here echoes the first Passover as well, which similarly inaugurated a wilderness march (Milgrom). In contrast to the Exodus account, however, something new has been added with the inauguration of the Tabernacle/Dwelling. In Exodus (12:43–49), the major laws concerning Passover had to do with excluding non-Israelites and not breaking the bones of the sacrificial lamb; here, the bone motif returns, but the existence of the sanctuary raises the issue of ritual pollution."
"Torah, Numbers.9.2","The second part of the chapter (vv. 15–23) parallels the ending of the book of Exodus (40:36–38), where, once the Tabernacle has been dedicated, the “Cloud” takes up residence there, to guide Israel “on all their marches.” Our passage here is longer and rather redundant, perhaps in order to set the chronological framework of the narrative straight."

"Torah, Numbers.10.2","A few other brief traditions have been included here: first, a renewed mention of Moshe’s father-in-law (cf. Ex. 18), who is exhorted to accompany the Israelites to Canaan.

"Torah, Numbers.10.3","The departure sequence ends, as sections in the Bible sometimes do, with a poem—in this case, the battle cry (similar to the one in Ps. 68:2) associated with the coffer (vv.35–36).

"Torah, Numbers.11.2","The chapter that introduces the rebellion narratives is long and complex. Although it resembles Ex. 16 (the manna chapter) in some general respects, it has its own distinct vocabulary and concerns. It is stylistically held together by the repeating roots “eat,” “gather,” and “weep”; the “grumbling” of the Exodus story does not yet appear. The chapter combines the people’s complaints about the manna (and a concomitant craving for meat) with Moshe’s complaints about how difficult it is to lead this people; both receive answer from God, the people in the form of quails and Moshe through the dissemination of prophetic gifts to others in the camp."
"Torah, Numbers.11.3","It is in this chapter that Moshe—the dramatic and at times tragic Moshe of the Golden Calf story in Exodus—reappears as a character with deep emotions. Although his fate as a leader destined never to enter the Promised Land is not sealed until Chap. 20, one has the sense already here that the strain of his mission is beginning to tell. The vividness of the portrayal of Moshe is matched by that of the Children of Israel, whose words, usually complaints, include the picturesque description of Egyptian cuisine in v.5."

"Torah, Numbers.11.7",and ate up the edge of the camp.
"Torah, Numbers.11.8",2 The people cried out to Moshe
"Torah, Numbers.11.9","and Moshe interceded to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.10",and the fire abated.
"Torah, Numbers.11.11","3 So they called the name of that place Tav’era/Blaze,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.12",for (there) had blazed against them fire of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Numbers.11.13",4 Now the gathered-riffraff that were among them
"Torah, Numbers.11.14","had a craving, hunger-craving,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.15","and moreover they again wept, the Children of Israel, and said:"
"Torah, Numbers.11.16",Who will give us meat to eat?
"Torah, Numbers.11.17","5 We recall the fish that we used to eat in Egypt for free,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.18","the cucumbers, the watermelons,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.19","the green-leeks, the onions, and the garlic!"
"Torah, Numbers.11.20","6 But now, our throats are dry;"
"Torah, Numbers.11.21",there is nothing at all
"Torah, Numbers.11.22",except for the <i>mahn</i> (in front of) our eyes!
"Torah, Numbers.11.23","7 —Now the <i>mahn</i> is like seed of coriander,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.24",its aspect like the aspect of bdellium.
"Torah, Numbers.11.25","8 The people would roam around and collect it,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.26","grind it in millstones or crush it in a crusher,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.27","boil it in a pot, and make it into cakes,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.28",so that its taste was like the taste of (something) rich (made with) oil.
"Torah, Numbers.11.29","9 And when the dew came down on the camp at night,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.30",the <i>mahn</i> would come down on top of it.—
"Torah, Numbers.11.31","10 Moshe heard the people weeping by their clans,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.32",each-man at the entrance to his tent.
"Torah, Numbers.11.33","Now Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up exceedingly,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.34",and in the eyes of Moshe it was ill.
"Torah, Numbers.11.35",11 Moshe said to Y<small>HWH</small>:
"Torah, Numbers.11.36","For-what have you dealt-ill with your servant,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.37","for-what-reason have I not found favor in your eyes,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.38",(that you) have placed the burden of this entire people on me?
"Torah, Numbers.11.39","12 Did I myself conceive this entire people,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.40","or did I myself give-birth to it,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.41","that you should say to me,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.42",Carry it in your bosom
"Torah, Numbers.11.43","like a nursing-parent carries a suckling-child,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.44",to the soil about which you swore to their fathers?
"Torah, Numbers.11.45","13 Where should I (get) meat to give to this entire people,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.46","when they weep on me, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.11.47",Give us meat so that we may eat!
"Torah, Numbers.11.48","14 I am not able, myself alone, to carry this entire people,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.49",for it is too heavy for me!
"Torah, Numbers.11.50","15 If thus you deal with me,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.51","pray kill me, yes, kill me,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.52","if I have found favor in your eyes,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.53",so that I do not have to see my ill-fortune!
"Torah, Numbers.11.54",16 Then Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.11.55","Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.56","of whom you know that they are elders of the people and its officers,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.57","and take them to the Tent of Appointment,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.58",stationing them there with you.
"Torah, Numbers.11.59","17 I will come down and speak with you there,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.60",I will extend from the rushing-spirit that is upon you
"Torah, Numbers.11.61",and place it upon them;
"Torah, Numbers.11.62","then they will carry along with you the burden of the people,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.63","so that you will not (have to) carry it, you alone."
"Torah, Numbers.11.64",18 Now to the people you are to say:
"Torah, Numbers.11.65","Hallow yourselves for the morrow that you may eat meat,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.66","for you have wept in the ears of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.11.67",Who will give us meat to eat?
"Torah, Numbers.11.68",For it was better for us in Egypt!
"Torah, Numbers.11.69","Y<small>HWH</small> will give you meat, and you shall eat it:"
"Torah, Numbers.11.70","19 not for (only) one day shall you eat it, and not for two days,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.71",not for five days or for ten days or (even) for twenty days—
"Torah, Numbers.11.72","20 (but) for a monthful of days,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.73",until it comes out of your nostrils
"Torah, Numbers.11.74","and becomes for you something-disgusting,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.75","because you have spurned Y<small>HWH</small> who is among you,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.76","by weeping before him, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.11.77",For-what-reason did we leave Egypt?
"Torah, Numbers.11.78",21 Moshe said:
"Torah, Numbers.11.79",Six hundred thousand on foot
"Torah, Numbers.11.80","(are) the (fighting-)people among whom I am,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.81","yet you, you say:"
"Torah, Numbers.11.82","Meat I will give them,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.83",and they are to eat (it) for a monthful of days?!
"Torah, Numbers.11.84","22 Are there flocks and herds that may be slain for them,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.85",that they would find-them-sufficient?
"Torah, Numbers.11.86","Or are there all the fish of the sea to be caught for them,"
"Torah, Numbers.11.87",that they would find-them-sufficient?
"Torah, Numbers.11.88",23 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.11.89",Is the arm of Y<small>HWH</small> (too) short?
"Torah, Numbers.11.90",Now you shall see whether my word happens to you or not.
"Torah, Numbers.11.91",_____________
"Torah, Numbers.11.92","11:4 <b>gathered-riffraff:</b> Heb. <i>asafsuf,</i> from the verb that means “to gather.” Perhaps parallel to the ragtag “mixed multitude” <i>(erev rav)</i> of Ex. 12:38. So the rebellion over food starts among the fringes of the community."

"Torah, Numbers.12.1","<i>Sibling Rebellion</i> (12): A challenge to Moshe’s leadership, which we had encountered both in Exodus and in the previous chapter, now comes from an unexpected source—Aharon and Miryam. Their complaint begins with some kind of objection to Moshe’s wife, but its core is quickly revealed in v.2: Does not God speak through them as well as through their stuttering brother? Milgrom speculates that it is the spreading of prophetic gifts in the previous chapter that gives them the idea. God’s response is to clarify Moshe’s uniqueness, and to punish Miryam—yet Aharon gets off easily here, possibly owing to a later editor who was highly sympathetic to the priesthood descended from Aharon, or because the latter, as High Priest, could not be tainted by <i>tzaraat</i> without damaging his priesthood, as Lev. 22:4ff. suggests (Sakenfeld)."
"Torah, Numbers.12.2","Chap. 12 is linked to the previous chapter by use of the words “eat” and “gather.” As its own unit, it is built on the ironic use of Heb. <i>dabber be</i>-, which can mean either “speak through” or “speak against.”"
"Torah, Numbers.12.3",24 Moshe went out and spoke to the people the words of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Numbers.12.4","He gathered seventy men from the elders of the people,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.5",and had-them-stand around the tent.
"Torah, Numbers.12.6",25 And Y<small>HWH</small> came down in a cloud
"Torah, Numbers.12.7","and spoke to him,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.8",and Y<small>HWH</small> extended some of the rushing-spirit that was upon him
"Torah, Numbers.12.9","and put it upon the seventy men, the elders;"
"Torah, Numbers.12.10","and it was,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.11","when the spirit rested upon them,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.12","that they acted-like-prophets, but did not continue."
"Torah, Numbers.12.13","26 Now two men remained in the camp,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.14","the name of the one was Eldad,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.15","the name of the second, Meidad,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.16",and the spirit rested upon them
"Torah, Numbers.12.17","—they were among those-recorded,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.18",but they had not gone out to the Tent—
"Torah, Numbers.12.19",and they acted-like-prophets in the camp.
"Torah, Numbers.12.20",27 A (certain) lad ran
"Torah, Numbers.12.21","and told Moshe, he said:"
"Torah, Numbers.12.22",Eldad and Meidad are acting-like-prophets in the camp!
"Torah, Numbers.12.23","28 Then Yehoshua son of Nun, Moshe’s attendant from his youth, spoke up,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.24",he said:
"Torah, Numbers.12.25","My lord Moshe, contain them!"
"Torah, Numbers.12.26",29 But Moshe said to him:

"Torah, Numbers.12.28","O who would give that all the people of Y<small>HWH</small> were prophets,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.29",that Y<small>HWH</small> would put the rush-of-his spirit upon them!
"Torah, Numbers.12.30","30 Moshe took himself back to the camp,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.31",he and the elders of Israel;
"Torah, Numbers.12.32",31 and a rush‐of‐wind moved from Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Numbers.12.33","and swept in quails from the sea,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.34",they spread out over the camp
"Torah, Numbers.12.35","as far as a day’s journey here and a day’s journey there,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.36","all around the camp,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.37",and about two cubits upon the face of the ground.
"Torah, Numbers.12.38","32 The people arose all that day and all night, and all the morrow day,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.39","gathering the quail,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.40",the least gathered ten <i>homers</i>.
"Torah, Numbers.12.41","They spread them, spread them out, all around the camp."
"Torah, Numbers.12.42",33 The meat was still between their teeth
"Torah, Numbers.12.43","—(the supply) not yet exhausted,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.44","when the anger of Y<small>HWH</small> flared up among the people,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.45",and Y<small>HWH</small> struck down among the people an exceedingly great striking.
"Torah, Numbers.12.46","34 So they called the name of that place Kivrot Ha-Taava/Burial-Places of the Craving,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.47",for there they buried the people who had-the-craving.
"Torah, Numbers.12.48","35 From Kivrot Ha-Taava the people marched to Hatzeirot,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.49",and they remained in Hatzeirot.
"Torah, Numbers.12.50","12:1 Now Miryam spoke, and Aharon, against Moshe"
"Torah, Numbers.12.51","on account of the Cushite wife that he had taken-in-marriage,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.52",for a Cushite wife had he taken.
"Torah, Numbers.12.53",2 They said:
"Torah, Numbers.12.54","Is it only, solely through Moshe that Y<small>HWH</small> speaks?"
"Torah, Numbers.12.55",Is it not also through us that he speaks?
"Torah, Numbers.12.56",And Y<small>HWH</small> heard.
"Torah, Numbers.12.57","3 Now the man Moshe (was) exceedingly humble,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.58",more than any (other) human who is on the face of the earth.
"Torah, Numbers.12.59","4 And Y<small>HWH</small> said suddenly to Moshe, to Aharon and to Miryam:"

"Torah, Numbers.12.61",The three of them went out.
"Torah, Numbers.12.62",5 And Y<small>HWH</small> descended in a column of cloud
"Torah, Numbers.12.63",and stood at the entrance to the Tent;
"Torah, Numbers.12.64",he called out: Aharon and Miryam!
"Torah, Numbers.12.65",and the two of them went out.
"Torah, Numbers.12.66",6 He said:

"Torah, Numbers.12.69","in a vision to him I make-myself-known,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.70",in a dream I speak with him.
"Torah, Numbers.12.71",7 Not so my servant Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.12.72","in all my house, trusted is he;"
"Torah, Numbers.12.73","8 mouth to mouth I speak with him,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.74","in-plain-sight, not in riddles,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.75",and the form of Y<small>HWH</small> (is what) he beholds.
"Torah, Numbers.12.76",So why were you not too awestruck
"Torah, Numbers.12.77","to speak against my servant, against Moshe?"
"Torah, Numbers.12.78","9 The anger of Y<small>HWH</small> flared up against them,"
"Torah, Numbers.12.79",and he went off.

"Torah, Numbers.12.86","do not, pray, impose on us guilt-for-a-sin"
"Torah, Numbers.12.87","by which we were foolish, by which we sinned!"
"Torah, Numbers.12.88",_____________
"Torah, Numbers.12.89","25 <b>acted-like-prophets:</b> The <i>hitpa’el</i> form of Heb. <i>n-b-’</i>, as opposed to the <i>pi’el</i> form, meaning “to prophesy” (speak in God’s name) (Greenberg 1983). “Mantic” or “ecstatic” prophecy was known all over the ancient world. The prophet would go into a trance, or roll about, or shriek (or a combination of these); such behavior was considered inspired by the gods. While the famous prophets of the Bible, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, are largely (but not exclusively) men of the word, who report God’s messages to the people, they retain in their actions some of the characteristics of the enthusiastic kind of prophecy. <b>but did not continue:</b> But the Hebrew consonants could also be read “and did not stop!”"
"Torah, Numbers.12.90",26 <b>Eldad … Meidad:</b> The names are obviously intended to rhyme; they may both indicate something like “beloved of God.”
"Torah, Numbers.12.91",28 <b>Yehoshua:</b> Trad. English “Joshua.”
"Torah, Numbers.12.92",29 <b>who would give:</b> “Would that” or “if only.”
"Torah, Numbers.12.93","31 <b>rush-of-wind:</b> Heb. <i>ruah</i> can mean both “spirit” and “wind,” as is clear from this chapter. Buber wrote extensively on this concept (1994). <b>two cubits:</b> Roughly a yard (or a meter)."
"Torah, Numbers.12.94","32 <b>spread them out:</b> In order to dry them. One ancient version has Heb. <i>sh-h-t</i>, “slew” (them) for <i>sh-t-h</i>, which appears in standard texts. <b><i>homers:</i></b> A <i>homer</i> was a large measure of volume, equal to about thirty gallons in one estimate."
"Torah, Numbers.12.95","12:1 <b>Cushite:</b> Either an Ethiopian, which some interpretive traditions hold to, and which would be clearly a racial slur, or a Midyanite. The first would indicate another wife of Moshe; the second, the Tzippora of Ex. 2."
"Torah, Numbers.12.96","3 <b>humble:</b> And not power-hungry. This description helps to prepare us for the confrontation with Korah in Chap. 16, where the rebels accuse Moshe of lording it over them. <b>earth:</b> Elsewhere rendered “soil.”"
"Torah, Numbers.12.97","6 <b>among-you-a-prophet:</b> The Hebrew is awkward, but solvable as an unusual syntactic form (Freedman 1972)."
"Torah, Numbers.13.1","<i>The Spies in Canaan and Back</i> (13): Here, as at the beginning of the book, we begin with a list—this time, of the men Moshe sends out to reconnoiter the land of Canaan. Order may also be perceived in the phraseology of Moshe’s questions to them (vv.18–20), and the mission goes well (witness the giant grape cluster in v.23). But everything falls apart in the middle of the report (vv.28ff.), and the ending of the chapter, in which the spies compare themselves (and, by extension, all the Israelites) to grasshoppers vis-a-vis the Canaanite natives of the land, is telling. It is a classic case of failure of nerve."
"Torah, Numbers.13.2","Scholars have detected a number of creative hands in this and the next chapter, based on the text’s alternating use of Calev and Calev/Yehoshua as the faithful spies, as well as other factors. The final result is a tug of war between sets of spies, the people, Moshe, and God. True to the new human tone of the narrative, so mundane a form as a reconnaissance mission has been here suffused with emotion, a trend that will continue throughout this part of the book."

"Torah, Numbers.14.1","<i>Rebellion and Evil Decree</i> (14): Another long and dramatic account, this chapter contains echoes of previous narratives. The “grumbling” of Ex. 16 finally returns, and God and Moshe talk to one another in a manner that recalls the Golden Calf incident of Ex. 32–34. God wishes to destroy the people and start all over again with Moshe; the prophet, for his part, reminds God of his essentially merciful nature, and basically blackmails him by pointing out what will happen to his reputation among the nations should he destroy the Israelites. Unlike the resolution in Exodus, this time the people—at least the older generation—are doomed to die out. After two years of both miraculous rescues and despair, it has become clear that the former slaves will not be able to accomplish the work of conquest—even with divine help. That is to be left to their children, whom Moshe will address in Deuteronomy."
"Torah, Numbers.14.2","V.26 begins a section that seems to double the earlier part of the chapter. Perhaps it stems from a separate tradition concerning the incident. It leads to the people’s disastrous attempt to force the issue by invading Canaan without the Coffer and Moshe (hence, without God). Thus the spy story of 13–14, which began in orderly fashion, ends in disarray, with a crushing defeat."
"Torah, Numbers.14.3",30 Calev hushed the people before Moshe
"Torah, Numbers.14.4",and said:
"Torah, Numbers.14.5","Let us go up, yes, up, and possess it,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.6","for we can prevail, yes, prevail against it!"
"Torah, Numbers.14.7",31 But the men who went up with him said:
"Torah, Numbers.14.8","We are not able to go up against the population,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.9",for it is stronger than we!
"Torah, Numbers.14.10",32 So they gave-out a (false) report of the land
"Torah, Numbers.14.11",that they had scouted out
"Torah, Numbers.14.12","to the Children of Israel, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.14.13",The land that we crossed through to scout it out:

"Torah, Numbers.14.15","all the people that we saw in its midst are men of (great) stature,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.16",33 (for) there we saw the giants—the Children of Anak (come) from the giants—
"Torah, Numbers.14.17","we were in our (own) eyes like grasshoppers,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.18",and thus were we in their eyes!
"Torah, Numbers.14.19","14:1 The entire community lifted up and let out their voice,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.20",and the people wept on that night.
"Torah, Numbers.14.21","2 And they grumbled against Moshe and against Aharon, all the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.22","they said to them, the entire community:"

"Torah, Numbers.14.28","4 So they said, each-man to his brother:"
"Torah, Numbers.14.29",Let us head back and return to Egypt!
"Torah, Numbers.14.30",5 Moshe and Aharon flung themselves on their faces
"Torah, Numbers.14.31",before the entire assembled community of the Children of Israel.
"Torah, Numbers.14.32","6 Now Yehoshua son of Nun and Calev son of Yefunne,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.33","(alone) from among those who scouted out the land,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.34",ripped their garments;
"Torah, Numbers.14.35","7 they said to the entire community of the Children of Israel, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.14.36","The land that we crossed through, to scout it out—"

"Torah, Numbers.14.47",do not be afraid of them!
"Torah, Numbers.14.48",10 But the entire community of Israel thought to pelt them with stones.
"Torah, Numbers.14.49",Now the Glory of Y<small>HWH</small> was seen at the Tent of Appointment
"Torah, Numbers.14.50","by all the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.51",11 and Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.14.52",How long will this people scorn me?
"Torah, Numbers.14.53","How long will they not trust in me,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.54",despite all the signs that I have done among them?
"Torah, Numbers.14.55","12 Let me strike it down with pestilence and dispossess it,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.56",and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier (in number) than it!
"Torah, Numbers.14.57",13 But Moshe said to Y<small>HWH</small>:
"Torah, Numbers.14.58","When they hear (about it), the Egyptians,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.59","that you brought up this people with your power from its midst,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.60",14 they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.

"Torah, Numbers.14.64","in a column of cloud going before them by day,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.65",and in a column of fire by night—
"Torah, Numbers.14.66","15 should you put this people to death as one man,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.67","then will say the nations that have heard of your fame, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.14.69","to bring this people into the land about which he swore to them,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.70",and so he slew them in the wilderness!
"Torah, Numbers.14.71","17 So-now,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.72","pray let the power of my Lord (to forbear) be great,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.73","as you have spoken, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.14.80","19 pray grant-pardon for the iniquity of this people, as your loyalty is great,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.81",just as you have been bearing (iniquity) for this people
"Torah, Numbers.14.82",from Egypt until now!
"Torah, Numbers.14.83",20 Y<small>HWH</small> said:
"Torah, Numbers.14.84","I grant-pardon, according to your words;"
"Torah, Numbers.14.85","21 however, as I live,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.86",and as the Glory of Y<small>HWH</small> fills all the earth:

"Torah, Numbers.14.88","that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.89","and have tested me these ten times,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.90",by not hearkening to my voice:

"Torah, Numbers.14.92",about which I swore to their fathers … !
"Torah, Numbers.14.93",All that have scorned me will not see it!

"Torah, Numbers.14.97",and his seed will possess it.
"Torah, Numbers.14.98",25 Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite are settled in the Lowlands;
"Torah, Numbers.14.99","on the morrow, face about and march into the wilderness,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.100",by the Reed Sea Road.
"Torah, Numbers.14.101","26 Now Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe and Aharon, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.14.102","27 Till when for this evil community,"

"Torah, Numbers.14.104","The grumblings of the Children of Israel that they grumble against me,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.105",I have heard!

"Torah, Numbers.14.115","to have you dwell in it,"

"Torah, Numbers.14.117","31 Your little-ones, whom you said would become plunder—"
"Torah, Numbers.14.118","I will let them enter,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.119",they shall come to know the land that you have spurned.
"Torah, Numbers.14.120","32 But your corpses, yours,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.121","shall fall in this wilderness,"

"Torah, Numbers.14.124",until your corpses come-to-an-end in the wilderness.
"Torah, Numbers.14.125","34 According to the number of days that you scouted out the land,"

"Torah, Numbers.14.127","(for each) day a year, (for each) day a year,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.128","you are to bear your iniquities,"

"Torah, Numbers.14.135",there they will die.
"Torah, Numbers.14.136",36 So the men whom Moshe had sent to scout out the land
"Torah, Numbers.14.137",returned and caused the entire community to grumble against him
"Torah, Numbers.14.138",by bringing a (false) report about the land;
"Torah, Numbers.14.139","37 the men died,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.140","those bringing a report of the land, an ill one,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.141","in a plague, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."

"Torah, Numbers.14.145","39 Now when Moshe spoke all these words to the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.14.146","the people mourned, exceedingly."
"Torah, Numbers.14.147",40 They started-early in the morning
"Torah, Numbers.14.148","and went up to the top of the hill-country, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.14.153","5 <b>the entire assembled community</b> etc.: A unique phrase, perhaps indicating an emergency session of the whole people (Magonet)."
"Torah, Numbers.14.154",7–8 Note the fourfold use of “land.”
"Torah, Numbers.14.155",9 <b>protector:</b> Lit. “shade” or “shadow”; the reference is probably to pagan gods.
"Torah, Numbers.14.156","13 <b>hear (about it):</b> That is, about the destruction of Israel by God."
"Torah, Numbers.14.157",14 <b>eye to eye:</b> The equivalent of English “face to face.”
"Torah, Numbers.14.158","17 <b>as you have spoken:</b> Moshe cites the characterization of God in the Golden Calf story, which employs almost identical words (Ex. 34:6–7); he also argues in terms similar to the way he did there (Ex. 32:11ff.)."
"Torah, Numbers.14.159",19 <b>pray grant-pardon</b> etc.: This verse is used in the Jewish liturgy of the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).
"Torah, Numbers.14.160",22 <b>ten times:</b> Equivalent to “many times” in biblical parlance.
"Torah, Numbers.14.161",23 <b>If they should see … :</b> Implied is an ending such as “I will destroy them.”
"Torah, Numbers.14.162","24 <b>another spirit:</b> In this case, courage. <b>followed-me-fully:</b> As Weinfeld (1991) notes, this is semantically equivalent to Avraham’s “being-whole(-hearted)” in Gen. 17:1. Both phrases are used in connection with covenant loyalty."
"Torah, Numbers.14.163","28 <b>if not … :</b> A rhetorical form meaning “I will do the following ….” Similarly, v.30 suggests that “none of you shall enter the land.”"
"Torah, Numbers.14.164",29 <b>counted (for battle) … number:</b> The census-taking at the opening of the book now turns into a census of death.
"Torah, Numbers.14.165",34 <b>hostility:</b> Or “constraining/frustrating (you).”
"Torah, Numbers.15.1","<i>Interlude</i> (15): Chap. 15, which gives respite from the striking rebellion narratives of 11–14, and a breather before the Korah story in 16–17 (although Wenham notes verbal ties to 13–14, and Buber 1988 to 16–18), brings together five rather disparate pieces of material that seem wrenched out of other contexts. We can, however, make some sense of them. Vv.1–16 (on various sacrifices) and 17–21 (about a “contribution” for God) are commanded for the time “when you enter the land of your settling / that I am giving you” or “when you enter the land / that I am bringing you to,” connecting them to the potential entry into Canaan of the two previous chapters and thus providing a setting that is missing in most of Leviticus. Further, vv.1–16 and 22–31, which, like Lev. 4, deal with the unintentional sins of the Israelites, both make pointed reference to the “sojourner,” the resident alien who is to be treated in respect of the laws involved here exactly like a native. The final section, on the tassels (Heb. <i>tzitzit</i>), is interestingly connected to the spy narrative via the term “scout around” in v.39 (Milgrom); “scout” had occurred seven times in the earlier story. “Bear in mind” also recalls the many instances of “reminders” in the Torah—objects such as a portion of manna—that serve as a visual warning or memorial for the Israelites of later generations. This is especially important after the Israelites’ losing heart in Chaps. 13–14. Stylistically, the four sections just mentioned are drawn together by the use of the phrase “throughout your generations” (vv.15, 21, 23, 38)."
"Torah, Numbers.15.2","This leaves the incident of the Sabbath violator in vv.32–36. It has clearly been placed in Numbers because it takes place “in the wilderness” (v.32); it has found its way into this specific chapter perhaps because it is, in its own way, a miniature rebellion story. Since it is so brief, it may well have been felt that it needed to be placed in a chapter already composed of short pieces. Stylistically it might have better appeared at the end of the chapter, but that position has been reserved for the rhetorically more dramatic section on the tassels."

"Torah, Numbers.15.89","44 <b>went up recklessly:</b> Others, “stormed.”"
"Torah, Numbers.15.90","15:3 <b>and sacrifice a fire-offering</b> etc.: In Anderson’s assessment, this part of the chapter returns to the function of Lev. 1–7: a general statement about sacrificial procedure (in this case, the addition of the grain-gift and the poured-offering). <b>a soothing savor:</b> A description attached to many sacrifices; cf. Lev. 1:9."
"Torah, Numbers.15.91",4 <b>bringing-near:</b> A verb used sometimes (especially in Leviticus) with the technical meaning “to offer/sacrifice.”
"Torah, Numbers.15.92","22 <b>err,/not doing:</b> That is, sin unwittingly. <b>these commandments:</b> Some, such as Milgrom, take this to refer to the two previous sections in the chapter; however, the wording, especially in v.23, is quite broad, and may constitute a new “teaching” about observance of the law (although not a law in and of itself) (Toeg, quoted in Fishbane 1988)."
"Torah, Numbers.16.1","<i>The Great Revolt</i> (16): In the two collections of wilderness rebellion traditions we have encountered thus far in the Torah, Ex. 15:22–17:7 and Num. 11–14, the rebels are a faceless “the people” or “the entire community.” An exception was Num. 12, where Aharon and Miryam complained against their brother; their personal example is now taken up by another relative, in a memorable narrative. The story of the revolt of Korah the Levite and Datan and Aviram the Reubenites, which may have stemmed from two different accounts, holds the common thread of the rebels’ feeling left out—Korah, as Moshe’s and Aharon’s first cousin, might well have headed the priestly line (his father was older than theirs), whereas Datan and Aviram’s tribe of Re’uven had lost some of its firstborn primacy, and was not even camped on the choice east side of the Dwelling. Moshe clearly sees the political motivation behind the revolt, and is indignant that anyone would impute greed (cf. v.15) or lust for power to him."
"Torah, Numbers.16.2","As Buber (1988) points out, however, more is at stake here. The rebels’ contention that “the entire community, the entirety of them, are holy,” though it sounds at first blush like the ideal expressed in Ex. 19:6 (God’s offer to make of the Israelites “a kingdom of priests, / a holy nation”), is in reality a most dangerous claim. Holiness in the Bible is a trait that can be acquired, even transmitted to an extent, but it is not absolutely innate, except in the case of God; and the Torah sees as ope of its major goals developing the means whereby people can, with holy intent and preparation, properly serve the Holy. The fate of the rebels therefore bespeaks the seriousness of the threat they pose, and is unique in the Bible."
"Torah, Numbers.16.3","The narrative hinges on a number of expressions. The conflict between Moshe and the rebels is nicely encapsulated by two pairs of identical charges and countercharges—“Too much (is) yours” (vv.3 and 7) and “Is it too little” (vv.9 and 13). The terms “community” and “assembly” are played upon, designating alternately the body of the people and the minicommunity of the rebels. More significantly, this chapter and those around it—15, 17, and 18—are meaningfully linked together by variations on the Hebrew root <i>k-r-b</i> (Buber 1994). The thread of meaning runs from “bringing near-offerings near,” to God “declaring [Moshe and Ahron] near” to him, to the fact that he has “brought-near” the Levites in terms of their duties, to Korah and his band being asked to “bring-near” the incense, whose fire-pans later become holy because they were “brought-near,” and finally, to the repeated warning to outsiders not to “come-near” the sancta. At issue is what Buber calls “authorized” and “unauthorized nearing,” which is mentioned frequently in Leviticus but is used in the present text with the full artistic resources at the narrator’s command. Viewed in this light, order is restored to the blurring of lines threatened by Korah."

"Torah, Numbers.16.148","16:1 <b>there betook-himself:</b> This is a difficult text, since “take” in Hebrew (<i>lakoah</i>) usually requires a direct object.

"Torah, Numbers.17.1","<i>Aftermath</i> (17): The revolt of Korah, with its macabre ending, has made it clear that Levites must not “come-near” the priestly domains, physically or professionally. Accordingly, the incense pans of the dead rebels become plating for the altar, as a warning for the future. The “fire-pan” becomes instrumental immediately thereafter, as Aharon must obtain forgiveness for the people, who understand the deaths of Korah and his followers as a political purge by the two brothers. Aharon’s action, it should be noted, cannot prevent the initial round of deaths by divine plague."
"Torah, Numbers.17.2","Upon hearing the “grumbling” of the Israelites (a word that did not, interestingly, appear in the Korah story), God now deems it necessary to provide another sign: proof that it is the Sons of Aharon that he has chosen (cf. 16:5)—as if the earth opening up were not enough! This is Aharon’s flowering rod, a stick that, though long-severed from its original tree, still manages to produce flowers and fruit. The motif is noted in many other cultures (cf. Gaster 1969 for references); Wagner made use of it to provide the climactic moment in his opera <i>Tannhäuser</i>."

"Torah, Numbers.17.56",(It is) you (who) caused-the-death of Y<small>HWH</small>’s people!
"Torah, Numbers.17.57","7 Now it was, when the community assembled against Moshe and against Aharon,"
"Torah, Numbers.17.58","that they turned toward the Tent of Appointment,"
"Torah, Numbers.17.59","and here: the cloud had covered it,"
"Torah, Numbers.17.60",and the Glory of Y<small>HWH</small> could be seen!
"Torah, Numbers.17.61",8 Then Moshe and Aharon came to the front of the Tent of Appointment.
"Torah, Numbers.17.62","9 And Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.17.63","10 Move-aside from the midst of this community,"
"Torah, Numbers.17.64",that I may finish them off in an instant!
"Torah, Numbers.17.65",They flung themselves upon their faces.
"Torah, Numbers.17.66",11 Moshe said to Aharon:
"Torah, Numbers.17.67",Take (your) pan
"Torah, Numbers.17.68","and place upon it fire from the slaughter-site, putting smoking-incense (there);"
"Torah, Numbers.17.69","go quickly to the community and effect-appeasement for them,"
"Torah, Numbers.17.70","for the fury is (still) going-out from the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.17.71",the plague has begun!
"Torah, Numbers.17.72","12 Aharon took (it), as Moshe had spoken,"
"Torah, Numbers.17.73",and he ran to the midst of the assembly:
"Torah, Numbers.17.74","and here, the plague had begun among the people!"
"Torah, Numbers.17.75","So he put the smoking-incense (in it), and effected-appeasement for the people:"
"Torah, Numbers.17.76","13 He stood between the dead and the living,"
"Torah, Numbers.17.77",and the plague was held-back.
"Torah, Numbers.17.78","14 Now those that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred,"
"Torah, Numbers.17.79",aside from those that died in the matter of Korah.
"Torah, Numbers.17.80","15 Aharon returned to Moshe, to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment,"
"Torah, Numbers.17.81",since the plague was held-back.

"Torah, Numbers.17.91","14 <b>14,700:</b> Another multiple of the “perfect” number seven."
"Torah, Numbers.18.1","<i>Levite Rules (18):</i> In order to more strictly enforce the separate roles of priest and Levite, necessitated by the rebellion of Korah, the text turns to clarification of the Levites’ duties and regulations concerning them. They are to act as a buffer between the sancta and the people, but may not come into contact with the holy-things themselves; the priests, of course, may and must. The priests’ reward—actually, their means of support—consists of firstborn animals and firstffuits; the Levites’, of tithes."
"Torah, Numbers.18.2","The chief refrain in the chapter is variations on “so that they may not die”; this has occurred already in 17:25, thus linking Chaps. 17 and 18 nicely."
"Torah, Numbers.18.3","16 Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.18.9","18 And the name of Aharon you are to write upon the staff of Levi,"
"Torah, Numbers.18.10","indeed, one staff for (each) head of their Fathers’ House."

"Torah, Numbers.18.15",thus will I still from upon me
"Torah, Numbers.18.16",the grumblings of the Children of Israel that they set-grumbling against you (both).
"Torah, Numbers.18.17","21 Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.18.18","and they gave him, all the leaders,"
"Torah, Numbers.18.19","a staff per (each) one leader, a staff per (each) one leader,"

"Torah, Numbers.18.21","twelve staffs,"
"Torah, Numbers.18.22",with the staff of Aharon in the midst of their staffs.
"Torah, Numbers.18.23","22 Moshe laid out the staffs before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.18.24",in the Tent of the Testimony.
"Torah, Numbers.18.25",23 Now it was on the morrow:
"Torah, Numbers.18.26","when Moshe entered the Tent of the Testimony,"
"Torah, Numbers.18.27","here: it had sprouted, the staff of Aharon, of the House of Levi!"
"Torah, Numbers.18.28","It had put-forth a sprouting-flower, it had blossomed a blossom, it had ripened almonds!"
"Torah, Numbers.18.29",24 Moshe brought out all the staffs from before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Numbers.18.30",to all the Children of Israel;
"Torah, Numbers.18.31","they saw (them), and each-man took his staff."
"Torah, Numbers.18.32",25 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.18.33",Return the staff of Aharon before the Testimony
"Torah, Numbers.18.34","to be safeguarded as a sign for the rebellious-folk,"
"Torah, Numbers.18.35","that their grumblings may be finished from me,"
"Torah, Numbers.18.36",so that they do not die!
"Torah, Numbers.18.37","26 Moshe did it,"
"Torah, Numbers.18.38","according to all that Y<small>HWH</small> commanded him, so he did."
"Torah, Numbers.18.39","27 But the Children of Israel said to Moshe, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.18.93",17 <b>staff:</b> A good example of the pun inherent in Heb. <i>matte</i> (cf. note to 4:18).

"Torah, Numbers.19.1","<i>Death and the Red Cow</i> (19): Apparently to close out the Korah story, the text turns to a mysterious and powerful ritual, one designed to remove the contaminating pollution of death. It is important to note that the revolt in Chap. 16 led, not only to the deaths of the rebels and their households, but also to the perishing of 14,700 people in the subsequent plague (17:12–14). So despite the fact that priests and Levites now have their tasks straight, thanks to Chap. 18, there remains the serious matter of purification."
"Torah, Numbers.19.2","Levine notes the typical priestly pattern at work: first the remedy is prescribed, and then the actual circumstances that call for it are enumerated. He also sees the chapter as essentially a protest against the widespread cult of the dead in the ancient Near East, from which the Israelites notably separated themselves."
"Torah, Numbers.19.3","Milgrom has illuminated a number of aspects of the Red Cow ritual, notably by characterizing it as a sort of <i>hattat</i> ceremony. That ritual, it may be recalled, enabled the priests to decontaminate the sanctuary of ritual pollution, chiefly through the sprinkling of blood against the altar. Milgrom points to the unusual nature of the ritual here, in that the purifying agent (in this case, water that has been mixed with the special cow’s ashes, which came partly from burned blood) is sprinkled on persons, not objects."

"Torah, Numbers.19.143",19 <b>“covenant of salt”:</b> Plaut suggests that this means “an eternal covenant”; salt prevents decay.
"Torah, Numbers.19.144",29 <b>choice-parts:</b> Lit. “fat”; English “cream [of the crop]” carries the same connotation.
"Torah, Numbers.19.145","19:2 <b>red:</b> Possibly indicating “brownish,” but the sound “red” is important here as a reminder of blood, a major purifying agent in the Israelite cult (especially in the <i>hattat</i> sacrifice; cf. Lev. 4:5–7) and a neutralizer of death, given its symbolic character as the life. <b>not yet yielded to a yoke:</b> Lit. “no yoke has gone upon it” (Heb. <i>lo ’ala ’aleha ’ol</i>); but the alliteration is a characteristic feature of this text."

"Torah, Numbers.20.1","<i>Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites</i> (20): The first part of this chapter contains a story that has deeply troubled readers for over two millennia. Its length belies its weight; in only thirteen verses, Moshe and Aharon have lost their most cherished dream—the privilege of entering the Promised Land."
"Torah, Numbers.20.2","The brevity here may result from the fact that, for the narrator, this story was a variant of, or constructed from, a similar one in Ex. 17, to explain more fully why the leaders shared the fate of their generation. In other words, their deaths may affect us more than the text meant it to. Nonetheless, the question of why exactly Moshe and Aharon received such a terrible punishment for a moment of indiscretion will not go away. Can it really be that the towering figure of Moshe, liberator and lawgiver, parent and prophet, is to be done away with in the blink of an eye, over a fit of justifiable temper? But it is a public moment, and there the answer may lie. The Bible consistently takes a stringent view of leadership: that leaders must be above reproach, and that they must not lose sight of the fact that it is God whom they represent. A similar impulse led to the strict standards to which the writer of Samuel-Kings, the so-called Deuteronomistic historian, held such revered personalities as David and Solomon."
"Torah, Numbers.20.3","From v.14 to v.21, the text gives us a moment to digest what has just happened, at the same time managing to introduce the major theme of the next several chapters: encountering other peoples and tribes as the Israelites near Canaan. First is Edom, in the territory to the east roughly between Eilat and the Dead Sea. The sequence begins tentatively, not with an Israelite victory, but not with a defeat either: they are forced to reroute their approach."
"Torah, Numbers.20.4","So as to keep the memory of Merivat-Kadesh close, the chapter ends with the death of Aharon, “before the eyes of the entire community” (v.27). For the first time in all the rebellion texts, the word “rebel” itself is used (v.24). On a positive note, leadership is seamlessly passed to the next generation; when Moshe returns from witnessing Aharon’s death, he is accompanied by the latter’s son El’azar, who is tellingly dressed in Aharon’s garments."
"Torah, Numbers.20.5","cut off shall that person be from the midst of the assembly,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.6","for the Holy-Area of Y<small>HWH</small> has he made-<i>tamei</i>,"

"Torah, Numbers.20.31","not a place of seeds and figs, vines and pomegranates"
"Torah, Numbers.20.32",—and water (there is) none to drink!
"Torah, Numbers.20.33",6 Moshe and Aharon came away from the presence of the assembly
"Torah, Numbers.20.34","to the entrance to the Tent of Appointment,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.35",and flung themselves upon their faces.
"Torah, Numbers.20.36","The Glory of Y<small>HWH</small> was seen by them,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.37","7 and Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.20.38",8 Take the staff
"Torah, Numbers.20.39","and assemble the community, you and Aharon your brother;"
"Torah, Numbers.20.40",you are to speak to the boulder before their eyes
"Torah, Numbers.20.41","so that it gives forth its water,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.42","thus you are to bring out for them water from the boulder,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.43",that you may give-drink to the assembly and to their cattle.
"Torah, Numbers.20.44","9 So Moshe took the staff from before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.45",as he had commanded him.
"Torah, Numbers.20.46",10 And Moshe and Aharon assembled the assembly facing the boulder.
"Torah, Numbers.20.47",He said to them:
"Torah, Numbers.20.48","Now hearken, (you) rebels,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.49",from this boulder must we bring you out water?
"Torah, Numbers.20.50",11 And Moshe raised his hand
"Torah, Numbers.20.51","and struck the boulder with his staff, twice,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.52",so that abundant water came out;
"Torah, Numbers.20.53",and the community and their cattle drank.
"Torah, Numbers.20.54",12 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe and to Aharon:
"Torah, Numbers.20.55",Because you did not have-trust in me
"Torah, Numbers.20.56","to treat-me-as-holy before the eyes of the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.57",therefore:
"Torah, Numbers.20.58",you (two) shall not bring this assembly into the land that I am giving them!
"Torah, Numbers.20.59","13 Those were the Waters of Meriva/Quarreling,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.60","where the Children of Israel quarreled with Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.61",and he was hallowed through them.
"Torah, Numbers.20.62",14 Moshe sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom:
"Torah, Numbers.20.63",Thus says your brother Israel:
"Torah, Numbers.20.64",You know (about) all the hardships that have found us:
"Torah, Numbers.20.65",15 that our fathers went down to Egypt
"Torah, Numbers.20.66","and we stayed in Egypt for many years,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.67",and Egypt ill-treated us and our fathers.
"Torah, Numbers.20.68","16 So we cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>, and he hearkened to our voice,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.69",he sent a messenger and brought us out of Egypt.
"Torah, Numbers.20.70","So here we are at Kadesh, (the) town at the edge of your territory."
"Torah, Numbers.20.71","17 Pray let us cross through your land,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.72","we will not cross through field or through orchard,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.73","we will not drink water from wells,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.74","(upon) the King’s Road we will march,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.75","not turning right or left,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.76",until we have crossed through your territory.
"Torah, Numbers.20.77",18 But Edom said to him:
"Torah, Numbers.20.78","You shall not cross through me,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.79",lest with the sword I come out to meet you!
"Torah, Numbers.20.80",19 The Children of Israel said to him:
"Torah, Numbers.20.81",On the byway we will go up;
"Torah, Numbers.20.82","if we drink your water, I and my livestock,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.83",I will give (you) its selling-price—
"Torah, Numbers.20.84",only (let it) not be a matter-of-dispute;
"Torah, Numbers.20.85",on foot let me cross!
"Torah, Numbers.20.86",20 But he said:
"Torah, Numbers.20.87",You shall not cross!
"Torah, Numbers.20.88",And Edom went out to meet him
"Torah, Numbers.20.89",with a heavy (host of) fighting-people and with a strong hand.
"Torah, Numbers.20.90","21 So Edom refused to give (Israel) leave to cross through his territory,"
"Torah, Numbers.20.91",and Israel turned away from him.

"Torah, Numbers.20.93","20:1 <b>Wilderness of Tzyn:</b> In Ex. 17, the parallel story, the location is the “Wilderness of Syn” (v.1). <b>the first New-Moon:</b> Of the final year of wandering."
"Torah, Numbers.20.94","2 <b>assembled against:</b> This verb, which occurs two more times in the narrative (vv.8 and 10), was also used twice in the Korah rebellion (16:3, 19)."

"Torah, Numbers.21.1","<i>First Victory: Rebellion Again; Traveling; Sihon and Og</i> (21): A miscellany of wilderness traditions, Chap. 21 begins with a military victory—perhaps a sign that Israel’s terrible trials are coming to an end. Not insignificantly, the victory comes after the Israelites have properly vowed to allot booty to God (v.2), a far cry from their willful attempt at conquest at the end of Chap. 14. This brief account may in fact be a reworking or different account of the Horma incident in that passage."
"Torah, Numbers.21.2","The strange events surrounding the “viper of copper” that follow provide a reminder, even amid the progress of the march and military successes, of the Israelites’ usual waywardness. As usual, the problem is food; several things, however, make this brief story unusual amid the rebellion narratives. For one, the punishment is unique; for another, the people call upon Moshe to remove the plague—in a manner that is more reminiscent of Pharaoh of Egypt, with the Plagues, than of previous Israelite behavior. Finally, there is the Bible’s record of what happened to the copper object: it was preserved in the cult and worshiped by the people, until it was smashed during the large-scale religious reform under King Hezekiah of Judah (late eighth century <small>B.C.E.</small>). One might note that the divine punishment for sin, once accomplished, clears the way for the Israelite victories that follow immediately."
"Torah, Numbers.21.3","Of additional interest in this chapter is the inclusion of three ancient poems (vv. 14–15, 17–18, and 27–30), whose origins and language are both obscure. Preceded by a brief itinerary of the Israelites’ travels up to Moabite territory, soon to be the scene of the Bil’am narratives (Chaps. 22–24), the chapter ends with two successful clashes against local kings, Sihon and Og. While the accounts here are brief, postbiblical Jewish tradition took delight in spinning fantastic tales about these two kings (cf. Ginzberg)."
"Torah, Numbers.21.4","22 They marched on from Kadesh,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.5","and they came, the Children of Israel, the entire community, to Hill’s Hill."
"Torah, Numbers.21.6","23 Now Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe and to Aharon at Hill’s Hill,"

"Torah, Numbers.21.8",saying:
"Torah, Numbers.21.9","24 Let Aharon be gathered to his kinspeople,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.10",for he is not to enter the land that I am giving to the Children of Israel—
"Torah, Numbers.21.11",since you (both) rebelled against my orders at the Waters of Meriva.
"Torah, Numbers.21.12","25 Take Aharon and El’azar his son,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.13",and bring them up on Hill’s Hill;
"Torah, Numbers.21.14",26 strip Aharon of his garments and clothe in them El’azar his son.
"Torah, Numbers.21.15",Aharon will be gathered and will die there.
"Torah, Numbers.21.16",27 So Moshe did as Y<small>HWH</small> commanded him:
"Torah, Numbers.21.17",they went up Hill’s Hill before the eyes of the entire community;
"Torah, Numbers.21.18",28 Moshe stripped Aharon of his garments and clothed in them El’azar his son.
"Torah, Numbers.21.19",So Aharon died there on top of the hill.
"Torah, Numbers.21.20","When Moshe and El’azar came down from the hill,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.21","29 the entire community saw that Aharon had expired,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.22","and they wept for Aharon thirty days,"

"Torah, Numbers.21.24","21:1 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who sat-as-ruler in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the Atarim Road,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.25",so they waged war against Israel and captured from them war-captives.
"Torah, Numbers.21.26",2 Then Israel vowed a vow to Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Numbers.21.27",and said:
"Torah, Numbers.21.28","If you will give, yes, give this people into my hand,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.29",I will devote their towns (to destruction).
"Torah, Numbers.21.30","3 And Y<small>HWH</small> hearkened to the voice of Israel, he gave (them) the Canaanites,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.31",and they devoted-them-to-destruction along with their cities;
"Torah, Numbers.21.32",so they called the name of the place Horma/Destruction.
"Torah, Numbers.21.33","4 They marched from Hill’s Hill by the Reed Sea Road,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.34","to go-around the land of Edom,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.35",and the people (became) short-tempered on the way.
"Torah, Numbers.21.36",5 The people spoke against God and against Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.21.37",Why did you bring us up from Egypt to die in the wilderness?
"Torah, Numbers.21.38","For there is no food and no water,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.39",and our throats loathe the despicable food!
"Torah, Numbers.21.40","6 So Y<small>HWH</small> sent upon the people vipers, burning-snakes;"
"Torah, Numbers.21.41","they bit the people,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.42",and there died many people of Israel.
"Torah, Numbers.21.43",7 The people came to Moshe
"Torah, Numbers.21.44",and said:
"Torah, Numbers.21.45",We have sinned!
"Torah, Numbers.21.46",For we have spoken against Y<small>HWH</small> and against you.
"Torah, Numbers.21.47","Intercede to God, so that he may remove from us the vipers!"
"Torah, Numbers.21.48",So Moshe interceded on behalf of the people.
"Torah, Numbers.21.49",8 And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.21.50",Make yourself a burning-snake and put it on a banner-pole;
"Torah, Numbers.21.51",it shall be:
"Torah, Numbers.21.52","whoever has been bitten and then sees it, will live."
"Torah, Numbers.21.53","9 So Moshe made a viper of copper, and he put it on a banner-pole,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.54",and it was:
"Torah, Numbers.21.55",if a viper bit a man
"Torah, Numbers.21.56","and he looked upon the viper of copper, he would live."
"Torah, Numbers.21.57",10 The Children of Israel marched on and encamped at Ovot.
"Torah, Numbers.21.58","11 They marched on from Ovot and encamped at Iyyei Ha-Avarim,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.59",in the wilderness that faces Moav;
"Torah, Numbers.21.60",toward the rising of the sun.
"Torah, Numbers.21.61",12 From there they marched on and encamped at Wadi Zered.
"Torah, Numbers.21.62",13 From there they marched on and encamped across the Arnon
"Torah, Numbers.21.63","that is in the wilderness,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.64",that goes out of the Amorite territory;
"Torah, Numbers.21.65",for the Arnon is the border of Moav
"Torah, Numbers.21.66",between Moav and the Amorites.
"Torah, Numbers.21.67",14 Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Y<small>HWH</small>:
"Torah, Numbers.21.68","… Vahev in Sufa,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.69","the wadis, Arnon,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.70","15 along with its canyon wadis,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.71","that stretch along the settled-country of Ar,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.72",leaning on the territory of Moav.
"Torah, Numbers.21.73",16 From there to Be’er/The Well;
"Torah, Numbers.21.74",that is the well of which Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.21.75","Gather the people, and I will give them water."
"Torah, Numbers.21.76",17 Then Israel sang this song:
"Torah, Numbers.21.77","Spring up, O well, sing-in-chorus to it;"
"Torah, Numbers.21.78",18 —the well that was dug out by princes!
"Torah, Numbers.21.79",—that was excavated by people’s nobles!
"Torah, Numbers.21.80",—with scepter!
"Torah, Numbers.21.81",—with their rods!

"Torah, Numbers.21.84",and from Nahliel—to Bamot/The Heights;
"Torah, Numbers.21.85","20 and from Bamot—to the valley that is at the Open-Country of Moav,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.86","the top of Pisga/the Summit,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.87",overlooking the face of the wasteland.
"Torah, Numbers.21.88","21 Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.21.91",in the vineyards we will not drink well water;

"Torah, Numbers.21.98",24 But Israel struck him with the edge of the sword
"Torah, Numbers.21.99","and took-possession of his land,"
"Torah, Numbers.21.100","from the Arnon as far as the Yabbok, as far as the Children of Ammon;"
"Torah, Numbers.21.101",for strong is the territory of the Children of Ammon.
"Torah, Numbers.21.102",25 Israel took all these towns
"Torah, Numbers.21.103",and Israel settled in all the Amorite towns—
"Torah, Numbers.21.104",in Heshbon and in all her daughter-villages;
"Torah, Numbers.21.105",26 for Heshbon—it was the town of Sihon king of the Amorites.
"Torah, Numbers.21.106",He had made-war on a former king of Moav
"Torah, Numbers.21.107","and had taken all his land from his hand, as far as the Arnon."
"Torah, Numbers.21.108",27 Therefore the parable-makers say:

"Torah, Numbers.21.110","be established, Sihon’s town!"
"Torah, Numbers.21.111","28 For fire went forth from Heshbon,"

"Torah, Numbers.21.127",dispossessing the Amorites who were there.
"Torah, Numbers.21.128",33 Then they faced-about and went up the Bashan Road.

"Torah, Numbers.22.1","<i>The Hiring of Bil’am</i> (22): Faced with overwhelming evidence of Israelite superiority, especially as evinced in the previous chapter, the Moabite king Balak tries to vanquish the invaders via a means more powerful than force of arms: a sorcerer’s curse. The first part of the story is memorable in its vivid characterization, use of theme words, and comic thrust. The central personalities have suggestive names: Balak sounds like a verb that means “to destroy,” Bil’am suggests “swallower” (hence destroyer), and Be’or, present only as the name of the sorcerer’s father, also connotes “destroying.” The text uses two different words for “curse,” soon to be joined by a third. The chapter introduces key themes of the story: “honor,” which Bil’am will refuse in the overwhelming face of God’s truth; “once again,” through which it becomes clear that, for God, “once [refusal of permission for Bil’am to go] is once-and-for-all,” and God’s blessing, once given, will not be rescinded (Rosenzweig 1994); and the emphatic refrain that, as noted above, in one form or another will echo throughout the story, “whatever God tells me, that (alone) must I speak/do.” Most memorable, of course, is the sequence about the talking donkey, which must have been more than a little amusing to ancient audiences. For here we have a dumb animal who sees divine messengers and possesses the divine gift of speech, contrasting with a prophet—who in Israelite thinking was supposed to be distinguished by his abilities as “seer” and mouthpiece of God—who sees nothing and raises his voice only to complain."
"Torah, Numbers.22.2",22:2 Now Balak son of Tzippor saw
"Torah, Numbers.22.3","all that Israel had done to the Amorites,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.4","3 and Moav was in exceeding fear before the people, since they were so many;"
"Torah, Numbers.22.5",they felt dread before the Children of Israel.
"Torah, Numbers.22.6",4 Moav said to the elders of Midyan:
"Torah, Numbers.22.7","Look now, this assembly will lick up everything around us like an ox licks up the green-things of the field!"
"Torah, Numbers.22.8",Now Balak son of Tzippor was king of Moav at that time.
"Torah, Numbers.22.9","5 He sent messengers to Bil’am son of Be’or, to Petor, which is beside the River (in) the land of the sons of his kinspeople,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.10","to call him, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.22.11","Here, a people has come up out of Egypt,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.12","here, it covers the aspect of the land,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.13",it has settled hard upon me!
"Torah, Numbers.22.14","6 So-now, pray go, damn this people for me,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.15",for it is too mighty (in number) for me!
"Torah, Numbers.22.16","Perhaps I will prevail: we will strike it, so that I drive it from the land."
"Torah, Numbers.22.17",For I know
"Torah, Numbers.22.18","that whomever you bless is blessed,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.19",whomever you damn is damned!
"Torah, Numbers.22.20","7 The elders of Moav and the elders of Midyan went,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.21","tokens-of-augury in their hand,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.22",they came to Bil’am and spoke Balak’s words to him.
"Torah, Numbers.22.23",8 He said to them:
"Torah, Numbers.22.24","Spend the night here tonight,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.25",then I will bring back to you whatever word Y<small>HWH</small> speaks to me.
"Torah, Numbers.22.26",The nobles of Moav stayed with Bil’am.
"Torah, Numbers.22.27",9 And God came to Bil’am and said:
"Torah, Numbers.22.28",Who are these men with you?
"Torah, Numbers.22.29",10 Bil’am said to God:
"Torah, Numbers.22.30","Balak son of Tzippor, king of Moav, has sent to me:"

"Torah, Numbers.22.35","You are not to go with them,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.36","you are not to damn the people,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.37",for it is blessed!
"Torah, Numbers.22.38",13 Bil’am arose at daybreak and said to Balak’s nobles:
"Torah, Numbers.22.39","Go to your land,"

"Torah, Numbers.22.41","14 The nobles from Moav arose, they came to Balak and said:"
"Torah, Numbers.22.42",Bil’am refuses to go with us!
"Torah, Numbers.22.43","15 So Balak once again sent nobles,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.44",greater and more honored than those;
"Torah, Numbers.22.45",16 they came to Bil’am
"Torah, Numbers.22.46",and said to him:
"Torah, Numbers.22.47",Thus says Balak son of Tzippor:
"Torah, Numbers.22.48",Pray do not hold back from going to me;
"Torah, Numbers.22.49","17 indeed, I will honor, yes, honor you exceedingly—"
"Torah, Numbers.22.50","anything that you say to me, I will do."
"Torah, Numbers.22.51","Only: pray go, revile for me this people!"
"Torah, Numbers.22.52","18 Bil’am answered,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.53",he said to the servants of Balak:
"Torah, Numbers.22.54",If Balak were to give me his house’s fill of silver and gold
"Torah, Numbers.22.55",I would not be able to cross the order of Y<small>HWH</small> my God
"Torah, Numbers.22.56",to do (anything) small or great!
"Torah, Numbers.22.57","19 So now,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.58","pray stay here, you as well, tonight,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.59",that I may know
"Torah, Numbers.22.60",what Y<small>HWH</small> will once again speak with me.
"Torah, Numbers.22.61","20 And God came to Bil’am at night,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.62",he said to him:
"Torah, Numbers.22.63","Since it is to call you that the men have come,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.64","arise, go with them;"
"Torah, Numbers.22.65","but—only the word that I speak to you,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.66",that (alone) may you do.
"Torah, Numbers.22.67","21 Bil’am arose at daybreak,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.68","he saddled his she-ass,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.69",and went with the nobles of Moav.
"Torah, Numbers.22.70","22 But Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up because he was going,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.71","so Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger stationed himself in the way as an adversary to him,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.72","while he was riding on his she-ass, his two serving-lads with him."
"Torah, Numbers.22.73",23 And the she-ass saw Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger
"Torah, Numbers.22.74","stationed in the way,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.75","his sword drawn in his hand,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.76",so the she-ass turned aside from the way and went into the field.
"Torah, Numbers.22.77",And Bil’am struck the she-ass
"Torah, Numbers.22.78",to turn her back onto the way.
"Torah, Numbers.22.79","24 But Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger stood in the furrow (between) the vineyards,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.80",a fence here and a fence there.
"Torah, Numbers.22.81","25 And the she-ass saw Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.82","so she pressed herself against the wall,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.83",pressing Bil’am’s foot against the wall;
"Torah, Numbers.22.84",and once again he struck her.
"Torah, Numbers.22.85","26 But Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger once again crossed over,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.86",standing in a narrow place
"Torah, Numbers.22.87","where there was no pathway to turn, right or left."
"Torah, Numbers.22.88","27 And the she-ass saw Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.89",so she crouched down beneath Bil’am.
"Torah, Numbers.22.90",And Bil’am’s anger flared up;
"Torah, Numbers.22.91",he struck the she-ass with his staff.
"Torah, Numbers.22.92",28 Then Y<small>HWH</small> opened the mouth of the she-ass
"Torah, Numbers.22.93",and she said to Bil’am:
"Torah, Numbers.22.94",What have I done to you
"Torah, Numbers.22.95",that you have struck me (on) these three occasions?
"Torah, Numbers.22.96",29 Bil’am said:
"Torah, Numbers.22.97",Because you have been capricious with me!
"Torah, Numbers.22.98","If a sword had been in my hand,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.99",by now I would have killed you!
"Torah, Numbers.22.100",30 The she-ass said to Bil’am:
"Torah, Numbers.22.101",Am I not your she-ass
"Torah, Numbers.22.102",upon whom you have ridden from your past until this day?
"Torah, Numbers.22.103","Have I ever been accustomed, accustomed to do thus to you?"
"Torah, Numbers.22.104",He said:
"Torah, Numbers.22.105",No.
"Torah, Numbers.22.106",31 Then Y<small>HWH</small> uncovered Bil’am’s eyes
"Torah, Numbers.22.107","and he saw Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger stationed in the way,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.108",his sword drawn in his hand;
"Torah, Numbers.22.109","he bowed and prostrated himself, to his brow."
"Torah, Numbers.22.110",32 Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger said to him:
"Torah, Numbers.22.111",For what (cause) did you strike your she-ass (on) these three occasions?
"Torah, Numbers.22.112","Here, I came out as an adversary,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.113",for the way was rushed out against me.
"Torah, Numbers.22.114","33 Now the she-ass saw me,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.115",so she turned aside before me (on) these three occasions.
"Torah, Numbers.22.116","Had she not turned aside from me,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.117","by now, (it is) you I would have killed;"
"Torah, Numbers.22.118",but her I would have left-alive!
"Torah, Numbers.22.119",34 Bil’am said to Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger:
"Torah, Numbers.22.120","I have sinned,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.121",for I did not know that you were stationed to meet me in the way.
"Torah, Numbers.22.122","But now, if it is ill in your eyes,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.123",I will head back.
"Torah, Numbers.22.124",35 Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger said to Bil’am:
"Torah, Numbers.22.125","Go with the men,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.126","but only the word that I speak to you,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.127",that (alone) may you speak.
"Torah, Numbers.22.128",And so Bil’am went with Balak’s nobles.
"Torah, Numbers.22.129","36 When Balak heard that Bil’am was coming,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.130","he went out to meet him,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.131","to Ir/Town of Moav that is by the Arnon border,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.132",that is at the far-edge of the border.
"Torah, Numbers.22.133",37 And Balak said to Bil’am:
"Torah, Numbers.22.134","Did I not send, yes, send to you, to call you!"
"Torah, Numbers.22.135",Why did you not go to me?
"Torah, Numbers.22.136",Am I truly not able to honor you?
"Torah, Numbers.22.137",38 Bil’am said to Balak:
"Torah, Numbers.22.138","Here, I have come to you;"
"Torah, Numbers.22.139","but now,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.140","am I able, able to speak anything (myself)?"
"Torah, Numbers.22.141","The word that God puts in my mouth,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.142",that (alone) may I speak.
"Torah, Numbers.22.143",39 Bil’am went with Balak;
"Torah, Numbers.22.144",they came to the village of Hutzot/Streets.
"Torah, Numbers.22.145","40 And Balak slaughtered oxen and sheep,"
"Torah, Numbers.22.146",and sent them out to Bil’am and to the nobles that were with him.

"Torah, Numbers.23.1","<i>Bil’am’s First Visions</i> (23): Having been granted permission to hire himself out to Balak, but with the caveat that he may speak only God’s word, Bil’am prepares to curse Israel. But his “encounters” with God leave not the slightest doubt of the outcome; curse is turned to blessing, despite all the correct ritual preparations and previous promises of payment for services rendered. One almost has the impression of a seance gone wrong. And, professionally speaking, hired prophets are supposed to tell kings what they want to hear."
"Torah, Numbers.23.2","The poetry in this chapter is powerful and striking. We move from the hopeful king’s lofty “mountains of Kedem,” whence Bil’am was hired, to the disturbing image of the king of beasts feasting on his prey. What began as an attack from above has ended in a blood-feast by the enemy."
"Torah, Numbers.23.3",41 Now it was at daybreak:
"Torah, Numbers.23.4","Balak took Bil’am and had him go up on the Heights of Baal,"
"Torah, Numbers.23.5",so that he could see from there the edge of the people.
"Torah, Numbers.23.6",23:1 Bil’am said to Balak:
"Torah, Numbers.23.7","Build me here seven slaughter-sites,"
"Torah, Numbers.23.8",and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.
"Torah, Numbers.23.9",2 Balak did as Bil’am had spoken to him;
"Torah, Numbers.23.10",then Bil’am and Balak offered up a bull and a ram on (each) slaughter-site.
"Torah, Numbers.23.11",3 Bil’am said to Balak:
"Torah, Numbers.23.12","Station yourself beside your offering-up, and I will go:"
"Torah, Numbers.23.13","perhaps Y<small>HWH</small> will encounter me in an encounter,"
"Torah, Numbers.23.14","the word of whatever he lets me see, I will report to you."
"Torah, Numbers.23.15",So he went off by-himself.
"Torah, Numbers.23.16","4 And God did encounter Bil’am,"
"Torah, Numbers.23.17",he said to him:
"Torah, Numbers.23.18","The seven slaughter-sites I have arranged,"
"Torah, Numbers.23.19",and I have offered-up a bull and a ram on (each) slaughter-site.
"Torah, Numbers.23.20",5 Y<small>HWH</small> put words in Bil’am’s mouth
"Torah, Numbers.23.21",and said:
"Torah, Numbers.23.22","Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak."
"Torah, Numbers.23.23","6 So he returned to him,"
"Torah, Numbers.23.24","and here: he was standing alongside his offering-up,"
"Torah, Numbers.23.25",he and all the nobles of Moav.
"Torah, Numbers.23.26",7 He took up his discourse and said:

"Torah, Numbers.23.41","May I die the death of the upright,"
"Torah, Numbers.23.42",may my future be like his!
"Torah, Numbers.23.43",11 Balak said to Bil’am:

"Torah, Numbers.23.49",that (alone) I must take-care to speak?
"Torah, Numbers.23.50",13 Balak said to him:
"Torah, Numbers.23.51",Pray go with me to another place from where you can see them:
"Torah, Numbers.23.52","only their edge will you see,"
"Torah, Numbers.23.53",all of them you will not see
"Torah, Numbers.23.54",—revile them for me from there!
"Torah, Numbers.23.55","14 So he took him to the Field of Watchmen, to the top of the summit."
"Torah, Numbers.23.56",He built seven slaughter-sites
"Torah, Numbers.23.57",and offered-up a bull and a ram on (each) slaughter-site.
"Torah, Numbers.23.58",15 Then he said to Balak:
"Torah, Numbers.23.59","Stand here, alongside your offering-up;"
"Torah, Numbers.23.60","as for me, I will seek-an-encounter there."
"Torah, Numbers.23.61",16 Y<small>HWH</small> let himself be encountered by Bil’am
"Torah, Numbers.23.62","and put words in his mouth,"
"Torah, Numbers.23.63",he said:
"Torah, Numbers.23.64","Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak."
"Torah, Numbers.23.65",17 He came to him:
"Torah, Numbers.23.66","here, he was standing alongside his offering-up,"
"Torah, Numbers.23.67",the nobles of Moav with him.
"Torah, Numbers.23.68",Balak said to him:
"Torah, Numbers.23.69",What did Y<small>HWH</small> speak?
"Torah, Numbers.23.70",18 He took up his discourse and said:

"Torah, Numbers.23.92","41 <b>Heights of Baal:</b> Perhaps a shrine, and thus an appropriate location for pronouncing the curse. <b>see … the edge:</b> As Milgrom notes, the one who curses must be able to see his victim in order for the curse to work."
"Torah, Numbers.23.93",23:1 <b>seven:</b> The use of the perfect number means that the curse should be effective.
"Torah, Numbers.23.94","3 <b>perhaps … encounter:</b> Note the chance aspect of Bil’am’s contact with God. <b>by-himself:</b> Heb. <i>shefi</i>, whose meaning is not clear; others, “to the height.”"
"Torah, Numbers.23.95",5 <b>words:</b> Lit. “a [divine] word.”
"Torah, Numbers.23.96","10 <b>dust-clouds:</b> Heb. difficult, possibly meaning “(even) a fourth of.”"
"Torah, Numbers.23.97","13 <b>to another place:</b> Perhaps a different approach, literally, will be successful. Such change of venue also occurs in the nonbiblical Deir ‘Alla traditions about Bil’am (Moore)."
"Torah, Numbers.23.98","14 <b>Watchmen:</b> Gaster (1969), on the basis of Semitic parallels, suggests that Heb. <i>tzofim</i> here means “astrological observers.”"
"Torah, Numbers.23.99",19 <b>retract:</b> Or “change his mind.”
"Torah, Numbers.23.100",21 <b>fanfare:</b> A word used to describe the “trilling” of the marching trumpets in Chap. 10.
"Torah, Numbers.23.101",22 <b>the horns of the wild-ox:</b> Greenstein suggests a parallel with Baal’s horned helmet in Ugaritic texts (personal communication).
"Torah, Numbers.23.102","23 <b>at once:</b> Buber (1988) understands this as “in time,” that is, in the real world, not through magic. <b>what God intends:</b> The King James Version reads “what hath God wrought”—in that form, the first message Samuel F. B. Morse sent by his new invention, the telegraph, in 1844."
"Torah, Numbers.24.1","<i>Bil’am the Prophet</i> (24): Few moments in the Torah, to my thinking, can compare with what now happens in this story. The description of Bil’am’s transformation in the opening verses is matched and even surpassed by what happens to the poetry of this section. From v.3 on, we are treated to an elevation and intensification of poetic language, beginning with the rhythmic opening lines and continuing through the pregnant Middle Eastern imagery of trees and water."
"Torah, Numbers.24.2","With the suggestion of the blessing given to Avraham in v.9, and with Bil’am’s vision of the future political triumphs of Israel vis-à-vis the surrounding nations, all that Balak can do is to “go on his way” (v.25). The king who is used to paying for what he wants, and to having enemies cursed, has no recourse left to him."
"Torah, Numbers.24.3","it does not lie down till it eats (its) prey,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.4",and the blood of the slain it drinks.
"Torah, Numbers.24.5",25 Balak said to Bil’am:
"Torah, Numbers.24.6","If you just cannot revile, revile them,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.7","just do not bless, bless them!"
"Torah, Numbers.24.8",26 Bil’am spoke up and said to Balak:
"Torah, Numbers.24.9","Did I not speak to you (before), saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.24.10",All that God speaks—
"Torah, Numbers.24.11",that (alone) may I do?!
"Torah, Numbers.24.12",27 Balak said to Bil’am:
"Torah, Numbers.24.13","Pray go, I will take you to another place;"
"Torah, Numbers.24.14",perhaps it will be right in God’s eyes that you will revile them for me from there.
"Torah, Numbers.24.15",28 So Balak took Bil’am to the top of Pe’or that overlooks the wasteland.
"Torah, Numbers.24.16",29 Bil’am said to Balak:
"Torah, Numbers.24.17",Build me here seven slaughter-sites
"Torah, Numbers.24.18",and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.
"Torah, Numbers.24.19",30 So Balak did as Bil’am had said;
"Torah, Numbers.24.20",and he offered-up a bull and a ram on (each) slaughter-site.
"Torah, Numbers.24.21",24:1 Now Bil’am saw
"Torah, Numbers.24.22","that it was good in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small> to bless Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.23",and so he did not go forth as time and time (before) to encounter divination-meetings;
"Torah, Numbers.24.24",but he set his face toward the wilderness.
"Torah, Numbers.24.25",2 And Bil’am lifted up his eyes
"Torah, Numbers.24.26","and saw Israel, dwelling by their tribes,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.27",and there came upon him the spirit of God.
"Torah, Numbers.24.28",3 He took up his discourse and said:
"Torah, Numbers.24.29","Utters Bil’am the son of Be’or,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.30","utters the man of the open eye,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.31",4 utters the hearer of Godly sayings
"Torah, Numbers.24.32","who envisages a vision of Shaddai,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.33","bowed, but with eyes uncovered:"
"Torah, Numbers.24.34","5 How goodly are your tents, O Yaakov,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.35","your dwellings, O Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.36","6 like groves stretched out,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.37","like gardens beside a river,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.38","like aloes planted by Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.39",like cedars beside the water;
"Torah, Numbers.24.40","7 dripping water from their boughs,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.41",their seed in many waters!
"Torah, Numbers.24.42","Their king will rise above Agag,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.43",their kingdom be exalted.
"Torah, Numbers.24.44",8 The God who brought them out of Egypt
"Torah, Numbers.24.45",like the horns of the wild-ox for him!
"Torah, Numbers.24.46","They will consume enemy nations,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.47",their bones they will crush;
"Torah, Numbers.24.48",their arrows they will smash!
"Torah, Numbers.24.49","9 They crouch, they lie down like a lion,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.50",like the king-of-beasts—who will (dare) rouse him?
"Torah, Numbers.24.51","Those who bless you—blessed,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.52",those who damn you—damned!
"Torah, Numbers.24.53","10 Balak’s anger flared up at Bil’am,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.54",he smacked his hands (together).
"Torah, Numbers.24.55",Balak said to Bil’am:
"Torah, Numbers.24.56","To revile my enemies I had you called,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.57","and here: you have blessed, yes, blessed them,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.58",these three times!
"Torah, Numbers.24.59","11 So now, hasten back to your (own) place!"
"Torah, Numbers.24.60","I had said: I will honor, yes, honor you;"
"Torah, Numbers.24.61",but here: Y<small>HWH</small> has denied you honor!
"Torah, Numbers.24.62",12 Bil’am said to Balak:
"Torah, Numbers.24.63","Didn’t I speak also to the messengers that you sent to me, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.24.64","13 If Balak were to give me his house’s fill of silver and gold,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.65","I would not be able to cross the order of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.66",to do good or ill from my (own) heart?
"Torah, Numbers.24.67","What Y<small>HWH</small> speaks,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.68",that (alone) may I speak!
"Torah, Numbers.24.69","14 So-now,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.70","here, I am going (back) to my people;"
"Torah, Numbers.24.71","come, I will advise you"
"Torah, Numbers.24.72",as to what this people will do to your people in future days.
"Torah, Numbers.24.73",15 So he took up his discourse and said:
"Torah, Numbers.24.74","Utters Bil’am the son of Be’or,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.75","utters the man of open eye,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.76","16 utters the hearer of Godly sayings,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.77","who knows the knowledge of the Most-High,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.78","envisaging a vision of Shaddai,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.79","bowed, but with eyes uncovered:"
"Torah, Numbers.24.80","17 I see it, but not now,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.81","I behold it, but not soon:"
"Torah, Numbers.24.82","There goes forth a star from Yaakov,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.83","there arises a meteor from Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.84","it smashes the pate of Moav,"
"Torah, Numbers.24.85",the crown of all the Children of Shet.
"Torah, Numbers.24.86",_____________
"Torah, Numbers.24.87","24:1 <b>saw:</b> Finally, he “sees” clearly and knows that he cannot expect to curse the people. Cf. also vv.2–4 for the theme of seeing."
"Torah, Numbers.24.88","2 <b>by their tribes:</b> That is, the entire camp. <b>spirit of God:</b> Thus we know that what follows is truly from God."
"Torah, Numbers.24.89","4 <b>Shaddai:</b> A name for God (or gods) found mainly in Genesis and Job. <b>bowed:</b> With the sense of “prostrate, humbled.”"

"Torah, Numbers.24.91",9 <b>bless … blessed … damn … damned:</b> Bil’am ends his inspired speech with a blessing close to God’s opening one to Avraham in Gen. 12:3.
"Torah, Numbers.24.92",10 <b>smacked his hands (together):</b> A gesture of contempt or mocking in the Bible.
"Torah, Numbers.24.93",11 <b>honor:</b> Balak is referring to the bestowing of wealth.
"Torah, Numbers.24.94","13 <b>heart:</b> Or, in more modern parlance, “mind.”"
"Torah, Numbers.24.95","16 <b>the Most-High:</b> Another name for God, found in Gen. 14:18–20."
"Torah, Numbers.24.96","17 <b>star … meteor:</b> The verse is difficult. It could also be rendered “There marches forth an army … there arises a tribe,” which likewise makes sense in the context. Rabbinic interpreters took the verse messianically; Rabbi Akiva understood “star,” <i>kokhav</i>, as a reference to his contemporary Simon Bar Kosiba, the leader of a major Jewish rebellion against Rome (132 <small>C.E.</small>), renaming him Bar Kokhba, “Son of a Star.” <b>pate … crown:</b> “Crown” (reading <i>kodkod</i> for <i>karkar</i>) in the sense of “head.” An alternate translation is “borderland … land.”"
"Torah, Numbers.25.1","<i>Final Rebellion: Apostasy</i> (25): A tale ostensibly meant to establish the permanent status of the Aaronide priesthood, this chapter has another important structural function. As the last section of Part II (at least as I have laid out the book’s structure), it prevents the wilderness traditions from ending on an up note. The Bil’am cycle with its exalted poetry would have made a positive conclusion, but the editor does not wish us to forget the basic facts of Israel’s wilderness experience: dissatisfaction, complaint, and rebellion. Here we end with the ultimate rebellion, the moment of serious unfaithfulness in the “marriage” between God and Israel."
"Torah, Numbers.25.2","Like his grandfather Aharon in Chap. 17, Pin’has is able to stay the plague from God, albeit not through peaceful means. His action here recalls the killing spree of the Levites at the Golden Calf incident, another major apostasy (Wenham). The text goes out of its way to name also specific offenders; the Moabite woman who is remembered for evil is, in fact, the daughter of a chieftain."
"Torah, Numbers.25.3","The horrifying details of Pin’has’s act remind the reader once again that, for the biblical writers, idolatry was the worst of all crimes. The books to follow, starting with Deuteronomy, will make this abundantly clear."
"Torah, Numbers.25.4","18 Edom becomes a possession,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.5","a possession becomes Se’ir of its enemies,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.6",but Israel does valiantly.
"Torah, Numbers.25.7","19 There rules (one) from Yaakov,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.8",destroying the remnant of Ir.
"Torah, Numbers.25.9","20 He saw Amalek,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.10",and he took up his discourse and said:
"Torah, Numbers.25.11","Premier of nations, Amalek,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.12",but its future: near to oblivion!
"Torah, Numbers.25.13","21 He saw the Kenites,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.14","and he took up his discourse, and said:"
"Torah, Numbers.25.15","Secure (is) your settlement,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.16","set in the clefts (is) your nest,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.17","22 but ablaze will be Kayin,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.18",when Ashur takes-you-captive.
"Torah, Numbers.25.19",23 And he took up his discourse and said:

"Torah, Numbers.25.21","24 Ships (come) from Kittite shore,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.22","they afflict Ashur, they afflict Ever,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.23",but they too: near to oblivion!
"Torah, Numbers.25.24","25 Then Bil’am arose and went, returning to his place;"
"Torah, Numbers.25.25",and also Balak went on his way.
"Torah, Numbers.25.26","25:1 Israel stayed in Shittim/Acacias,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.27",and the people began to whore with the women of Moav.
"Torah, Numbers.25.28",2 They called the people for slaughter-offerings to their gods;
"Torah, Numbers.25.29",the people ate
"Torah, Numbers.25.30",and prostrated themselves to their gods.
"Torah, Numbers.25.31","3 And Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Pe’or,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.32",so the anger of Y<small>HWH</small> flared up against Israel;
"Torah, Numbers.25.33",4 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.25.34","Take all the heads of the people and impale them to Y<small>HWH</small>, facing the sun,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.35",so that the flaming anger of Y<small>HWH</small> may turn from Israel.
"Torah, Numbers.25.36",5 Moshe said to the officials of Israel:
"Torah, Numbers.25.37",Let each-man kill (those of) his men who yoked themselves to the Baal of Pe’or!
"Torah, Numbers.25.38","6 Now here, a man of the Children of Israel had come"
"Torah, Numbers.25.39","and had brought-near to his brothers a (certain) Midyanitess,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.40",before the eyes of Moshe and before the eyes of the entire community of the Children of Israel
"Torah, Numbers.25.41",while they were (all) weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.
"Torah, Numbers.25.42","7 When Pin’has son of El’azar son of Aharon the priest saw (it),"
"Torah, Numbers.25.43","he arose from the midst of the community,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.44",taking a spear in his hand;
"Torah, Numbers.25.45","8 he came after the man of Israel into the private-chamber,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.46","and he thrust through the two of them,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.47","the man of Israel and the woman, in her private-parts,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.48",and the plague was held-back from the Children of Israel.
"Torah, Numbers.25.49",9 And those that died of the plague were four and twenty thousand.
"Torah, Numbers.25.50","10 Now Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.25.51",11 Pin’has son of El’azar son of Aharon the priest
"Torah, Numbers.25.52",has turned my venomous-anger from the Children of Israel
"Torah, Numbers.25.53","in his being-zealous with my zeal in their midst,"
"Torah, Numbers.25.54",so that I did not finish off the Children of Israel in my jealousy.
"Torah, Numbers.25.55",12 Therefore say:

These children of slaves are now mustered, in the same tribal order as the census in Chap. 1. The purpose of the counting is set forth in vv.52–56: so that the Promised Land may be properly divided up, according to population. True to the scheme of Chap. 1, the Levites go through their own census (vv.57–62)—since they receive designated towns but not a large mass of land. The ending verses assure us that the census in this chapter does not include anyone of the Exodus generation, excluding Calev and Yehoshua. Thus we are on new ground."

"Torah, Numbers.27.1","<i>A Case of Inheritance: Daughters of Tzelofhad I; The Passing of Leadership</i> (27): If the land is to be apportioned by tribe, the question of inheritance becomes a major one for the future. In that vein, the text, in almost Talmudic fashion, brings a case with some difficulties: What if a father dies without sons but does leave daughters—may they inherit the ancestral land, given the context of a patriarchal society? Moshe is unable to solve the problem, but must leave it up to God, who rules that not only daughters but other relations as well may serve to keep the land in the family (an attendant question, how to keep land within a tribe’s territory, will be answered in Chap. 36). This section of the chapter is a good example of a law embedded in a narrative, or a narrative created for the sake of a law. It also has the effect of showing that the divine promise of land is about to be fulfilled, that all tribes must be included in the process, and that the growing biblical tradition allows for reinterpretation (Olson)."
"Torah, Numbers.27.2","From v.12 on, we are reminded that Moshe is about to die. In an expansive speech (vv.18–21), God designates Yehoshua as Moshe’s successor, and publicly the aging leader transfers authority to him. Given the structure of Part III of the book, which is bracketed by daughters of Tzelofhad sections, we might expect Moshe’s death to parallel the passage here, and thus come at the end of Chap. 36. But that will not be the case; his death is left for the end of the entire Torah, in Deuteronomy."
"Torah, Numbers.27.3",61 But Nadav and Avihu had died
"Torah, Numbers.27.4",when they brought-near outside fire before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Numbers.27.5","62 And their accounting was: three and twenty thousand,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.6","all males from the age of a month and upward,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.7","for they had not been counted in the midst of the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.8",for they were not given an inheritance in the midst of the Children of Israel.
"Torah, Numbers.27.9",63 These are those-counted by Moshe and El’azar the priest
"Torah, Numbers.27.10",that they counted (of) the Children of Israel
"Torah, Numbers.27.11","in the Plains of Moav, by Jordan-Jericho."
"Torah, Numbers.27.12",64 Among these there was not a man of those counted by Moshe and Aharon the priest
"Torah, Numbers.27.13",when they counted the Children of Israel in the Wilderness of Sinai.
"Torah, Numbers.27.14",65 For Y<small>HWH</small> had said to them:
"Torah, Numbers.27.15","They are to die, yes, die in the wilderness,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.16",there will not be-left of them a man
"Torah, Numbers.27.17",except for Calev son of Yefunne and Yehoshua son of Nun.
"Torah, Numbers.27.18",27:1 There came-near the daughters of Tzelofhad

"Torah, Numbers.27.20","of the clan of Menashe son of Yosef,"

"Torah, Numbers.27.22","Mahla, No’a, Hogla, Milka and Tirtza."
"Torah, Numbers.27.23",2 They stood before Moshe and before El’azar the priest
"Torah, Numbers.27.24","and before the leaders and the entire community,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.25","at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.27.26",3 Our father died in the wilderness.
"Torah, Numbers.27.27","He was not in the midst of the community that came-together against Y<small>HWH</small>, in the community of Korah;"
"Torah, Numbers.27.28","rather, for his own sin he died,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.29",and sons he did not have.
"Torah, Numbers.27.30","4 Why should the name of our father be taken-away from the midst of his clan,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.31",(just) because he has no son?
"Torah, Numbers.27.32",Give us a holding in the midst of our father’s brothers!
"Torah, Numbers.27.33","5 Moshe brought-near their case, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Numbers.27.34","6 And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.27.36","You are to give, yes, give them a hereditary holding in the midst of their father’s brothers,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.37",you are to transfer the inheritance of their father to them.
"Torah, Numbers.27.38","8 And to the Children of Israel you are to speak, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.27.40",you are to transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
"Torah, Numbers.27.41","9 And if he has no daughter,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.42",you are to give his inheritance to his brothers.
"Torah, Numbers.27.43","10 And if he has no brothers,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.44",you are to give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.
"Torah, Numbers.27.45","11 And if no brothers has his father,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.46","you are to give his inheritance to his kin that is nearest to him from his clan,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.47",and he is to take-possession of it;
"Torah, Numbers.27.48","it shall be for the Children of Israel as a law of procedure,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.49",as Y<small>HWH</small> commanded Moshe.
"Torah, Numbers.27.50",12 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.27.51",Go up these Mountains of Avarim/The-Region-Across
"Torah, Numbers.27.52",and see the land that I am giving to the Children of Israel.
"Torah, Numbers.27.53","13 When you have seen it,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.54","you will be gathered to your kinspeople, even you,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.55",as Aharon your brother was gathered;
"Torah, Numbers.27.56",14 since you rebelled against my order in the Wilderness of Tzyn
"Torah, Numbers.27.57",—when the community quarreled—
"Torah, Numbers.27.58",to treat-me-as-holy through water before their eyes;
"Torah, Numbers.27.59","they are the waters of Merivat Kadesh/Quarreling at Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Tzyn."
"Torah, Numbers.27.60","15 Then Moshe spoke to Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.27.61","16 Let Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of the spirits of all flesh, designate a man over the community"
"Torah, Numbers.27.62","17 who will go out before them, who will come back before them,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.63","who will lead them out, who will bring them back;"
"Torah, Numbers.27.64",so that the community of Y<small>HWH</small> will not be like a flock that has no shepherd.
"Torah, Numbers.27.65",18 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.27.66","Take yourself Yehoshua son of Nun,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.67","a man in whom the spirit is,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.68",and lean your hand upon him.
"Torah, Numbers.27.69","19 You are to have him stand before El’azar the priest and before the entire community,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.70",and you are to commission him before their eyes.
"Torah, Numbers.27.71","20 You are to put of your majesty upon him,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.72","in order that they may hearken, the entire community of the Children of Israel."
"Torah, Numbers.27.73","21 Before El’azar the priest he is to stand,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.74","he will seek judgment for him of the <i>Urim</i>, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.75","by his order he will go out and by his order he will come back,"
"Torah, Numbers.27.76","he and all the Children of Israel with him, and the entire community."
"Torah, Numbers.27.77",22 Moshe did as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him;
"Torah, Numbers.27.78",he took Yehoshua
"Torah, Numbers.27.79","and had him stand before El’azar the priest, and before the entire community."
"Torah, Numbers.27.80",_____________
"Torah, Numbers.27.81",27:1 <b>came-near:</b> Here with the connotation of “came before the authorities.” <b>Mahla</b> etc.: Several of these names are the names of known towns.
"Torah, Numbers.27.82",3 <b>for his own sin:</b> As distinct from the sin of taking part in the Korah rebellion.
"Torah, Numbers.27.83",4 <b>holding:</b> An ancestral plot of land.
"Torah, Numbers.27.84",12 <b>Avarim/The-Region-Across:</b> The mountains beyond the Jordan to the east.
"Torah, Numbers.27.85","15 <b>Then Moshe spoke to Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:</b> A reversal of the usual formula in which, typically, God commands Moshe to proclaim a new law."
"Torah, Numbers.27.86","17 <b>go out … come back:</b> These verbs are often used to indicate military leadership. <b>shepherd:</b> A central ancient Near Eastern metaphor for leadership, alternatively applied to Moshe, David, and later to Jesus."
"Torah, Numbers.27.87",19 <b>commission:</b> The same verb normally rendered “command.”
"Torah, Numbers.27.88","20 <b>majesty:</b> JPS “authority.” <b>hearken:</b> That is, obey."
"Torah, Numbers.27.89",21 <b><i>Urim:</i></b> Some kind of oracular object (usually called <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tummim</i>) used to predict the future. It sits in the <i>efod</i> worn by the High Priest (cf. Ex. 28:30).
"Torah, Numbers.28.1","<i>Festival Offerings</i> (28–29): With Chaps. 28–30 we return to a recurring phenomenon in the book of Numbers: the intrusion of priestly material. We would expect 28 and 29, which form a logical unit and enumerate the sacrifices brought on holy days, to be properly placed in Leviticus. In fact, Lev. 23 does set out a sacred calendar. The purpose of that passage, however, was to indicate the overlay of the holy on the cycle of the year; the material here neither creates the calendar itself nor has anything to do with either voluntary offerings or those brought for expiation of sin. It may have been inserted at this point, in this book, because in its drawn-out, formulaic rhetoric, it has the character of a list such as we often find in Numbers. Part III of the book is a logical setting for it, given that it concentrates on the “pilgrimage-festivals” that fit a settled, agricultural context, and these chapters deal with various issues arising from Israel’s immanent possession of the land."
"Torah, Numbers.28.2","Interesting is the addition of the New Moon festival (vv.11ff.), not mentioned in Lev. 23. It was apparently a serious holy day, although the Bible does not forbid work on it. The New Moon fits in the general layout of the chapter, which is, first, according to frequency of sacrifice and then to calendar (Milgrom)."
"Torah, Numbers.28.3",23 He leaned his hands upon him and commisioned him
"Torah, Numbers.28.4",as Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken by the hand of Moshe.
"Torah, Numbers.28.5","28:1 Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.28.25","like the morning grain-gift and like its poured-offering you are to sacrifice it,"

"Torah, Numbers.28.199","9 <b>And on the day of the Sabbath:</b> This and the following passages became part of the traditional Jewish liturgy (in the <i>Musaf</i>, “Additional” Service) for Sabbath and festivals."
"Torah, Numbers.28.200",10 <b>its Sabbath:</b> Probably meaning “its particular Sabbath.”
"Torah, Numbers.28.201","11 <b>heads of your New-Moons:</b> Milgrom notes that the number of animals sacrificed here equals that for major festivals, indicating the biblical importance of the New Moon."
"Torah, Numbers.28.202","18 <b>a proclamation of holiness:</b> Others, “a holy convocation.” <b>servile work:</b> Heavy labor. Later Jewish tradition understood this to mean that certain “work,” like cooking, is in fact permitted."

"Torah, Numbers.29.1","<i>Vows and Women</i> (30): Taking its verbal cue from 29:39, this chapter focuses on the binding nature of vows, especially as regards women, whose legal status was typically bound up with that of their fathers or husbands (unless they were widows or otherwise adult and single; cf. Wegner 1988). In this respect it continues the priestly concern with women, who do not always fit the priestly categories as neatly as that class might have wished. The length of the chapter signals the importance, or rather the sacredness, of an oath in ancient Israel; it stood as uttered unless an annulment procedure was followed. Human words, and not only divine ones, were seen as having effects in the real world."
"Torah, Numbers.29.2","The chapter is built around repeating words, such as “vow,” “bind,” “establish,” “annul,” and “silent.”"
"Torah, Numbers.29.3",30:1 So Moshe declared to the Children of Israel
"Torah, Numbers.29.4",according to all that Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe.
"Torah, Numbers.29.5","2 Moshe spoke to the heads of the tribes of the Children of Israel, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.29.7",3 (Any) man who vows a vow to Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Numbers.29.8","or swears a sworn-oath, to bind himself by a binding-obligation:"
"Torah, Numbers.29.9","he is not to desecrate his word,"
"Torah, Numbers.29.10","according to all that goes out of his mouth, he is to do."
"Torah, Numbers.29.11","4 And a woman, when she vows a vow to Y<small>HWH</small>"
"Torah, Numbers.29.12","or binds (herself) by a binding-obligation in her father’s house, in her youth,"
"Torah, Numbers.29.13","5 and her father hears her vow, or her binding-obligation by which she has bound herself,"
"Torah, Numbers.29.14",and her father is silent to her:
"Torah, Numbers.29.15","all her vows, they shall be upheld,"
"Torah, Numbers.29.16",and all her binding-obligations by which she has bound herself shall be upheld.
"Torah, Numbers.29.17","6 Now if her father constrains her at the time that he hears it,"
"Torah, Numbers.29.18","all her vows and her binding-obligations by which she binds herself shall not be upheld,"
"Torah, Numbers.29.19","and Y<small>HWH</small> will grant-her-pardon,"

"Torah, Numbers.29.29",he annulls her vow that is upon her
"Torah, Numbers.29.30",_____________
"Torah, Numbers.29.31",30:3 <b>desecrate:</b> Violate.

"Torah, Numbers.30.1","<i>War against Midyan</i> (31): We return to preconquest war traditions, such as we encountered in Chap. 21. It is as if God permits Moshe a taste of conquest before he is to be “gathered to [his] kinspeople” (v.2). And it is unfinished business that he takes up here, since the Midyanites had been identified as the ones who lured the Israelites to sin at Baal Pe’or (25:16–18). Also notable in this long chapter is the detailed account of dividing the spoils (vv.25–54); this is both characteristic of Numbers, as a list, and an indication of an important issue that will need attention once the conquest proper proceeds. It also may be an indication of a later tradition; Levine sees in the allotment of spoils for sanctuary income a characteristic royal policy."
"Torah, Numbers.30.2","The cruel aspect of this war, while not unusual by ancient standards, feels jarring to modern Jewish and Christian readers, who perhaps expect the Bible to be more peace-oriented. It is not, although it often “seeks peace,” and there are passages (e.g., Deut. 20 and 21:10–14) where an attempt is made to mute some of the harsh realities of ancient warfare."
"Torah, Numbers.30.3","Niditch has pointed out that this chapter presents an ideology of war slightly different from some other biblical accounts. The term “devote-to-destruction” is not used; virgin girls, who are not yet of the status of “the enemy,” are spared; and war is seen as a ritually defiling activity, i.e., contact with death. In other words, the text exhibits some ambiguity about war, which must then be dealt with via purifying rituals."
"Torah, Numbers.30.4","as well as the rash-statement of her lips by which she has bound herself,"
"Torah, Numbers.30.5",and Y<small>HWH</small> will grant-her-pardon.
"Torah, Numbers.30.6","10 Now the vow of a widow or a divorcée,"
"Torah, Numbers.30.7","anything by which she has bound herself,"

"Torah, Numbers.30.13","all her vows, they shall be upheld,"

"Torah, Numbers.30.15","13 But if her husband annulled, yes, annulled them at the time of his hearing it,"
"Torah, Numbers.30.16","all that went out of her lips as her vows, as her binding of herself—"

"Torah, Numbers.30.23","(then) he has upheld all her vows and all her binding-obligations that are upon her,"
"Torah, Numbers.30.24","he has them upheld,"

"Torah, Numbers.30.95",you and El’azar the priest and the heads of the fathers of the community.

"Torah, Numbers.30.98",and the entire community.

"Torah, Numbers.30.103",29 From their half-share you are to take
"Torah, Numbers.30.104",and give to El’azar the priest a contribution to Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Numbers.30.105","30 And from the half-share of the Children of Israel you are to take one, withheld from the fifty,"
"Torah, Numbers.30.106","from humans and from cattle, from donkeys and from sheep,"

"Torah, Numbers.30.110",31 Moshe and El’azar the priest did
"Torah, Numbers.30.111",as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe.
"Torah, Numbers.30.112","32 Now what was taken, over-and-above the plunder that the people from the armed-forces plundered,"
"Torah, Numbers.30.113","were sheep, six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand,"

"Torah, Numbers.31.1","<i>The Two and a Half Tribes</i> (32): Although most biblical traditions place the Promised Land west of the Jordan River, Numbers includes an unusual request by the tribes of Reu’ven, Gad, and half of the tribe of Menashe: Since they are shepherds, and have heard of the fertile grazing area east of the river, they wish to remain on the east bank. Moshe accedes to their wish, provided that they assist their fellow Israelites in conquering Canaan proper. The historical result of this settlement—which gives us a taste of settlement before the larger conquest in the book of Joshua—seems to have been a checkered one, with Moabites and Ammonites reclaiming land at various subsequent periods."
"Torah, Numbers.31.2","Milgrom has demonstrated how the chapter is built by a select vocabulary of words repeated seven times; the whole may be summarized by the composite statement “If Gad and Reuben cross over as vanguard [Heb. <i>h-l-tz;</i> see below) before Y<small>HWH</small>, they will receive the land holdings (they desire).” The sevenfold “before Y<small>HWH</small>” of the chapter drums in the participation of the divine in the conquest (Milgrom also brings up the possibility that it suggests the Coffer’s presence at the battle)."
"Torah, Numbers.31.3","43 the half-share for the community, from the sheep—"
"Torah, Numbers.31.4",three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred;

"Torah, Numbers.31.6",45 and donkeys thirty thousand and five hundred;
"Torah, Numbers.31.7",46 and human persons sixteen thousand.
"Torah, Numbers.31.8","47 Moshe took from the half-share of the Children of Israel, one withheld out of fifty,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.9","among man and among beast,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.10","and gave them to the Levites, those charged with the duties of the Dwelling of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.11",as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe.
"Torah, Numbers.31.12","48 Now there came-near to Moshe the commanders that belonged to the divisions of the armed-forces,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.13","officers of thousands and officers of hundreds,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.14",49 they said to Moshe:
"Torah, Numbers.31.15","Your servants have taken up the head-count of the men of war that are under our hand,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.16",there has not gone uncounted of us a (single) man!
"Torah, Numbers.31.17",50 And we have brought-near a near-offering for Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Numbers.31.18","(from) any man who found a vessel of gold, armlets or bracelets,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.19","rings, earrings, or ornaments,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.20","to effect-ransom for our lives, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Numbers.31.21","51 So Moshe and El’azar the priest took the gold from them,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.22",all kinds of implements of fine-workmanship.
"Torah, Numbers.31.23",52 Now all the gold of the contribution that they set-aside for Y<small>HWH</small> was:
"Torah, Numbers.31.24","sixteen thousand and seven hundred and fifty <i>shekels</i>,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.25",from the officers of thousands and from the officers of hundreds.
"Torah, Numbers.31.26","53 The men of the armed-forces kept-as-plunder, each-man (what) was his."
"Torah, Numbers.31.27",54 And Moshe and El’azar the priest took the gold
"Torah, Numbers.31.28","from the officers of thousands and the officers of hundreds,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.29","and brought it to the Tent of Appointment,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.30","(as) a reminder for the Children of Israel, before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Numbers.31.31","32:1 Now many livestock had the Sons of Re’uven and the Sons of Gad,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.32",an exceedingly mighty (amount);
"Torah, Numbers.31.33",and they saw the land of Ya’zer in the land of Gil’ad:
"Torah, Numbers.31.34","here, the place was a place (fit) for livestock."
"Torah, Numbers.31.35",2 So the Sons of Re’uven and the Sons of Gad came
"Torah, Numbers.31.36","and said to Moshe, to El’azar the priest and to the leaders of the community, saying:"

"Torah, Numbers.31.41","it is a land for livestock,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.42",and your servants have livestock.
"Torah, Numbers.31.43",5 And they said:
"Torah, Numbers.31.44","If we have found favor in your eyes,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.45",let this land be given to your servants as a holding;
"Torah, Numbers.31.46",do not make us cross the Jordan!
"Torah, Numbers.31.47",6 Moshe said to the Sons of Gad and to the Sons of Re’uven:
"Torah, Numbers.31.48","Should your brothers go out to war,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.49","and you, you stay here?"
"Torah, Numbers.31.50",7 Why would you constrain the will of the Children of Israel
"Torah, Numbers.31.51",from crossing into the land that Y<small>HWH</small> has given them?
"Torah, Numbers.31.52","8 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them out of Kadesh Barne’a to see the land:"
"Torah, Numbers.31.53","9 they went up as far as Wadi Eshkol and saw the land,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.54",then they constrained the will of the Children of Israel
"Torah, Numbers.31.55",so they did not come into the land that Y<small>HWH</small> had given them.
"Torah, Numbers.31.56","10 And the anger of Y<small>HWH</small> flared up on that day,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.57","and he swore, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.31.58","11 If they should see, the men who went up from Egypt,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.59",—from the age of twenty and upward—
"Torah, Numbers.31.60","the soil about which I swore to Avraham, to Yitzhak and to Yaakov … !"
"Torah, Numbers.31.61","For they did not follow-fully after me,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.62","12 excepting Calev son of Yefunne, the Kenizzite, and Yehoshua son of Nun,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.63",for they followed-fully after Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Numbers.31.64","13 And the anger of Y<small>HWH</small> flared up against Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.65","and he had them wander in the wilderness, for forty years,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.66","until it came-to-an-end, that whole generation that was doing what was ill in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>."
"Torah, Numbers.31.67","14 Now here, you have arisen in place of your fathers,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.68","a brood of sinning men,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.69",to add further to the flaming anger of Y<small>HWH</small> against Israel.
"Torah, Numbers.31.70","15 If you turn away from him,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.71","he will add further to leave them in the wilderness,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.72",and you will bring-ruin-upon this whole people!
"Torah, Numbers.31.73",16 They came close to him and said:
"Torah, Numbers.31.74","Sheep fences we will build, for our livestock here,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.75",and towns for our little-ones;
"Torah, Numbers.31.76","17 and as for us, we shall be drafted hastily before the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.77",until we have brought them to their region.
"Torah, Numbers.31.78",But our little-ones will stay in towns fortified against the inhabitants of the land.
"Torah, Numbers.31.79",18 We will not return to our houses
"Torah, Numbers.31.80",until the Children of Israel have inherited each-man his inheritance.
"Torah, Numbers.31.81","19 For we will not take-inheritance with them across the Jordan and further (on),"
"Torah, Numbers.31.82",for our inheritance has become ours
"Torah, Numbers.31.83","across the Jordan, toward sunrise."
"Torah, Numbers.31.84",20 Moshe said to them:
"Torah, Numbers.31.85","If you do this thing,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.86","if you are drafted before Y<small>HWH</small> for war,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.87","21 and you cross the Jordan, every hand-picked man, before Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.88","until he has dispossessed his enemies from before him,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.89","22 and the land is subdued before Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.90","afterward you may return,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.91",and (then) you will be clear (of obligation) before Y<small>HWH</small> and before Israel;
"Torah, Numbers.31.92",this land will be for you as a holding before Y<small>HWH</small>.
"Torah, Numbers.31.93",23 But if you do not do thus:
"Torah, Numbers.31.94","here: you will have sinned against Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.95",and know your sin—that (it) will overtake you!
"Torah, Numbers.31.96","24 Build yourselves towns for your little-ones and fences for your flocks,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.97","and what has gone out of your mouths, do!"
"Torah, Numbers.31.98","25 Then said the Sons of Gad and the Sons of Re’uven to Moshe, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.31.99",Your servants will do as my lord commands:
"Torah, Numbers.31.100","26 our little-ones, our wives, our livestock and all our animals"
"Torah, Numbers.31.101",will stay there in the towns of Gil’ad;
"Torah, Numbers.31.102","27 your servants will cross over, every drafted (member) of the armed-forces, before Y<small>HWH</small>, in war,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.103",as my lord has spoken.
"Torah, Numbers.31.104",28 So Moshe commanded El’azar the priest concerning them
"Torah, Numbers.31.105",and Yehoshua son of Nun
"Torah, Numbers.31.106","and the heads of the Fathers of the tribes of the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.107",29 and Moshe said to them:
"Torah, Numbers.31.108","If the Sons of Gad and the Sons of Re’uven cross over the Jordan with you,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.109","everyone drafted for war, before Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.110","and the land is subdued before you,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.111",you may give them the land of Gil’ad as an inheritance.
"Torah, Numbers.31.112","30 But if the drafted (warriors) do not cross over with you,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.113",they will receive-holdings with you in the land of Canaan.
"Torah, Numbers.31.114","31 The Sons of Gad and the Sons of Re’uven answered, saying:"
"Torah, Numbers.31.115","What Y<small>HWH</small> has spoken to your servants, thus will we do:"
"Torah, Numbers.31.116","32 we ourselves will cross over, as drafted men, before Y<small>HWH</small>, into the land of Canaan,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.117","(remaining) with us (will be) our inherited holding, across the Jordan."
"Torah, Numbers.31.118","33 So Moshe gave to them, to the Sons of Gad, the Sons of Re’uven, and half the tribe of Menashe son of Yosef,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.119","the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.120","and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.121","the land as regards its towns in the territories, the towns of the land all around."
"Torah, Numbers.31.122","34 And the Sons of Gad rebuilt Divon, Atarot, and Aro’er,"

"Torah, Numbers.31.125",as fortified cities and as fences for flocks.
"Torah, Numbers.31.126",37 And the Sons of Re’uven rebuilt Heshbon and El’alei
"Torah, Numbers.31.127","and Kiryatayim,"

"Torah, Numbers.31.129",and Sivma;

"Torah, Numbers.31.131",the names of the towns that they built.
"Torah, Numbers.31.132","39 Then went out the Sons of Makhir son of Menashe, to Gil’ad,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.133",they conquered it
"Torah, Numbers.31.134",and dispossessed the Amorites that were in it.
"Torah, Numbers.31.135","40 And Moshe gave Gil’ad to Makhir son of Menashe,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.136",and he settled there.
"Torah, Numbers.31.137",41 And Ya’ir son of Menashe marched out
"Torah, Numbers.31.138","and conquered their villages,"
"Torah, Numbers.31.139",he called them Hawot-Ya’ir/Fortified-Villages of Ya’ir.

It would of course be ideal if we could map out the route, but the location of most of the places mentioned in the chapter has been lost over time. We are left with the rhythm of the place-names rather than a viable historical record."
"Torah, Numbers.32.2","Vv.50ff. introduce a new note, appropriate in view of the preconquest situation. Before Moshe lays out the future borders of Israelite Canaan in the next chapter, he must warn his charges about the dangers of leaving the conquered peoples (and their religious culture) settled in the land.

Greenberg (1959) has claimed that the specified towns probably were a substitute for what in other ancient Near Eastern societies was banishment; in his view, the idea of internal banishment presented here affirms the high and nonnegotiable value put on human life in the Bible—even when it is ended by accident.

The decision rendered here (that the daughters of Tzelofhad may inherit their father’s holdings, but that they must agree to marry within their tribe) ties the final loose end relating to the land, and so we are able to leave the wilderness narratives and laws with a sense that the future in the Promised Land is both assured and orderly. All that remains is for Moshe to die—but first he has a series of speeches to deliver to his charges of half a lifetime. These will be introduced by the opening verse of the next book, “These are the words/speeches ….”"

That is, male relatives ultimately inherit the land, as though there were no daughters! Thus the process of “inner-biblical interpretation,” whereby already in the Bible itself passages are subject to later scrutiny and recasting, makes its appearance; it will be exemplified by much of the material in the next book, Deuteronomy."

"Torah, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure.1","T<small>HE READER WHO APPROACHES THE BOOK OF</small> N<small>UMBERS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ITS</small> common Hebrew name, <i>Bemidbar</i>, “In the Wilderness,” will logically expect a narrative account of the wanderings of the Israelites before they reach the Promised Land. But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil’am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations."
"Torah, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure.2","It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern)."
"Torah, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure.3","The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history."
"Torah, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure.4","Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26.

"Torah, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure.45","In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them."
"Torah, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure.46","With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival."
"Torah, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure.47","The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy."
"Torah, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure.48","Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part."
"Torah, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure.49","As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph."
"Torah, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure.50","The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25."
"Torah, Numbers, On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure.51","It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."
"Torah, Numbers, I: the Wilderness Camp.1",(1–10)
"Torah, Numbers, I: the Wilderness Camp.2","T<small>O LIST IS TO DEMONSTRATE A SENSE OF ORDER AND CONTROL</small>. T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> Numbers commences with several lists that serve to arrange and catalog the Israelite camp in the wilderness: first, the “accountings” of the Israelites fit for battle; then, the symmetrical arrangement of the camp itself, around the Tabernacle; and finally, the special listing of the Levite population, accompanied by an enumeration of its special tasks in the camp. The first part of Numbers thus takes place as it were in the shadow of Mount Sinai—that is, under the aegis of the priestly school of thinking, in which order is everything."
"Torah, Numbers, I: the Wilderness Camp.3","There is a strong military bent to the arrangement. The census of Chapter 1 is not a head count of the entire Israelite population, but rather of those “twenty years of age and upward,” those eligible to serve in the army. The setup of the camp resembles that in ancient Egypt, with the sanctuary and ark (here “Dwelling” and “coffer”) in the center (in the Egypt of Raamses II—thought by some to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus—it was the king’s throne). The Levites, whom we have not encountered previously as a group with tasks distinct from those of the priests, emerge in this part of the book as caretakers and perhaps guardians of the sanctuary, in addition to their tasks of dismantling and transport of the “Holy-Shrine.” This military aspect reflects an ancient concept of Israel as the “forces of Y<small>HWH</small>,” surely a conquest image, which later becomes standardized in language in the phrase usually rendered “the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.”"
"Torah, Numbers, I: the Wilderness Camp.4","Some of the material in this section might well have been put elsewhere. Chapters 5–7 would have fit nicely in Leviticus; Chapter 7, the listing of the tribal gifts brought to the sanctuary upon its dedication, could even have followed Ex. 40, where Moshe completes the erection of the structure. That these chapters are here therefore must be the result of a conscious decision, either to include material that did not find its way into the other books, or out of a feeling that they were appropriately placed in the book about Israel’s wanderings in the wilderness."
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.1",(11–25)
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.2","V<small>IRTUALLY THE FIRST THING THE</small> I<small>SRAELITES DO AFTER SETTING OUT ON THE SECOND</small> leg of their journey to the Promised Land is—rebel. This pattern was already seen in the book of Exodus, where, despite the climactic miracle of deliverance at the Sea of Reeds, the Israelites “grumbled against Moshe” at Mara because of lack of drinkable water. Although a strain in later biblical thinking remembered the wilderness period as a kind of honeymoon (cf. Jer. 2:2), the Torah itself chose to remember it as a severe time of testing which the ex-slaves ultimately failed to pass."
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.3","The second part of Numbers is a remarkable collection of rebellion narratives that simultaneously display striking similarities and great and colorful differences. The section details six rebellions of the people, and two of the leaders themselves. They are united by a consistent vocabulary: verbs such as “grumble” and “assemble/gather/speak against” depict complaints against Moshe and Aharon and against God. These stories also display the recurring themes of dearth of food and water, and God’s anger at the rebellions, usually expressed in some form of plague (or, additionally, fire)."
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.4","Rather than unfold in simple chronological order, one following another, these pieces of the text have been intensified by priestly editing, which has interspersed the stories with a number of cultic and legal passages (Chaps. 15, 18, and 19, all of which bear the theme word “law” [Heb. <i>hok</i> or <i>hukka</i>]), and which are somehow related to previous or succeeding narratives. The interruptions also allow each of the memorable rebellion narratives to “breathe,” giving the audience time to digest the images and the drama presented therein. The stories possess both in abundant measure; one thinks, for instance, of the “meat between the teeth” (11:33), of the grape clusters borne on a pole by two men (13:23); and of the great confrontation with Korah in Chapter 16 (not to mention its resolution), as well as Moshe’s dramatic failure in Chapter 20."
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.5","As in any great literature, repetition of story type or type scene is here accomplished via variation of the most telling kind. In this case we observe once again an alternating pattern to the rebellions, a pattern which reveals not one theme but several:"
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.6","The people, over lack of food (chapter 11)"
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.7","Moshe’s siblings, over prophetic primacy (12)"
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.8","The people, over the spies’ false report (14)"
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.9","Levites, over Moshe and Aharon’s prerogatives (16)"
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.10","The people, over the rebellious Levites’ sinister fate (17)"
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.11","Moshe himself, over the burden of leading the people (20)"
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.12","The people, over the lack of food and water (21)"
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.13","The pattern observable here is broken, in true biblical rhetorical style (where the last in a sequence often serves by its oddness to reinforce the whole), in a final rebellion (Chap. 25), where the people’s actions involve neither the “complaining” vocabulary nor a revolt against human leadership, but rather comprise the greatest biblical crime of them all: worship of other gods. Viewed in this patterned fashion, the rebellion narratives emerge with a kind of crescendo effect."
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.14","It is also possible, as I have done in “On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure,” above, to follow the scheme put forth by Mann—a three-part structure to the section, each with its internal logic and conclusions. These are treated below; for the moment, it will suffice to see in the first subsection (Chaps. 11–14) the inevitable result of wilderness rebellions: the divine decree that the slave generation must die out before entering the Promised Land; the second subsection (16–20) deals with the challenges to the leadership of Moshe and Aharon, and results in a similar decree, that they will die outside the land; and the third subsection (20–25) chronicles the encounter of the Israelites with neighboring nations, which initially goes in their favor but ends with the disastrous incident at Baal Pe’or (25)."
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.15","The primary issue in these stories, to the biblical writer, is lack of trust in God. Each of the three sections mentions or implies that problem; 14:11 and 20:12 use the verb itself, and the narrative of Chapter 25 suggests it. The bottom line is that the Israelites could not keep faith with God—even after both staggering acts of divine intervention (i.e., rescue) and demonstrations of the force of divine wrath—and this lack of faith led ultimately to their dying out in the wilderness outside the Promised Land, in punishment. The stories clearly were meant to be understood as an unfortunate example for later generations, and were taken as such already in the biblical period (see, for example, the treatment in Psalm 78)."
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.16","Read on another level, the rebellion narratives are largely concerned with the issue of human leadership, its qualifications, manifestations, and limitations (and even failures). Has there ever been a leader as beleaguered as Moshe? From the beginning of his career on the sands of Egypt, where he assumes the mantle of leadership in the matter of retaliating against the sadistic Egyptian taskmaster (Ex. 2:11–12), to its end at the plains of Moab, in stern address to the people he has struggled to lead (this is the setting of the entire next book, Deuteronomy), he must evoke trust in God, lead the people through an uncharted wilderness, and inspire confidence in his own leadership. His success is muted by the passing of the generation he initially leads, before it can enter Canaan; like them, he too must pass on—with merely a look beyond the Jordan, but no more. Later generations of Jewish readers wept on confronting Moshe’s seemingly premature death, and created heroic tales of his pleading before God to be let into the land he had so long sought to reach. In Numbers he fully deserves this stature, alternately interceding with and cajoling God, standing up for and then almost giving up on this people with whom his life has become so enmeshed. Our stories stress his gifts of prophecy and his pathos as a deeply human leader."
"Torah, Numbers, Ii: the Rebellion Narratives.17","A final, troubling issue is the character of God in this part of the book. It is a measure of the Bible’s artistry that the rebellion accounts are so varied in content and style; but the variations in punishment—from undetailed death to skin disease to stoning and the earth opening up, just to mention a few examples—create an impression, not of artistic richness but of unremitting severity. The Bible does not seem to have a problem with this kind of divine behavior, and other ancient cultures would have felt at home here, but already in late antiquity, and continuing down to our own day, Jews and Christians most often have preferred, and prayed to, a more forgiving, nurturing, and compassionate God. Dealing with these texts, in the end, raises the question of whether to understand them as the result of “historical necessity” or “literary conceit” (that is, the old generation simply had to die out) or as they stand in the text: a harsh portrayal of what happened when the covenant people violated the covenant."
"Torah, Numbers On Bil’am.0","(22:2-25:9)"
"Torah, Numbers, On Bil’am.1","N<small>OW EMBEDDED WITHIN THE SECOND PART OF THE BOOK OF</small> N<small>UMBERS, THE STORIES</small> and exalted poetry connected with the name of the pagan prophet Bil’am (Balaam) in many ways point to the final section of the book. They provide a welcome relief from the depressing and at times exasperating narratives of rebellion. Israel in Bil’am’s vision is the realization of the patriarchal dream, a sea of people (and tents) without number, upright in conduct and victorious in battle. In its focusing on the theme of reversal—curses turned to blessings, ass turned seer/prophet, and prophet turned fool—the Bil’am section suggests that, as we leave the old generation to die out in the wilderness, God’s own “cursing” of the people because of their rebelliousness will somehow, ultimately, be turned into blessing. No wonder that Buber (1988) felt the hidden presence of Moses and his vision of Israel in these chapters."
"Torah, Numbers, On Bil’am.2","Recent archaeological finds have placed Bil’am as a figure known to extrabiblical traditions located in the lands east of the Jordan. The Torah uses him (as the Bible may have used Job and other such personalities) for its own purposes, picking up a theme it has utilized earlier: the acknowledgment of God’s power and Israel’s glory by a wise or inspired pagan (cf., for instance, the figure of Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, in Ex. 18; or, to use later examples, Jericho’s Rahab in Josh. 2 and the Queen of Sheba in I Kings 10). Just as the Pharaoh is made to acknowledge God’s power and Israel’s glory toward the beginning of the Exodus sequence, so the nations or tribes surrounding Israel are portrayed as coming to the same realization at its end. Bil’am, as it were, provides religious legitimacy for these ideas in the non-Israelite domain."
"Torah, Numbers, On Bil’am.3","The narrative is built, not only on obvious theme words such as “word,” “speak,” and “curse/revile/doom,” but also on repeating phrases. Central to them, in variation, is “only the word that I [God] speak to you, / that (alone) may speak” (22:20, 35, 38; 23:12, 36). The episode with the she-ass, one of the most unusual in the Bible, revolves around the threefold “And the she-ass saw YHWH’s messenger” (22:23, 2.5, 27), suggesting, of course, that Bil’am, the reputed holy man, does not see him. The story also offers an illustration of the Bible’s balanced sense of justice: Balak “once again” sends emissaries, Bil’am “once again” beats the she-ass, but these actions are thwarted by the divine messenger’s “once again” blocking the path (and, symbolically, the curse)."
"Torah, Numbers, On Bil’am.4","While some scholars have suggested that the she-ass section has origins independent from the main body of the story, it is verbally linked to Bil’am’s speeches later in the story by a single device. The refrain of “these three times,” describing Bil’am’s beating of the she-ass and her refusal to continue, is matched by the threefold refusal of God to allow anything but blessing to publicly issue forth from the prophet’s mouth (“[on] these three occasions,” 24:10)."
"Torah, Numbers, On Bil’am.5","The poetic sections of the story are built on the basis of a stock scene: Bil’am has Balak build seven altars and prepare seven bulls and seven rams; the prophet sacrifices the animals, and has the king stand alongside the altars while he, Bil’am, goes off to encounter God. When he returns, he “takes up his parable,” stressing twice how God blesses, not curses, Israel, and how he will under no circumstances revoke that blessing. The full version of the blessing, beginning in 24:3, is distinguished by its lofty tone (clearly suggesting the infusion of the “spirit of God” [24:2]). The tripled “Utters …” signals an abrupt change in mood and inspiration; the word, more properly “the utterance of …,” is frequently used by the later Prophets to open their speeches."
"Torah, Numbers, On Bil’am.6","A word should be said about the “oracles to the nations” that begin in 24:17. These are reminiscent of many Prophetic passages, in which the seer turns outside Israel and addresses the neighboring peoples (e.g., Amos 1–2:3). Their inclusion in Numbers helps to link the Bil’am story with what has immediately preceded it, the account of Israel’s militarily successful encounter with its historical neighbors."
"Torah, Numbers, On Bil’am.7","Similarly, the Bil’am episode is linked to the chapter that follows it, the apostasy at Baal-Peor. A tradition reported in 31:8 informs us that Bil’am was among those killed by Pin’has in his “zeal” or “indignation” (Fishbane 1974) for Y<small>HWH</small>."

It is concerned, then, with the transfer of leadership from Moshe to Yehoshua (Joshua); with provisions for two and a half tribes to remain on the east bank of the Jordan River, as long as they take part in the impending invasion; with listing the entire route of the Israelites, from Egypt to the plains of Moab; and with the borders of the land to be conquered."
"Torah, Numbers, Iii: the Preparations For Conquest.3","As has been the case earlier in the book, however, other material intervenes: a theme and variation doublet on the inheritance of land in a case where a man leaves daughters, not sons; two chapters on what sacrifices are to be brought on holy days; a section on vows taken by women; war with Midyan and the precise apportioning of spoils, both to warriors and to the sanctuary; and the law regarding accidental homicide, in which family vengeance is circumvented by the existence of “safe” Levite towns to which the manslayer may flee."
"Torah, Numbers, Iii: the Preparations For Conquest.4","The inconsistent thematics may again be explained by the intrusion of an editorial hand, again by priestly interests. In Levine’s view, most of Chapters 25–36 function to establish matters of importance in the priestly view, just as in Chapters 1–10. Here law takes precedence over narrative."
"Torah, Numbers, Iii: the Preparations For Conquest.5","Despite the varied subject matter of this section, it holds together structurally, via the common biblical technique of word (sound) repetition. The rather common verb <i>tzivvah</i>, “command,” weaves through every one of Chapters 26–36, except for 33. Sometimes it introduces what God wants the Israelites to do; sometimes it leads to the formula of fulfillment, “as YHWH commanded the Children of Israel, so they did”; still other times it refers to a command given by Moshe himself. The entire section begins with the verb (26:4), and ends with it as well (36:13). In addition, the chapters most far afield, 28–29 (taken as a unit) and 30, begin and end with it. Whether this was a conscious technique by redactors is hard to say, but its existence is striking."
"Torah, Numbers, Iii: the Preparations For Conquest.6","Another structural device, that of framing, also occurs in this part of the book: after the introductory census (Chap. 26), the rest is built between two brackets, each involving the daughters of Tzelofhad, and each opening with the verb “to come-near” (27:1 and 36:1). So despite the wide-ranging material, some sense of unity has been imposed upon it."
"Torah, Numbers, Iii: the Preparations For Conquest.7","Finally, there is the key occurrence, for the book of Numbers, of more lists, from census to holiday sacrifices, from stops along the journey to the precise borders of the Promised Land. We are in the presence of order once again."
"Torah, Numbers, Iii: the Preparations For Conquest.8","What remains lacking at the end of the book is exactly what Deuteronomy supplies: a final exhortation from Moshe, which includes reiteration and further clarification of the laws, a public covenant ceremony, Moshe’s long blessing of the people, and the account of his death and burial. If added here, these topics might have tipped the scales of Numbers, which has given us almost too much to digest as it is; as the Torah has come down to us, they are more appropriately treated in the expansive and majestic rhetorical setting of Deuteronomy."

"Torah, Numbers, Iii: the Preparations For Conquest.10","<b><i>Num. 26:3</i> Moshe spoke, and El’azar the priest, to them in the Plains of Moav …</b>"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.1","<i>Setting Out</i> (1): After the narrator’s brief introduction, which places the Israelites at the very borders of the Promised Land, Moshe’s words bring the Israelites from Sinai to Kadesh, in the southern part of the land. He begins with his own problem, the burden of leadership; but the bulk of the chapter functions to explain why the Israelites that came out of Egypt were not privileged to enter the land itself. Stylistically interesting is Moshe’s constant use of quotations—he cites God, himself, and the Israelites. The effect is to make the narrative vivid and also authoritative in tone (cf. Polzin 1980)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.2",1:1 These are the words that Moshe spoke to all Israel
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.3",in (the country) across the Jordan
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.4","in the wilderness, in the plains near Suf,"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.8","in the eleventh New-Moon, on (day) one after the New-Moon,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.9",Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.10","according to all that Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him concerning them,"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.14","5 In (the country) across the Jordan, in the land of Moav,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.15","Moshe set about to explain this Instruction, saying:"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.35","13 Provide yourselves (with) men, wise, understanding and knowledgeable, for your tribes,"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.37","14 And you answered me, you said:"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.39","15 So I took heads of your tribes, men wise and knowledgeable,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.40","and I placed them as heads over you,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.41","as rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens, and as officials for your tribes."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.42","16 And I commanded your judges at that time, saying:"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.43","hear-out (what is) between your brothers,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.44",judge with equity between each-man and his brother or a sojourner.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.45","17 You are not to (specially-)recognize a face in judgment,"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.50",and I will hear-it-out.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.51",18 So I commanded you at that time concerning all the matters that you should do.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.52",19 We marched on from Horev
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.53","and traveled through the whole wilderness, that great and awe-inspiring one that you saw,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.54",by the Amorite hill-country route
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.55","as Y<small>HWH</small> our God commanded us,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.56",and we came as far as Kadesh-Barne’a.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.57",20 And I said to you:

"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.63","Do not be afraid, do not be dismayed!"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.64","22 Then you came-near to me, all of you, and said:"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.68",about the route that we should (use to) go up against it
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.69",and about the towns that we will come to.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.70","23 The matter was good in my eyes,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.71","and so I took from among you twelve men, one man per tribe."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.72","24 They faced about and went up into the hills, and came as far as the Wadi of Clusters"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.73",and spied it out.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.74",25 They took in their hand (some) of the fruit of the land and brought (it) down to us
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.75","and returned us word, they said:"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.77","26 Yet you were not willing to go up,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.78",you rebelled against the order of Y<small>HWH</small> your God.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.79","27 You muttered in your tents, you said:"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.1.110","37 At me also Y<small>HWH</small> was incensed for your sakes, saying:"

This section is connected to the previous material by its evocation of past events (the sin at Baal Pe’or and the revelation at Sinai/Horev), but it also points to the future, by means of its vision of exile and return. Not surprisingly, the words “hear/hearken,” “see,” “laws (and regulations),” and “command” are all key expressions; these become increasingly important in the chapters to follow."

"Torah, Deuteronomy.4.161","16 <b>lest:</b> This particle occurs frequently in Deuteronomy, as part of its elaborate language of warning."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.4.162","21 <b>and he swore</b> etc.: Here it is to the people’s “words” (unspecified, but probably their refusal to enter the land in Num. 13–14), and not to Moshe’s own rebellious act in striking the rock in Num. 20, that the narrator attributes God’s barring the Promised Land to him."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.4.163",27 <b>menfolk few-in-number:</b> Echoing Jacob’s fear in Gen. 34:30.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.4.164",36 <b>discipline:</b> Or “rebuke.”
"Torah, Deuteronomy.4.165","37 <b>since he loved your fathers:</b> Often given as the reason for God’s mercy toward Israel; cf. Moshe’s plea in Ex. 32:13. <b>seed:</b> Meaning “offspring.” <b>with his presence:</b> Focusing on the direct intervention of God (as opposed to angels, for instance), is characteristic of Deuteronomy (Tigay)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.5.1","<i>Towns of Asylum</i> (4:41–43): In a brief passage that seems utterly out of place amid the deep rhetoric of this section, Moshe carries out a command he had received in Num. 35:9–34 to make sure that an accidental manslayer has a special place(s) to flee to from an avenging family. Perhaps this has been placed here because it is one of the few “laws and regulations” in the Torah whose observance is mandated on the east bank of the Jordan River—and hence is one of the few that Moshe personally gets to carry out."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.5.2","41 Then Moshe set apart three towns in (the country) across the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.5.3","42 for fleeing to (for) the (accidental) murderer who murders his neighbor with no forethought,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.5.4","where he did not bear-hatred toward him from yesterday and the day-before,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.5.5",and so can flee to one of these towns and stay-alive:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.5.6","43 Betzer in the wilderness of the plateau land, belonging to the Re’uvenites,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.5.7","Ra’mot in Gil’ad, belonging to the Gadites,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.5.8","and Golan in Bashan, belonging to the Menashites."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.6.1","<i>The Basic Rules</i> (4:44–5:30): After a brief introduction, the text appears to begin the sequence of “laws and regulations” with the Ten Commandments. The latter, however, are quoted from Sinai (albeit in slightly altered form), and we are justified in viewing them, just as their counterpart in Ex. 20, as a kind of preamble to the laws themselves. They may even function as a narrated piece amid the pleas of Moshe. At any event, Chap. 5 uses key words we have previously encountered—“speak,” “command,” “hear”—but puts major emphasis on variations of the root “live.” The message would seem to be that those who heard God speaking at Sinai miraculously survived, and now will survive into the long term if they keep God’s covenant which he presented at the mountain."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.6.2","The Ten Commandments, of course, form a cornerstone of Western civilization—although a glance at them will reveal that they have not been very well followed over the past two millennia. But their language and their message remain an ideal. They served for a time as part of Jewish liturgy, but were ultimately removed from the Prayer Book out of fear that it would be thought that ten rules were the limit of one’s obligations to God."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.6.3","As in Chap. 4, where the audience is warned not to add anything to the revealed Instruction, Chap. 5 also reminds them that nothing was added at Sinai."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.6.4","44 This is the Instruction that Moshe set before the Children of Israel,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.6.5","45 these are the precepts and the laws and the regulations that Moshe declared to the Children of Israel when they went out from Egypt,"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.6.7","in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who sat-as-ruler in Heshbon,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.6.8","whom Moshe and the Children of Israel struck, when they went out from Egypt;"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.7.1","<i>The Centrality of Education</i> (6): Deuteronomy places particular emphasis on transmitting the meaning and practice of the laws. Crucial here is the concept that constant recital of key ideas and experiences, and making sure to pass them on to new generations, will insure the observance of the commandments and hence Israel’s good life on the promised soil. “Command” is the frequently used key word; the central passage is the so-called <i>Shema</i> (“Hearken [O Israel]”), already used in ancient times as both the core prayer in daily Jewish liturgy and the cry of martyrs (it is used as well as a prayer for retiring at night and as the core of the deathbed confession). Here memory is the key: the experience of slavery in Egypt, Israel’s trying behavior in the wilderness, and, above all, the constant rescuing grace of God. The idea that there should be constant reminders of the covenant became a staple of Jewish ritual practice, from the early education of children in the biblical text, to the <i>tefillin</i> (see below) worn in daily prayer, to the <i>mezuza</i> (a small box containing passages from Deuteronomy) on the doorpost. All three are mentioned in vv.7–9."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.7.2","Vv. 5–9 have an oral, liturgical ring to them, with the tenfold repetition of the sound <i>ekha</i> (“your”). A good many sections of Deuteronomy in fact utilize this style, providing the book, despite its emphasis on the phenomenon of writing, with a distinctive sound."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.7.3","6:1 Now this is the commandment, the laws and the regulations"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.7.74",_____________
"Torah, Deuteronomy.7.75","21 <b>Glory:</b> God’s visible manifestation, his “aura.” <b>they can remain-alive:</b> In the Bible (cf. Ex. 33:20) as elsewhere in the ancient world, the divine usually cannot be directly viewed by humans."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.7.76",26 <b>all the days:</b> Or “every day.”
"Torah, Deuteronomy.7.77","6:3 <b>exceedingly many:</b> Fulfilling the promise made to Abraham in Genesis on numerous occasions. <b>honey:</b> Alternatively, “nectar,” the syrup of dates."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.7.78","4 <b>Y<small>HWH</small> our God, Y<small>HWH</small> (is) One!:</b> Despite the centrality of this phrase as a rallying cry in later Jewish history and thought, its precise meaning is not clear. It most likely stipulates that the Israelites are to worship Y<small>HWH</small> alone; a secondary meaning might be reflected by the translation “Y<small>HWH</small> is (but) one” — that is, God has no partner or consort as in the mythology of neighboring cultures."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.7.79","5 <b>heart:</b> The word is often the equivalent of “mind” in biblical language. <b>being:</b> Heb. <i>nefesh</i> carries a host of meanings: “life” or “life-essence,” “breath,” “self,” and “appetite,” to mention a few. The traditional English “soul,” while stirring in these passages, gives the impression of something contrasted to the body—not an idea that appears in the Hebrew Bible. It should be mentioned that the couplet “heart and being,” which occurs a number of times in Deuteronomy, might also indicate “mind and emotions.” <b>substance:</b> Or “excess”; others, “might,” “capacity.” There are other examples of biblical Hebrew words for “strength” that also mean “wealth” (e.g., <i>hayil</i> in Deut. 33:11)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.7.80","7 <b>repeat … with:</b> Others, “teach diligently to,” “impress upon.”"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.8.1","<i>Israel and the Canaanites</i> (7): An important part of Israel’s self-understanding in Deuteronomy, as elsewhere in the Torah, is separation from other peoples—particularly from the inhabitants of the land they are to conquer. This chapter emphasizes the absolute avoidance of the Canaanites which the Israelites are to practice (it begins and ends with “devotion-to-destruction,” a kind of ritual ban or confiscation). The violence on the part of Israel spoken of in the opening verses, and the destruction wrought by God in the closing lines, frame a middle section that speaks of God’s “love” and “loyalty” toward Israel—again, in the mode of an ancient Near Eastern overlord. The emotional tone of the chapter strongly suggests a period of intense nationalism."

"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.57",—now the mountain was burning with fire—
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.58","the two tablets of the covenant in my two arms,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.59",16 and I saw:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.60","here, you were sinning against Y<small>HWH</small> your God, you had made yourselves a molten calf;"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.61",you had turned-aside quickly from the way that Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded you!
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.62",17 So I grasped the two tablets
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.63",and threw them from my two arms
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.64",and smashed them before your eyes.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.65",18 I lay-fallen before Y<small>HWH</small> as at the beginning (of the) forty days and forty nights;
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.66","food I did not eat, water I did not drink,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.67","because of all your sins that you sinned, by doing what was ill in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>, to vex him."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.68","19 For I was in dread of the anger and the venom with which Y<small>HWH</small> was furious with you, to destroy you;"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.69","and Y<small>HWH</small> hearkened to me, also on that occasion."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.70","20 But with Aharon, Y<small>HWH</small> was exceedingly incensed, (enough) to destroy him,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.71",but I interceded also on behalf of Aharon at that time.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.72","21 Now as for your sinful-thing that you had made, the calf:"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.73","I took (it) and burned it with fire,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.74","I beat it, well ground-up, until it was crushed (into) fine-dust,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.75",and I threw its dust into the stream that comes down the mountain.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.76","22 —And at Tav’era / Blazing and at Massa / Testing, and at Kivrot ha-Taava/Burial-Sites of Craving,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.77","you were infuriating Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.78","23 and (also) when Y<small>HWH</small> sent you on from Kadesh Barne’a, saying:"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.79","Go up, possess the land that I am giving to you,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.80","you rebelled against the order of Y<small>HWH</small> your God, and did not trust him and did not hearken to his voice."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.81",24 Rebellious have you been against Y<small>HWH</small> from the (first) day that I knew you!
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.82",25 Now when I lay-fallen before Y<small>HWH</small>
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.83","for the forty days and the forty nights that I was fallen,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.84","when Y<small>HWH</small> said he would destroy you,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.85",26 I interceded to Y<small>HWH</small> and said:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.86","My Lord, Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.87","do not bring-ruin on your people, your inheritance"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.88","whom you redeemed in your greatness,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.89",whom you took out of Egypt with a strong hand!
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.90","27 Bear-in-mind your servants, Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yaakov;"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.91","do not face toward the hard-heartedness of this people or toward their wickedness or toward their sin,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.92",28 lest the (people of the) land out of which you took them say:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.93",Because of Y<small>HWH</small>’s inability to bring them to the land which he had promised to them
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.94",and because of his hatred for them
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.95","did he take them out, to cause-their-death in the wilderness!"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.96","29 —And they are your people, your inheritance"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.97",whom you took out in your great power and with your outstretched arm!
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.98",10:1 At that time Y<small>HWH</small> said to me:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.99","Carve yourself two tablets of stone, like the first-ones,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.100","and come up to me, on the mountain,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.101",and make yourself a coffer of wood.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.102","2 I will write on the tablets the words that were on the tablets, the first-ones, that you smashed,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.103",and you are to put them in the coffer.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.104","3 So I made a coffer of acacia wood,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.105","I carved out two tablets of stone, like the first-ones,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.106","and I went up, on the mountain, the two tablets in my arms."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.107","4 And he wrote on the tablets according to the first writing,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.108",the Ten Words
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.109","that Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to you on the mountain, from the midst of the fire,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.110","on the day of the Assembly,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.111",and Y<small>HWH</small> gave them to me.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.112","5 And when I faced about and came down the mountain,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.113","I put the tablets in the coffer that I had made,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.114","and they have remained there,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.115",as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded me.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.116",6 And the Children of Israel marched from the Wells of the Children of Ya’akan to Mosera;
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.117","there Aharon died, and he was buried there;"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.118",so El’azar his son served-as-priest in his stead.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.119","7 From there they marched to Gudgoda,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.120","from Gudgoda to Yotvata, a land of streams of water."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.121",8 At that time Y<small>HWH</small> separated the tribe of Levi
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.122","to carry the coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s covenant, to stand before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, to attend on him and to give-blessing in his name,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.123",until this day.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.124",9 Therefore Levi did not have an inheritable portion along with his brothers;
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.125","Y<small>HWH</small> is his inheritance,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.126",as Y<small>HWH</small> your God promised him.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.127","10 As for me, I stood on the mountain"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.128","like the days, the first-ones, forty days and forty nights,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.129",and Y<small>HWH</small> hearkened to me also on that occasion—
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.130",Y<small>HWH</small> did not consent to bring-ruin upon you.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.131",11 Y<small>HWH</small> said to me:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.132","Arise, go on the march before the people,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.133",so that they may enter and take-possession-of the land
"Torah, Deuteronomy.10.134","about which I swore to their fathers, to give them."

"Torah, Deuteronomy.11.1","<i>Concluding Exhortation</i> (10:12–11:32): To conclude his long introduction to the laws, Moshe returns to the theme of Y<small>HWH</small>’s love for Israel, expanding it to include Israel’s duty to love the stranger and also to love God. Once again the past is invoked, especially those parts of it that focus on God’s might. The intimate connection between people and land is stressed through Moshe’s wonderful description of Canaan (vv.11–12), and the polarity of blessing and curse rounds out his plea—just as a long blessing/curse cycle will round out the whole book in Chaps. 29 and 30. In fact, Chap. 11, both in its beginning (“you are to keep his charge, his laws, his regulations and his commandments”) and its ending (“you are to take-care to observe all the laws and the regulations that I place before you today”), form a fitting lead-in to the long sequence of laws that is about to commence."

"Torah, Deuteronomy.12.1","<i>On Worship and Meat-Eating</i> (12:2–31): The extended section on laws begins with what sounds like a reference to Josiah’s reform—the smashing of idols, the abolition of the “high-places” (the pagan shrines which dotted the ancient landscape of Canaan), and the centralization of the cult in the place that “God chooses to have his name dwell.” Since this emphasis is central to the program of Deuteronomy in its final form, it is not surprising that it appears first in the legal section of the book—rather like the opening of the laws in Exodus 21–23, which centers around the situation of one of its central concerns and images, the slave (Levinson). A logical result of the centralization of the cult is the need to permit the eating of meat in local sites; previously it had been permitted only at the Dwelling (cf. Lev. 17), the portable sanctuary. But the old prohibition against eating blood, as symbolic of the life, is upheld."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.12.2","Vv.29–31, which mark a transition to the next chapter, round out Chap. 12’s stern proscription of improper worship—“indeed, even their sons and daughters they burn with fire to their gods!” (31)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.12.3","Christensen (1986) notes a stylistic peculiarity of this chapter which is typical of Deuteronomy: a shift between second person plural and singular.

Its distinctive appearance here focuses on the aspect of food in general; in Exodus it occurs in the more limited context of rules regarding the spring ritual.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.14.89",22 <b>tithe:</b> To give a tenth of one’s produce to the sanctuary. Cf. Num. 18.

"Torah, Deuteronomy.14.91","26 <b>you may eat (it) there:</b> In the priestly texts, the tithe is given to the Levites, not to the people themselves. The concept adopted in Deuteronomy is that holiness “is not inherent, but must be willed” (Weinfeld)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.15.1","<i>The Number Seven and the Matter of Debt</i> (15:1–18): In Lev. 25, the Sabbatical year was explained in great detail, principally in regard to letting the land lie fallow. Similarly, the cycle of seven-times-seven years (plus one), the Jubilee (“Homebringing”) Year, was characterized as a time of land returning to its original owners. While the Leviticus text talks a good deal about poverty from v.35 on, most of it is about land and money. In Deuteronomy, on the other hand, the issue of the needy jumps to the fore from the beginning of the chapter, and remains central throughout. The result of such care is “blessing” from God, a theme word in the chapter."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.15.2","Vv.12–18 parallel Ex. 21:2–6, but utilize a more rational argument. They also include the freeing of female slaves, in effect recognizing their personhood in a way the Exodus passage does not (Weinfeld 1992)."

To that end, animals other than lambs are now allowed to be sacrificed, and they may be boiled, not just roasted.

Judg. 8:22–23), and could roundly condemn monarchy’s excesses (cf. I Sam. 8:10–18). On the other hand, popular support for this common human institution was widespread in the face of the constant military threat, especially from the coast-dwelling and technologically superior Philistines. Once established, the monarchy was permanent."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.20.2","Our passage clearly demonstrates the controls on the institution desired by the biblical writers: limits on wealth and the stipulation that the king study God’s Instruction. The latter expectation, in varying forms, is found all over the ancient Near East (Weinfeld)."

The safeguard against false prophecy, though—noting the nonfulfillment of the “prophet’s” word—was too shaky a basis for a stable system.

"Torah, Deuteronomy.25.1","<i>Laws of War</i> (20): As an example of Deuteronomy’s thinking and often humane approach, the rules of war have a reasoned tone compared even to the contemporary world. Many of them occur elsewhere in the ancient Near East. The first four verses stress the frequently appearing idea that God fights on the Israelites’ behalf. From there vv.5–7 help to maintain the values of an agricultural society by keeping new builders, new planters, and newlyweds at home for a while. Added to this are considerations of troop morale (vv.8–9), offers of peaceful surrender terms (10–11), and the end results of siege as commonly portrayed in the ancient world (12–14). A different outcome is to be striven for in the case of the native Canaanites, who are to be wiped out, that Israel not be led astray into their “abominable” practices (16–18). The latter passage, especially since it is followed by an ecologically compassionate one about fruit trees, seems genocidal and hence morally unacceptable today. Clearly it stems from a zealous time and strong feelings; whether it was carried out as described we do not know. Medieval Jews solved the problem of moral sensibilities for themselves by defining the Canaanites as long dead with no contemporary successors. But the troubling nature of the text remains."

In the biblical view (as in that of other ancient societies), crime or wrongdoing was seen as completely disruptive, a threat to the well-being of the very cosmos. Here atonement is made via a public confession and the death of an animal—not with the usual “decontaminating” use of sacrificial blood but with a death that symbolically atones for the death of the murder victim."

The behavior of this son is regarded as a threat, not only to his family, but to the entire community (Frymer-Kensky 1992a).

Israelite women may have occasionally found themselves in the latter situation, which is also attested in the ancient Near East. See the discussion in Tigay, 1996."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.35.3","<i>Charging Interest</i> (23:20–21): The law prohibits taking interest within the community as a damaging practice.

The law also demonstrates the significance of the spoken word (through the use of “lips” and “mouth”), common to ancient societies and to many later ones as well."

"Torah, Deuteronomy.41.18","while you (were) weary and faint,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.41.19",and (thus) he did not stand-in-awe of God.

"Torah, Deuteronomy.42.1","<i>The Declaration of the Farmer</i> (26:1–15): In a climactic set of ceremonies, those who work the land are to acknowledge God’s ownership of the soil. Through the offering of firstfruits, the memory of the Exodus and the gift of the land are kept immediate—“I have entered the land” (v.3). The descendants’ rootedness in “a land flowing with milk and honey” (9) is made to contrast with the ancestors’ wandering. This characterization of the land, and thanksgiving for its produce, is reiterated in the brief section about tithes (12–15). Thus the land is not taken for granted, and Israel celebrates, not the sexuality of the gods as the source of the soil’s fertility, but rather the gift of a God who has intervened in human history."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.42.2","This chapter is a fitting end to the sequence of laws in Deuteronomy; emphasizing the gift of the land (as Buber 1982 points out, “give” in various permutations occurs seven times) suggests that the gift may be revoked if the society does not uphold the covenant. Also notable is the sixfold use of the Hebrew root b-w-’(<i>bo</i>’), appearing here variously as “enter,” “produce,” “bring.”"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.44.1","<i>The Covenant Ceremony</i> (27): As if to dramatize what has just concluded, the text at this point interpolates a ceremony that in location (Shechem) and theme anticipates what we find at the end of the book of Joshua (Chap. 24). It also encourages viewing Deuteronomy as a Northern document. Here the core is the series of curses uttered on Mount Eval in vv.15–26 (the blessings, curiously, do not appear). The curses, which do not introduce any new material as such, reflect the community’s fear that someone will sin in secret and not be found out, and the entire community will suffer as a result (Bellefontaine). The public pronouncement of threats was not unusual at the sealing of an agreement in the ancient Near East. As in previous legal sections, we are presented with a mixture of areas—criminal, sexual, and ritual—ending with the general provision that the “words of this Instruction” are to be carefully observed."

"Torah, Deuteronomy.45.1","<i>The Consequences</i> (28): Following the dramatic ceremony of Chap. 27, which, as an event placed in the future, feels somewhat artificial, is the more conventional listing of blessings and curses, parallel to Lev. 26. The latter functionally ends the book of Leviticus (Chap. 27 is obviously a kind of appendix), and our chapter here ends the long legal portion of Deuteronomy. A further parallel is the summary verses in each; Lev. 26 ends with “These are the laws, the regulations and the instructions that Y<small>HWH</small> gave / between himself and the Children of Israel at Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moshe,” while v.69 of our chapter is “These are the words of the covenant / that Y<small>HWH</small> commanded Moshe to cut with the Children of Israel / in the land of Moav, / aside from the covenant that he cut with them at Horev.”"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.45.2","As is typical of this kind of literature, the curses seem to outweigh the blessings, not only in verse count (55 to 14) but in color of description as well. While later generations of Jews, horrified by the warnings of disaster, stipulated that this chapter be read in an undertone when it is a weekly public synagogue reading, it is fairly standard stuff in the context of ancient Near Eastern treaties."

"Torah, Deuteronomy.47.1","<i>Exile and Return</i> (30): A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. <i>shuv</i> (“return / restore”)."

"Torah, Deuteronomy.47.69",30:3 <b>restore your fortunes:</b> Heb. <i>shav … shevutekha;</i> continuing the use of the root <i>shuv</i> (“return”) that echoes throughout the chapter.

"Torah, Deuteronomy.47.71","13 <b>across the sea:</b> An especially daunting proposition for the Israelites, who were not coast dwellers."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.1","<i>Preparing for the Future</i> (31): Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.2","It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.3",31:1 Moshe went
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.4","and spoke these words to all Israel,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.5",2 he said to them:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.6",A hundred and twenty years old am I today;
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.7","I am no longer able to go-out and to come-in,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.8",and Y<small>HWH</small> has said to me:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.9",you are not to cross over this Jordan!
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.10","3 Y<small>HWH</small> your God, he will cross over before you,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.11","he will destroy those nations from before you, so that you may dispossess them;"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.12","Yehoshua, he will cross over before you,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.13",as Y<small>HWH</small> has promised.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.14",4 Y<small>HWH</small> will do to them
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.15","as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.16",that he destroyed them.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.17",5 Y<small>HWH</small> will give them before you
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.18",and you will do to them
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.19",according to all the command that I have commanded you.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.20","6 Be strong, be courageous,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.21","do not be overawed, do not be terrified before them,"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.23","he will not let-go-of you, he will not abandon you!"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.24",7 Then Moshe called Yehoshua
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.25","and said to him, before the eyes of all Israel:"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.26","Be strong, be courageous,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.27",for you yourself will enter with this people
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.28","the land about which Y<small>HWH</small> swore to your fathers, to give them;"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.29",you yourself will allot-it-as-inheritance to them.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.30","8 And Y<small>HWH</small>, he is the one who goes before you,"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.33","you are not to be overawed, you are not to be shattered!"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.34",9 Now Moshe wrote down this Instruction
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.35","and gave it to the priests, the Sons of Levi,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.36","those carrying the coffer of the Covenant of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.37",and to all the elders of Israel.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.38","10 And Moshe commanded them, saying:"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.48","and your sojourner that is in your gates,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.49","in order that they may hearken, in order that they may learn"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.50","and have-awe-for Y<small>HWH</small> your God,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.51",to carefully observe all the words of this Instruction;
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.52","13 and (that) their children, who do not know,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.53",may hearken and learn
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.54","to have-awe-for Y<small>HWH</small> your God,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.55",all the days that you remain-alive on the soil
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.56",that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.57",14 Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.58","Here, your days are drawing-near to die."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.59","Call Yehoshua and station yourselves at the Tent of Appointment,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.60",that I may command him.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.61","So Moshe went, along with Yehoshua,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.62",they stationed themselves at the Tent of Appointment.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.63","15 And Y<small>HWH</small> was seen at the Tent of Appointment, in a column of cloud,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.64",and the column of cloud stood over the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.65",16 Now Y<small>HWH</small> said to Moshe:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.66","Here, you are about to lie beside your fathers;"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.67",now this people will proceed
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.68",to go whoring after the gods of the foreigner of the land
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.69","that they are entering in his midst,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.70",they will abandon me
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.71",and violate my covenant that I have cut with them.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.72",17 And my anger will flare up against them on that day.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.73",I will abandon them and I will conceal my face from them;
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.74","(they) will be (ripe) for devouring,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.75",and there will befall them many and troubling ills.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.76",And they will say on that day:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.77",Was it not because God was not in my midst
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.78",that there have befallen me these ills?
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.79","18 But I, I will conceal, yes, conceal my face on that day,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.80","because of all the ill that they have done,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.81",for they faced-about to other gods!
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.82","19 But now, write yourselves down this song,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.83","teach it to the Children of Israel, putting it in their mouths,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.84",in order that this song may be for you as a witness against the Children of Israel.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.85","20 When I bring them to the soil about which I swore to their fathers,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.86","a land flowing with milk and honey,"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.88","and they face-about to other gods, and serve them,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.89",spurning me and violating my covenant:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.90","21 it will be,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.91","when there befall them many and troubling ills,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.92","this song will speak up before their presence as a witness,"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.94","Indeed, I know the plans that they are making today,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.95",(even) before I bring them into the land about which I swore!
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.96","22 So Moshe wrote down this song on that day,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.97",and he taught it to the Children of Israel.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.98",23 And he commanded Yehoshua son of Nun
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.99",and said:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.100","Be strong, be courageous,"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.109","and place it beside the coffer of the Covenant of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.110",let it be there among you as a witness.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.111","27 For I myself know your rebelliousness,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.112",and your hard neck;
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.113","here, while I am yet alive with you today,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.114",you have been rebellious against Y<small>HWH</small>—
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.115",even (more) so after my death!
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.116","28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officials,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.117","that I may speak in their ears these words,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.118",that I may call-to-witness against them the heavens and the earth.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.119",29 For I know:
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.120","after my death, indeed, you will wreak ruin, yes, ruin,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.121","turning-aside from the way that I have commanded you,"

"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.124",vexing him through the doings of your hands!
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.125",30 So Moshe spoke in the ears of the entire assembly of Israel
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.126","the words of this song, until they were ended:"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.127",_____________
"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.128",31:1 <b>went and spoke:</b> Ancient versions read “(When) Moshe finished speaking” (<i>vykl</i> instead of <i>vylk</i>).

"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.130","14 <b>days … drawing near … die:</b> Despite the English, the Hebrew here is not alliterative."

"Torah, Deuteronomy.48.133",21 <b>plans:</b> Suggesting evil ones; cf. Gen. 8:21.
"Torah, Deuteronomy.49.1","<i>The Song of Moshe</i> (32:1–43): Especially in the ancient and medieval world, the death accounts of heroes tend to end with inspired visions. The inclusion of an ancient poem here is made to fit further into the context of Moshe’s exhortations in Deuteronomy—as a final warning to and witness against the people whom he has led. The “song” emphasizes the power and caring nature of God, which is contrasted with Israel’s pathetic response of unfaithfulness. God is likened to a nurturing parent and a protecting eagle; when Israel responds with idolatry, he turns into a destroyer. Much of this poem reminds one of other biblical literature, such as Psalm 78—also a reprise of Israel’s history. That poem is recited as a proof of God’s choosing the (southern) House of David; the political motivation behind Deut. 32, if there was one, is no longer clear to us."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.49.2","Skehan notes that the number of verses in the song, 69, equals the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet (23) times three. Similar or related schemes appear elsewhere in the Bible, often in the form of acrostics (cf. Lamentations)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.49.3","The song, which may predate Deuteronomy, may have been placed here as a traditional poem that meaningfully deals with catastrophe (Tigay). Despite the obscurity of some of its phrases, it stands as a witness to Israel’s self-understanding, albeit a negative one."
"Torah, Deuteronomy.49.4","32:1 Give ear, O heavens, that I may speak,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy.49.5","hear, O earth, the utterance of my mouth."

"Torah, Deuteronomy.49.7","let my words flow like dew,"

The weighting of tribes is very different here from what it was in Genesis: Levi is quite strong, Shim’on has disappeared, and Yehuda, the tribe of David’s royal lineage, has a reduced role.

"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.0",(1-34)
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.1","D<small>EUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE</small> literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.2","An ancient name for Deuteronomy, <i>mishne tora</i>—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.”"
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.3","From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.4","The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.5","Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.6","Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.7","But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright,"
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.8",the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were.
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.9","It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.10","That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 <small>B.C.E.</small>) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.11",It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.”
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.12","The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the L<small>ORD</small>.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the L<small>ORD</small> for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the L<small>ORD</small> … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version)"
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.13","What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king"
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.14","directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the L<small>ORD</small>. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the L<small>ORD</small>, to follow the L<small>ORD</small>, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3)"
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.15","The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.16","The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.17","The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.18","In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century <small>B.C.E.</small>, which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.19","Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.20","Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of <i>one God</i> for <i>one people</i> in <i>one land</i> observing <i>one cult</i>” (italics his)."

"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.36",D   The End (34)
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.37","A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure.38","It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, I: Historical Overview.1",(1–4:43)
"Torah, Deuteronomy, I: Historical Overview.2","I<small>N THIS INTRODUCTORY SECTION, WHICH SOME SCHOLARS HAVE VIEWED AS A LATER</small> addition to the core of the book, Moshe reviews the journey of the Israelites from Mount Sinai (“Horev”) into the Negev, and from there up east of the Dead Sea to a spot opposite Jericho. Two things make this more than a mere itinerary: First, Moshe confines himself to the most important moments—the choosing of leaders, the sending of the spies (with all its disastrous consequences), the encounters with various nations, and the provisions made for the soon-to-occur conquest. Second, the text characterizes itself, not as a narrative per se, but as an “explanation” (1:5) of the “Instruction.” In other words, history is made to function as lesson here. That the account ends with Bet (Baal) Pe’or in 3:29 is surely not accidental; as 4:3 reminds us, this was the site of Israel’s great apostasy, the final negative act by a wayward generation that was not to live to enter the land of Israel. By means of this introduction, the new generation is warned about the failings of the old, and begins to be prepared for “entering and taking-possession of the land” promised to their ancestors (4:1)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, I: Historical Overview.3","The first four chapters of the book establish its character as a link: by recounting key events in Israel’s wanderings, they summarize the narratives of Exodus and Numbers; by demonstrating that disaster resulted from the people’s rebellions, they set the ideology that will permeate the so-called Deuteronomistic History, namely the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings (Nelson)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, I: Historical Overview.4","It should be realized that these chapters are not merely previous narratives repeated verbatim. They are in fact reworkings of earlier material, often with changes. Thus, to use Brettler’s example, 1:9–18 retells Ex. 18:13–26, with the change that this time, as Moshe appoints lower-level leadership for the people, he does so without his father-in-law Yitro (who had helped in the Exodus version), and chooses them on the basis of their capabilities (“wisdom”), not their piety. Brettler also points to the frequent use of the phrase “at that time” as an indicator of later additions to the text. For a comprehensive discussion of how these opening chapters differ from earlier accounts, see Tigay."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Ii: Opening Exhortation.1",(4:44–11:32)
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Ii: Opening Exhortation.2","T<small>HIS SECTION OF</small> D<small>EUTERONOMY IS A LONG PERSONAL AND EMOTIONAL PLEA ON BE</small>-half of the leader. Its rhetoric has become famous, as have several passages noted below. It is in this section that Moshe appears in his most classic Deuteronomistic mode, urging the people on to follow God’s rules and warning them against violating the covenant."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Ii: Opening Exhortation.3","Recurring phrases in the section include “Hearken O Israel,” “And now, O Israel,” “When I bring you into the land …,” and “take-care.” In addition, the word “love,” which as noted above carries the connotation of “loyalty,” is important in these speeches."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Ii: Opening Exhortation.4","After a brief geographical introduction in vv.44–49, which parallels the opening of the book and which, in the eyes of many, once served as the book’s actual beginning, the section presents a version of the so-called Ten Commandments, and a short recapitulation of the circumstances surrounding their being given on Sinai. In that sense, Chapter 5 is a continuation of the historical overview of the beginning of the book."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Ii: Opening Exhortation.5","Another famous passage here is in Chapter 6, where Israel is enjoined to “love” God, warned about what will happen if they abandon him, and given a kind of script as answer to their children’s future question, “What (mean) the precepts, the laws and the regulations that Y<small>HWH</small> your God has commanded you?” (v.20)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Ii: Opening Exhortation.6","Other important themes appear in these speeches. Israel is defined as a people that is not to intermarry with the indigenous peoples of Canaan; as a people chosen, not for its military power or large population, but because God “loved” them, and because he could not abide the Canaanites’ behavior. To prove his point that Israel possesses no inherent superiority, Moshe turns again to history, and retells the story of the Molten Calf (Ex. 32–34)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Ii: Opening Exhortation.7","He ends (in Chap. 11) by reiterating the motif of God’s power and hence his ability to reward faithfulness with the gift of the good land. Israel is promised blessing and not curse, provided that they “take-care to observe” the laws which are now to be set before them."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Iii: the Terms of the Covenant.1",(12–28)
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Iii: the Terms of the Covenant.2","A<small>fter lengthy exhortation we are brought at last to the heart of Deu-</small> teronomy. Just as its corresponding Exodus section, Chapters 19–24, stands at the center of that book, and Gen. 22, Lev. 19, and Num. 19–20 place dramatic narratives or important laws at their core, the laws that we now encounter focus our attention on the object of Moshe’s main concern in Deut. 1–11 and 27–30: the “covenant” or pact between God and Israel. Israel is to demonstrate its love or loyalty to God by “taking-care to observe” the laws, and binds itself in a ceremony, at least in descriptive form, at the end of the section."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Iii: the Terms of the Covenant.3","The subject matter of this long collection forms an interesting contrast to both the Covenant Code of Exodus (in the chapters just referred to) and other law collections in the ancient Near East. The Exodus material contains much that deals with property and damages, whereas Deuteronomy appears to focus more heavily on criminal and moral issues. Although neighboring civilizations had legal literature that parallels many of the cases before us (cf. Hallo for a discussion), Deuteronomy’s particular emphases suggest a shift away from personal property as the central area of society’s concern (Greenberg 1970). In addition, the biblical text here (as previously in the book) is generally cast in the second person singular, giving it a highly personal edge, and there is a higher percentage of “motive clauses”—explanations or justifications for the laws—than in other Near Eastern law codes. Sonsino has noted a strong similarity between the language of these chapters and the thrust of biblical “wisdom literature” such as the book of Proverbs; thus a major function of the material may well be didactic and not legal per se. This, interestingly, puts Deuteronomy more squarely within its Near Eastern setting; Fishbane (1988) characterizes both sets of systems as “stylized collections of typical cases.”"
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Iii: the Terms of the Covenant.4","Yet he also argues that whatever the original purpose of the laws in Chapters 12–26, they came already within the biblical period itself to be seen as actual “legislative texts,” and as such, subject to later interpretation much as any law code might spawn (this multiple function of the laws was noted by Weinfeld 1972a). In this connection it is clear that new attitudes have been adopted and changes made in specific cases. It is usually accepted that Deuteronomy has introduced a markedly humanistic tone into Israel’s legal system; in Weinfeld’s words (1993):"
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Iii: the Terms of the Covenant.5","… the author’s purpose was not to produce a civil-law book like the book of the covenant, treating of pecuniary matters, but to set forth a code of laws securing the protection of the individual and particularly of those persons in need of protection."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Iii: the Terms of the Covenant.6",Some of the changes from earlier laws are noted in the Commentary and Notes below.
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Iii: the Terms of the Covenant.7","Nelson has divided the laws into the following sections: Purity in Worship (12:1–14:21); Life in the New Land (14:22–16:17); The Structures of Society (16:18–20:20); and Interpreting Traditional Laws (21:1–26:19). In his view, the changes introduced into Israel’s legal culture are responses to changes in Israelite society, whether economic, political, or religious—changes that may well reflect the monarchic period. The attempt to find a logical pattern to the structure of the laws, however, does not always succeed. Levinson has shown how a better understanding of the sequencing of the laws may be found in the principle of response to the centralization of worship, the event that historically may have accompanied Deuteronomy’s promulgation. In this scheme, 12:1–16:17 is above all a response to how centralization affected the cultic (sacrifical worship) sphere, and 16:18–17:13 to how judicial process was similarly affected. At the same time, these changes appear to be woven into older material."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Iii: the Terms of the Covenant.8","The phrase “And Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe, saying: / Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them: …,” so common in the legal and cultic sections of Leviticus and Numbers, does not appear here. Neither does it appear in the Covenant Code; but in the context of Deuteronomy, the absence of the phrase supports the emphasis on Moshe as the central figure (in Exodus the legal portions are followed by the Tabernacle instructions, which indeed use the quoted formula)."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Iii: the Terms of the Covenant.9","Chapter 12 begins with “These are the laws and the regulations that you are to take-care to observe”; Chapter 28 ends with “These are the words of the covenant ….” As in Exodus, the laws are the terms of the covenant, not merely a set of rules to be followed. This is further supported by the framework into which these chapters have been placed. The first two parts of the book serve as a classic ancient Near Eastern introduction to a treaty, with their historical look back. In addition, the section ends with both a covenant ceremony (Chap. 27) and a series of blessings and curses (28), also typical in this genre. So far from being merely a dry list of laws, the core of Deuteronomy, with its reasoned tone and wide-ranging scope, serves both as a summing-up and as a basis for Israel’s life on the land. No wonder, then, that the exiles returning from Babylonia under Persian rule in the sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small> and later came to view the Torah as a real constitution."

"Torah, Deuteronomy, Iv: Concluding Exhortation.2","T<small>HE FIRST TWO PARTS OF</small> D<small>EUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE</small> third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity."

A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, V: Final Matters.4","This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36:"
"Torah, Deuteronomy, V: Final Matters.5",Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia:
"Torah, Deuteronomy, V: Final Matters.6","Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth;"
"Torah, Deuteronomy, V: Final Matters.7","he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, V: Final Matters.8","Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Suggestions For Further Reading.1","T<small>HE SECONDARY LITERATURE ON THE</small> F<small>IVE</small> B<small>OOKS OF</small> M<small>OSES, SINGLY AND AS A GROUP, IS IM</small>mense. Tradition-minded Jews and Christians will as a matter of course make use of ancient exegetes and their medieval successors to get a fuller understanding of specific words and passages. Much of this material is now available in English translation, whether of Midrashim, some of the medievals, the Church Fathers, or Luther. As far as modern commentaries go, here too the amount of material is vast. New works appear constantly (Tigay’s JPS <i>Commentary on Deuteronomy</i>, for instance, will be appearing in 1996), and a full listing of appropriate works would take up several volumes on its own. The reader is therefore advised to consult the solid and extensive bibliographies found in the major commentaries such as Speiser (1964), Childs (1974), Sarna (1986), Milgrom (1991), Levine (1993), Weinfeld (1991), and Tigay (1996). As mentioned below, there is also a wealth of material to be gleaned from the numerous recent reference works, such as the <i>Anchor Bible Dictionary</i>."
"Torah, Deuteronomy, Suggestions For Further Reading.2","The list below, which cites mainly English-language works, is intended to supplement <i>The Five Books of</i> Moses in terms of interpreting the text, providing ancient Near Eastern background, biblical history, and a literary approach to the Bible. It makes no pretense at being comprehensive, but is selective, including both those works which I found stimulating and those which are referred to in the Commentary and Notes (cited there by author and, if there is more than one work by the author, by date). The abbreviation ‘’JPS,” which appears numerous times in the notes, refers to the New Jewish Publication Society translation, listed as <i>The Torah</i> below."
