I Kings 3:1,"<b>Pharaoh:</b> As usual, we are not told which king of Egypt is meant here. <b>the City of David:</b> Referring to the area south of the present Old City; Shelomo expanded the royal precinct northward, with the Temple atop what the ancients called Mount Zion (today’s Temple Mount). <b>his house:</b> The Hebrew word used for both “palace” and “Temple” are the same (<i>bayit</i>) in these texts.

Their origin may be Canaanite, with connotations of fertility, attributable to the phallic shape and the inclusion of pomegranates (Mulder). And the unusual names attached to them may also reflect ancient Near Eastern practice, where pillars were accompanied by inscriptions of prayers. The names here would have been the opening words of a phrase like “In strength He establishes (or: May He establish) [the earth].”"

I Kings 7:23,"<b>Sea-Basin:</b> Scholars disagree on whether this object had mythic overtones, symbolizing the primeval waters of chaos brought under control by Y<small>HWH</small> (see, for instance, Ps. 104:6-9), or was merely a place for the priests to wash. Perhaps it was both. JPS uses the inelegant “tank.”"

I Kings 8:65,"<b>Levo-Hamat:</b> The “Entrance of Hamat,” some fifty miles north of Damascus. <b>Y<small>HWH</small> our God:</b> As Cogan (2001) points out, this phrase, common in Deuteronomy, is unprecedented here. “Our” has the effect of bringing the audience into the scene."

Forms of religious enthusiasm are, of course, still practiced in the modern world. <b>until the [time of the]… grain-gift:</b> Late afternoon, so a good many hours have passed. <b>no voice:</b> Heb. <i>kol</i> is also used as the conventional word for thunder (see the “voice of Y<small>HWH</small>” in Ps. 29), and since Baal was worshipped as a storm/rain god, the wording here may be sarcastic (Fishbane)."
I Kings 9:30,<b>[I] will … come:</b> So LXX; MT has imperatives here.
I Kings 9:31,"<b>kings [who keep] loyalty:</b> Not “merciful,” as in some translations.

Walsh suggests that Ah’av’s wounds have made him disoriented."
I Kings 9:35,"<b>was stood up:</b> Or “propped up.” Walsh points up the irony: “a king who pretended not to be a king is now a corpse pretending not to be dead.” <b>facing Aram:</b> Facing the enemy troops, as if the commander of Israel is still at the helm. Something similar happens in the medieval account of the Spanish hero El Cid."
I Kings 9:36,"<b>Eliyyahu the prophet:</b> The use of his full title, reinforcing his stature as the “real” prophet and setting up the drama that now follows."

I Kings 9:41,"<b>Go up:</b> In contrast to his speech to the servant in v.43, where he uses “pray,” Eliyyahu is more “confrontative” with Ah’av (Walsh). <b>hark!:</b> Understanding Heb. <i>kol</i> here as in the Kayin and Hevel (Cain and Abel) story in Gen. 4:10, and elsewhere."
I Kings 9:42,"<b>Because you sent free …:</b> The king is condemned here for sparing his enemy, which violated certain biblical views on warfare.

I Kings 9:43,"<b>seven times:</b> As we have encountered it previously, this is a folkloric number, usually indicating perfection."
I Kings 9:44,"<b>removed:</b> Following ancient versions; MT has “turned aside,” the simpler form of the verb."
I Kings 9:45,[]
I Kings 9:46,"<b>ran ahead of Ah’av:</b> Medieval commentators, and Cogan (2001), see this as a mark of respect for the king, with Eliyyahu acting like one of the outrunners. But it should also be noted that from Carmel to Yizre’el is a hefty run, perhaps eighteen miles. So Eliyyahu outraces the king’s chariot horses, again acting almost supernaturally (Cantrell)."
